    "text": "Opinion writer\n\nLet me say at the outset that I fully accept one core conclusion reached by the special counsel\u2019s investigation, as described in Attorney General William P. Barr\u2019s letter to Congress: The probe did not establish any criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to sabotage the 2016 election.\n\nThat is genuinely, if narrowly, exonerating for the president on the \u201ccollusion\u201d question.\n\nBut even if you accept that to be the case, the following three things are also true:\n\nDonald Trump got elected president in part due to a massive foreign attack on our democracy. Even if Trump\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t collude with that act in a criminally chargeable manner, he committed extraordinary abuses of power to try to prevent a full accounting of that attack on our democracy from taking place. Trump\u2019s attorney general is in the process of preventing a real public airing of the full dimensions of both of the above points.\n\nMultiple news organizations are pushing variations on the idea that a \u201ccloud\u201d has lifted from Trump. The president himself claims \u201cComplete and Total EXONERATION.\u201d\n\nThis is nonsense. Indeed, one of the most important takeaways from Barr\u2019s brief summary of Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s conclusions is that it underscores the above three points with fresh urgency.\n\nOn collusion, Barr writes, Mueller\u2019s investigation \u201cdid not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the Russian government\u201d in its sabotaging of the election on Trump\u2019s behalf, via massive cybertheft and disinformation warfare. As the Lawfare team notes, while this is certainly exonerating, it\u2019s possible Mueller documented collusion-like behavior that fell just short of criminality, but we can\u2019t know without seeing the full report.\n\nOn obstruction of justice, Barr\u2019s letter says that Mueller declined to decide whether Trump had committed crimes. Instead, Mueller\u2019s report \u201csets out evidence on both sides of the question,\u201d and explicitly says that it \u201cdoes not exonerate\u201d Trump of criminality. That left the decision to Barr, who says he and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein determined that the evidence developed by Mueller is \u201cnot sufficient to establish\u201d obstruction.\n\nMultiple legal observers have been scaldingly critical of Barr for making this decision, because of its haste, and on substantive grounds. Marcy Wheeler points out that during his confirmation hearings, Barr flatly conceded that certain types of conduct Trump has actually committed would constitute obstruction of justice. So why the absolution?\n\nUnderscoring that point, former prosecutor Ken White notes that Barr is silent on a crucial question: whether he concluded Trump didn\u2019t interfere in the investigation in an obstructive manner based on the evidence, or, by contrast, that Trump didn\u2019t obstruct justice because interfering inherently cannot be obstruction when done by the head of the executive branch.\n\nBarr made this latter argument in an unsolicited memo that has been sharply criticized by legal experts. Crucially, this is also the theory advanced by Trump\u2019s own lawyers. The question is whether Barr based the decision on this theory. If so, as Neal Katyal suggests, this would put Trump above the law.\n\nBut we cannot even evaluate Barr\u2019s decision unless we see the evidence that Mueller laid out \u201con both sides of the question.\u201d\n\nGuess who decides whether we get to see that evidence: Barr does.\n\nBarr could release the obstruction portions right now\n\nWe do have some sense of the evidence Mueller amassed from reporting on Trump\u2019s efforts to derail the investigation. They include firing his FBI director after demanding \u201cloyalty\u201d; pressing him to lay off his national security adviser; leaning on other intelligence officials to corral him; and Trump\u2019s effort to bully his former attorney general into protecting him from the probe. While establishing criminal obstruction is tricky, those are all flagrant abuses of power.\n\nIt\u2019s all but certain Mueller has established substantially more about those episodes than is publicly known. And as Katyal points out, Barr\u2019s letter notes that Mueller investigated numerous potential acts of obstruction, not all of which have been publicly reported, meaning there are episodes we still don\u2019t know about.\n\nMueller amassed all this evidence without exonerating Trump on obstruction. Barr looked at all of this evidence and did exonerate him \u2014 allowing Trump to claim vindication on obstruction as well.\n\n\u201cBarr gave the president a powerful talking point that Mueller didn\u2019t,\u201d former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller told me.\n\nBut what\u2019s stopping Barr from releasing the facts Mueller established, so we can evaluate this decision for ourselves? Nothing, Miller argues, because this evidence wasn\u2019t gathered via grand jury, which could require the maintenance of secrecy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been any sign that Mueller used the grand jury for the obstruction inquiry,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cThe White House produced documents and witnesses voluntarily. If there\u2019s no grand jury involvement, then Barr could release that portion of the report today.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s remember what this is really about\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to derail the investigation weren\u2019t merely about halting scrutiny of \u201ccollusion.\u201d They were also about halting an accounting of the Russian attack on our democracy irrespective of whether \u201ccollusion\u201d happened. Barr\u2019s letter reminds us of this, by noting that Mueller\u2019s report documents Russia\u2019s extensive efforts to swing the election, including a concerted campaign to divide the country along social lines.\n\nWe already know a great deal about this from Mueller\u2019s indictments of Russians. But Mueller\u2019s report would likely tell us much more.\n\nWe know Trump has long opposed a full accounting of that Russian attack \u2014 not just because he denies collusion but also because he reportedly saw the very existence of that attack as undermining the greatness of his victory. Indeed, it\u2019s been documented that this is why he did so little to secure the country against the next Russian attack.\n\nThus, what Barr\u2019s letter really tells us is that, without the Mueller report, we are being denied a full reckoning into that subversion of our democracy and a full public airing of Trump\u2019s efforts to prevent that reckoning from happening.\n\nBarr\u2019s letter promises more disclosure to come, and perhaps we will get it. If not, perhaps Congress can force it. But until then, none of those efforts at public accountability are taking place. And the implications of that are terrible to contemplate.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: What Barr\u2019s letter about the Mueller report says and doesn\u2019t say\n\nHarry Litman: Three puzzling aspects of Barr\u2019s summary of the Mueller report\n\nE.J.

    "text": "Michael Avenatti, a high-profile attorney and critic of President Trump, was arrested in New York on Monday and charged in what prosecutors called a brazen bid to extort millions of dollars from Nike by threatening to damage the company\u2019s image.\n\nSimultaneously, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles filed separate charges accusing Avenatti of wire fraud and bank fraud, alleging that he took a client\u2019s settlement money and used it to cover costs related to Avenatti\u2019s coffee shop business and other personal expenses. Avenatti is accused of concealing from the client where the money was.\n\nFBI officials said Avenatti, 48, was arrested in Manhattan on Monday as he arrived at the offices of Boies Schiller, the law firm representing Nike. He had gone there for a meeting about his demands, officials said. Monday evening, a federal magistrate judge in New York ordered Avenatti released on $300,000 bond.\n\nGeoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said that Avenatti dressed up the alleged demands as legal negotiations but that he still broke the law.\n\n\u201cA suit and tie doesn\u2019t mask the fact that, at its core, this was an old-fashioned shakedown,\u201d Berman said. \u201cWhen lawyers use their law licenses as weapons, as a guise to extort payments for themselves, they are no longer acting as attorneys. They are acting as criminals.\u201d\n\n[Michael Avenatti, the adrenaline-fueled lawyer taking on President Trump]\n\nThe charges mark the latest and most remarkable chapter in the strange public saga of the California lawyer who had represented Stormy Daniels, an adult-film actress paid to keep quiet during the 2016 presidential campaign about her alleged affair with Trump several years ago. At the height of his attacks on Trump\u2019s integrity, Avenatti considered running for president before opting against it late last year.\n\nThat case catapulted Avenatti to cable-news fame, but prosecutors now say he threatened to use that platform to commit a crime. Avenatti did not respond to requests for comment. Leaving a New York courthouse Monday evening, he said he would be \u201cfully exonerated\u201d and \u201cjustice will be done.\u201d\n\nAuthorities charge that Avenatti threatened to hold a news conference on the eve of the NCAA college basketball tournament to reveal damaging allegations against Nike unless it paid his client $1.5 million and agreed to hire Avenatti and another lawyer for $15 million to $25 million to conduct an \u201cinternal investigation\u201d into the purported allegations.\n\n\u201cNike will not be extorted or hide information that is relevant to a government investigation,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cNike firmly believes in ethical and fair play, both in business and sports, and will continue to assist the prosecutors.\u201d\n\nThe charging document said Avenatti proposed another alternative to hiring him to conduct an investigation: \u201ca total payment of $22.5 million from Nike to resolve any claims [the client] might have and additionally to buy Avenatti\u2019s silence.\u201d\n\nShortly before the charges were unsealed Monday, Avenatti tweeted that he planned to hold a news conference Tuesday \u201cto disclose a major high school/college basketball scandal perpetrated by @Nike that we have uncovered. This criminal conduct reaches the highest levels of Nike and involves some of the biggest names in college basketball.\u201d\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed by an FBI agent, Avenatti and the other lawyer approached Nike last week, the first in a series of contentious discussions. Court papers identify the other lawyer only as \u201cco-conspirator 1,\u201d but people close to the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Avenatti was working with Mark Geragos.\n\nGeragos, whose law firm declined to comment, is a high-profile television personality and celebrity lawyer. His clients have included Michael Jackson, Chris Brown and Jussie Smollett, the \u201cEmpire\u201d actor recently accused of fabricating a story about a racist attack.\n\nGeragos has not been charged with a crime.\n\nLast week, prosecutors said, Avenatti told Nike that if the demands were not met, \u201cI\u2019ll go take ten billion dollars off your client\u2019s market cap. . . . I\u2019m not f-----g around,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nAvenatti claimed that his client \u201chad evidence that one or more Nike employees had authorized and funded payments to the families of top high school basketball players and/or their families and attempted to conceal those payments,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nProsecutors said Avenatti threatened to expose Nike to the kind of controversy that has plagued competitor Adidas. In October, two Adidas officials were convicted of fraud in federal court for secretly paying the families of several top basketball recruits to secure their commitments to college teams sponsored by the German company.\n\nIn wiretapped phone calls and text messages introduced during their trial, the Adidas officials spoke of their belief that Nike arranged similar payments to steer top athletic recruits.\n\nIn its statement Monday, Nike said it has been cooperating with that federal investigation for more than a year.\n\nAfter Avenatti brought his alleged demands to Nike last week, the Boies Schiller lawyers responded by calling federal prosecutors.\n\nFederal agents arranged to secretly record subsequent conversations during which, they say, Avenatti demanded money not just for his client but also for himself.\n\nThe charges in the New York case are extortion, extortion conspiracy, transmission of interstate communications with intent to extort, and conspiracy to transmit interstate communications with the intent to extort.\n\nAt one point in the secretly recorded negotiations, a Boies Schiller lawyer noted that he had never been paid the kind of money by Nike that Avenatti was demanding, court documents say. Prosecutors say Avenatti responded by asking whether the lawyer had ever \u201cheld the balls of the client in your hand where you could take five to six billion dollars\u2019 market cap off of them?\u201d\n\nIn the California case, Avenatti is accused of misusing client funds and of lying to a bank about his income to obtain loans totaling $4.1 million for his law firm and coffee business.\n\nAccording to court papers, Avenatti negotiated in January a $1.6 million settlement on behalf of an unidentified client, but prosecutors say he gave that client a bogus settlement agreement with a false payment date, concealing what he had done.\n\nAs part of a long-running investigation into Avenatti\u2019s alleged financial misdeeds, officials said he did not pay taxes for several years and owed the Internal Revenue Service $850,438, plus interest and penalties.\n\n\u201cThere have been collection efforts going on for many, many years,\u201d said Nick Hanna, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. \u201cThis investigation was started in the ordinary course; it came up through the IRS with the collection of back taxes.\u201d\n\nHanna said the Avenatti case \u201chas nothing to do with anything political or with anything else. The facts in this case speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, dropped Avenatti as her lawyer earlier this year. In a statement issued after his arrest, she said she was \u201csaddened but not shocked\u201d by reports he had been charged. Avenatti, she said, \u201cdealt with me extremely dishonestly.\u201d\n\nAvenatti shot to prominence one year ago after he began representing Daniels in a lawsuit to void her 2016 nondisclosure agreement with Trump over a one-night stand she claims they had 10 years earlier. Trump denies her allegations of an affair.\n\nOver the course of nine months, Avenatti styled himself as Trump\u2019s chief legal adversary and threatened to challenge the president as a Democrat in the 2020 election. His brashness on Twitter and cable TV, where he taunted Trump and Trump\u2019s lawyers, won support from some liberals.\n\nAvenatti defended his approach amid criticism from some in the legal and political worlds. \u201cWe\u2019ve been aggressive, but I also think we\u2019ve been strategic and thoughtful, and without that approach, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are now. We\u2019ve created a situation where the other side continues to make mistake after mistake,\u201d he told The Washington Post in May.\n\nAvenatti courted controversy by representing Julie Swetnick, one of the women who accused now-Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh of misconduct. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) later claimed that Avenatti and Swetnick made \u201cmaterially false\u201d statements to his panel and referred them to the Justice Department.\n\nBased in Newport Beach, Calif., Avenatti was known for his success in a handful of large class-action lawsuits, financial disputes with partners at his former law firm, and allegedly dubious business practices involving his onetime ownership stake in Tully\u2019s, a now-defunct Seattle-based coffee chain. Avenatti has denied wrongdoing in the latter two cases.\n\nWhile representing Daniels, he brought multiple actions against the president and his former attorney Michael Cohen, among others. One suit accused Trump of defamation after the president suggested Daniels was perpetrating a \u201ccon job\u201d when she said she was threatened not to speak about their alleged affair. A federal judge dismissed the suit in October.\n\nIn November, Avenatti was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of domestic violence. Prosecutors declined to charge him.\n\nA few days later, a judge evicted his law firm after it failed to pay more than $213,000 in rent. Avenatti called the decision \u201cridiculous\u201d and said it involved his \u201cold firm, which was already in the process of moving.\u201d\n\nStephen Gillers, a New York University professor and expert on legal ethics, said Avenatti is more show than substance.\n\n\u201cI was always uncomfortable with his claims and astonished at the amount of airtime he got,\u201d Gillers said.\n\nWill Hobson contributed to this report."

Shevrin Jones, of West Park, said he would \u201cbe the first person to co-sponsor something to deal with mental health in our schools and our communities.\u201d\n\nAmid the new Parkland pain, Sunday marked the one-year anniversary of the March For Our Lives, a student-led protest of the country\u2019s gun laws that drew hundreds of thousands of people to Washington and to other marches around the world.\n\nThe news of the two suicides comes just as students are out of school this coming week for spring break, worrying some that students may not get the help they need..\n\nInvestigators told the Miami Herald that the male student died in \u201can apparent suicide\u201d on Saturday night. He was in 10th grade and attended Stoneman Douglas last year at the time of the Feb. 14 shooting.\n\nIt isn\u2019t known whether his death can be linked to the school shooting, police said. They did not release his name.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many more kids have to be taken from us as a result of suicide for the government / school district to do anything?\n\n\n\nRip 17+2 \u2014 David Hogg (@davidhogg111) March 24, 2019\n\nThe death follows the suicide of a recent Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School graduate, Sydney Aiello, who took her life after being diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The Broward County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office said Aiello died from a gunshot wound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow many more kids have to be taken from us as a result of suicide for the government / school district to do anything? Rip 17 + 2,\u201d former Stoneman Douglas student and gun-control activist David Hogg said Sunday on Twitter.\n\n-\n\nIf you are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741.\n\nYou can also dial: 2-1-1 or 954-740-6731. If you prefer not to call, you can text \u201cFL\u201d to 741741 for a live counselor.\n\n-\n\nRyan Petty, who has been in close contact with local and state officials, told the Miami Herald the student who died Saturday also died from a gunshot.\n\nPetty founded a suicide prevention foundation called the Walk Up Foundation after his daughter\u2019s death. He said \u201cthe issue of suicide needs to be talked about.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is another tragic example,\u201d Petty said, who has partnered with Columbia University and The Columbia Lighthouse Project for his Foundation.\n\nKelly Posner, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia and the founder and director of The Columbia Lighthouse Project, said the Columbia protocol \u2014 the series of questions that local officials are urging parents to ask their children \u2014 \u201cis the most evidence-supported tool of its kind that anyone can use anywhere in the world to prevent suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuicide is the No. 1 cause of adolescent deaths. Fifty percent of suicidal people see their primary care doctor the month before they die,\u201d Posner said. \u201cThis is an urgent memo, the Columbia protocol needs to be in everybody\u2019s hands, this includes parents, the coaches, the peers, the janitors, the librarians. In the past, nobody knew what questions to ask and what to do when they got the answers. Now we know.\u201d\n\nThe list of questions uses plain and direct language, which Posner says is most effective in eliciting honest and clear responses. For example, the questionnaire may ask:\n\n\u201cHave you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you been thinking about how you might kill yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you taken any steps toward making a suicide attempt or preparing to kill yourself (such as collecting pills, getting a gun, giving valuables away, or writing a suicide note)?\u201d\n\nBased on the responses, the questioner can establish criteria or thresholds that determine what to do next for each person assessed like hospitalization, counseling, referrals, and other actions.\n\nPosner, who was awarded with the Secretary of Defense medal for exceptional public service for her suicide prevention work in the Marine Corps, said only one percent of people who ask the questions end up with a high-risk response.\n\n\u201cWe know, point blank, as clear as day, that these questions help identify people who are suffering in silence and will help us save lives,\u201d she said.\n\nSince the Valentine\u2019s Day shooting traumatized an entire student body, students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School regularly report to trauma counselors after breaking down in tears. They panic when fire alarms drag on even moments too long. Reports of widespread absences are common.\n\nAs spring break starts, faculty at the Parkland school worry that their students may not be receiving the help they need away from campus. They also are concerned that recent changes at the school may be negatively affecting kids.\n\nGrief therapists working with Parkland families mobilized Sunday to figure out the best way to provide help. They also are concerned that students will be off this week.\n\nProfessionals United for Parkland, a group of private trauma-trained therapists who are volunteering their services, told the Herald the \u201csuicides were expected after the shooting\u2019s one year anniversary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese deaths could have been prevented. Contagion in high school suicidal behavior is common. We have to stop it now and draw attention to suicide prevention,\u201d said Les Gordon, who sits on the board of the group and works as a trauma therapist in Boca Raton.\n\nGordon said the group\u2019s Facebook Page is constantly publishing available resources and that the Coral Springs Museum of Art will be hosting a group of available therapists from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. this week.\n\nThe Broward County Resiliency Center at Pines Trail Park Amphitheater, will also have clinicians available from noon to 7 p.m. daily until April 1. Eagles\u2019 Haven, 5655 Coral Ridge Drive, will be open as well.\n\n\u201cOur community needs to pull together in a cohesive manner. We pledge to provide resources, assist other organizations, make referrals for proper trauma treatment and to support the therapeutic community who are on the frontlines,\u201d he said.\n\nGreg Pittman, an American History teacher at Stoneman Douglas said the reassignment of the high school\u2019s three assistant principals and a security specialist, administrators who were with the school during the mass shooting, has affected the mental health of the students who need help the most.\n\n\u201cThe kids need help and many of them that do need help are not getting any,\u201d Pittman said Sunday. \u201cThey want to talk to people that were there.\u201d\n\nPittman, who taught Sydney Aiello, said he has spoken with students directly about their concerns over the changing structure of their school. He said more mental health resources may be needed.\n\n\u201cMany of them think that they don\u2019t need help,\u201d he said. \u201cThat only their friends who were there understand. More resources probably would help, but also the resources that knew them [are] leaving.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a meeting Friday between the district and the faculty, Pittman said Broward Chief Officer of School Performance and Accountability Valerie Wanza acknowledged it was a mistake to remove the administrators students had grown accustomed to seeing.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a mistake then and even more so now,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his students are under \u201ctremendous pressure,\u201d some having seen their friends die or seeing their bodies on the floor after the shooting.\n\nPittman, who was at the school during the shooting, regularly sees a therapist and takes medication for emotional distress.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t witness it, but many of these kids had to witness their friends dying,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they have seen, I\u2019m concerned we\u2019re gonna see more.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter Sunday, Ryan Petty posted \u201c17 + 2\u201d with a breaking heart emoji, a somber reminder of the growing tally of the massacre.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Sydney did it, and now this other kid has done it...\u201d Pittman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it will take but we need more help.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMiami Herald staff writers Martin Vassolo and David Smiley contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nMarch 22, 2019, 9:02 PM GMT / Updated March 23, 2019, 11:20 AM GMT By Dareh Gregorian and Julia Ainsley\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller on Friday wrapped up his nearly two-year investigation into Donald Trump and Russia and sent his report to Attorney General William Barr.\n\nNo details of Mueller's findings have been released, but Barr said he may be able to brief congressional leaders on the report as soon as this weekend.\n\n\"I am reviewing this report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,\" Barr wrote in a letter on Friday to a group of lawmakers on the House and Senate judiciary committees.\n\nBarr also said in his letter that he was required to inform congressional leaders if Mueller \u2014 whom Trump has relentlessly attacked as conducting a \"witch hunt\" \u2014 had proposed anything \"inappropriate or unwarranted\" as part of the probe.\n\n\"There were no such instances during the Special Counsel's investigation,\" the attorney general said, adding that he would determine how much of the report could eventually be released to Congress and the public.\n\nTrump's outside lawyers, Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, issued a statement saying, \"We're pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations. Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, \"We're pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations. Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.\u201d In a tweet, she said that the White House had not seen the report.\n\nThe transmission of the report to Barr concludes an investigation that has resulted in the indictments of 34 people, infuriated the president and threw the administration into turmoil.\n\nThe Mueller report was delivered in person to the attorney general's office earlier Friday afternoon, before 4 p.m. At 4:30 pm, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein called Mueller and thanked him for his work.\n\nMinutes later, Barr\u2019s chief of staff called Emmett Flood, a White House lawyer, and read him the letter they were sending to Congress. The relevant committees in Congress all got the Mueller report at the same time, promptly at 5 pm.\n\nThe long-awaited end to the probe comes almost two years after Mueller was appointed by Rosenstein to investigate \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump\" and \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\n\nTo date, almost three dozen people and three companies have been criminally charged in the sprawling probe, including Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn; former campaign chairman Paul Manafort; former political adviser Roger Stone; former personal lawyer Michael Cohen; and numerous Russian nationals. There have been a number of guilty pleas and convictions \u2014 but none of the charges have directly accused anyone in Trump's orbit of conspiring with the Russian intelligence operation to help Trump get elected in 2016.\n\nThere will be no more indictments now that the probe is concluded, NBC News has learned.\n\nIt's unclear how detailed Mueller's report is, or when his conclusions may become public. According to Justice Department guidelines, his confidential report to the attorney general is supposed to explain \"the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the special counsel.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News mobile app for breaking news alerts and full coverage of the Mueller report.\n\nThe attorney general is required to report Mueller's findings to Congress \"with an outline of the actions and the reasons for them,\" the guidelines say, but it's unclear how long that may take.\n\nAs the Mueller investigation picked up steam and various Trump associates were charged, the president increasingly went on the offensive, blasting it as a \"witch hunt\" and \"a hoax,\" calling Mueller's investigators \"angry Democrats\" and singling out some who'd worked on the case. He labeled Cohen \"a rat\" for cooperating with investigators.\n\nTrump refused to sit for an interview with Mueller \u2014 his lawyers said they were concerned about a \"perjury trap\" \u2014 but he did submit written responses to Mueller's questions in November.\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel on May 17, 2017 \u2014 eight days after Trump fired James Comey as FBI director. Comey had been leading the investigation into Russian meddling and any possible Trump campaign involvement. The president initially said he'd canned Comey at the urging of Rosenstein and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but later told NBC \"Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt it was his decision, and cited his frustration with the Russia probe.\n\n\"And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,\" Trump told Holt.\n\nThat fueled law-enforcement concerns that Trump was trying to obstruct the investigation \u2014 worries that were heightened a day after the firing, when he hosted two Russian diplomats in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job,\" Trump told them, according to The New York Times. \"I faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.\"\n\nThose and other actions taken by the president since the probe began led Mueller to investigate whether Trump was trying to obstruct justice in the case, sources have told NBC News.\n\nThe FBI probe into the campaign's alleged Russia ties started in July 2016 after a little-known Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, told an Australian diplomat that the Russians had obtained thousands of emails that would embarrass Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The Australian government passed that information on to the FBI after hacked Democratic National Committee emails were posted online.\n\nThat wouldn't be the only hack. Russian cybercriminals targeted Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails, U.S. intelligence officials found. They were released online just hours after the \"Access Hollywood\" scandal threatened to sink Trump's campaign.\n\nAdding to investigators' suspicions was Trump's often-abrasive deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he repeatedly praised as \"tough\" and \"strong.\" He was also dismissive of U.S. findings that Russia was behind the cybercrimes, noting, \"It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?\"\n\nTrump initially denied that he and his campaign had anything to do with any Russians \u2014 claims that have since fallen apart.\n\nFlynn had sat with Putin at a dinner in Moscow in 2015, and would be fired from his job as national security adviser for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the content of his conversations with a Russian diplomat. Cohen and Trump associate Felix Sater were in talks during the campaign to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow, which would reportedly come complete with a multimillion-dollar apartment for Putin. The president's son Donald Trump Jr. set up a meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian entourage after they offered unspecified \"dirt\" on Clinton\u2019s campaign courtesy of the Kremlin.\n\n\"If it's what you say I love it,\" Trump Jr. said in accepting the meeting, which would include Manafort and Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner."

    "text": "A federal judge ruled late Tuesday that the Interior Department violated federal law by failing to take into account the climate impact of its oil and gas leasing in the West.\n\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras of Washington could force the Trump administration to account for the full climate impact of its energy-dominance agenda, and it could signal trouble for the president\u2019s plan to boost fossil fuel production across the country. Contreras concluded that the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management \u201cdid not sufficiently consider climate change\u201d when making decisions to auction off federal land in Wyoming to oil and gas drilling under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016. The judge temporarily blocked drilling on about 300,000 acres of land in the state.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nThe initial ruling in the case, brought by the advocacy groups WildEarth Guardians and Physicians for Social Responsibility, has implications for oil and gas drilling on federal land throughout the West. In the decision, Contreras \u2014 an Obama appointee \u2014 faulted the agency\u2019s environmental assessments as inadequate because they did not detail how individual drilling projects contribute to the nation\u2019s overall carbon output. Since greenhouse gas emissions are driving climate change, the judge wrote, these analyses did not provide policymakers and the public with a sufficient understanding of drilling\u2019s impact, as required under the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\n\u201cGiven the national, cumulative nature of climate change, considering each individual drilling project in a vacuum deprives the agency and the public of the context necessary to evaluate oil and gas drilling on federal land before irretrievably committing to that drilling,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAsked about the decision Wednesday, Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said in an email, \u201cWe do not comment on ongoing litigation.\"\n\nWyoming Gov. Mark Gordon (R) criticized the ruling in a statement, and suggested that the state might appeal it.\n\n\u201cWe will be exploring options and following up with our state, federal, and industry partners,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cOur country\u2019s efforts to reduce carbon should not center on the livelihoods of those committed workers and industries who seek to provide reliable and affordable energy, especially when we don\u2019t look to the detrimental effects of other expansive industries. Bringing our country to its knees is not the way to thwart climate change.\u201d\n\nContreras did not void the leases outright, but instead ordered the bureau to redo its analysis of hundreds of projects in Wyoming.\n\nWestern Energy Alliance President Kathleen Sgamma, whose group is one of the defendants in the case, said in a phone interview that she was confident that the ruling could be overturned on appeal. She noted that the Obama and Trump administrations had conducted similar climate analyses in their leasing documents, and that it was impossible to predict the cumulative impact of these auctions because just under half of all federal land leased for drilling is eventually developed.\n\n\u201cThis judge has ignored decades of legal precedent in this ruling,\u201d she said. \u201cThe judge is basically asking BLM to take a wild guess on how many wells will be developed on leases, prematurely.\u201d\n\nJeremy Nichols, who directs WildEarth Guardians\u2019 climate and energy program, said in a phone interview that the decision would force the administration to reveal how its policies are helping to fuel climate change. He said his group would take steps to try to block federal oil and gas lease auctions scheduled in the coming week, which encompass an additional 511,000 acres of western land.\n\n[Why the Trump administration keeps losing in court, especially on the environment]\n\n\u201cIt calls into question the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s entire oil and gas program,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cThis forces them to pull their head out of the sand and look at the bigger picture.\u201d\n\nFederal oil, gas and coal leasing \u2014 both on land and offshore \u2014 accounts for a quarter of America\u2019s total carbon output, according to a report issued last year by the Interior Department\u2019s U.S. Geological Survey. Oil and gas drilling accounts for about 40 percent, or 500 million metric tons, of that total.\n\nLast month, a U.S. magistrate judge in Montana ordered the agency to redo its environmental impact analysis of mine expansion on federal land there to reflect factors including the climate impacts of moving the coal by rail and the economic impact of climate change spurred by the burning of coal mined on site.\n\nUniversity of Chicago clinical law professor Mark Templeton, who filed an amicus brief in the case involving Montana\u2019s Spring Creek Coal mine, said federal law imposes these procedural requirements to give the public and federal officials a better sense of what\u2019s at stake in these decisions.\n\n\u201cWe all know climate change is bad, in broad scale and scope,\u201d he said, adding that when it comes to Tuesday\u2019s case, \u201cWhat this ruling shows is individuals in government are making decisions that contribute to climate change, and therefore they need to be considering those effects when they\u2019re making those decisions.\u201d\n\nEven if Contreras\u2019s decision stands, however, it may not block the administration\u2019s energy agenda. Although BLM would be required to disclose the overall climate impact of its leasing decisions, it could still go ahead and open those lands up for development.\n\nWhile the Interior Department began to take into account the climate impacts of federal oil, gas and coal leasing toward the end of Obama\u2019s second term, administration officials jettisoned those plans when President Trump took office.\n\nThe agency lifted Obama\u2019s moratorium on federal coal leasing. The White House also slashed the projected economic damage that stems from burning fossil fuels from about $50 per ton under Obama to between $1 and $7 per ton. The numbers are based on cost-benefit analyses for rules affecting methane leaks from oil and gas operations on public land, as well as pollution from coal-fired power plants. Trump officials reached a lower estimate by excluding climate effects outside the United States and by putting a reduced emphasis on how global warming will affect future generations.\n\nThe Trump administration is working to overhaul a 2016 policy that requires federal agencies to assess the global climate impact of their actions.\n\nTrump and several of his top deputies have dismissed recent federal findings that the United States and other countries must curb their carbon output in the next decade or face potentially disastrous consequences from climate change. In a draft analysis last year of its plan to freeze fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projected that if the United States continued on its current path, the globe could warm by 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. It suggested that this trend illustrated why curbing carbon emissions would make little difference to the planet.\n\nEven though Tuesday\u2019s ruling eventually could be overturned, proponents of oil and gas drilling cautioned that it could still have a chilling effect on development out West.\n\n\u201cAny time there\u2019s a ruling that sows more uncertainty on federal land, that has a ripple effect not just on these leases in question, but throughout the entire federal onshore system,\u201d Sgamma said.\n\nAnd Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement: \u201cThis bad decision will hurt workers in Wyoming, reduce revenue for the state and slow America\u2019s energy production.\"\n\nDarryl Fears and Brady Dennis contributed to this report."

The new trademarks are considered by some to be a conflict of interest, especially as three of the trademarks were specifically made under the president's name.\n\nThe approval is preliminary and will be formally registered in 90 days, if no one objects to the trademarks.\n\nHong Kong intellectual-property officials told the AP the trademarks were approved unusually quickly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Trump-branded businesses planned in China include spas, massage parlors, escort services, hotels, finance and real-estate companies, retail shops, restaurants and bars.\n\nSpring Chang, a partner at the Beijing law firm that has represented the Trump Organization, told the AP that she didn't \"see any special treatment\" in the trademark cases.\n\nConflicts of interest have been a concern since Trump won the presidency last November. In January, Trump announced he was creating a \"blind trust\" with his children to take over the Trump Organization and related family-owned companies. Critics have blasted the arrangement, saying it's impossible for the blind trust to operate as intended when the president's children are at the helm of the company."

Steve King, whose history of making racist remarks has recently come under scrutiny, shared a Facebook post over the weekend that boasts red states would \"win\" a fight against blue states \u2014 and that they have \"8 trillion bullets.\"\n\n\"Wonder who would win...\" the Iowa Republican wrote in a post Saturday, adding an emoji with a smirk. Attached to the post is a photo depicting Democratic-leaning states engaged in a fight with Republican-leaning states. The photo's caption reads, \"Folks keep talking about another civil war... One side has about 8 trillion bullets, while the other side doesn't know which bathroom to use,\" an apparent reference to Democrats' support of gender-neutral bathrooms.\n\nAmong the collection of states colored blue is King's home state of Iowa, which he has represented in Congress since 2003.\n\nKing's office did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Later Monday, the post was removed from King's Facebook page.\n\nThe post came several days after President Donald Trump seemed to insinuate that his supporters -- the police, military and \"Bikers for Trump,\" he claims -- could turn violent against Democrats.\n\nRead More"

Consider them as a product of his pathologies, and they make perfect sense. https://t.co/k9rAK3tGFT \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) March 18, 2019\n\nConway, of course, is the husband to Trump consigliere and prominent surrogate Kellyanne Conway, who managed his campaign following the firings of Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the prominent D.C. lawyer from unloading on the president whenever he does something particularly egregious \u2014 and his behavior over the weekend certainly deserves it:\n\nWhile many people with diagnosed mental health issues might take issue with a lawyer branding Trump as a narcissist from afar, one only has to watch any of his speeches to realize immediately that the President of the United States is sundowning before our very eyes, his brain leaking out of his ears and onto the podium with every retelling of his meetings with our movie-star handsome generals or his insistence that the wheel was invented before the wall or his wild theory that our stealth jets are literally invisible.\n\nThere\u2019s probably going to be some uncomfortable silences at dinner tonight in the Conway household.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution and I have the duty to veto it. And I'm very proud to veto,\" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, calling the resolution \"reckless\" and a \"vote against reality.\"\n\n\"As president, the protection of the nation is my highest duty,\" he continued, reiterating that there is \"definitely a national emergency\" at the border.\n\n\"I was elected by a very, very great group of American people. Millions and millions of people because they want security for our country and that\u2019s what we are going to have,\" Trump said, displaying his determination to carry out his promise for a border wall made during his presidential campaign.\n\nTrump was joined in the Oval Office on Friday by law enforcement officials as well as relatives of individuals who were killed by illegal immigrants.\n\nTrump was responding to the rare rebuke enabled by members of his own party, when the GOP-controlled Senate voted 59-41 on Thursday to approve a House-passed measure that would revoke his national emergency declaration. Twelve Senate Republicans joined the Democrats to cancel the president's declaration.\n\nTrump declared an emergency in order to claim billions of dollars for a border wall after Congress refused to direct the resources the president requested for the southern border.\n\nThe House is set to vote in an attempt to overturn Trump's veto on March 26, although it is unlikely to pass. Still, the president's emergency declaration faces legal challenges.\n\nTrump did not seem deterred by such challenges, telling reporters on Friday that he believes his veto is \"consistent with the law and the legislative process designed by our founders.\"\n\nTrump spent the days leading up to the vote \u2014 which the Senate was legally required to hold, following House passage of the measure \u2014 lobbying Republicans to support his move. Two of the most vulnerable 2020 Republicans, Sens. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., voted against the resolution to end the emergency.\n\nTrump thanked Republicans who did not go against him in the Oval Office Friday, calling them \"courageous.\"\n\n\"I'm proud, as I said, of a lot of Republican Senators that were with me and I'm also very proud of the House \u2014 the Republicans in the House voted overwhelmingly in favor of a secure border,\" Trump continued.\n\nRepublicans who broke from Trump cited constitutional concerns about the potential precedent set by his use of emergency executive power."

    "text": "Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar brought his partner, Matthew Barrett, with him to breakfast with Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday.\n\nSome people online were quick to point out the juxtaposition because Pence has consistently received harsh criticism from LGBTQ activists. Pence, a conservative Christian, has not been quiet about his opposition to same-sex marriage in the past, once saying on the House floor: \"Societal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family.\"\n\nOn his last trip to the US last year, Varadkar had a closed-door meeting with Pence. After, the Taoiseach \u2014 the prime minister of Ireland \u2014 told reporters that he had brought up the issue of LGBTQ rights with him. He also said Pence and his wife told him that he and his partner were \"very welcome to visit their home in the future.\"\n\nVaradkar took Pence up on his offer Thursday, bringing Barrett along for a morning reception at the vice president's residence on the grounds of the US Naval Observatory.\n\nRead more: Inside Number One Observatory Circle, the overlooked but stunning vice president's residence where the Pences live\n\nThis time, the reception was open to reporters, so cameras were rolling when Varadkar talked about the change he's seen in his traditionally Catholic country when it comes to acceptance of gay people.\n\nVaradkar said that while growing up in Ireland he was always \"fascinated by American politics,\" which inspired him \"to believe in the power of politics to do good.\"\n\n\"I also knew at the time that I lived in a country where, if I tried to be myself at the time, I would have ended up breaking laws,\" he said. \"But today that has all changed. I stand here leader of my country, flawed and human, but judged by my political actions and not my sexual orientation, my skin tone, gender, or religious beliefs.\"\n\nVaradkar said Ireland isn't the only place where this is possible, but \"every country where freedom and liberty are cherished.\"\n\n\"We are, after all, all God's children,\" he said.\n\nPence avoided mentioning LGBTQ rights in his speech, instead focusing on his family's ties to Ireland. He said he is planning a trip to Ireland with his mother, who is first-generation Irish-American (two of Pence's grandparents were born in Ireland).\n\n\"People often ask me what I felt on Inauguration Day when I raised my right hand,\" Pence said. \"As I looked out at that vast throng of Americans and took that oath, I thought about my grandpa ... He was proud to be an American, but I can still hear that Irish brogue in my heart when my grandfather used to talk about the old country and his home across the pond. His love for the Irish people, his love for the Irish heritage is bone-marrow deep.\""

    "text": "An often-overlooked source of funding for the Green New Deal is the private sector. Government does not need to foot the whole bill. It merely needs to spend enough, and legislate enough, to trigger a transformation of private investment. Even many liberal and left economists are stuck thinking that government has to pay for the whole Green New Deal, as if it were a welfare program. In reality, government merely needs to do enough to channel ongoing public and private investment in new directions.\n\nThe Green New Deal is not some discreet object to be purchased. Rather, it is a process of society-wide economic and technical change. The Green New Deal does not mean buying a bunch of new green stuff to bolt onto all the old dirty stuff; rather, it means changing how society invests. It means industrial planning. It means channeling flows of capital away from harmful activities like oil drilling and speculation, into socially useful work like building out the clean energy sector. Even if one ultimately wants to nationalize the means of production, green industrial planning within a capitalist framework is an important step toward deeper changes in our mode of production as a whole.\n\nOne very important source of badly misallocated capital is corporate America\u2019s vast hoard of semi-hibernating cash. Last year the Federal Reserve reported that nonfinancial corporations held $4.8 trillion in cash. That sum is equal to almost one quarter of the entire US annual economic output, which last year was $20.5 trillion. And this $4.8 trillion in cash is only a subset of a larger, less liquid, hoard of $22.1 trillion worth of financial assets held by nonfinancial corporations.\n\nThis is not money paid out to stockholders as profits or to managers as bonuses. This is money retained by firms for investment. Technically much of this cash it is \u201cat work\u201d somewhere, in the sense that it has been invested, it is not currency piled in a vault. But it is at work primarily in the financial sector where it is fueling the next speculative bubble while doing little to grow the real economy.\n\nWhy are firms sitting on this money? Because they are waiting for the next big thing, the basis for the next long wave of accumulation: something equivalent to the sustained build-out provided by the advent of the internal combustion engine, or electrification, or the rise of personal computing and the internet. The Green New Deal\u2019s vision of a civilization-wide, clean energy transition would unleash the hoarded corporate cash and be the basis of a new long wave of investment.\n\nTo meet the goals of the Green New Deal the US government would need to use a combination of regulation, investment, procurement, and subsidy. Legislatively, step one should be to stop all fossil fuel extraction on public lands and end all subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimates that federal subsidies for oil, gas, and coal production average about $26 billion a year. That sum could shift to subsidizing clean energy production.\n\nNext, put the fossil fuel sector on an aggressive legal timeline towards extinction. At the same time, government needs to increase \u201crenewable portfolio standards\u201d \u2014 that is, increase the percentage of clean power each utility company is required to produce. What would happen to the money now invested in building oil pipelines? It too would shift into building the clean energy sector.\n\nLegal changes like these would force a massive private sector build-out of clean energy capacity. Duke Energy could stay in business, but it would have to close its coal- and gas-fired plants, while building wind and solar capacity. Translated at scale across the economy, these sorts of dynamics would force the hoarded corporate cash to get off the speculative bench and get back into the real-economy game of actually producing useful products \u2014 such as electric vehicles, retrofitted buildings, massive wind farms, and photovoltaic solar panels on every roof.\n\nAnother tool for channeling investment is government procurement, what I have called the Big Green Buy. If the federal government performed energy-saving retrofits on all of its 450,000 buildings, that work would require a mix of public employees and private contractors. Similarly, if the public sector switched from gas to electric vehicles, private sector auto manufactures would have to invest to meet the demand.\n\nIf the government set out a schedule to buy all the energy it consumed from clean sources, who would build the needed wind turbines and solar panels? Perhaps someday worker- or state-owned firms but in the near term most of that demand would have to be met by private firms. A greening of government procurement would thus draw forth the nonfinancial sector\u2019s financial hoard and shift capital away from filthy fossil fuels.\n\nFar from \u201ccosting too much\u201d the Green New Deal promises the very thing that Wall Street hoarding denies: more opportunity and more income for more people. After all, capital is like blood, it is only useful if it circulates."

    "text": "8.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThey can dish it out but they can\u2019t take it.\n\nAfter President Trump posted a hilariously hypocritical and ironically self-reflective tweet criticizing the media for spreading phony conspiracy theories about whether the woman accompanying him on his recent tour of tornado damage in Alabama was his wife Melania or a cleverly disguised body double, the White House stepped up its attack by having a spokesperson for the first lady attack the hosts of ABC\u2019s The View for discussing the theory on air.\n\nComing from the man who single-handedly kept the \u201cbirther\u201d lie about then-President Obama alive even after hard evidence of its falsity was made public, Trump\u2019s tweet proves that this particular gander can\u2019t handle the same level of \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d \u2014 as the self-victimized Trump likes to refer to it when he\u2019s on the receiving end \u2014 as the goose he tortured for years with his cynical lies.\n\nThe Fake News photoshopped pictures of Melania, then propelled conspiracy theories that it\u2019s actually not her by my side in Alabama and other places. They are only getting more deranged with time! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet was quickly followed by a post from Stephanie Grisham, the White House Director of Communications for FLOTUS that tried to shame the hosts of The View for discussing a heavily trending Twitter topic in a brief segment that paled in comparison to the hours that networks like Fox News spent trying to delegitimize Obama by claiming he wasn\u2019t truly eligible to be president because of his supposed foreign birth.\n\n.@flotus & @potus traveled to Alabama to pay their respects & comfort victims of the tornado devastation. In typical fashion, @theview chooses to laugh in the face of tragedy. Shameful. https://t.co/KzG2c4Th4a \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@StephGrisham45) March 11, 2019\n\nWhether The View hosts were \u201claughing in the face of tragedy\u201d is a debatable issue, but if you do believe that they were, please explain how what they were doing was more offensive than the president chucking rolls of paper towels at hurricane victims in Puerto Rico.\n\nIt seems like that would have to be considered at least equally shameful to a dispassionate observer.\n\nThen again, a dispassionate observer would most likely look at the entire \u201cfake Melania\u201d conspiracy theory, shrug, and say \u201cI really don\u2019t care. Do you?\u201d\n\nFollow Vinnie Longobardo on Twitter.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "On Wednesday morning in a D.C. courtroom, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort engaged in what we assume was, for him, a deeply humiliating, depraved act: he expressed remorse, presumably for the first time in his 69 years on earth. Or, at least, he tried to. \u201cI am sorry for what I\u2019ve done and all the activities that have gotten us here today,\u201d he told Judge Amy Berman Jackson, claiming that he shouldn\u2019t get more jail time for the copious federal crimes he committed because he is his adult wife\u2019s \u201cprimary caretaker,\u201d and the two of them need each other. \u201cI know that it was my conduct that brought me here today,\u201d Manafort added. \u201cFor that, I am remorseful. While I cannot undo the past, I can ensure that the future will be very different. . . . I can say to you with conviction that my behavior in the future will be very different.\u201d\n\nWhile that reasoning might have worked on Judge T.S. Ellis, who strangely argued last week that Manafort had led a \u201cblameless life\u201d outside of all the crime, Jackson wasn\u2019t having it, sentencing him to an additional 43 months on federal conspiracy charges, and letting him know she saw right through his 3-piece suit (\u201cSaying I\u2019m sorry I got caught is not an inspiring plea for leniency\u201d). And, somehow, it\u2019s unlikely that that was the worst part of Manafort\u2019s day! Because literal minutes later, this happened:\n\nNew York prosecutors Wednesday announced criminal charges against President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chief, Paul Manafort, only minutes after his sentencing in a federal case. The indictment, unveiled by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, charges Manafort with 16 counts related to mortgage fraud, conspiracy, and falsifying business records. . . . Crucially, Trump does not have pardon power for state charges.\n\nThe indictment from New York prosecutors alleges a yearlong scheme in which Manafort doctored business records to obtain millions in loans, and reportedly grew out of an investigation that started in 2017 when prosecutors started looking into loans Manafort had received from two banks. Last week, a grand jury moved to charge the guy who ran the president\u2019s campaign with residential mortgage fraud, conspiracy, falsifying business records, and a handful of other crimes. If he\u2019s convicted of the most serious charges, he could spend up to a quarter of a century in prison. (The Times could not immediately reach Manafort\u2019s legal team for comment.)\n\nAccording to the Times, Manafort\u2019s attorneys likely will dispute the indictment on the basis of double jeopardy, but \u201cprosecutors in Mr. Vance\u2019s office have expressed confidence that they would prevail.\u201d Trump, who loves himself a good crook, has previously called Manafort a \u201cbrave man\u201d with a \u201cwonderful family\u201d who has been treated worse than \u201cAlfonse Capone.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe.\n\nAnd speaking of pardons\n\nYou may want to sit down for this, but it\u2019s possible Donald Trump dangled a pardon in front of Michael Cohen, on the condition that the former fixer refuse to cooperate with the Feds. Per CNN:\n\nAn attorney who said he was speaking with President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani reassured Michael Cohen in an April 2018 e-mail that Cohen could \u201csleep well tonight\u201d because he had \u201cfriends in high places,\u201d according to a copy of an e-mail obtained by CNN.\n\nTwo emails\u2014both dated April 21, 2018, and among documents provided to Congress by the president\u2019s former attorney and fixer\u2014do not specifically mention a pardon. Cohen, in his closed-door congressional testimony, has provided these e-mails in an effort to corroborate his claim that a pardon was dangled before he decided to cooperate with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with his testimony.\n\nAccording to the attorney who wrote the e-mails, Robert Costello, the notion that there was a pardon on the table contingent on not ratting out Trump is \u201cutter nonsense.\u201d According to Costello, in reality, Cohen was the one who asked him to raise the possibility of a pardon with Giuliani. A source \u201cwith knowledge of Cohen\u2019s thinking at the time\u201d insisted to CNN that Trump\u2019s legal time was \u201ctrying to keep Cohen in the fold as a way to keep him quiet, hinting that a pardon could be in the mix at some point.\u201d When everyone involved is a documented liar, it\u2019s hard to know who to believe!\n\nBusiness exec charged in college-admissions scandal not a business exec any longer\n\nWhile others have been placed in a time-out:\n\nManuel Henriquez has resigned as C.E.O. of Hercules Capital, and private-equity firm TPG executive William McGlashan and Willkie Farr & Gallagher co-chairman Gordon Caplan have been placed on leave after they were accused in a scam to help their children get into top colleges. The three were among 50 people charged in what investigators said was a $25 million bribery scam.\n\nHenriquez, 55, resigned as chairman and C.E.O. of his California-based venture capital firm, according to a company statement, which did not mention the admissions scheme. He was arrested in New York on Tuesday and released on $500,000 bail. Hercules\u2019s shares lost 8.9 percent after the arrest announcement, but were slightly higher on Wednesday.\n\nMcGlashan, 55, was placed on indefinite leave, TPG said. He managed TPG Growth, which has invested in companies including Airbnb, Spotify, and Uber, and led TPG\u2019s Rise Fund, which is committed to investing for social and environmental good, according to the Web site. . . . Caplan, 52, of Greenwich Connecticut, was placed on indefinite leave, by Willkie Farr, according to reports.\n\nAccording a phone call cited in the indictment, Caplan said he wasn\u2019t \u201cworried about the moral issue\u201d of allegedly paying $75,000 to have his daughter\u2019s test scores changed, but rather her being \u201cfinished\u201d if she got caught.\n\nA Howard Schultz presidency would include a lot of sh-tty coffee: Howard Schultz\n\nWells Fargo C.E.O. did pretty well for himself last year\n\nConsidering that in 2018 the California lender copped to accidentally foreclosing on hundreds of customers who lost their homes; was accused of steering Latino and African-American borrowers into high-risk and high-cost mortgages (a claim it denies); told shareholders they can\u2019t sue over misleading statements by management like \u201cwe\u2019re changing our ways\u201d and \u201cwe want to regain your trust\u201d because such statements weren\u2019t supposed to be taken literally; and allegedly continued to employ the same high-pressure tactics that led to its sham accounts scandal, Tim Sloan should be quite pleased with his 5 percent raise, which included a $2.4 million salary, $14 million in stock awards, and $2 million in incentive awards.\n\nElsewhere!\n\nWho was acing tests for rich kids in the admissions scam?

    "text": "13.7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nDonald Trump is a man known for dabbling in, and in some cases diving headfirst into, conspiracy theories. His political career really began with his spreading of the racist lie that our first black president wasn\u2019t born in the United States and as such wasn\u2019t eligible to hold his office. Now, he\u2019s found himself on the receiving end of a conspiracy theory, and he isn\u2019t exactly pleased about it.\n\nThis morning, Trump took to Twitter and claimed that the \u201cFake News\u201d is spreading \u201cphotoshopped\u201d pictures of First Lady Melania Trump in order to stoke rumors that it wasn\u2019t really her who accompanied him to Alabama to visit the tornado survivors last week and was, in fact, a body double intended to look like his wife.\n\nThe Fake News photoshopped pictures of Melania, then propelled conspiracy theories that it\u2019s actually not her by my side in Alabama and other places. They are only getting more deranged with time! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2019\n\nThe \u201cFake Melania\u201d theory has been a popular one on Twitter for some time, and it postulates that sometimes Melania refuses or is unable to travel with the president. During those times, a woman with a similar physical appearance dons glasses to obscure her face and follows Donald Trump around.\n\nThe conspiracy theory dates back to 2017 when a clip of Melania with her husband went viral. In it, she stands silently by his side, her face mostly in shadows as President Trump rambles on. To many people, it didn\u2019t look like Melania Trump, and the theory was only emboldened by Trump\u2019s strange decision to say \u201cMy wife Melania, who happens to be right here\u2026\u201d as if trying to convince everyone that it was really her.\n\nThis is not Melania. To think they would go this far & try & make us think its her on TV is mind blowing. Makes me wonder what else is a lie pic.twitter.com/JhPVmXdGit \u2014 BuyLegalMeds.com (@JoeVargas) October 18, 2017\n\nThe theory popped up again this past Friday when a photo of Melania once again spread like wildfire on Twitter, with many users once again convinced that it looked like some woman other than the First Lady.\n\nGUYS THAT IS NOT MELANIA pic.twitter.com/2kfo7QMU2x \u2014 Red\u2122\ufe0f (@Redpainter1) March 8, 2019\n\nOne user even compiled a semi-convincing comparison between the \u201cFake Melania\u201d and a Secret Service agent with a similar face.\n\nI found the fake melania pic.twitter.com/6PJhttQSyp \u2014 lib bapper (@lib_crusher) March 8, 2019\n\nOther Twitter users took the conspiracy theory less seriously and instead used it to make jokes and poke fun at the Trumps.\n\nNation stunned as Melania body double removes sunglasses and wig. #FakeMelania pic.twitter.com/UVBCwfvpWJ \u2014 Blue Cap (@BlueCapFL) March 9, 2019\n\nSo popular was the theory that the hosts of The View actually discussed it at some length, with Joy Behar admitting that she herself didn\u2019t think the latest photo looked like Melania.\n\nFAKE MELANIA CONSPIRACIES RETURN: The internet is buzzing again with theories that first lady Melania Trump is using an imposter to stand in for her \u2014 the co-hosts investigate. https://t.co/f8u2wc159S pic.twitter.com/XNYBT9U6S8 \u2014 The View (@TheView) March 11, 2019\n\nThe explanations for why Trump would possibly use a body double of his wife instead of just having her come along with him vary, with some suggesting it\u2019s simply because she can\u2019t stand being around him more than is absolutely necessary.\n\nIn any case, the fact that something as absurd as this theory even seems plausible to some people demonstrates how little faith people have in Donald Trump. He\u2019s so strange, so clearly dishonest, that Americans can imagine him pulling a stunt like this.\n\nTrump, for his part, has now only made matters worse by trying to swat down this conspiracy theory with one of his own. The media didn\u2019t \u201cphotoshop\u201d these images and for him to suggest as much is almost as ridiculous as the body double theory itself. It\u2019s especially pathetic of him to lie about it when the footage he already shared of his trip proves that it was Melania that went with him. The man simply can\u2019t resist the urge to lie and attack the media.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "31k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nNew York\u2019s Attorney General Leticia James just opened a sweeping investigation into the fraud and misdealings of the Trump Organization that its former executive vice-president revealed in his Congressional testimony last month.\n\nMichael Cohen was an executive in the Trump Organization for a decade, starting in 2006 before resigning to become the President\u2019s personal lawyer, and his testimony to the House Oversight Committee last month revealed numerous threads of criminal behavior at his former employer\u2019s business that prompted the new investigation.\n\nUnlike the other seventeen investigations into Donald Trump, the NY AG\u2019s new probe is focused squarely on a soft target, the President\u2019s family real estate business. New York\u2019s new probe could result in the state equivalent of the death penalty for the Trump Organization. The Times reports:\n\nThe New York attorney general\u2019s office late on Monday issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump Organization projects and a failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League in 2014, according to a person briefed on the subpoenas. The inquiry by Ms. James\u2019s office is a civil investigation, not a criminal one, although its focus and scope were unclear.\n\nDissolution for a corporation is analogous to the death penalty, and only applies to the most serious cases, as Fordham Law Professor Jed Sugarman explained in the Times\u2019 Opinion section earlier today:\n\nNew York\u2019s highest court has described this remedy of civil dissolution as a \u201cjudgment of corporate death,\u201d and for the state to invoke such a corporate death penalty, the corporation\u2019s \u201ctransgressions\u201d must not be merely incidental, but \u201cmaterial and serious; and such as to harm or menace the public welfare.\u201d If a state civil investigation turned up more evidence of criminal fraud, state and federal prosecutors could use these findings to indict the Trump Organization and its officials, including Mr. Weisselberg.\n\nCrucially, Trump cannot use his pardon powers to interfere with NY AG James\u2019 investigation, and the right to sue a president in civil court for his pre-office behavior is a firmly established precedent.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s fraudulent \u201ccharity\u201d organization, the Trump Foundation, is still fighting a similar lawsuit from the previous New York AG Barbara Underwood, who obtained a judicial order to dissolve the non-profit corporation.\n\nNow, Trump is feeling more heat than ever as state authorities are using his former fixer\u2019s Congressional testimony as a factual basis to open new inquiries into the kinds of financial crimes that inevitably sprout from business fraud \u2014 and all it took was just one Congressional hearing for Michael Cohen to rip the lid off of Pandora\u2019s box at the Trump Organization.\n\nNo wonder New York AG Tish James said on the campaign trail that, \u201cthe president of the United States has to worry about three things; Mueller, Cohen, and Tish James.\u201d\n\nOriginal reporting by William K. Rashbaum and Danny Hakim at the New York Times.\n\n\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Vice President Pence is discussing an offer with Republican senators that could lead to the defeat of a Democratic resolution overturning Preside nt Trump 's emergency declaration to build a wall on the Mexican border, according to GOP sources briefed on the matter.\n\nUnder the deal discussed between Pence and GOP senators, Trump would sign legislation reining in his power to declare future national emergencies if they defeat the resolution of disapproval.\n\nKilling the resolution on the Republican-controlled Senate floor would spare the president a major embarrassment and avoid him having to issue the first veto of his presidency.\n\nBut there is some skepticism among GOP senators whether Trump will actually go through with it. And the plan is hurt by the fact that a bill to curb the president's power to declare national emergencies won't come to the Senate floor until after the March recess.\n\nPence met Tuesday with a group of Republicans, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the sponsor of legislation to curb the president's national emergency declaration power, as well as Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.). Lee's measure would require Congress to vote to extend a national emergency declaration after a period of 30 days.\n\nSenate Republicans familiar with the offer say there would have to be an ironclad promise from Trump to sign Lee's bill in order to flip Republicans who currently say they will vote for the resolution of disapproval.\n\nSo far, Trump himself hasn't made any such pledges, leaving the process in limbo.\n\nPence made \"no commitment,\" according to a White House official familiar with the meeting, and only said he would relay the possible deal to Trump.\n\nThe vice president said he would be \"happy to bring their concerns to the president but made zero commitments,\" according to the White House official.\n\nThe White House official noted that Tillis requested the meeting and Pence was happy to attend, emphasizing that the senators \"pitched the VP a proposal\" and that \"he listened and said he'd take it to POTUS.\"\n\nThe vice president \"encouraged the senators to vote against the disapproval resolution and indicated a vote for it would be vote against securing our borders,\" the source added.\n\nA lunchtime meeting of the Senate Republican Conference on Tuesday failed to settle the internal debate over the emergency declaration and the resolution of disapproval.\n\n\"It was our usual circular conversation,\" said one GOP senator. \"Everyone goes around and throws out proposals and nothing gets resolved.\n\n\"There is no plan,\" the source added.\n\nAlready Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), say they won't change their minds on voting for the resolution. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) doesn't seem inclined to reverse herself, either.\n\n\"No, I think Congress should allocate the money and that's a very strong belief. It's also in the Constitution,\" Paul said when asked whether he might alter course and vote against the disapproval resolution.\n\nTillis, who is up for reelection in 2020 and could face a primary challenger, however, might change his mind if Trump gives a strong enough assurance that he would support future reform of the National Emergencies Act of 1976.\n\nTillis told colleagues at lunch Tuesday that he thought Trump was within his power to declare a national emergency to obtain $3.6 billion in additional funding for border barriers, even though he disagrees with the use of that power.\n\nBut there are at least a half-dozen other Republicans who are considered strong possibilities to vote for the disapproval legislation, such as Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who say they have already decided how they're going to vote but haven't yet announced it.\n\nOther potential defectors include Portman, Toomey, Alexander and Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.).\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who plans to vote against the disapproval resolution, predicted that it will get between 50 and 60 votes - enough to pass with the simple majority it needs.\n\n\"It will probably get over 50 but less than 60, I think,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans control 53 seats, so the disapproval resolution will pass if four or more Republicans vote for it. All Democrats are expected to support it.\n\nPaul, who has announced his support for the resolution, said the White House and GOP leaders are stepping up their pressure effort to keep Republicans in line.\n\n\"They're being beaten upright, so if you see anybody that's got blood dripping out of their ear, they may be changing,\" Paul joked.\n\nHe said there is still \"a significant number\" of Republicans willing to vote for the disapproval resolution but added \"there are a lot of people being bruised and beleaguered. We'll see.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, the only vote expected on Thursday is on the Democratic disapproval resolution.\n\n\"Right now, that's the only thing that's going to be voted on,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) after meeting with colleagues over lunch to discuss the path forward.\n\nLee acknowledged that he won't be able to get his bill to the floor before the March recess, which is scheduled to begin Friday.\n\nThat means any plan to trade votes on Thursday's resolution would have to wait at least for a couple of weeks.\n\nEfforts to come up with an alternative Republican resolution that would state support for the president's efforts to secure the border while expressing disapproval of Trump's emergency declaration have failed to yield a concrete proposal.\n\nToomey, who is working on a GOP alternative resolution, however, is still working with colleagues to come up with something.\n\nUpdated at 5:16 p.m."

The $4.7 trillion budget proposal also grows the national deficit by another $1.1 trillion next year alone, with the administration projecting an increase in the national debt to over $31 trillion by 2029 from where it already stands at over $22 trillion.\n\nTrump\u2019s budget proposal includes:\n\nAn administration\u2019s budget is a reflection of the party\u2019s priorities and goals for the nation. It is clear from the Trump budget proposal that the Republican's main concern is cutting social and domestic programs in order to pay for massive for tax breaks given to millionaires and corporations, all while increasing the national deficit for future generations. Constituents must make it clear to Congress that Trump's budget strays far from true American values and must not be taken seriously."

    "text": "Nancy Pelosi stands up in her spacious office in the U.S. Capitol, walks past an enormous window with a commanding view of the Mall and the Washington Monument, and picks up a small plaque from her desk. A gift from Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), the plaque has the familiar profile of a young Abraham Lincoln on one side. Pelosi returns to her chair holding the plaque on her palm and reads a quote from Lincoln etched on the reverse side: \u201cPublic sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail. Without it, nothing can succeed.\u201d\n\nIt was public sentiment, Pelosi says, that convinced her President Trump would back down in the standoff over funding a border wall that partially shut down the government for 35 days earlier this year. And it is public sentiment, she says, that will guide her as she leads the House Democrats and seeks to use their powers as a check on a president she believes disregards the Constitution.\n\n(Photo illustration by Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nPelosi, 78, never thought that Donald Trump would be elected president, but in many ways she has been preparing for this political battle all of her life. First elected to Congress in a special election in 1987 and now in her 17th term, she is experienced in all of Washington\u2019s various forms of combat, power and perseverance. She is the first woman to lead a political party in Congress and, in 2007, was the first woman to become speaker of the House. After Democrats won control of the House in November following eight years out of power, Pelosi fended off an effort by some in her party to replace her, and reclaimed the speakership.\n\nNow in her fourth decade as an elected representative, Pelosi is at the outset of a term that will almost certainly be the most critical of her career. I spoke with her last week about her relationship with Trump, the rise of a new generation of women lawmakers, the Green New Deal, the prospect of impeachment and more.\n\nAfter eight years as minority leader, what does it mean for you to be back in this office?\n\nHas it been eight years? [Laughs.] In some ways it seems much faster than that. Well, being in the majority always feels great, especially compared to the minority. \u2026 So it feels good. I mean, it feels responsible. We have important work to do for our country. And I\u2019m very proud that we got here on a path for the people with a clear definition of our agenda. Lower health-care costs, bigger paychecks, building the infrastructure of America, cleaner government. We have H.R. 1 on the floor, and in the first 100 days we will have had introductions, hearings, markups or floor action on everything in our agenda: lowering health-care costs by lowering the cost of prescription drugs, building infrastructure, bigger paychecks. And then guns, dreamers, Equality Act and equal pay.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi greeting workers who were furloughed during the shutdown. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nIs this the most divisive political climate in your 32 years in Congress?\n\nYeah, well, it\u2019s very divisive because of the person who is in the White House and the enablers that the Republicans in Congress are to him. It was terrible when we were here in the \u201990s and [Newt] Gingrich was speaker and impeached the president, Bill Clinton. There\u2019s no question that that was horrible for the country. It was unnecessary and the rest. But in terms of where we are, as Thomas Paine said, the times have found us. And the times have found us now. We have a very serious challenge to the Constitution of the United States in the president\u2019s unconstitutional assault on the Constitution, on the first branch of government, the legislative branch. \u2026 This is very serious for our country. Forgetting politics, forgetting partisanship, just talk about patriotism. So in terms of divisiveness, that we don\u2019t see a commensurate \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say reaction, just action \u2014 on the part of Republicans to the statements and actions the president is taking, yeah, this is probably the most divisive and serious. Serious, because again it\u2019s about our fundamentals; it\u2019s not about our politics.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cbeen a great organizer for Democrats, a great fundraiser for Democrats and a great mobilizer at the grass-roots level for Democrats. And I think that\u2019s good for America.\u201d\n\nFor 2020, your goal is to keep control of the House and have a Democrat elected president.\n\nAnd the Senate, the whole thing.\n\nIs this the most critical 20 months of your entire career?\n\nWell, every election we say this is the most important election of our time. And it just gets to be more crucial every time. In \u201916, I never thought he would be elected president of the United States. How could it be? But then he was, so that made \u201918 more crucial. And we won that. And thank God, because we now have a lever; we have leverage against this assault on the Constitution. This election is very important. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be reelected, but it is important for us to elect a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate and Democratic House. So they only become more crucial. Not to diminish the importance of the others, but because of the actions taken by the person in the White House, disregarding the Constitution of the United States, disregarding our commitments to the world in terms of our commitment to NATO, to Paris climate, to our values.\n\nPelosi during President Trump's State of the Union address. (Doug Mills/Pool/The New York Times)\n\nHow would you describe your relationship with the president?\n\nIs there a relationship? [Laughs.] How would I describe my relationship to the president? My relationship toward him is respectful, respectful of the office that he holds. Straightforward, just tell him what I think. And I always say you\u2019re not going to hear me saying anything publicly that I\u2019m not saying here in the office. Hopeful that at some point we can find common ground that he\u2019ll stick to. So, yeah, respectful, honest and hopeful.\n\nDo you feel that he has done anything that has been good for America?\n\nHe\u2019s been a great organizer for Democrats, a great fundraiser for Democrats and a great mobilizer at the grass-roots level for Democrats. [Laughs.] And I think that\u2019s good for America.\n\nThere have been increasing calls, including from some of your members, for impeachment of the president.\n\nI\u2019m not for impeachment. This is news. I\u2019m going to give you some news right now because I haven\u2019t said this to any press person before. But since you asked, and I\u2019ve been thinking about this: Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he\u2019s just not worth it.\n\nA lot of Americans are really anxious about where the country is right now, and some of them feel the nation\u2019s institutions are in a perilous state. Do you share that concern?\n\nNo. Here\u2019s why I don\u2019t: Our country is great. It\u2019s a great country. Our founders gave us the strongest foundation. \u2026 All the challenges we have faced, we can withstand anything. But maybe not two [Trump] terms. So we have to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nRep.

Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nSo you\u2019re on the cover of Rolling Stone with Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Do you see in this new generation of women lawmakers, not just them, but this generation, do you see yourself in them, or do you not see much of yourself in them at all?\n\nHere\u2019s what I see myself in them as: When I came to Congress I had no intention of running for office, shy person that I have always been. I was chair of the [California Democratic] Party, always advancing other people. I loved that because I cared about the causes of the Democratic Party, about fairness in our economy.\n\nMy motivation is the 1 in 5 children who lives in poverty in America.\n\nSo what I see, and I say this to them: I was you. I used to carry the [protest] signs pushing strollers. \u2026 And as an advocate, relentless, persistent, dissatisfied always. But when you cross over the threshold and come to Congress, you can bring those enthusiasms, those priorities, your knowledge, your vision, your plan. But you have to want to get results. You have to get results. Then, you were trying to impact others making decisions. Now you are that person. So [my] being a progressive, a liberal from San Francisco, they can\u2019t go any place I haven\u2019t been philosophically. [Laughs.] \u2026 So I think I have a good simpatico with a lot of them because, again, that\u2019s who I was. The young women today, though, coming in \u2026 the way they balance family and children and home, I\u2019m in awe of them. I\u2019m in awe of them.\n\n\u201cThere are a range of views in our caucus, and we respect that. But we are unified. People compliment me and they say, \u2018Oh, you know, you can keep them all together.\u2019 I don\u2019t. Our values unify us.\u201d\n\nIs it harder to manage the demands of the more-centrist members who are going to face tougher reelections, or the more-progressive members who maybe feel a freedom to push a little more?\n\nUnderstand this: There are a range of views in our caucus, and we respect that. But we are unified. People compliment me and they say, \u201cOh, you know, you can keep them all together.\u201d I don\u2019t. Our values unify us. And all of us, wherever we are, here or there, are all of one mind that we are here for America\u2019s working families to lower their costs, to raise their paycheck and give them more-honest government in a country where we have gun safety and respect for every person in our society. So there is no management of this. It\u2019s the vitality. We invite it. We\u2019re not trying to curtail it. We\u2019re excited by it.\n\nHas Twitter been good for American politics?\n\nAre you including the president of the United States? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been good. No. I think truth, fact, evidence, data \u2014 I think that\u2019s what\u2019s good for America. As long as that\u2019s being conveyed, I\u2019m for it all. But when it\u2019s not, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the president is conveying, I think that that does a disservice.\n\nIt\u2019s Ash Wednesday, and you\u2019re a practicing Catholic. How does your faith guide you in this office?\n\nI was born into a family that was devoutly Catholic, fiercely patriotic, proud of our Italian American heritage and staunchly Democrat. And we saw that connection between church and Democrats as the Gospel of Matthew. When I was hungry, when I was thirsty, when I was naked, when I was homeless, when I was in prison. And that was how we were raised, that we had a responsibility to other people. And that was our motivation. So that\u2019s why sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to understand \u2014 I have to admit this, that we were raised to say there\u2019s a spark of divinity in every person. That we\u2019re all God\u2019s children. And yet I see people of faith go down paths that so contradict what they say. For example, on the issue of immigration, so many people of faith, I guess they just don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a spark of divinity or that we\u2019re all God\u2019s children. How disrespectful they are.\n\nPelosi signs a deal to reopen the government on Capitol Hill. (Andrew Harnik/AP) Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

Schumer (D-N.Y.) speak to the media after a meeting with Trump during the partial government shutdown. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Trump was asking for the money for the border wall, why was it so essential that Democrats not give in?\n\nBecause it was wrong. I mean, when the president was advocating for a wall, that was a tangible, visible sign of discrimination. He [was] in sharp contrast to every president before him in modern times. It might interest you to know that the president I quoted most on the campaign trail was Ronald Reagan. \u2026 He talks about the Statue of Liberty and what it means to the world to see this beacon of hope, what it means to people who came here, people who are coming here. Then he goes on to say, the vital force of America\u2019s preeminence in the world is every generation of newcomers to our country. And when America fails to recognize that, America will fail to be preeminent in the world. \u2026 Ronald Reagan, President George Herbert Walker Bush, President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush, President Barack Obama all subscribed to the vitality of America being about a renewal of optimism, hope, determination to make the future better. Courageous to come here, to do it as newcomers, making America more American and subscribing to those values of our country.\n\nExcept this president used a message of fear against immigrants, against trade, against Hillary Clinton in his campaign, but his anti-immigrant issue is ongoing. It\u2019s the wall, and the wall is not even a campaign promise because he promised Mexico was going to pay for it. It\u2019s a campaign applause line of discrimination and bigotry. And it\u2019s just not right, and it doesn\u2019t do the job. So he wants us to spend billions of dollars when we have other needs to meet the needs of the American people. He wants us to spend tens of billions of dollars on a wall that doesn\u2019t serve the purpose and is a sign of discrimination.\n\n\u201cThis president ... is fighting clean air for your children to breathe, clean water for them to drink, food safety \u2014 every good thing that we should be doing that people can\u2019t do for themselves.\u201d\n\nYou said earlier you don\u2019t feel it\u2019s worth it to pursue impeachment. Do you believe he\u2019s fit to be president?\n\nAre we talking ethically? Intellectually? Politically? What are we talking here?\n\nAll \u2014\n\nAll of the above. No. No. I don\u2019t think he is. I mean, ethically unfit. Intellectually unfit. Curiosity-wise unfit. No, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit to be president of the United States. And that\u2019s up to us to make the contrast to show that this president \u2014 while he may be appealing to you on your insecurity and therefore your xenophobia, whether it\u2019s globalization or immigrants \u2014 is fighting clean air for your children to breathe, clean water for them to drink, food safety, every good thing that we should be doing that people can\u2019t do for themselves. You know, I have five kids, and I think I can do everything for them, but I can\u2019t control the air they breathe, the water that they drink. You depend on the public sector to do certain things for the health and well-being of your family, and he is counter to that.\n\nBut again, this is coming across too negatively. I don\u2019t usually talk about him this much. This is the most I\u2019ve probably talked about him. I hardly ever talk about him. You know, it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about what we can do for the people to lower health-care costs, bigger paychecks, cleaner government.\n\nPelosi with other women elected to Congress at the Capitol in January. A record number of women are serving in the 116th Congress. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the proposals that has drawn a lot of attention and some support from Democrats is this idea of a Green New Deal. What do you tell members who want leadership to get behind that plan?\n\nI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s ever told me to get behind the plan. Here\u2019s the thing: When I was speaker, the first time, my flagship issue was climate and energy. And working with President Bush to pass the biggest energy bill in the history of our country, the equivalent of taking millions of cars off the road by raising emission standards, the CAFE standards. He wanted nuclear. I want renewables. We came to a conclusion. We passed a big bill that was the basis for many of President Obama\u2019s initiatives to protect the environment and honor what we agreed to in Paris. \u2026\n\nSo the fact that the Green New Deal raises the profile of the issue, that\u2019s really important. But any proposal that someone has, has to come through the committee process. We see it for standards. What does it do in terms of public health, clean air, clean water? What does it do in terms of jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs? How does it keep America preeminent in the green technologies? What does it do in terms of our national security? And I think the generals came out again with a more-current statement of how the climate issue is a national security issue. \u2026 And it\u2019s a moral issue if you believe, as I do, that this is God\u2019s creation and we have a responsibility to be good stewards of it \u2014 and even if you don\u2019t share that view, if you just believe that we have a moral responsibility to future generations to preserve the planet or pass it on to the next generation in a responsible way. \u2026 So I\u2019ve just said if you have an idea, put it forth, we\u2019ll send it to committee. It will be subjected to that review. But know that we all share the value of preserving the planet.\n\nPelosi fixes her granddaughter Bella Kaufman's hair in the Speaker's Office in January. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n[Your daughter Alexandra] said in an interview: \u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing. And that should make you sleep at night, knowing that at least somebody in this town knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d I want to ask: How well do you sleep at night?\n\nIt depends on how much chocolate I have eaten during the day. Now today I gave up chocolate for lunch \u2014 I mean for Lent. [Laughs.] It really was more for lunch because I\u2019m off it already. I had a doughnut for breakfast. I totally forgot till I went to get the ashes that I wasn\u2019t supposed to have that chocolate doughnut for breakfast. Then, once I had the doughnut, I thought I might as well have the chocolate ice cream for lunch. Then my colleague came from Guam and brought chocolate chip cookies. What am I supposed to do? And out of kindness to my colleagues, to my staff and to my families, I don\u2019t think giving up chocolate for Lent is going to work.\n\nWell, that did not last long.\n\nIt didn\u2019t last long at all. \u2026 What keeps me up at night is the concern I have about the lack of respect for the Constitution, for our values, for our responsibilities and the rest that exists in the White House. And how can we, because you have so many issues, how do we stay focused and just make sure the public knows this isn\u2019t, again, about politics, it\u2019s about who we are as a nation. \u2026\n\nSo it\u2019s always about what keeps you up at night. The challenge and what are we going to do about it. And I have a pretty good feel for what we need to do, and, really, to be respectful of every point of view in our caucus. I consider myself a weaver. Like, every thread is important, and you have to just weave it all in. Every thread is important no matter how different \u2014 in fact, that\u2019s part of the strength of it. And that beautiful tapestry of what is the Democratic Party in Congress is strengthened by every different thread. So as I say to the members, and will close by saying to you: Our diversity is our strength, our unity is our power. We\u2019re about power.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed."

    ],
    "text": "For the first time in its history, the U.S. government is detaining more than 50,000 people it says are undocumented immigrants in jails and prisons around the country.\n\nAccording to a figure provided to Capitol Hill and made available to The Daily Beast, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has set an all-time record\u2013the latest in its string of broken records concerning immigrants detained\u2013is 50,049 people as of Wednesday, March 6. The figure includes both single adults and whole families behind bars. After initial publication of this piece, ICE confirmed the detentions figure.\n\nIt\u2019s an increase of approximately 2,000 people in the month-plus since Jan. 30, when ICE, it previously told The Daily Beast, was detaining 48,088 people. And it\u2019s just another 2,000 people shy of the 52,000-person daily detentions ICE is asking Congress to fund in its next budget.\n\nAsked what accounts for the increase, ICE spokeswoman Danielle Bennett said in a statement: \u201cICE makes custody determinations on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with U.S. law and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy, considering the merits and factors of each case while adhering to current agency priorities, guidelines and legal mandates. Ensuring there are sufficient beds available to meet the current demand for detention space is crucial to the success of ICE\u2019s overall mission.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear where ICE would have found the money for the increase. A year ago, when passing ICE\u2019s most recent budget, legislators explicitly instructed the interior-immigration agency to cap detentions at 40,520. Instead, by the summer ICE had surpassed that total, leading its Department of Homeland Security parent to raid its other accounts, including FEMA, to float ICE. A Senate appropriator\u2013the last sort of person an executive agency wishes to anger come budget season\u2013called ICE out for continuing a policy of \u201cmaximum cruelty.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress should absolutely not pay a single penny more to fuel the administration\u2019s agenda until there are clear and transparent explanations for what they\u2019re planning on doing with the money,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) told The Daily Beast in November.\n\nNevertheless, ICE continued breaking its detention records. It\u2019s now reached a record high, composed of people who spend months\u2013years, even\u2013locked away, navigating a cumbersome and unfamiliar legal process, sometimes separated from their children or their parents and siblings. In some cases, they are held in for-profit prisons where they work for far below minimum wages.\n\nICE has still yet to account for its funding for the detentions increase. Asked on Thursday by The Daily Beast, ICE pointed to a conference call with Deputy Director Matt Albence from Feb. 11. Albence at the time answered a question about where ICE found money for an 8,000-person detentions overage by saying it was \u201cstill coming out of our detention PPA [program, project or activity]. That\u2019s where we fund our detention beds. So, we are funding at levels where we are able to cover the bills that we currently have.\u201d\n\nAlbence said last month that the 52,000 detentions ICE seeks congressional funding for was \u201creally what we need to get the [job] done. We're managing as best as we can with the resources that we currently have, but there\u2019s certainly no shortage of work out there.\u201d\n\nImmigration advocates were unsurprised and no less horrified.\n\n\u201cTo see ICE jailing more than 50,000 immigrants each day\u2013it\u2019s a tragic milestone,\u201d said Heidi Altman, policy director of the National Immigrant Justice Center. \u201cThis mass deprivation of liberty and dignity is unnecessary and continues to play out in dangerous ways. Inside the jails people are enduring overcrowding, food consistently described as foul and meager in calories, solitary confinement as punishment for a misplaced word, and more. An expansion this quick and this reckless risks lives.\u201d\n\nICE did see an increase in detention funding as part of the deal to prevent a government shutdown. Democrats and Republicans kept the government open, immigration advocates warned, on the backs of immigrants thrown behind bars. The deal raised the upper boundary of people ICE was funded to hold\u2013but to 45,724. Even as legislators struck their deal, ICE had thousands more people than that under detention. It\u2019s now exceeded that cap even more.\n\nOne young woman, Yesica, told The Daily Beast that she fled her native El Salvador to escape MS-13, the brutal gang President Donald Trump frequently suggests are representative of central American migrants. After escaping a dire fate of violent persecution for her sexual identity, she described her for-profit ICE prison in Texas, where she works for as much as $3 per day, like this:\n\n\u201cThis is a really terrible place,\u201d Yesica, 23, said through a translator in December. \u201cIt\u2019s inhumane. It\u2019s like a torture chamber.\u201d"

    "text": "Nancy Gertner, a retired U.S. District Court judge in Massachusetts, is a lecturer at Harvard Law School.\n\nIt is not unusual for judges to intervene in court proceedings from time to time \u2014 to direct the lawyers to move the case along or to admonish them that evidence is repetitive. The judge's role is to act not as a \"mere moderator,\" as the Supreme Court noted in Herron v. Southern Pacific in 1931, but as the \"governor of the trial\" responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of all participants.\n\nThe performance of U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III in the trial of Paul Manafort on bank fraud and tax evasion charges has been decidedly unusual.\n\nDuring the trial, Ellis intervened regularly, and mainly against one side: the prosecution. The judge's interruptions occurred in the presence of the jury and on matters of substance, not courtroom conduct. He disparaged the prosecution's evidence, misstated its legal theories, even implied that prosecutors had disobeyed his orders when they had not.\n\nUnder the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges, a judge is supposed to be fair and impartial, as well as \"patient, dignified, respectful and courteous\" to those in his courtroom. The rule's concern is as much about the appearance of justice as its reality. If the judge violates that rule and a defendant is convicted, there may be a trial remedy \u2014 an appeal.\n\nBut there will be no appeal available to address Ellis's anti-prosecution bias if Manafort is acquitted by the jurors, who began deliberating on Thursday. The prohibition against double jeopardy precludes it. And if President Trump's former campaign chairman is convicted despite Ellis's interventions, the judge's hostility toward the prosecution will have been irrelevant.\n\nFor now, we have only the extraordinary evidence of Ellis's conduct during the 12-day trial. The judge continually interrupted the prosecution's questioning of witnesses, prompting lead prosecutor Greg Andres to pointedly note: \"Your honor stops us and asks us to move on.\" Ellis pressed the prosecution to rush through testimony about important financial documents. He made critical comments about prosecution evidence and strategy \u2014 all in front of the jury.\n\nEllis also questioned the relevance of Manafort's work as a political consultant for Russian-backed politicians in Ukraine, for which he was paid tens of millions of dollars from 2010 to 2014. But if Manafort didn't disclose some payments because he was not registered in the United States as a foreign agent, it would provide a motive to hide the amounts from the U.S. government \u2014 just what the trial was about. Ellis chided prosecutors for eliciting testimony about Manafort's lavish lifestyle, but that kind of testimony is also a classic element in a tax-evasion case. That your cars, boats, condos and clothing suggest you made much more income than you reported would surely be relevant.\n\nAfter prosecutor Uzo Asonye questioned a bank employee about Manafort's failed attempt to obtain a $5.5 million construction loan on a Brooklyn brownstone, the judge \u2014 unprompted by a defense objection \u2014 declared: \"You might want to spend time on a loan that was granted.\" The comment strongly implied to jurors that the prosecution was wasting their time. But an attempt to defraud was part of the conspiracy count in the indictment; false representation to secure a loan, successful or not, is itself a crime.\n\nDespite appearances, Ellis doesn't think he is infallible. He admitted on Aug. 9, \"I may have made a mistake\" the day before when he berated prosecutors for allowing the government's tax expert witness to sit in the courtroom during other testimony. Earlier in the trial, prosecutors had explicitly sought and obtained Ellis's permission for the tax expert to be present while other witnesses testified.\n\nThe Manafort trial is the most prominent case to emerge so far from the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. Clearly worried about its outcome, prosecutors went so far as to urge Ellis to tell the jury, in his instructions before they began deliberating, not to let his commentary affect their decision-making. Ellis essentially did just that on Wednesday.\n\nIt may well have been too little too late. The potential for judges to influence juries is so great that courts often caution jurors against reading too much into a judge's subtle nonverbal behaviors, a nod of the head, a smile or a frown. Jurors do it anyway. Legal scholars study whether judges' conduct on the bench influences juries \u2014 and reliably find that it does. The research typically concerns a judge's anti-defendant bias. Defendants have all the protections of a trial \u2014 the high standard of proof, the presumption of innocence, the evidentiary rules designed to protect them. What will be the impact of Ellis's anti-government bias, which was not nonverbal and hardly subtle? Hard to tell. We know next to nothing about this jury. Seeking to expedite matters, Ellis impaneled the Manafort jury in a single day."

    "text": "20.1k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThe President\u2019s convicted former personal lawyer just sued the Trump Organization for almost $4 million dollars in legal fees, costs, and fines associated with his criminal conviction and cooperation agreement.\n\nMichael Cohen\u2019s lawsuit in New York Supreme Court (embedded below) just revealed that Donald Trump\u2019s sons gave him a contract where they indemnified the company\u2019s former executive after he departed to become the President\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nShockingly, that means the Trump family will be stuck on the hook paying for Cohen\u2019s top flight legal counsel who negotiated his cooperation agreements and continues to help him testify against the President to Congress.\n\nMichael Cohen is seeking at least $3.8 million dollars in reimbursement for fines, legal fees, and forfeitures, as well as pre-judgment interest and his attorney fees to sue for repayment. The lawsuit alleges:\n\nIn or around July 2017, the Trump Organization entered into an agreement with Mr. Cohen under which the Trump Organization agreed to indemnify Mr. Cohen and, separately, to pay for his attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in connection with Mr. Cohen\u2019s representation and defense in the Investigations and other matters. In or around June 2018, the Trump Organization ceased to pay McDermott\u2019s invoices, without notice or justification.\n\nAn indemnity agreement is typically an open-ended promise to pay, which Cohen says covers all of his legal fees and losses incurred for activities connected to the company.\n\nBut those in the know recognize that there is obvious strategic value to the case beyond getting paid.\n\nCohen can take discovery of the Trump Organization to try to prove that he did significant work for them, identify what work he did, and prove that the work was at their direction, in order to prove that he\u2019s owed what he claims.\n\nThat also means the documents evidencing what the Trump Organization told him to do may become public record.\n\nIronically, the Trump Organization\u2019s sudden refusal to make good on their written agreement is what Michael Cohen says led directly to his fateful decision to cooperate with federal prosecutors, according to the complaint:\n\nAs a result of the Trump Organization\u2019s wrongful refusal to pay McDermott\u2019s invoices under the indemnification agreement, McDermott ultimately withdrew from its representation of Mr. Cohen. McDermott\u2019s withdrawal prejudiced Mr. Cohen\u2019s ability to respond to the Mueller investigation, the SDNY Investigation, and other matters.\n\nMichael Cohen\u2019s plea deal last September became the first concrete evidence that the President had committed a crime to get into office, and that he will probably face charges when he leaves the White House.\n\nThe filing from Cohen\u2019s newest pair of law firms laid out the expenses he believes he\u2019s owed under the deal, which should be enough to send the notoriously parsimonious President\u2019s blood pressure skyrocketing. They wrote:\n\nAs of January 25, 2019, the amount of Mr. Cohen\u2019s unpaid legal fees and costs in connection with the Matters was approximately $1.9 million. In addition, Mr. Cohen has been ordered to pay or forfeit an additional approximately $1.9 million as part of his criminal sentence arising from conduct undertaken by Mr. Cohen in furtherance of and at the behest of the Trump Organization and its principals, directors, and officers. All of these amounts were subject to the Trump Organization\u2019s indemnification agreement.\n\nToday\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump Organization details Michael Cohen\u2019s involvement in eleven (!) different investigations, ranging from four separate House and Senate committee probes, to Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation, to civil cases stemming from the incriminating hush money payments he made to Donald Trump\u2019s lovers, and to the New York state investigation of the now-dissolved Trump Foundation.\n\nCohen had to hire four different law firms just to keep up with the dizzying number of investigations after his primary criminal defense counsel withdrew from the case.\n\nHis lawyers also noted that the Trump 2020 Campaign picked up some of Cohen\u2019s legal fees, which might upset the President\u2019s small donors when they learn what they\u2019ve \u201cbought.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump is so cheap that he once cashed a 13 cent check sent to him as a gag, and this would not be the first time that his refusal to pay anyone for anything came back to haunt him.\n\nNow, it looks like Trump\u2019s pennywise refusal to keep defending his fixer for the crimes he directed is about to cost him millions to uphold his company\u2019s obligation to pay the legal costs and fines for his former lawyer to keep burning him in court and Congress.\n\nMaybe his Republican allies in Congress will rethink their strategy of trying to heap additional criminal charges on to Michael Cohen since there\u2019s a good chance that all they\u2019re accomplishing is adding even more to the President\u2019s mounting legal bills.\n\nHere\u2019s a copy of Michael Cohen\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump Organization:\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    ],
    "text": "(CNN) Even as the 2020 race begins in earnest, President Donald Trump is already suggesting that Democrats cannot beat him fairly -- raising the specter that if he loses next November, he will suggest that the election was not legitimate.\n\n\"The Democrats in Congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see,\" Trump tweeted Tuesday , referring to House Democrats' launching of a broad-scale investigation into him . \"When the Republicans had the Majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! The Dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win!\"\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nTrump 2020 campaign press secretary Kayleigh McEnany echoed that sentiment in a statement on the Democratic investigations. \"These desperate Democrats know they cannot beat President Trump in 2020, so instead they have embarked on a disgraceful witch hunt with one singular aim: topple the will of the American people and seize the power that they have zero chance at winning legitimately,\" she said\n\nAnd asked Wednesday about the Democratic investigations, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said this: \"They continue to be a group totally taken by small radical leftist fringe of their party and they're completely controlled by it, they know that's not enough to beat this President so they're going to look for other ways to do that.\"\n\nAll of that rhetoric fits into a very clear pattern: Convince the Trump base that it is not possible for him to lose a fair and legitimate election in 2020. Thus, if he loses, it must be, by definition, illegitimate.\n\nNone of this should be surprising, given Trump's oft-stated view of the 2016 election -- in which he won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.\n\nLess than three weeks after winning the White House in 2016, Trump sent out this tweet: \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\"\n\nIn a meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers just days after his inauguration, Trump was at it again -- reportedly telling the gathering that somewhere between 3 and 5 million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election and, had only legitimate votes been cast, he would have won the popular vote in addition to the Electoral College.\n\nNeither Trump nor anyone in his administration has ever provided any evidence of his claims of widespread illegality. A commission formed by Trump -- and chaired by failed Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach -- was disbanded after less than a year . And study after study has shown that widespread voter fraud -- of the sort alleged by Trump -- simply does not exist\n\nOf course, Trump is less interested in the facts about voter fraud -- or lack thereof -- than he is about convincing his base that if he loses, it's not because he got less votes, it's because something nefarious is being perpetrated against him by the elites.\n\nHow do I know? Because Trump was doing it in the 2016 election -- before he knew he actually won.\n\n\"It's largely a rigged system. And you see it at the polling booths, too. There are reports that when people vote for Republicans the entire ticket switches over to Democrats. You've seen that. It's happening at various places today. It's been reported. In other words, the machines, you put down a Republican and it registers as a Democrat. They've had a lot of complaints about that today.\"\n\nSo, yeah.\n\nThis is straight from the Trump blueprint -- and not just in politics, either. In his past life as a businessman, Trump would regularly declare victory on a deal loudly and publicly -- even when the facts didn't bear out his bluster. Hell, he somehow spun three bankruptcies as wins for him!\n\nIt's not just that Trump doesn't like losing. (No one likes losing.) It's that he is unwilling to accept any sort of loss for fear that defeat might take some of the shine off of his all-I-do-is-win persona.\n\nIn the business world, that approach was mostly harmless. Trump could say whatever he wanted but, at the end of the day, it was pretty clear who won and who lost a deal. Money, usually, changed hands. And while lots of people Trump dealt with rolled their eyes about his massive exaggerations, they usually just ignored them.\n\nIn politics, Trump's inability to accept that he could lose fair and square is far, far more dangerous.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's former longtime fixer, said as much during his congressional testimony in front of the House Oversight Committee last month. \"Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, that there will never be a peaceful transition of power,\" said Cohen\n\nSit with that for a minute. And realize what it would mean if the sitting incumbent President of the United States simply refuses to concede he has lost in 2020."

    "text": "The appalling separation of children from their families at the US-Mexico border stems from policy decisions made in spring 2018 by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, whereby all undocumented immigrants are referred to the DOJ for immediate criminal prosecution and deportation. As a result, nearly 3,000 children were separated from their parents by DHS, though thousands more may have separated during an influx that started in 2017, before the court required tracking. Due to a lack of coordinated formal tracking system, the total number of children separated from their parents is \u201cunknown.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Trump administration have publicly admitted that the barbaric family separation policy was meant to deter undocumented families trying to escape violence in their home countries. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s oversight of this egregious human rights violation, combined with her lies to Congress and the American public about the family separation policy make her utterly unfit for her role. Congress must call on Nielsen to resign immediately."

    "text": "Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has himself a problem. Several of them, actually, all stemming from the same source. Somewhere along the line, and for reasons known only to himself, he grabbed a roll of industrial strength duct tape and strapped himself to the keel of the USS Donald Trump. That boat is now charging hard for stormy seas, and Mitch may soon find himself sinking fast once the green water starts shipping over the bow.\n\nRand Paul, the other Republican senator from Kentucky, announced on Sunday that he would vote in favor of a bill to quash Trump\u2019s contra-constitutional emergency declaration. The bill has already been passed by the House with 13 Republicans joining every Democrat, and Paul\u2019s \u201cYes\u201d marks the fourth and most vital Senate Republican vote on the measure. Now that he has joined with Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), the bill is sure to pass that chamber unless one of them changes their mind or a Democrat goes rogue.\n\nEven that possibility may not kill the bill, according to Paul. \u201cBy my count,\u201d he told reporters on Monday, \u201cI\u2019ve had at least 10 people coming up to me saying they will vote to disapprove on this.\u201d One assumes he means \u201cRepublicans\u201d when he says \u201cpeople,\u201d but you can never be sure. That\u2019s a pretty cozy margin right there, if it\u2019s true, which it very well may be. We have seen numerous instances of senators suddenly locating their integrity when a bill\u2019s outcome is already determined, for good or ill. The most famous recent example of this \u201cBe right there!\u201d phenomenon came after deceased Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) killed Trump\u2019s anti-Obamacare bill with a dramatic thumbs-down. Immediately afterward, McCain had himself some company.\n\nEven if no other Republicans join them, \u201cYes\u201d votes from these four political apostates guarantees the bill will be delivered to Trump for his Richter Scale signature or veto. It is widely assumed the president will issue the first veto of his administration and kick the bill back to Congress. At present, it does not appear that he gives a damn one way or another. \u201cAt least for now,\u201d reports Politico, \u201cTrump is doing little to try and dissuade the approximately dozen Republican senators who are considering voting to block his national emergency declaration on the southern border.\u201d This, of course, can change as fast as Trump can open Twitter on his phone.\n\nImagine the consternation bleeding from the walls in McConnell\u2019s D.C. office. The House is now controlled by Democrats who will spend the next two years clobbering him with hot-button votes on climate change, gun violence, health care, child care, and of course, this emergency declaration. Some 20 GOP senators will be running for re-election in 2020 to the Democrats\u2019 12, with two Republicans \u2014 Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Pat Roberts of Kansas \u2014 heading for the exits. All the candidates will have to run on how they vote on these popular issues, and if they continue to stick with Trump, it will be hard slogging all around.\n\nMcConnell has enough on his plate maintaining his party\u2019s slim majority without having to tend to his own electoral fate, which is also shaping up to be a perilous full-time job. The majority leader is himself up for re-election in 2020, and his approval rating in Kentucky stands at a grim 38 percent with a 47 percent disapproval rate. Trump, by contrast, has an approval rating of 53 percent in McConnell\u2019s home state. Rand Paul, McConnell\u2019s colleague, polls at 43 percent approval back home. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) is actively recruiting candidates to run against McConnell next year, among them a female fighter pilot named Amy McGrath who flew multiple combat missions over Afghanistan.\n\nIt\u2019s a whole barrel of pickles for Mitch, who amply deserves all the trouble that can find him. On one side stands Donald Trump and his emergency declaration, which several members of his own party are apparently about to publicly denounce. The most vocal critic of the declaration is Rand Paul, McConnell\u2019s senatorial partner from Kentucky. McConnell will need active help from both Trump and Paul to keep his seat. By law, he cannot dodge this national emergency vote and spare himself the agony.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s path is already fraught with multiple perils, and the fight over the probably inevitable veto is still to come. Overriding a presidential veto in the Senate requires 67 votes; the Democrats have 47 in hand and need 20 more to make the nut, and with as many as 12 senators possibly breaking ranks on the declaration vote, the possibility of actually collecting the necessary 67 override votes, while slim, is no longer in the realm of the absurd. Hovering over it all is the dim view a large majority of voters in his home state have of Mitch already.\n\nWe may be bearing witness to Mitch McConnell\u2019s last stand. Win or lose, he has no one but himself to blame. Integrity counts, and the hole left in its absence is large enough for even the biggest man to fall into. Look out below, Mitch.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Truthout. May not be reprinted without permission."

Kelley, who taught marketing at Wharton for 31 years and had Trump in his classroom, said, \u201cDonald Trump was the dumbest goddamn student I ever had,\u201d in a conversation with his close friend Frank DiPrima.\n\nKelley made the comment while Trump was already a public figure, but had not yet ventured into politics.\n\nThe professor \u201coften referred to Trump\u2019s arrogance when he told of this\u2014that Trump came to Wharton thinking he already knew everything.\u201d The parallels between this student and the 71-year-old man currently sitting in the Oval Office, who only this week challenged his own Secretary of State to an IQ test, are striking.\n\nTillerson, for his part, had reportedly called Trump a \u201cmoron.\u201d\n\nUnlike the current President, Professor Kelley was no moron. Per Mr. DiPrima, \u201cBill Kelley was one smart cookie. His text book cited above [Marketing Intelligence \u2014 The Management of Marketing Information (originally published by P. Staples, London, 1968)] \u2014 published in the late 1960s \u2014 was standard in his time in the then-new field of \u2018marketing intelligence\u2019 and the necessity of using computers and data bases to manage it.\u201d\n\nIt seems that our know-it-all President hasn\u2019t changed much in the last 50 years. Neither, though, has the late Professor Kelley\u2019s assessment of him.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!"

    "text": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Monday that the Justice Department will begin prosecuting every person who illegally crosses into the United States along the Southwest border, a hard-line policy shift focusing in particular on migrants traveling with children.\n\nIn separate speeches \u2014 one in Scottsdale, Ariz., the other in San Diego \u2014 Sessions said the Department of Homeland Security will begin referring such cases to the Justice Department for prosecution. Federal prosecutors will \u201ctake on as many of those cases as humanly possible until we get to 100 percent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you cross the border unlawfully . . . then we will prosecute you,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIf you smuggle an illegal alien across the border, then we\u2019ll prosecute you. . . . If you\u2019re smuggling a child, then we\u2019re going to prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you, probably, as required by law. If you don\u2019t want your child separated, then don\u2019t bring them across the border illegally. It\u2019s not our fault that somebody does that.\u201d\n\n[Top Homeland Security officials urge criminal prosecution of parents who cross border with children]\n\nDHS officials say they have seen a significant increase in illegal border crossings over the past year, including a rise in the number of families and unaccompanied children. In the past month, Border Patrol officers say they have encountered more than 50,000 immigrants trying to enter the United States. From April 2017 to April 2018, the number of apprehensions and \u201cinadmissible\u201d border crossings tripled, according to DHS.\n\nAdvocates for migrants have said most are fleeing violence in Central America and should be treated as asylum seekers, not criminals. The American Civil Liberties Union has already filed a federal lawsuit in California over past separations.\n\n\n\nA 4-year-old boy weeps in the arms of a family member after he and others were apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents upon crossing illegally near McAllen, Tex., on May 2. (Adrees Latif/Reuters)\n\nSessions indicated that while he has \u201cno doubt\u201d people illegally crossing the border are fleeing danger or despair, \u201cWe cannot take everyone on this planet who is in a difficult situation.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D), who has battled the Trump administration in court, signaled that he was following the issue closely.\n\n\u201cAs a father, the last thing I would do is separate fathers and mothers from their children and I would hope the federal government thinks twice about doing this,\u201d Becerra said. \u201cThere are constitutional protections we can look to.\u201d\n\nIn San Diego, Sessions was interrupted by a heckler with a megaphone.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want you in our state,\u201d the man yelled. \u201cAre you going to be separating families? Is that why you\u2019re here? Why are you doing this? Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul? Why do you work for this administration?\u201d\n\n\n\nA Border Patrol agent looks out over Tijuana, Mexico. (Gregory Bull/AP)\n\nSenior immigration and border officials called for the increased prosecutions last month in a confidential memo to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. They said filing criminal charges against migrants, including parents traveling with children, would be the \u201cmost effective\u201d way to tamp down on illegal border crossings.\n\nThe \u201czero-tolerance\u201d measure announced Monday could split up thousands of families because children are not allowed in criminal jails. Until now, most families apprehended crossing the border illegally have been released to await civil deportation hearings.\n\nThe Trump administration piloted this approach in the Border Patrol\u2019s El Paso sector, which includes New Mexico, between July and November 2017, and said the number of families attempting to cross illegally plunged by 64 percent.\n\nThe New York Times reported last month that hundreds of children have been taken from their parents at the border since October.\n\nNielsen told lawmakers in April that DHS aims to keep families together \u201cas long as operationally possible.\u201d She said families are separated to \u201cprotect the children\u201d in case the adults traveling with them are not really their parents.\n\n[While eyes are on Russia, Sessions dramatically reshapes the Justice Department]\n\nSessions, who as attorney general has been especially aggressive on immigration, said that to carry out the new enforcement policies, he was sending 35 prosecutors to the Southwest and 18 immigration judges to the border to handle asylum claims. Those moves were announced last week.\n\nCriminal prosecutions at the border have soared over the past two decades, from fewer than 10,000 cases in 1996 to more than 90,000 at their peak in 2013 under former president Barack Obama, according to TRAC, a Syracuse University organization that tracks criminal immigration prosecutions. Last fiscal year, the number of immigration prosecutions declined 14 percent, to nearly 60,000.\n\nThe most common criminal charge is \u201cimproper entry by alien\u201d \u2014 or illegal entry. First-time offenders usually face a federal misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in prison or fines. Repeat offenders can be imprisoned for up to two years and fined, or charged with the more serious offense of \u201cillegal reentry.\u201d\n\nAfter President Trump called last month for renewed efforts to reduce illegal border crossings, Sessions ordered U.S. attorneys on the border to prosecute migrants \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d His remarks Monday appeared to signal that federal prosecutors will make this a higher priority.\n\n\u201cEleven million people are already here illegally,\u201d Sessions said in his speech. \u201cThat\u2019s more than the population of the state of Georgia. . . . We\u2019re not going to stand for this. We are not going to let this country be invaded. We will not be stampeded. We will not capitulate to lawlessness.\u201d"

Both issues warrant immediate attention because they pose substantial risks to children receiving care at this facility. We continue to follow these issues and look forward to receiving information on the corrective actions ACF has taken.\"\n\n\"Both issues warrant immediate attention because they pose substantial risks to children receiving care at this facility,\" Williams said.\n\nACF stands for the Administration for Children and Families, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, is part of ACF.\n\nThe memo said the inspector general had since learned that ORR was working with the facility to remedy the fingerprint check issue. It was unclear how many employees had since undergone the fingerprint checks.\n\nThe memo also said the inspector general had learned that the former director of ORR had signed off on waiving requirements for child abuse and neglect checks for incoming staff at Tornillo in a memorandum in June, two days before the facility began operating.\n\nThe memo said the inspector general also found that, as of Sept. 25, BCFS Health and Human Services, the nonprofit contracted to run the facility, was not conducting FBI fingerprint checks on its staff.\n\nIt also found that ORR was not aware that the fingerprint checks were not being done, the memo said, citing discussions with agency staff and senior management at the Tornillo facility.\n\nThe memo said that in later communications, the inspector general learned that ORR was working with BCFS to secure completing the fingerprint checks for staff.\n\nHHS \u2014 which blamed \"a broken immigration system\" that encourages children to make the dangerous journey to the United States \u2014 told NBC News on Tuesday night that it began working with BCFS to resolve the issues in September.\n\nIt said that Tornillo now has enough clinicians to provide emergency mental health services and that when a child is found to have a mental health need that cannot be met at the facility, the child is transferred to a \"more appropriate facility.\"\n\n\"In fact, a mental health clinician visits each child every day,\" the agency said.\n\nBCFS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Krista Piferrer, a spokeswoman, told the AP that the company was checking job candidates' criminal histories and running sex offender registry checks.\n\n\"Those are pretty comprehensive,\" Piferrer said. \"Standing up the site, it's no easy feat, but we know what right looks like.\"\n\nORR's reasoning for the waiver was that the agency was under urgent pressure to open the camp quickly and that the state might not be willing or able to perform those child abuse and neglect checks for a detention facility under federal jurisdiction, the memo said.\n\nThe agency also justified its waiver on the assumption that Tornillo staff had already undergone FBI fingerprint background checks, according to the memo. But that is not the case, the inspector general said.\n\nThe facility has undergone a recent expansion since the administration first announced that it was opening the temporary shelter for a couple of hundred migrant children six months ago.\n\nThe camp was first designed to temporarily house about 450 children in June, when President Donald Trump's zero-tolerance policy separated over 2,500 migrant children from their parents. The majority of them have since been reunited, but HHS still oversees the care of migrant children and adolescents who come to the United States alone.\n\nThe inspector general's office requested in its memo that the Administration for Children and Families provide a written response on the actions being taken to ensure that Tornillo facility's employees are getting the required FBI background checks and that insufficient staffing of clinicians was being addressed within 30 days.\n\nVice News reported earlier Tuesday that workers at Tornillo had not received the mandated FBI fingerprint checks.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson told Vice that BCFS Health and Human Services was responsible for making sure the fingerprint checks were being conducted. But the company said it has been unable to do the checks because of a technicality in how it accesses the FBI databases, according to Vice."

    "text": "At the same Feb. 21 hearing, the judge warned him: \"Today, I gave you a second chance. This is not baseball, you don't get a third chance.\"\n\nIf Jackson finds that Stone, who is currently free on a $250,000 signature bond, violated that order, she could have him jailed without bail pending his trial on charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing justice.\n\nStone on Sunday deleted the \"Who framed Roger Stone\" image from a series of other rotating images on his Instagram story shortly after CNBC sent an email to his lawyer asking about it.\n\nThe other images suggested that people donate to Stone's legal defense fund, with one saying, \"I am committed to proving my innocence. But I need your help,\" and another saying, \"I've always had Trump's back. Will you have mine?\"\n\n\"We note for the Court that according to public reporting, on March 3, 2019, the defendant's Instagram account shared an image with the title 'who framed Roger Stone.' A copy of the image is submitted under seal as Exhibit C,\" Mueller said in the court filing in federal court in Washington, D.C.\n\nCNBC's story on the image is referenced in a footnote in that filing.\n\nStone posted the \"Framed\" Instagram image two days after Jackson ordered his defense lawyers to explain why they did not tell her about the planned publication of a book by Stone that could violate her gag order. The book is entitled \"The Myth of Russian Collusion: The Inside Story of How Trump Really Won.\"\n\nJackson's gag order prohibits Stone from \"making statements to the media or in public settings about the Special Counsel's investigation or this case or any of the participants in the investigation or the case.\"\n\nThe gag covers \"posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other form of social media,\" as well as other forms of communication.\n\nIn his new book, The Washington Post reported Monday, Stone writes: \"I now find myself on Crooked Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's hit list because I have advised Donald Trump for the past forty years. I am being targeted not because I committed a crime, but because the Deep State liberals want to silence me and pressure me to testify against my good friend.\"\n\nMueller's spokesman, who had declined to comment to CNBC on Stone's post Sunday, declined to comment Monday on the special counsel's filing Monday.\n\nStone's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEarlier Monday, Stone's attorneys told Jackson in a filing that they believed his new book, which has an updated introduction discussing his case, should be allowed to be published because it was written and edited before the judge issued her gag order.\n\nHis attorneys write that Stone's publication of the book \"should not be viewed as contravening the Court's prohibitions because these prohibitions were not extant and could not have been known prior to February 21, 2019.\"\n\nBut Mueller's filing afterward noted that, \"A preview of the defendant's book, including the updated Introduction referenced in the defendant's Motion to Clarify, is currently publicly available on Amazon.com and Google Books.\"\n\nStone was arrested in January. He has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nMueller claims Stone lied to Congress about his alleged effort to get the document collection group WikiLeaks to release emails hacked by Russian agents from Democrats, including Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nStone is alleged to have been in contact with top-ranking Trump campaign officials about efforts to leak damaging information about Clinton.\n\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Kevin Breuninger"

    "text": "37.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nPresident Trump is a man painfully, embarrassingly desperate for attention and accolades. This is, after all, the man who had a fake Time magazine cover of himself made and hung on the walls of several of his own golf clubs. He is deeply aware of his own inadequacies and craves exterior validation to prop himself up.\n\nTrump\u2019s lack of presidential accomplishments has prevented him from receiving any kind of substantive international recognition so far. There have been rumblings that Trump is angling for a Nobel Peace Prize over his North Korea negotiations, but that seems unlikely given the humiliating fashion in which the talks broke down at the summit this week.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee which awards the much-coveted prize keeps the identities of those being considered for the honor under wraps. But on Tuesday, the organization deviated from their time-honored protocol for a very odd reason. The New York Times reports that the committee announced on Tuesday that they\u2019ve discovered a forged Nobel Prize nomination for Donald Trump. The issue has been referred to authorities in Oslo, Norway for further investigation.\n\nTo make matters even stranger, this is the second of two forged attempts. Henrik Pryser Libell writes in The Times:\n\n\u201cMoreover, the forgery appears to have occurred twice: Olav Njolstad, the secretary of the five-member committee, said it appeared that a forged nomination of Mr. Trump for the prize was also submitted last year \u2014 and was also referred to the police. (The earlier forgery was not disclosed to the public at the time.)\u201d\n\nInspector Rune Skjold, the man in charge of the Oslo police\u2019s economic crimes division, revealed that investigators have been cooperating with the F.B.I since last fall, which seems to imply that the forgeries were created and sent from the United States. Skjold also revealed that authorities suspect the same person is behind both attempted fake nominations.\n\nOlav Njolstad refused to give too many details about the forgeries or investigation, but he did seem to indicate that the person whose name was forged on the documents \u2014 that is to say an individual eligible to submit nominations for the prize\u2014 was contacted and confirmed that he/she did not submit the documents nominating Donald Trump.\n\nThe New York Times further explains that the forged name could belong to anyone from a head of state, to an individual lawmaker or cabinet minister, to a respected university professor or a prominent member of any number of prestigious international organizations.\n\nOne of the forgeries has already undergone extensive forensic examination and the second is slated to undergo the same. While it\u2019s as yet unclear who\u2019s behind this pathetic attempt to snag a Nobel Peace Prize for the worst president in American history, it seems likely that the full truth will eventually emerge.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "Photo: Win McNamee (Getty Images)\n\nOn Tuesday, seven prominent CEOs and leaders of pharmaceutical companies appeared before the Senate Finance Committee at a congressional hearing called to address the industry\u2019s relentless raising of drug prices.\n\n\n\nPredictably, the CEOs from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi, AbbVie, and AstraZeneca collectively passed the buck, mostly blaming everyone else for the U.S.\u2019s astronomically high drug prices and predicting doom if any major pricing reforms became reality. Here were some of their most absurd talking points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Higher Prices Aren\u2019t Really Their Fault\n\nA common refrain by the industry is that it\u2019s been forced to jack up the list price of drugs due to pharmacy benefit managers (PBM), third-party programs that negotiate down prescription drug prices for customers through rebates they obtain from the company. PBMs, CEOs argued during the hearing, are siphoning an ever-larger share of the savings for themselves. They also called for an end to the third-party rebate system in private and public health plans entirely.\n\n\u201cThe government has to get up and change the rules. And those rebates have to go,\u201d said AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnscrupulous PBMs do share some blame for escalating costs, and lawmakers have proposed bills that would weaken or eliminate them. But they don\u2019t negotiate rebates for all drugs, and collectively, they only take in a small amount of the total money generated by prescription drugs annually\u2014just 4 percent ($23 billion) of $480 billion in 2016, according to an analysis. The drug companies themselves, by the way, take in two-thirds of that total in net revenue, according to that same analysis\u2014a sum of $323 billion in 2016.\n\nAs committee co-chair Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) noted during the hearing, the companies themselves have the final word in setting prices.\n\n\u201cThe central argument, basically, from Pharma is: \u2018The fault is always somebody\u2019s else,\u2019\u201d said Wyden during his opening statement. \u201cIt is long past time to drop the excuses and take concrete actions to make medicine more affordable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Modern Medicine Will Die Off If We Try To Cut Into Their Profits\n\nIn one of the most telling moments of the hearing, the executives were asked by Pat Roberts (R-Kansas) what exactly kept them up at night.\n\nWhile many took the time to wax poetic about doing right by patients, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier couldn\u2019t resist a little doomsaying. Among the things that kept him up, he said, was the fear that \u201coutrageous solutions\u201d to lowering drug costs demanded by the public would create a future where no new medical breakthroughs could happen again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese outrageous solutions, the CEOs made clear throughout the hearing, included even meager proposals to bring the U.S. a bit closer to its peers in controlling drug prices. The industry, for instance, has aggressively lobbied against a proposal widely praised by policy experts that would set the price of existing drugs under Medicare Part B, which covers drugs given for in-patient, hospital care, to an international price index. Giovanni Caforio, CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, criticized the idea during the hearing, while others like Olivier Brandicourt, CEO of Sanofi, went on the record as being against any direct control of costs by the government.\n\n\u201cThe government should not directly control the price of medicines either through federal government price controls or worse, outsourcing price decision to other countries,\u201d said Brandicourt.\n\nYet when Wyden asked AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez if AbbVie was still profitable in places with strict price controls such as Germany, Gonzalez was forced to admit that they are indeed profitable in every industrialized country. Gonzalez then tried to argue that if the U.S. ever did get drug prices to those levels, the company\u2019s investment in R&D would be lower; Wyden countered correctly that AbbVie\u2019s U.S. revenue alone is higher than what it spends in research globally annually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. It\u2019s Medicare\u2019s Fault That Patients Pay So Much For Drugs\n\nThe CEOs\u2019 attempts to spin reality were often baffling, but none so much as when they pointed the finger at Medicare; they even (inadvertently) helped make the case for Medicare for All.\n\nRepeatedly, the CEOs took aim at Medicare Part D for the high prices paid by patients, since its model requires patients on average to cover 13 percent of their drug costs out-of-pocket, as opposed to 3 percent of hospital costs. Many, like Jennifer Taubert, the executive vice president and worldwide chairman of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s pharma division, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, called for a hard limit on out-of-pocket costs that can be paid by Medicare patients, or for the government to make it easier for companies to offer rebates directly to these patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile Medicare Part D is working for many seniors and has been effective in containing costs, we believe an out-of-pocket cap in Medicare Part D is a needed protection,\u201d Taubert said in her opening statement.\n\nMedicare plans should absolutely cover a greater percentage of drug costs, and it\u2019s an idea that\u2019s begun to receive some support in Congress. But it\u2019s also plainly true that if a drug\u2019s list price set by a company was lowered, out-of-pocket costs for that drug would drop too, no matter how big the slice of the pie currently paid by the government or private insurer is. The lack of an out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D is a flaw that\u2019s been worsened by ever-rising list prices, but it\u2019s not responsible for the pricing crisis.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that growing deductibles, co-payments, and other forms of cost-sharing have helped increase the out-of-pocket costs people have to pay alongside higher drug prices. But advocates of a single-payer system often argue that their plan\u2014by cutting out the private insurance industry from essential health coverage, greatly reducing administrative costs, and giving the government the ability to broadly drive down drug prices as other countries do\u2014would save the average American money while still being able to reduce or completely end cost-sharing (and obviously providing coverage to millions more people). And more than one study, from both conservative- and progressive-leaning sources, has suggested they\u2019re completely right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, if Big Pharma is really upset that Medicare patients are being forced to pay more out-of-pocket money for their drugs, they should go ahead and endorse Medicare for All. But something tells me that they won\u2019t."

Tony Evers (D) issued an executive order Monday withdrawing more than 110 soldiers and airmen of the Wisconsin National Guard from Arizona\u2019s southern border.\n\n\u201cThere is simply not ample evidence to support the president\u2019s contention that there exists a national security crisis at our southwestern border,\u201d Evers said in a statement, referring to President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S. is facing an immigration emergency:\n\nThere is simply not ample evidence to support the president\u2019s contention of a national security crisis at our southwestern border.

In his executive order this week, Evers said that he revoked consent for this deployment and called for all 112 Wisconsin National Guard to be \u201cpromptly\u201d pulled off their current missions at the border.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Wisconsin were quick to lambaste Evers\u2019 decision. Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, called the governor\u2019s move \u201cunfortunate.\u201d Scott Fitzgerald, the majority leader of the state Senate, accused Evers of \u201cplaying politics instead of working to keep Wisconsin safe.\u201d\n\n27 PHOTOS US troops sent to border by Trump in anticipation of migrant caravans See Gallery US troops sent to border by Trump in anticipation of migrant caravans Members of the U.S.military place razor wire along the U.S.-Mexico border on the McAllen-Hidalgo International Bridge, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in McAllen, Texas.

He exhibited the same tendency for ridiculing the looks of others that he demonstrated when he callously mocked a disabled reporter at a campaign rally by holding his hands over his eyes to mimic the eyeglasses of President Xi\u2019s aides.\n\nWith his circled fingers over his eyes, it was difficult to tell if he was also squinting while gesturing, a not unimaginable possibility from a president not known for his sensitivity to violating norms of offensive racial stereotypes.\n\nTrump told governors today that Xi Jinping's aides are \"central casting \u2013 glasses, pad.\" This is what he did upon saying \"glasses.\" pic.twitter.com/Mry8m7qomD \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) February 25, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s obsession with stereotypes \u2014 referenced in his mention of \u201ccentral casting\u201d \u2014 only highlights how far from the norm of presidential behavior his conduct and demeanor has strayed. If American presidents were chosen by central casting rather than a skewed electoral college, Trump would have never made it past the first audition. The Republican party couldn\u2019t have done worse if they had simply called a prominent casting director to pick someone to act as their nominee in 2016.\n\nThis is the man who is now jetting off to negotiate a denuclearization deal with the leader of North Korea.

We will bring Bob Mueller in to testify before Congress. We will take it to court if necessary,\u201d Schiff told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIn the end, I think the Department [of Justice] understands they\u2019re going to have to make this public. I think Barr will ultimately understand that, as well,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nSix Democratic House committee chairpeople urged Barr in a letter Friday to publicize Mueller\u2019s report. The lawmakers requested that the Justice Department provide parts of the report that are not made public to Congress and asked that the department explain its reasoning for any redactions.\n\n\u201cWe write to you to express, in the strongest possible terms, our expectation that the Department of Justice will release to the public the report Special Counsel Mueller submits to you \u2014 without delay and to the maximum extent permitted by law,\u201d the committee chairpeople wrote in the letter. Besides Schiff (D-N.Y.), the letter was signed by House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.).\n\n\u201cWe are going to get to the bottom of this,\u201d Schiff said Sunday. \u201cWe are going to share this information with the public. And if the president is serious about all of his claims of exoneration, then he should welcome the publication of this report.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s Intelligence Committee is scheduled to hear testimony from Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump\u2019s former attorney and fixer, behind closed doors Thursday. Cohen is set to provide closed-door testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday and publicly go before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe think he has a lot to offer,\u201d Schiff said."

That\u2019s why we just won the Senate and why we will win big in 2020. The Fake News just doesn\u2019t want to report the facts. Border Security is a big factor. The under construction Wall will stop Gangs, Drugs and Crime! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 23, 2019\n\nTrump may be correct if he defines \u201cENERGY\u201d as the ownership of interests in fossil fuel companies or if he interprets it as a willingness by his right-wing followers to amass a stockpile of deadly weapons and a hit list of journalists and politicians who oppose his policies.\n\nHowever, while the president may be mainlining Fox News hosannas directly into his cerebellum, he has yet to grasp the fact that reality doesn\u2019t bend to his egotistical wishes and that no matter how loudly and obnoxiously he proclaims a swell of dynamism on the right wing of this country, his own approval ratings continue to languish more than 10 points below his disapproval ratings in FiveThirtyEight.com\u2019s average of multiple polls.\n\nThose approval ratings are so low exactly because of Trump\u2019s repetition of the same lies as contained in this morning\u2019s tweet over and over again. His attacks on the \u201cFake News\u201d media that report the details of his deceptions and corruption, while his own lies about his actions are exposed in the slowly unfolding indictments emanating from both Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office and from the prosecutors in the president\u2019s hometown division of the Justice Department, the Southern District of New York.\n\nHis easily refuted fantasies about the border wall already being under construction and the ability of prehistoric technology to solve problems of \u201cGangs, Drugs and Crime\u201d are designed to create a false, hyped-up level of \u201cENERGY\u201d in his base of misled citizens with gullibility issues through the use of despicable fear tactics that create more hatred than enthusiasm.\n\nIn reality, Trump\u2019s definition of \u201cENERGY\u201d closely follows Einstein\u2019s formula with a recontextualizing of the parameters of the variables in the famous physicist\u2019s classic equation: E = mc2 \u2014 except in this case \u201cENERGY\u201d equals Massive lies times Crazy delusions squared.\n\nThe 2020 elections will give progressives and Democrats the opportunity to demonstrate that our level of energy can power the third rail to a train that will roll over the Republican kleptocracy and power the nation with new ideas that benefit all of the people. We are charged and ready to go.\n\nFollow Vinnie Longobardo on Twitter.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

Not yet at least.\n\nNow the bets are on as to whether the notoriously loquacious Republican dirty trickster will be able to keep his mouth shut long enough to keep it that way until his trial on one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements \u2014 including lying to Congress \u2014 and one count of witness tampering in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nStrone was back in court today after he posted a photo of Judge Amy Berman Jackson \u2014 the justice overseeing his case \u2014 with the crosshairs of a rifle scope next to her on Instagram as part of his fundraising efforts for his defense despite being under a limited gag order.\n\nSuffice it to say that Judge Jackson was not amused by the dissembling that Stone and his attorneys attempted in trying to excuse his behavior, but rather than taking the most extreme step of detaining the foppish political operative until his trial, she imposed a more stringent gag order that prohibits Stone from speaking publically about his case or the wider investigation with which it is a part.\n\nThe judge declared that it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d to allow Stone another opportunity to flout her intention of having him remain silent about his prosecution on such significant charges.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving you another chance,\u201d she said. \u201cI have serious doubts whether you\u2019ve learned any lesson at all.\u201d \u201cRoger Stone knows full well the power of words and the power of symbols,\u201d she said in rejecting Stone\u2019s protestations that he didn\u2019t mean his post to imply a threat. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing ambiguous about crosshairs.\u201d\n\nJudge Jackson threatened that she would send Stone to prison to await trial if he violates the gag order in any way between now and the start of his proceedings.\n\nStone attempted to apologize to the judge as he took the stand in his defense, saying \u201cI am kicking myself over my own stupidity\u201d \u2014 something that he could have used to raise a significant sum for his defense if he allowed others to do it for him.\n\n\u201cThis was an egregious, stupid error for which I apologize to the court,\u201d the Nixon-tatooed political consultant admitted, while giving contradictory explanations of how the Instagram post was created and posted.\n\nJudge Jackson found Stone\u2019s apology to have little credibility given that he continued to make statements to the press using language similar to that contained in the offending post.\n\n\u201cThank you, but the apology rings quite hollow,\u201d she said. Based on his subsequent statements and actions, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t find any of the evolving and contradictory explanations credible.\u201d \u201cThe privilege, the liberty he was afforded was promptly abused. You were right about that Mr. Stone. If the conduct of the past weekend is what Mr. Stone would call judicious, it would be foolhardy for the court to take no action and learn what injudicious looks like,\u201d the judge concluded.\n\nWith the judge\u2019s order today, Roger Stone is now barred from making any public statements about his case, about the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s contact with Russia, or about any of the people participating in the investigation. \u201cPeriod.\u201d\n\nThe only thing that Stone will be allowed to do now is to solicit contributions for his legal defense and continue to claim that he\u2019s innocent of the charges, but otherwise, he\u2019ll have to keep his mouth as shut as tight as Robert Mueller\u2019s lips have been throughout the Russia probe.\n\nFollow Vinnie Longobardo on Twitter.\n\nOriginal reporting by Rachel Weiner Manuel Roig-Franzia at The Washington Post.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "18.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nActor Alec Baldwin has mastered the art of parodying President Donald Trump, who melted down on Twitter over the weekend.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. saw his dad\u2019s epic fail and decided to attack Baldwin for his Emmy-winning portrayal of America\u2019s worst president, a man who was nominated and lost at the Emmys while playing himself on TV.\n\nAlec Baldwin gave his response to Don Jr.\u2019s barbs on a podcast (embedded below) that came out this morning and it\u2019s literally a laugh-out-loud moment. He told the Dworkin Report:\n\n\u201cTrump may not go down\u2026 but it sure sounds like his son\u2019s gonna be indicted\u2026 and unless he\u2019s pardoned, he\u2019s gonna go to prison.\u201d \u201cSo I guess he\u2019ll have a lot of time to watch SNL then.\u201d\n\nNot only is Alec Baldwin likely correct about Don Jr., but media reports for the last four months say Trump\u2019s oldest son has been expecting to face an indictment soon for his role in soliciting election assistance from the government of Russia.\n\nThe entire incident began this weekend when Baldwin appeared on SNL in a fake White House Rose Garden to spoof Trump\u2019s insanely rambling speech and press conference to declare a fake national emergency last Friday.\n\nNaturally, the Kvetcher-in-Chief responded on Twitter early the next morning, but he turned the rhetoric up to full blast, even for someone who has lobbed more than a thousand insults at the FBI and federal prosecutors.\n\nNothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2019\n\nWhen asked why Baldwin publicly complained that Trump\u2019s tweet was a serious attempt to incite the next #MAGAbomber to hurt him or his family.\n\nThat\u2019s when Don Jr. stepped in to launch another attack against the Emmy-winning actor.\n\nAlec Baldwin explained in in more detail during the podcast why Trump\u2019s renewed attack on SNL is more dangerous now because he\u2019s talking about retribution and investigations.\n\n\u201cTrump signals people. Not necessarily what to do, but how to feel, and that\u2019s the beginning,\u201d says Baldwin. \u201cYou make people angry. You make people agitated, and bitter, and then the actions flow from there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need somebody who is petty and antagonistic, with all of these crazy government shutdowns and whatnot,\u201d Baldwin deadpanned making the perfect analogy about Trump\u2019s terrible role atop the United States government. \u201cHe\u2019s like a drunk driver. Nobody wants the driver of the school bus to be a drunk driver, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re stuck with now.\u201d\n\nNBC\u2019s Saturday Night Live has specialized in performing political satire on the national stage ever since its inaugural season in 1975.\n\nNo other SNL performer has faced an infuriated and retaliatory President at the other end of the joke, like Donald Trump, and certainly, no presidential relative has confronted one of its comedians even though some of them have been the butt of jokes in the past.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s psychotic rage has inspired violence across America, but his vituperative attack on Alec Baldwin and Saturday Night Live this weekend stand out for its increased level of vitriol and desperation, and Don Jr.\u2019s slavish follow-up assault this week demonstrates that the apple truly does not fall far from the tree.\n\nListen to the complete Dworkin Report podcast with Alec Baldwin here, it\u2019s 11 minutes long:\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "Historian Rutger Bregman, in collaboration with NowThis, has released a tape featuring a heated conversation he says he had with Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\n\u201cYou are a millionaire funded by billionaires, that\u2019s what you are... You\u2019re part of the problem,\u201d Bregman can be heard saying just before Carlson goes into an expletive-filled tailspin.\n\n\u201cMoron... I wanna say to you why don\u2019t you go fuck yourself \u2015 you tiny brain,\u201d the host replies. \u201cAnd I hope this gets picked up because you\u2019re a moron. I tried to give you a hearing, but you were too fucking annoying.\u201d\n\nThe pre-recorded interview was supposed to air on Carlson\u2019s show, according to Bregman and Carlson. The Dutch historian and author had been invited to talk to the Fox News host after he made incendiary remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and accused rich people of not paying their fair share of taxes, according to The Guardian.\n\nCarlson addressed the video on Wednesday night, saying he was incensed by Bregman\u2019s remark that Fox News tells him what he can say.\n\n\u201cWhatever my faults or those of this channel, nobody in management has ever told us what positions to take on the air, never. Not one time,\u201d said Carlson, before saying he and others on Fox News have \u201ctotal freedom.\u201d\n\nThe host added that he did what he tries hard never to do and was \u201crude.\u201d Carlson said that while he felt what he said was accurate, the vulgar terms were not allowed to be used on television, so the segment could not be aired.\n\n\u201cThere is some profanity, and I apologize for that. On the other hand, it was genuinely heartfelt and I meant it with total sincerity,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nBregman\u2019s tweets last week suggest the interview happened earlier this month and was supposed to air on Feb. 11.\n\nThe historian tweeted that Carlson later sent him an email saying: \u201cI loved what you said at Davos, so I had high hopes for our interview. But you turned out to be far dumber, more dogmatic and less impressive than I expected. You\u2019re [a] professional academic, so I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, but it was still disappointing. Also, for what it\u2019s worth, you\u2019re an asshole.\u201d\n\nSo @TuckerCarlson just called me a \u2018fucking moron\u2019 during a prerecord for his show, for pointing out that he\u2019s a millionaire funded by billionaires.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see if they\u2019ll air it.\n\n\n\n\u2018Did they get it on audio?? Fuck fuck fuck\u2019 we heard them say here..\n\n\n\n(Yes, we did.) \u2014 Rutger Bregman (@rcbregman) February 12, 2019\n\nOkay, so now @TuckerCarlson sent me this email, after I asked him when the interview is gonna air (was supposed to be on tonight). Stay tuned. pic.twitter.com/AKaNEjm2S2 \u2014 Rutger Bregman (@rcbregman) February 12, 2019\n\nAfter NowThis published the video, Bregman tweeted again on Wednesday: \u201cHere\u2019s the interview that Tucker Carlson and Fox News didn\u2019t want you to see.\u201d He said he chose to release the footage because he thinks \u201cwe should keep talking about the corrupting influence of money in politics.\u201d\n\n1/ Here\u2019s the interview that @TuckerCarlson and Fox News didn\u2019t want you to see. I chose to release it, because I think we should keep talking about the corrupting influence of money in politics. It also shows how angry elites can get if you do that. https://t.co/hs1474MJNM \u2014 Rutger Bregman (@rcbregman) February 20, 2019\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Bregman said he stands behind his comments but wishes he had quoted Noam Chomsky when Carlson asked him how he\u2019s being influenced by Big Business and tax-avoiding billionaires.\n\n\u201cYears ago, when he was asked a similar question, Chomsky replied: \u2018I\u2019m sure you believe everything you\u2019re saying. But what I\u2019m saying is that if you believe something different, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting where you\u2019re sitting,\u2019\u201d wrote Bregman."

    "text": "Democrats in both the House and Senate have introduced the Raise the Wage Act of 2019 (S. 150/H.R. 582), which would raise the federal minimum wage by roughly a dollar a year until it reaches $15 in 2024. Thereafter, further increases to the minimum wage would be adjusted based on median wage growth without the need for additional legislation. The bill includes other provisions to address increasing income inequality, such as the gradual elimination of sub-minimum wages for young people, people with disabilities, and tipped workers (restaurant workers and others in the service and hospitality industry).\n\nMany lawmakers assume that young people without major financial responsibilities hold minimum wage jobs, but in reality the majority of these jobholders are adults and their household\u2019s primary breadwinners. Sixty-two percent of those working minimum wage jobs are women, and six million of them are mothers. Nearly 75% of Americans support raising the minimum wage. Nineteen states have already done so, and another 21 cities in red and blue states alike have increased the minimum wage to $15/hour. Under the Raise the Wage Act, nearly 30% of all American workers would see higher wages, including more than 40% of African American workers and a third of Latinx workers.\n\nIncreasing the minimum wage would benefit not only struggling workers and families but also the US economy. Consumer spending would increase, and the need for taxpayer funded public-assistance programs would decrease. Congressional support for the Raise the Wage Act is at an all-time high with 30 co-sponsors in the Senate and 188 co-sponsors in the House. The time for Congress to act is now."

    "text": "President Vladimir Putin warned on Wednesday of a resolute response if the U.S. decides to station missiles in countries neighboring Russia.\n\nPutin, in his annual address to parliament, said his country would not seek confrontation and would not take the first step in deploying missiles after the suspension of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\n\nHowever, he said Russia would respond to any deployment of new intermediate-range missiles in Europe by targeting the United States itself and not just the countries where they are deployed, according to a Reuters translation. He said he would field new weapons that would target U.S. decision-making centers.\n\nHe warned U.S. policymakers, some of whom he said were obsessed with U.S. exceptionalism, about being careful before taking new measures.\n\n\"It's their right to think how they want. But can they count? I'm sure they can. Let them count the speed and the range of the weapons systems we are developing,\" Putin said to applause, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Russia will be forced to create and deploy types of weapons which can be used not only in respect of those territories from which the direct threat to us originates, but also in respect of those territories where the centers of decision-making are located.\"\n\nIn early February, the U.S. confirmed it would suspend its participation in the decades-old INF treaty, which bans ground-launched medium-range missiles with a range of 310 to 3,400 miles. The U.S. administration said it had taken the measure following Russia's refusal to accept that its SSC-8 missile directly contravenes the Cold War-era agreement."

    "text": "Washington (CNN) Attorney General Bill Barr is preparing to announce as early as next week the completion of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, with plans for Barr to submit to Congress soon after a summary of Mueller's confidential report, according to people familiar with the plans.\n\nThe preparations are the clearest indication yet that Mueller is nearly done with his almost two-year investigation.\n\nThe precise timing of the announcement is subject to change.\n\nThe scope and contours of what Barr will send to Congress remain unclear. Also unclear is how long it will take Justice officials to prepare what will be submitted to lawmakers.\n\nBut with President Donald Trump soon to travel overseas for a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Justice officials are mindful of not interfering with the White House's diplomatic efforts, which could impact the timing.\n\nThe Justice Department and the special counsel's office declined to comment.\n\nBarr has said that he wants to be as \"transparent\" as possible with Congress and the public, \"consistent with the rules and the law.\"\n\nUnder the special counsel regulations, Mueller must submit a \"confidential\" report to the attorney general at the conclusion of his work, but the rules don't require it to be shared with Congress, or by extension, the public. And, as Barr has made clear, the Justice Department generally guards against publicizing \"derogatory\" information about uncharged individuals.\n\nAs a result, one of the most pressing questions Barr will face in the coming weeks is the extent to which Mueller's findings should be disclosed to Congress.\n\nThe regulations require Mueller to explain in his report all decisions to prosecute or not prosecute matters under scrutiny. Barr would also need to inform Congress if the Justice Department prevented the special counsel team from pursuing any investigative steps.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that it's \"totally up to Bill Barr\" as to whether Mueller's report comes out while he is overseas in Vietnam next week.\n\n\"That'll be totally up to the new attorney general. He's a tremendous man, a tremendous person, who really respects this country and respects the Justice Department, so that'll be totally up to him,\" Trump told reporters in the White House.\n\nSpeculation about the end of the probe has been running rampant in Washington. NBC News reported recently the probe would be done by mid-February.\n\nLife after Mueller\n\nWhile the Mueller investigation may soon come to a close, there continue to be court cases that will be handled by other federal prosecutors.\n\nIn addition, Mueller has referred certain matters that fell outside the scope of the Russia probe to other US Attorneys to pursue. Some of those investigations have already been revealed, including the investigation in New York into former Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen. That probe has spawned subsequent federal investigations in New York into the Trump Organization and the Trump Inaugural Committee. It is possible the special counsel's team has referred other matters that have not yet come to light.\n\nFor close watchers of the federal courthouse and the Mueller team, small changes have added up in recent weeks.\n\nOn Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday last week, special counsel's office employees carried boxes and pushed a cart full of files out of their office -- an unusual move that could foreshadow a hand-off of legal work.\n\nAt the same time, the Mueller prosecutors' workload appears to be dwindling. Four of Mueller's 17 prosecutors have ended their tenures with the office, with most returning to other roles in the Justice Department.\n\nAnd the grand jury that Mueller's prosecutors used to return indictments of longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and several Russians hasn't apparently convened since January 24 the day it approved the criminal charges against Stone.\n\nEven with these signs of a wrap up, the DC US Attorney's office has stepped in to work on cases that may continue longer than Mueller is the special counsel.\n\nThat office has joined onto some of the Mueller's team's casework, including the cases against Stone, a Russian social media propaganda conspiracy, and in an ongoing foreign government-owned company's fight against a grand jury subpoena.\n\nMueller and his prosecutors are still reporting to work as frequently as ever -- with some even coming in on recent snow days and Presidents' Day. But also visiting them more often than ever before are the prosecutors from the DC US Attorney's Office and others in the Justice Department who've worked on the Mueller cases.\n\nIn one court case, against Concord Management for its alleged support for the social media conspiracy prosecutors told a judge in January there's still a related \"matter occurring before the grand jury.\"\n\nIn other cases, including Manafort's, the Mueller team has made heavy redactions to its recent public court filings, including to protect pending investigations and people who haven't been charged with crimes."

    "text": "We share love letters from four refugees, giving an insight into the pain they felt when they had to leave behind not just their country but their belongings.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: These love letters were written by refugees stranded in the \u201chotspot\u201d camp on the Greek island of Leros. They were an assignment developed by Maria Tetradi, language education director of the Hub, a refugee community space organized by Austrian charity Echo100Plus. The letters were originally published in the second issue of ZINE, a publication by and for refugees that is organized by editor and journalist Holly St. Lifer.\n\nDear Scissors,\n\nI bought you in a shop. The same shop in Baghdad where I bought my fabric. I bought you the same day I opened my shop when I was 14 years old. Afterward, I bought more scissors, but I will always remember you, as you were my first pair.\n\nYou were black, not plastic but metal, just a bit bigger than my hand. You didn\u2019t smell of anything, or at least I don\u2019t remember. I liked you because you helped me make my work. With you I made many curtains. Every time I opened my shop I had you with me. I used you to cut my fabric, but I had to leave you behind because I had to close my shop and sell everything, including you.\n\nEven though I know that I will have other pairs of scissors in the future, I will never forget you because with you I created my first curtains. I hope you are in good hands now and that you will never forget about me too.\n\nLove,\n\nZainulabdeen\n\nDear Books,\n\nThanks for all the information you gave me throughout these years. It\u2019s really helped me. I still remember when I got you, even though you were small. But you were heavy because of all the pages you were made of and it was a pain to carry you all the way.\n\nDear books. By Basel Al Sheakh Ali.\n\nI still remember your smell. It was like paper.\n\nAt times I really hated you because I had to memorize all your information to pass my classes. But I still like how useful you were, even though you made me so anxious and I wanted to rip you up, especially during exams.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I left you behind. It wasn\u2019t easy for me. I regret that I left you, but it\u2019s too late to get you back.\n\nStill after all, I thank you. Without you, I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am now.\n\nLove,\n\nMohammad Kamal\n\nDear Hope,\n\nI am sorry because I left you behind. You know how much I love you. But I wasn\u2019t able to carry you.\n\nWe had some problems being in the same place. You were getting upset every time I told you, \u201cI made you.\u201d You are a little child, you are so small, but even you \u2013 so small \u2013 I could not carry you.\n\nI had a dangerous road and was afraid to take you with me. I know you miss me like I miss you. I miss your colors and you, like how you told me you miss my hand. I know you are safe and I hope we meet again.\n\nI will not sell you for all the money in the world. I had told you what happened that time, and my wife saw your color on my hand and she discovered our relationship and I had no answer.\n\nShe asked me if I love you more than her. What can I answer? Should I tell her I like your shine? Or your brightness? And your shape?\n\nIt is difficult.\n\nAnd anyway, I write to you to tell you I can\u2019t wait to meet you again. And I miss you, my baby.\n\nLove,\n\nBasel Al Sheakh Ali\n\nDear My Sexy Green Shoes,\n\nThe first time I left Iraq to go to Sweden, I had to take a small boat to Greece from Turkey. There were too many people in the boat, so it flipped over and everyone fell in the water. I had to swim to the island and leave my backpack to sink. I lost all of my belongings that day, including my first pair of sexy green shoes.\n\nThat\u2019s why the next time I had to make that same journey, I left you at home in case I fell in the water again, which I did. But this time, I was wearing red leather sneakers.\n\nWhen I arrived on the island, I didn\u2019t have anything except my shirt, shorts and my red leather sneakers. I missed you so much. It made me sad to remember how I\u2019d walk in the street with you, the girls eyeing you because of your beautiful color and the soft, comfortable fabric. A lot of people pined for a pair of shoes like mine, but they weren\u2019t available in Iraq.\n\nI remember the day I bought you at H&M in Sweden. One day I was walking the streets of Stockholm, and I saw you in the store window. Do you believe in love at first sight? Your smooth body and the beautiful light green color made me fall in love with you instantly. I bought you, and put you on right there in the store. Then I took a selfie of myself and posted it on social media.\n\nIn my country, it\u2019s traditional to leave your shoes outside the front door. But I didn\u2019t do that with you. You were too special to me to leave you outside, so I kept you in my bedroom.\n\nMy family moved to a new house three months ago and I have not been in contact with them. I wonder if they were able to take you. I hope one day it will be safe for me to go back to Iraq and walk on its busy streets, wearing you again.\n\nMiss you,\n\nHayder Al-Hilo\n\nReprinted with permission from Echo100Plus, a nonprofit organization supporting refugees in Greece.

    "text": "Senate Panel Launches Bipartisan Probe Into Think Tank Linked To Butina, Torshin\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pavel Ptitsin/AP Pavel Ptitsin/AP\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee is launching a bipartisan investigation into how a conservative think tank aided Maria Butina, the admitted Russian agent who sought political influence through her ties with the National Rifle Association.\n\nButina pleaded guilty to acting as a foreign agent in the United States in December, and her alleged Russian government handler, Alexander Torshin, was sanctioned by the U.S. in April 2018.\n\nIn a letter to Dimitri Simes, the CEO of the Center for the National Interest think tank, the committee requested records related to meetings Torshin and Butina had in 2015 with the Federal Reserve vice chairman and the Treasury Department undersecretary for international affairs.\n\nRepublican Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Democratic ranking member Ron Wyden of Oregon also sent letters to the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to find out more about these meetings and to receive more details about their policies regarding meeting with foreign officials.\n\nA Freedom of Information Act request by NPR, which the Federal Reserve responded to the day before the Senate Finance Committee made public its intention to investigate, answers some of the questions being posed by the committee.\n\nThe documents reveal that Paul Saunders, then the executive director of the Center for the National Interest, reached out to the Federal Reserve to set up meetings for Torshin. \"I am writing to request an appointment for Mr. Alexander Torshin,\" Saunders wrote, in a March 2015 email. \"Mr. Torshin is in the United States on a private visit. ... He would like to discuss U.S.-Russia relations and international economic issues and can also share his perspective on Russia's financial situation and its impact on Russian politics.\"\n\nThe Center for the National Interest was established by former President Richard Nixon and is considered a conservative think tank with a reputation for following a foreign policy school of thought known as realism. Henry Kissinger is the honorary chairman of the board of directors, and many of the other directors are well-known conservative thinkers.\n\nNPR's FOIA request also yielded an internal memorandum that summarizes the meeting held between Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer, Torshin and Butina in April 2015.\n\nThe memo reveals that back in spring 2015, both Torshin and Butina were already touting their relationships with the National Rifle Association \u2014 and that the meetings with senior officials were an offshoot of their primary trip purpose: to attend the yearly NRA conference.\n\n\"Butina ... served as translator during the meeting. She is Founding Chairman and Board Member of a Russian organization which promotes the right to bear arms. They are both life members of the National Rifle Association,\" the internal memo reads. \"They are in the United States to attend the NRA's annual meeting.\"\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee's public announcement Friday of a bipartisan probe into this matter reveals a new element of the numerous congressional investigations into Russia.\n\n\"A critical issue facing the Committee and the country is the extent to which the Russian government engaged in efforts designed to undermine our political system and governmental policy through obfuscation and manipulation,\" the two senators wrote in their letters Friday."

    "text": "President Trump\u2019s decision to declare a national emergency in order to build his stupid, vanity border wall is a quasi-legal, immoral act of barbarian authoritarianism. But it\u2019s also something else: a desperate act of a desperate man who is becoming increasingly irrelevant in Washington.\n\nThink about it this way: For two years, with his own party in control of Congress, Trump couldn\u2019t get his border wall funded. Honestly, despite his own reports of being the most accomplished president ever, he didn\u2019t get much else done either.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s because his political capital is drained by the encroaching Mueller investigation. Perhaps it\u2019s because he squandered much of his legitimacy by ramping up his hateful, lie-filled tirades and locking children in cages. And/or perhaps he\u2019s simply incompetent.\n\nWhatever the case, Trump was already increasingly marginal before the 2018 midterms, which gave us allegedly the most deeply divided Congress in history. And yet even this Congress has found something to actually unite around\u2013in coming up with a bipartisan plan to keep the federal government open and move forward, whether Trump likes it or not.\n\nAsked about the Democratic and Republican compromise to fund border security and keep the federal government from shutting down yet again, Trump said, \"Am I happy? The answer is no, I'm not. I'm not happy.\" But they\u2019re passing it anyway\u2013including majority support from Democrats as well as Republicans. And the White House has said that Trump will sign the bill.\n\nNow, failing to get what he wanted either from his own party or bipartisan democratic process, Trump is once again resorting to a solo temper tantrum, this time in the form of declaring a national emergency.\n\nWhat\u2019s noteworthy is that there was little back-and-forth like before the shutdown last time, when Trump\u2019s blessing of the terms of the deal was prized by congressional Republicans. Several times, Republicans, including Trump\u2019s own vice president, Mike Pence, came up with a proposed solution only for Trump to shoot it down\u2013which then ended the conversation.\n\nNow, the center of gravity has decisively shifted. Trump\u2019s approval or disapproval of the compromise seemed irrelevant to congressional negotiators this time. They gave him something to sign that had no more money for his beloved wall. The powerful and effective leader in Washington today, especially in these behind-the-scenes machinations that actually get things done, is not Donald Trump but Nancy Pelosi.\n\nShe stood her ground during the shutdown and stood up against Trump\u2019s wasteful and pointless border wall, and Trump caved. Pelosi even bested Trump in scheduling the State of the Union. And the American people have noticed. Trump\u2019s approval ratings took a hit, and likely to fall further now. Pelosi\u2019s approval ratings seem to be steadily rising.\n\nSome credit is also due to Chuck Schumer, who proposed the bipartisan conference committee in the first place knowing that Trump would have to back whatever came out of it. Still, it\u2019s Pelosi who seems to now define the moral spine and political acumen of Washington.\n\n\u201c The President\u2019s coattails are turning into entrails. \u201d\n\nWhile Trump is watching Fox & Friends and tweeting, Speaker Pelosi is the one getting things done. And more and more, Washington is bypassing Trump altogether. Trump\u2019s national emergency stunt is designed solely to please his base because they\u2019re the only people who affirmatively care what he does anymore. Incidentally, here\u2019s a prediction: When congressional Republicans are up for re-election in 2020, they\u2019ll be boasting they voted for the border security compromise and will avoid talking about Trump\u2019s emergency declaration. The president\u2019s coattails are turning into entrails.\n\nAll of this is simply the most public culmination of what has been privately going on in Washington for some time. Last September, a senior-level White House official writing anonymously in The New York Times said that Trump\u2019s own team is trying to \u201cpreserve our democratic institutions\u201d by \u201cworking to insulate their operations from [Trump\u2019s] whims.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, veteran journalist Bob Woodward published a book in which he reported that Trump\u2019s National Economic Council head Gary Cohn had literally removed a letter from Trump\u2019s desk the president was planning to sign to withdraw the U.S. from its trade agreement with South Korea.\n\nThere were reports that Trump\u2019s military advisers were doing what they could behind the scenes to steer the ship, until Trump started publicly contradicting their advice and critiquing their expertise. Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Adm. James Stavridis praised Trump\u2019s generals for \u201cstepping into the breach\u201d but added, \u201cIn the end, each of them had to ask himself, At what point does my serving in this White House become less a guardrail and more an enabler?\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a situation of a deep state or a shadow government. This is actual leaders doing their actual jobs while the supposed President of the United States of America is increasingly, to quote The Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin, \u201cirrelevant and incoherent.\u201d\n\nEven in declaring a national emergency, Trump may have inadvertently handed more power and relevance to Pelosi\u2014who can force Republicans to vote on Trump\u2019s actions if she chooses. Trump is trying to act relevant by playing the strongman. But while he\u2019s obviously still president, and obviously still has formal as well as cultural power, he\u2019s being marginalized by the establishment. And this next move will marginalize him even further \u2013 dragging down his numbers, pissing off Republicans in Congress, and potentially leading to a string of embarrassing court rulings. But, as they say, desperate times call for desperate measures. The same is true for desperate people. And Donald Trump is desperate."

    "text": "7.5k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nSenate Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) just sent shockwaves through America\u2019s political universe by revealing that President Trump plans to declare a fake national emergency to build a wall monument to racism along America\u2019s southern border.\n\nIf Trump does use an emergency declaration to redirect money from other Congressional appropriations, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) could set up a legislative showdown to stop him, quickly forcing an up or down Senate vote that could divide the Republican Party.\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing that could stop a stupid Trump tweet from emerging (there\u2019s one for everything, right?) which highlights just how ludicrous it is for the President to invent a fake immigration emergency when all he\u2019s doing is being a racist.\n\nIt turns out that the Hypocrite in Chief hyper-overreacted to President Obama\u2019s legitimate use of the Executive Order to create DACA, which courts have upheld time and time again and described his current presidential fail to a tee.\n\nTrump\u2019s big plan to subvert the Constitution has been brewing for months, starting with his first big fake emergency during the 2018 midterm elections. Aided and abetted by mainstream news organizations reporting about his frivolous nonsense \u201ccaravan\u201d scare tactics, the President ruined the holidays for thousands of troops.\n\nA couple of weeks into the Trump shutdown, the President began floating his fake emergency idea, which frankly, he could\u2019ve pushed forward a month ago, without damaging the lives of many thousands of federal employees and contractors.\n\nJust like the shutdown, we can also partially attribute his fake national emergency to the advice of the \u201cFox News cabinet.\u201d\n\nSpeaker Pelosi is America\u2019s best chance at ending the fake Trump emergency with a House resolution, which would give the Senate exactly 36 days before it would be forced to vote on the matter according to the Post:\n\n\u201cThe NEA lays out a timetable for this process, and by [the Brookings Institute\u2019s Elizabeth] Goitein\u2019s reading, it would all take place within the protracted period of barely longer than a month.\u201d \u201c\u2019In short, there could be 36 days between introduction of the resolution in the House and a vote on the Senate floor,\u2019 Goitein told me, \u2018but that vote would have to happen,\u201d and once it did, one way or the other, it would put senators \u2018on record.'\u201d\n\nThe Senate\u2019s Republican majority could take steps to prevent that vote, but not without going on the record supporting Trump\u2019s constitutional end run.\n\nEven staunch pro-Trump Republicans like Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson and five others are pushing back against the fake wall emergency since allowing a tyrannical dictatorship to exist in the White House could take money away from their pet projects.\n\nDonald Trump would be wise \u2013 if that was even possible \u2013 to consult his old tweets about presidential overreach before going fully ahead with his fake emergency declaration, but only after signing the Congressional compromise to fully fund the government this week so that 800,000 federal workers and more contractors don\u2019t bear the brunt of his foolishness yet again.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "\u201cThe president is doing an end run around Congress,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told reporters. She suggested that Mr. Trump was setting a precedent for future Democratic presidents to act on issues like gun control \u2014 precisely the scenario that scares Republicans.\n\n\u201cYou want to talk about a national emergency, let\u2019s talk about today,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said, reminding Mr. Trump that it was the anniversary of the shooting massacre last February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Seventeen students and staff members were killed. \u201cThat\u2019s a national emergency. Why don\u2019t you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, echoed her criticism and said Congress would defend its prerogatives. \u201cThe public was more opposed to the emergency declaration than they were to the wall,\u201d he said in a brief interview. \u201cAnd they were opposed to the wall.\u201d\n\nAbout a half-dozen Senate Republicans quickly spoke out against the move, as well. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency,\u201d said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. \u201cWe as legislators are trying to address the president\u2019s priority. What we\u2019re voting on now is perhaps an imperfect solution, but it\u2019s one we could get consensus on.\u201d\n\nSenator Susan Collins of Maine said such a declaration was \u201cof dubious constitutionality,\u201d while Senator Marco Rubio of Florida called it \u201ca bad idea.\u201d Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said, \u201cWe have a government that has a Constitution that has a division of power, and revenue raising and spending power was given to Congress.\u201d\n\nStill, other Republicans backed Mr. Trump, including an ally, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who faces re-election next year. \u201cHe feels that declaring a national emergency gives him that flexibility that he wants and needs, so I\u2019m supportive of that,\u201d Ms. Capito said of the president.\n\n\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, we tried for 35 days in December and January, right, to get the Democrats to do what everyone knows needs to happen except Democrats,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio. \u201cI support the national emergency declaration 100 percent.\u201d"

    "text": "\n\nFILE PHOTO: Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort arrives for arraignment on a third superseding indictment against him by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on charges of witness tampering, at U.S. District Court in Washington, June 15, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst//File Photo/File Photo (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s lies caught up with him in federal court on Wednesday. The result was a decision that likely means, absent either a deal or a presidential pardon, he\u2019ll spend the rest of his life in jail.\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nThe judge\u2019s finding that Manafort, 69, breached his cooperation deal with prosecutors by lying after his guilty plea could add years to his prison sentence and came after a set of sealed court hearings. Manafort had denied intentionally lying after his plea deal, but U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District found he lied in three of five areas alleged by prosecutors. She said she would factor in his deception on other topics at sentencing March 13.\n\nThe subject matter of Manafort\u2019s lies goes to the core of possible cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russians linked to Russian intelligence \u2014 in this case, Konstantin Kilimnik, who met with Manafort during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn particular, the court found that Manafort lied about his contacts with Kilimnik both during and after the election. Manafort was also found to have lied about \u201ca payment that was routed through a pro-Trump political action committee to cover his legal bills, and about information relevant to another undisclosed investigation underway at the Justice Department.\u201d\n\nIn some sense, we should have expected this outcome. \u201cNo surprise Manafort was caught lying again,\u201d says Joyce White Vance, a former federal prosecutor. \u201cThe open question is whether Manafort was freelancing or whether others from the campaign were involved.\u201d\n\nIn previous court filings that were inadvertently released, we learned that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had evidence that Manafort gave Kilimnik private polling data. This exchange, according to what federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told a federal judge last week, went \u201cto the heart\u201d of the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe Post previously reported that, at a hush-hush August 2, 2016 meeting at the Grand Havana Room, a private cigar room in New York, Manafort, deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates and Kilimnik discussed \u201ca proposed resolution to the conflict over Ukraine, an issue of great interest to the Russian government, according to a partially redacted transcript of the Feb. 4 hearing.\u201d It was there that there may have been \u201ca handoff by Manafort of internal polling data from Trump\u2019s presidential campaign to his Russian associate.\u201d\n\nManafort finds himself in a much worse position than he was as a cooperating witness trying to whittle down his potential sentence for eight felony convictions handed down last year in Virginia. \u201cManafort is either the most self-destructive, irrational liar in history, or he is still protecting a secret so dark that exposing it would kill his chance for a pardon,\u201d former Justice Department spokesman Matt Miller tells me. \u201cNow that he\u2019s facing a jail sentence that could stretch for the rest of his life, we\u2019ll find out if his risky gamble will pay off.\u201d\n\nThis, in short, was collusion \u2014 Trump\u2019s top campaign official giving material to a suspected agent of a hostile foreign government that the campaign had already been warned was attempting to interfere with our election. Whatever you call it \u2014 direct or indirect evidence \u2014 this now is one link proven in court between the campaign and the Russians. We know of others, of course, including the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 designed to get dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s public call for Russia to go after Clinton\u2019s emails, and more than 100 contacts between Russian figures and members of the Trump circle.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to think of an explanation for Manafort\u2019s lying that doesn\u2019t open new avenues for Mueller to explore. \u201cThere is no non-nefarious explanation for the chairman of a presidential campaign secretly meeting with a suspected Russian agent in the midst of an election that the Russians are actively trying to influence and then lying about it to the prosecutor after agreeing to cooperate.,\u201d says Max Bergmann of the Moscow Project. \u201cThe only reason for Manafort to lie at this point is to cover up something truly devastating.\u201d\n\nOddly, it was on Wednesday morning that we learned Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, believed there\u2019d been no direct evidence of collusion. That assertion is hard to square with the court\u2019s finding later on Wednesday and publicly available evidence. The only question is which of these contacts Trump was aware of and/or authorized, and what the nature of any quid pro quo may have been.\n\nFormer prosecutor Mimi Rocah observes, \u201cIt isn\u2019t surprising to me that the judge found that Manafort lied because prosecutors don\u2019t try to void cooperation agreements lightly. But it\u2019s still shocking.\" She notes that \"Manafort chose to lie about his dealings with a Russian intelligence officer and spend years more in prison than he would have if he had told the truth. So the looming question that remains in my mind is \u2014 why? \"\n\nThose speculating that Mueller is wrapping up soon better reset their clocks. With Manafort now under extreme pressure, he could for the first time tell us what exactly is the deep dark secret about Russia and the Trump operation that so many people have lied to cover up.\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Measer: The real value of Paul Manafort\u2019s polling data\n\nRandall D.

During this period, Jared Kushner was working in the White House under an interim clearance while the FBI conducted background checks.\n\nThe security specialist\u2019s account of what standard procedure would call for in this type of situation outlines a process of meeting with the individual in question to discuss the incriminating information, which in this instance had already been vetted as \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nIn her complaint, Newbold says that Kline refused to follow this procedure, deciding that he \u201cwas going to wait until the [FBI] investigation was completed.\u201d When she then \u201cquestioned why we were treating this individual any differently than we would any other individual,\u201d Kline cut her off by saying that \u201che would not address this matter further.\u201d\n\nNewbold\u2019s whistleblower accusation further alleges that she again raised her concerns about the same administration member \u2014 assumed to be Kushner \u2014 a little over a month after her initial conversation and was advised by Kline to \u2018watch myself.\u2019\u201d\n\nJust a few months later Kline overruled the objections by Newbold and one other career White House security specialist over the concerns about the presidential advisor\u2019s foreign contacts that were detailed in his FBI background investigation and granted Kushner top-secret clearance, according to two sources familiar with the situation.\n\nAccording to NBC News:\n\n\u201cKushner\u2019s was one of at least 30 cases in which Kline overruled career security experts and approved a top-secret clearance for incoming Trump officials despite unfavorable information, according to the two sources.\u201d\n\nNewbold\u2019s complaint to the office that deals with whistleblower allegations claims that she has been retaliated against for raising concerns about her supervisor\u2019s \u201creckless security judgments.\u201d\n\nIt is not the security specialist\u2019s first complaint against Kline, whom she also accused of discrimination against her because of her height as someone with a rare form of dwarfism. She alleges that her supervisor purposefully moved files to which she needed access to a location out of her reach and callously told her to get her staff to help her when she needed them.\n\nWhen NBC tried to reach Kline for comment about this violation of Equal Employment Opportunity regulations, he replied by text: \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAfter she raised the security concerns about Kushner, Newbold was suspended from her job without pay for two weeks, although administration officials claim that it has nothing to do with her revelations about the breach of security protocols but was instead based on \u201cfailure to supervise, failure to follow instructions and defiance of authority.\u201d\n\nSInce Newbold has never before faced any other disciplinary action over the course of her 18-year career in the federal government, her case for being retaliated against for her disclosures of wrongdoing seems fairly strong, particularly with the news that late last year she had contacted Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which is actively probing exactly how Kushner received his top-secret clearance, to give him her insight into the unusual overriding of her recommendations.\n\nFollow Vinnie Longobardo on Twitter.\n\nOriginal reporting by Laura Strickler at NBC News.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "Butterflies Vs. Border Wall: National Butterfly Center Seeks Restraining Order\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR\n\nThe National Butterfly Center, in danger of losing access to most of its wildlife nature preserve along the Rio Grande, is asking a court to stop federal officials from building a border wall across its land.\n\nThe North American Butterfly Association first sued more than a year ago after government officials allegedly cut down trees and cleared brush on its Texas property. The planned wall would cut the 100-acre property in two, with as much as 70 percent of the land inaccessible between the wall and the Rio Grande, Butterfly Center Executive Director Marianna Trevino Wright has told NPR.\n\nTrevino Wright told CNN last week that the case had been \"languishing\" in the court since then and that she was exploring further legal action. This week, she asked the court to stop the government from bringing heavy machinery onto its land, until the court can rule on its original 2017 request.\n\nIt's the latest court challenge brought by environmental groups that lament the damage caused by construction of barriers between U.S. and Mexico. On Monday, a federal court ruled that the Trump administration has broad authority to waive environmental laws in the name of border security. The Department of Homeland Security has already said it will waive regulations to build along the Rio Grande.\n\nOver the past week, government officials have \"driven their trucks and heavy machinery back and forth across the Butterfly Center as if they own it,\" NABA told the court. They've also \"blocked access to more than two-thirds of the Butterfly Center with law enforcement vehicles and by cutting the Butterfly Center's lock on one of its gates and replacing it with one of their own.\"\n\nAs border wall construction begins on land next to the butterfly center, the Trump administration's \"constitutional violations are escalating,\" NABA wrote, alleging its property was being destroyed in violation of the Fourth and Fifth amendments to the U.S. Constitution. NABA says government officials have installed cameras on its private property and have \"engaged in harassment\" of Butterfly Center staff and visitors since the summer of 2017.\n\nA Customs and Border Protection spokesman told CNN they wouldn't comment, citing ongoing litigation.\n\n\"People have been talking about butterflies versus border security, but this case is about so much more than that,\" Trevino Wright said in a statement. \"It is about constitutional protections, the right to due process, the illegal waiver of laws duly enacted by Congress, and the lawlessness of the federal government's actions.\"\n\n\"Imagine going home to your house one day and finding people cutting down your trees, knocking down your fence and destroying your yard,\" Trevino Wright told NPR last year.\n\nThe butterfly center has set up a GoFundMe page to help with its legal defense costs. So far, it has raised nearly $90,000.\n\n\"The issue is not whether butterflies can fly over a wall, but whether private property (farms, businesses, homes) should be seized and destroyed for a project that does not serve the greater good or enhance national security,\" the center wrote. The wall essentially \"pushes the boundaries of Mexico north of the Rio Grande and makes America smaller,\" it said."

    "text": "On Thursday February 8, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey introduced the Green New Deal resolution, which outlines a broad program to address the accelerating twin crises of climate change and economic disparity in our country, with a focus on justice for those frontline communities most impacted by both. For instance, in addition to the environmentally-focused requirement for net zero greenhouse gas emissions and infrastructure investment, the program also includes a federal jobs guarantee, the right to unionize, and universal housing and healthcare.\n\nAlthough unlikely to be taken up in the Republican-majority Senate, if House Democrats can pass this progressive resolution then it will be a key focus for the 2020 elections. If the election results in a Democratic Congress and President, this momentum will rapidly carry the Green New Deal into law.\n\nTell your Representatives and Senators that supporting the Green New Deal is critical to ensure both environmental and economic security for all Americans."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., introduced a bill on Friday to decriminalize marijuana and allow for it to be taxed and regulated. The bill is titled S. 420, in a reference to marijuana culture.\n\nThe proposal, identical to a bill in the House, aims to ease the longstanding conflict between states where cannabis is legal in some form and the U.S. government, which categorizes marijuana as a dangerous illegal drug, similar to LSD or heroin. The American Civil Liberties Union estimates that around half of all drug arrests are for marijuana possession.\n\nMany politicians have framed legalization as a criminal justice issue, as African Americans are more likely to be arrested on marijuana-related charges than whites.\n\n\"The federal prohibition of marijuana is wrong, plain and simple,\" Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement. \"Too many lives have been wasted, and too many economic opportunities have been missed.\"\n\nIt remains unclear if Wyden's bill would have a chance at clearing the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe Democratic majority in the House appears more open to considering proposals to ease federal restrictions on marijuana. The chamber has set a hearing next week on a bill intended to make banking services more widely available for pot companies.\n\nA proposal similar to Wyden's previously languished in the Senate and House. However, Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat carrying the current bill in the House, said voters have \"elected the most pro-cannabis Congress in American history.\"\n\n\"It's tough to see how things will shake out, but there is a very serious chance cannabis policy reform will move in the Senate,\" said Morgan Fox of the National Cannabis Industry Association.\n\nMost Americans live in states where pot can be legally purchased for medical or recreational use, and the move to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana came as the issue has played into the emerging 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nThe proposal would take marijuana off the federal controlled substances list and remove federal criminal penalties for individuals and businesses acting in compliance with state marijuana laws. The bill would allow marijuana to be taxed and regulated like alcohol, and reduce barriers for legal marijuana businesses to get access to banking.\n\nThe bill is part of a three-bill package: A second would impose a tax on marijuana products similar to federal excise taxes on alcohol, while a third would allow state-legal marijuana businesses to claim tax deductions and credits.\n\nJustin Strekal, political director of the pro-legalization group NORML, said in a statement that the proposal is another sign of the \"growing public support for ending our failed war on cannabis consumers.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner, who sits on the board of cannabis company Acreage Holdings, announced on Friday the formation of an industry-backed lobbying group that would push for national marijuana reforms."

    "text": "Overturning a decision by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, an appeals court Tuesday ordered the state to issue a permit to a major Broward County landowner that wants to drill an exploratory oil well in the Everglades.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 1st District Court of Appeal ruled the department improperly rejected a recommended order by an administrative law judge, who said in 2017 that a permit should be approved for Kanter Real Estate LLC.\n\nThe 14-page ruling Tuesday said, in part, that Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Noah Valenstein improperly rejected \u201cfactual findings\u201d by Administrative Law Judge E. Gary Early. Those findings included that the site targeted for exploratory drilling was environmentally degraded and was isolated from surface water and groundwater.\n\n\u201cAppellant (Kanter Real Estate) correctly asserts that (part of Early\u2019s recommended order) is made up entirely of factual findings and that the secretary improperly relied upon or created an unadopted rule by basing its decision on a \u2018long-standing policy to deny oil and gas permits within lands subject to Everglades restoration,\u2019 \u201d said the appeals-court ruling, written by Chief Judge Brad Thomas and joined by judges Harvey Jay and Robert E. Long Jr.\n\nKanter, which owns about 20,000 acres in Broward County, applied in 2015 to drill an exploratory oil well on about five acres of its land in the Everglades. The department denied a permit, leading Kanter to take the case to the Division of Administrative Hearings.\n\nEarly determined that Kanter had met requirements for a permit, with the recommended order saying that the \u201cgreater weight of the evidence establishes that the potential for harmful discharges and the potential for harm to groundwater and public water supply are insignificant.\u201d\n\nBut under administrative law, the dispute then returned to the department for issuance of a final order. The department denied the proposed permit, saying in part that the lands involved are \u201cin the environmentally sensitive Everglades\u201d and that state environmental officials had not issued such an exploratory permit in the Everglades since 1967.\n\nThomas wrote Tuesday, however, that state law requires agencies to accept administrative law judges\u2019 findings of fact unless the findings are not supported by \u201ccompetent, substantial evidence.\u201d Also, he wrote that state law bars agencies from considering information outside the record of the administrative law case.\n\n\u201cHere, the ALJ\u2019s (Early\u2019s) ultimate finding of fact was that the land in question did not have any qualities that would make it vulnerable to pollution of the land, aquifer or surface waters, a finding the ALJ supported with examples and facts introduced as evidence,\u201d the ruling said.\n\nThe appeals court also said the Department of Environmental Protection \u201cimproperly recast factual findings to reach a desired outcome, contrary to law.\u201d\n\nThomas, who was clearly skeptical of the department\u2019s position during a hearing last month, wrote that a Kanter expert testified that there is a 23 percent chance of discovering oil at the targeted site. If oil is discovered, the expert testified that between 180,000 and 10 million barrels could be produced.\n\nThe project would not involve the controversial drilling practice known as fracking, which Gov. Ron DeSantis and some lawmakers are seeking to ban in Florida."

    "text": "With a supermajority of Americans supporting marijuana legalization, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Ron Wyden (D-OR), has introduced a bill to tax and regulate the substance like alcohol.\n\nIn a nod to the mainstreaming of marijuana culture, the legislation carries the stony bill number S. 420. It is the companion to a bill introduced by fellow Oregon Democrat, Rep. Earl Blumenauer, the senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, H.R. 420.\n\nS. 420 \u2014 aka the \u201cMarijuana Revenue and Regulation Act\u201d \u2014 would create a national framework for states to choose their own paths on marijuana. The bill has four major components:\n\nFirst, the bill would remove marijuana from the DEA\u2019s list of Schedules I drugs, where it is currently grouped with dangerous and addictive substances like heroin.\n\nSecond, the bill would impose a federal excise tax on legalized cannabis products, much like the feds now impose on tobacco and alcohol, eventually rising to 25 percent of the sales price.\n\nThird, S. 420 would require marijuana \u201cproducers, importers and wholesalers\u201d to register for a permit with the Department of Treasury.\n\nFourth, the bill would support states that opt to continue pot prohibition, with a federal ban on pot sales and distribution there.\n\nCongress\u2019 420 bills have emerged from Oregon\u2019s successful legalization of marijuana, but speak to the frustration that pot-legal states continue to face under the federal government\u2019s misguided War on Drugs.\n\n\u201cThe federal prohibition of marijuana is wrong, plain and simple,\u201d Wyden said, introducing his bill on Friday. Underscoring the lives ruined and economic opportunities squandered due to decades of criminalization, Wyden insisted: \u201cIt\u2019s time Congress make the changes Oregonians and Americans across the country are demanding.\u201d\n\nPraising Wyden\u2019s Senate leadership, Blumenauer insisted the federal government must \u201ccatch up\u201d to marijuana-legal states, and that it\u2019s high time for \u201cthe most pro-cannabis Congress in American history\u201d to work the will of the people. \u201cWe will break through,\u201d he promised.\n\n(For those uninitiated in the numerology of cannabis culture, here is Rolling Stone\u2019s report on the origin story of 420.)"

    "text": "New York (CNN Business) In an explosive tell-all blog post published Thursday, Jeff Bezos accused the publisher of the National Enquirer of trying to extort him.\n\nThe post by Bezos on the blogging platform Medium revealed what he said were the full text of emails his representatives got from executives at AMI, the publisher of the National Enquirer.\n\nBezos, the billionaire founder and CEO of, alleged that AMI threatened to release compromising photos of him. His post included what he said were emails from AMI detailing what he described as \"extortion and blackmail.\" Bezos, the world's richest person, is the single largest shareholder in Amazon, with 16% of the company's stock.\n\n\"Something unusual happened to me yesterday. Actually, for me it wasn't just unusual \u2014 it was a first. I was made an offer I couldn't refuse. Or at least that's what the top people at the National Enquirer thought. I'm glad they thought that, because it emboldened them to put it all in writing,\" Bezos wrote. \"Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\"\n\nBezos titled his post \"No thank you, Mr. Pecker,\" referring to AMI's chairman and CEO, David Pecker . In the text, he shared what he said was an email from AMI's chief content officer, Dylan Howard, in which Howard threatened to release intimate and personal photos and text messages of Bezos and a woman the National Enquirer said he was having an affair with.\n\n\"In the AMI letters I'm making public, you will see the precise details of their extortionate proposal: They will publish the personal photos unless Gavin de Becker and I make the specific false public statement to the press that we 'have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI's coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.'\n\nIn an explosive tell-all blog post published Thursday afternoon, Jeff Bezos accused the publisher of the National Enquirer of trying to extort him.\n\nSome of Bezos' text messages were made public last month. Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, are getting divorced after 25 years of marriage.\n\nHoward and AMI deputy general counsel Jon Fine did not immediately respond to CNN Business' requests for comment. Neither did a spokesperson for the Washington Post. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment other than to confirm that Bezos wrote the post.\n\nRival investigations\n\nAfter Bezos made his divorce plans public, the National Enquirer said it had been investigating Bezos for four months , claiming it had evidence that Bezos has been \"whisking his mistress off to exotic destinations on his $65 million private jet.\" The Enquirer and other outlets identified the woman as Lauren Sanchez , a former anchor for Fox's local station in Los Angeles.\n\nGavin de Becker, whom the Washington Post described as \"Bezos' longtime private security consultant,\" has been conducting an investigation to determine the source of the leaks to the Enquirer.\n\nEarlier this week, de Becker told the Post that he believed the Enquirer's reporting about Bezos was sparked by a \"politically motivated\" leak, and told the Post and the Daily Beast that his investigation had looked at Michael Sanchez, Lauren Sanchez's brother, who is connected to a number of associates of President Donald Trump. Sanchez, the Post reported, \"firmly denies playing any role in the revelation of his sister's affair.\" Michael Sanchez did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nIn his blog post, Bezos said that \"an AMI leader advised us\" that Pecker was \"apoplectic\" about de Becker's investigation.\n\nAMI threatens Bezos\n\nBezos included an email from Howard to de Becker's lawyer. In the email, Howard wrote that he had evidence of 10 photographs of Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, including nude selfies. In his introduction to his descriptions of the photos, Howard appeared to make reference to an upcoming Post article that quoted de Becker.\n\n\"(W)ith The Washington Post poised to publish unsubstantiated rumors of The National Enquirer's initial report, I wanted to describe to you the photos obtained during our newsgathering.\"\n\nThen, in an email to de Becker's attorney, AMI Deputy General Counsel Jon Fine referenced Bezos' investigation and the Post's reporting.\n\n\"It is our understanding that your client's representatives, including the Washington Post, continue to pursue and to disseminate these false and spurious allegations in a manner that is injurious to American Media and its executives,\" Fine said in the email. \"Accordingly, we hereby demand that you cease and desist such defamatory conduct immediately. Any further dissemination of these false, vicious, speculative and unsubstantiated statements is done at your client's peril.\"\n\nBezos called the exchanges an \"extortionate proposal.\"\n\nPecker has b ecome a public name because of his association with President Donald Trump. Pecker was granted immunity in a federal investigation into former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. In exchange, Pecker agreed to provide federal prosecutors information on hush money deals.\n\nCohen admitted that he made payments to AMI, which in turn paid women who claim they had affairs with Trump. AMI purchased the rights to the women's stories but never published them \u2014 a technique known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\n-- CNN Business' Heather Kelly and Oliver Darcy contributed to this report."

    "text": "CLOSE A divided Supreme Court stopped Louisiana from enforcing new regulations on abortion clinics in a test of the conservative court\u2019s views on abortion rights. Time\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A deeply divided Supreme Court Thursday temporarily blocked abortion restrictions in Louisiana that critics complained were virtually identical to those struck down by the justices in 2016.\n\nAlthough the court's new conservative majority may be poised to uphold more limits on abortion in the future, the Louisiana law's similarity to one the justices thwarted in Texas less than three years ago apparently sealed its fate, at least for now.\n\nThe court still could uphold the law after further review, giving President Donald Trump something to show for his 2016 pledge to appoint \"pro-life justices.\"\n\nThe action gave abortion rights proponents, as well as women seeking procedures, a reprieve from a law that critics said threatened to leave just one abortion clinic and provider in business to serve an estimated 10,000 women.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts joined the court's four liberals in blocking the law. Four conservatives objected, and new Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a dissent on his own behalf. He said the law should be implemented now so that both sides can find out how many abortion clinics and providers survive the new restrictions.\n\nWithout letting the law take effect, Kavanaugh wrote, the court likely will have to hear the case next fall before deciding whether enough abortion clinics and providers remain in business. That, he said, \"will take far longer and be no more beneficial than the approach suggested here.\"\n\nThe Louisiana law requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. That was one of two requirements of the Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down as burdensome in a landmark 5-3 ruling when Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy held the deciding vote.\n\nLouisiana officials claimed their law would not have the same deleterious effects that the Texas law threatened, thereby making it constitutional under the Supreme Court's \"undue burden\" test. The law previously was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, dominated by conservatives, including five appointed by Trump.\n\nSince the Supreme Court's 2016 decision, Kennedy retired and two Trump nominees \u2013 Associate Justices Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh \u2013 gave abortion opponents hope for a reversal on laws affecting abortion.\n\nKavanaugh, who succeeded Kennedy in October, has been viewed as the crucial fifth conservative vote. He has praised former chief justice William Rehnquist's dissent from the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, and he dissented from his federal appeals court's 2017 decision allowing an undocumented teenager in government custody to get an abortion.\n\nBut during his confirmation hearing last September, Kavanaugh referred to landmark Supreme Court decisions legalizing and affirming abortion rights as \"precedent on precedent.\"\n\nAbortion rights groups argued that the Texas decision set a precedent from which the justices could not retreat. The opinion by Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, in which Kennedy joined the court's liberals, said the law would force too many abortion clinics to close, leaving the state unable to handle up to 70,000 abortions annually. That burden on women, the court said, was unconstitutional without equal or greater health benefits.\n\nSince that 5-3 ruling, which occurred after Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's death left the court shorthanded, laws requiring hospital admitting privileges have been struck down or unenforced in several other states, including Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wisconsin. Only Missouri, North Dakota and Utah still have similar laws on the books.\n\nLouisiana's statute was passed in 2014 but struck down by a federal district judge after trial three years later. It was resurrected in a 2-1 ruling by a federal appeals court panel, and the full appeals court later voted 9-6 against hearing the abortion rights group's appeal. Trump's judges all voted with the majority.\n\nThe justices still are considering whether to hear another abortion case challenging an Indiana law that bans abortions sought because of race, sex or disability. Another part of that law requires fetal remains to be buried or cremated. It was signed by Gov.

    "text": "President Trump took fresh aim Thursday at House Democrats, claiming they are going \u201cnuts\u201d with unprecedented investigations into his administration and businesses that are starting to unfold on Capitol Hill.\n\nTrump\u2019s assessment \u2014 in morning tweets \u2014 drew a sharp rebuke from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who accused Trump of \u201cprojecting his own unruliness\u201d and vowed that Democrats would \u201cnot surrender our constitutional responsibility for oversight.\u201d\n\nIn tweets posted before his appearance at a national prayer breakfast, Trump singled out House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who announced Wednesday that his panel would scrutinize \u201ccredible reports of money laundering and financial compromise\u201d involving Trump\u2019s businesses as part of a fresh investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged ties with Russia.\n\n[Schumer says Trump\u2019s warning about congressional investigations shows \u2018he\u2019s scared\u2019]\n\n\u201cSo now Congressman Adam B. Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so,\u201d Trump said on Twitter. \u201cNever happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment.\u201d\n\nIn another tweet, Trump said he has heard that \u201cother committee heads will do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dems and their committees are going \u2018nuts,\u2019 \u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThe Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be no time left to run government.\u201d\n\nWithout elaboration, Trump also said that congressional Democrats were \u201cstealing people\u201d who work at the White House to help with the investigations.\n\nSo now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so. Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2019\n\n....The Dems and their committees are going \u201cnuts.\u201d The Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2019\n\nThat was an apparent reference to news that Schiff\u2019s committee had hired at least one former White House national security aide.\n\nMore than an hour later, Trump returned to the subject on Twitter, writing: \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! It should never be allowed to happen again!\u201d\n\nPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! It should never be allowed to happen again! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2019\n\nThe tweets were posted ahead of hearings scheduled Thursday by other committees on presidential tax returns and family separations at the Mexican border, and a Friday session to question acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker about a range of subjects.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines Thursday morning to give its chairman the authority to subpoena testimony from Whitaker should he fail to show up or answer questions during Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\nWhitaker subsequently said he will not appear before the committee without assurances that he won\u2019t be subpoenaed.\n\nDemocrats have contended they are merely exercising their responsibilities of congressional oversight after a period of limited scrutiny while the House was under Republican control.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday, Pelosi told reporters that she was \u201cvery proud\u201d of the work of House committees.\n\n\u201cI always think that whatever the president says about us, he\u2019s projecting his own unruliness,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cHe\u2019s a projector, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. . . . Even the Republicans have complimented the committees on being wise in how they proceed in terms of subpoenas and the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not surrender our constitutional responsibility for oversight,\u201d she added. \u201cThat would make us delinquent in our duties. \u201d\n\nIn response to a reporter\u2019s question, Pelosi also defended an effort to secure Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he has declined to voluntarily make available, as past presidents have.\n\n\u201cI think overwhelming the public wants to see the president\u2019s tax returns,\u201d she said.\n\n[Trump says Democrats investigating him is \u2018PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT.\u2019 He\u2019s called for at least 18 investigations of his opponents.]\n\nThe Trump administration is also facing some additional scrutiny from the Republican-led Senate.\n\nOn Thursday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said a hearing on the deaths of two migrant children in U.S. custody at the southern border would be scheduled for March 5. The hearing was requested by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).\n\nAllies of the president have started to push back on the expanding probes.\n\nIn a tweet late Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and a Trump confidant, wrote: \u201cSo after nearly two years of investigations, zero evidence of collusion, and plenty of debunked conspiracy theories \u2014 including from Chairman Schiff himself \u2014 Congressional Democrats now want to EXPAND the Russia probe. Seriously.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, retweeted Meadows\u2019s tweet on Thursday morning.\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech Tuesday night, the president warned that he would not work with Democrats on legislation if they are overzealous in their oversight.\n\nTrump said that \u201can economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring a television interview Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Trump\u2019s warning shows that \u201che\u2019s scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got something to hide,\u201d the senator said. \u201cBecause if he had nothing to hide, he\u2019d just shrug his shoulders and let these investigations go forward. He\u2019s afraid of them.\u201d\n\nTrump also lashed out at Schiff on Wednesday, calling him a \u201cpolitical hack.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis, Karoun Demirjian and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Republicans in Congress have formally asked Democrats to stop trying to get their hands on President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\nDemocrats are holding a hearing Thursday on the importance of disclosing Trump\u2019s tax information, which would reveal how much money he makes, who pays him and how much tax he pays.\n\nTop-ranking Republicans on the House tax committee asked its chairman not to request the documents, even though federal law explicitly gives him the power to do so \u2015 and even though Republicans used that power to oversee Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cTransparency in our government is enormously important, but must be undertaken with appropriate care,\u201d Reps. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) and Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) wrote in a Thursday letter to Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.).\n\n\u201cWeaponizing our nation\u2019s tax code by targeting political foes only serves to weaken our system of government, not strengthen it,\u201d Brady and Kelly wrote. \u201cIf there are valid concerns with financial disclosure, then let\u2019s come together to legislate a thoughtful solution to require additional disclosures.\u201d\n\nTrump broke with precedent of the last 40 years by refusing to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign. And he broke with tradition when he took office without divesting from his businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for congressional committees to conduct oversight of the executive branch, but Trump said during his State of the Union address on Tuesday that Democrats should lay off.\n\n\u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWays and Means can obtain anyone\u2019s tax returns under a provision of the tax code. This provision has existed since the 1920s, when Congress enabled three congressional committees to obtain the president\u2019s tax returns without the chief executive\u2019s consent. Those committees can then release those tax returns to the full House or Senate if they choose. The Joint Committee on Taxation famously did so in 1974 when it sent its report on President Richard Nixon\u2019s tax returns to the House.\n\nIn 2014, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee used their authority under the same provision to obtain the tax information of several private groups that were seeking nonprofit status from the IRS. They then voted to release that information publicly in a letter that sought criminal prosecution of a former IRS official for allegedly targeting conservative groups for audits.\n\nBrady and Kelly were members of Ways and Means in 2014, as were several other Republicans currently on the committee.\n\nAt the hearing, a panel of four expert witnesses testified that the committee has broad authority to request tax returns from the president or anyone else. But Republicans argued the committee had no need to obtain Trump\u2019s returns because the IRS is mandated to audit them and the president already has to make other financial disclosures.\n\nThe witnesses, however, argued that Congress sought Nixon\u2019s tax returns because they did not trust the IRS to properly audit the president\u2019s taxes without undue influence, and because tax returns contain different information than what\u2019s required by mandatory financial disclosures.\n\nRepresentatives for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have said he would review any requests \u201cfor legality,\u201d suggesting the Trump administration would defy Congress \u2015 and defy the law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any wiggle room in the statute for the secretary to refuse a request,\u201d George Yin, a tax expert at the University of Virginia Law School, testified."

    "text": "Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is considering running for president as an independent.(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nANALYSIS \u2014 The frenzy over businessman Howard Schultz\u2019s announcement that he is considering an independent run for president is understandable.\n\nDemocrats think President Donald Trump is headed for defeat in a one-on-one general election contest, and anything that changes that trajectory improves his re-election prospects.\n\nUnfortunately, few of the people who panicked about Schultz \u2014 or praised him \u2014 seemed to look at the numbers. So, let\u2019s do just that.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s stipulate that if he runs, Schultz will position himself as fiscally conservative and socially progressive. He\u2019ll stress his business credentials, pragmatic approach, centrist views, commitment to tolerance and diversity, and frustration with the two parties.\n\nLet\u2019s also note that Schultz has very deep pockets and would be the ultimate outsider and disruptor, giving him appeal to many voters, especially if the Democrats nominate an extreme liberal.\n\nLet\u2019s also acknowledge that American politics has become something less than predictable.\n\nThe impossible has already happened, so something else impossible could happen again.\n\nBut while more than four in ten Americans identify as independents, let\u2019s not get carried away about Schultz\u2019s chances.\n\nMany independents are closet partisans, just as many \u201cweak\u201d partisans actually vote as if they are strong Republicans or strong Democrats. That\u2019s just how people behave.\n\nThey like to think of themselves as more independent than they really are.\n\nWith Schultz positioning himself as a moderate and independent, he\u2019s unlikely to find support among partisans and the most ideological.\n\nThose voters are strongly attached to one of the two parties, and his moderate message won\u2019t resonate with them.\n\nAlso watch: Elizabeth Warren is running for president \u2014 Here are some congressional basics\n\nMapping it up\n\nO.K., let\u2019s turn to the numbers \u2014 that is, to the states.\n\nThe national election actually is a collection of state contests, with the winner needing 270 electoral votes.\n\nFor years, Gallup has ranked states on the basis of a number of measures, including Trump\u2019s job approval/disapproval, self-identification as Republican/Democrat or independent-leaning Republican/Democrat, self-identification as conservative/liberal, and religiosity.\n\nI\u2019ve gone through the lists and identified nine states plus the District of Columbia, with 139 electoral votes, that are among both the most liberal and the most Democratic: California, Connecticut, D.C., Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\n\nVoters in these states would be less likely to find Schultz\u2019s positioning appealing. (The list does not include five states that made one list but not both: Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey and New Mexico.)\n\nI found 16 states, with 96 electoral votes, that are among the most conservative and the most Republican: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming.\n\nThese states would be even less likely to vote for Schultz than would the liberal/Democratic states because of Schultz\u2019s very limited appeal in rural, socially conservative areas. (Again, this list does not include three states that made one list but not both: Alaska, Louisiana and West Virginia.)\n\nThe two lists of the most partisan and ideological states account for 235 electoral votes, leaving Schultz and the two major party nominees to compete for 303 electoral votes, 30 more than needed for a victory.\n\nSchultz would need to win 270 of the remaining 303 available.\n\nIn other words, he\u2019d need to virtually sweep the \u201ccompetitive\u201d states.\n\nBut remember, the so-called competitive list includes Alaska (3 electoral votes), Hawaii (4), Illinois (20), Louisiana (10), Maine (4), New Jersey (14), New Mexico (5) and West Virginia (5), which make either the most partisan or the most ideological list, but not both.\n\nMany or all of these states would be difficult \u2014 or impossible, in the case of West Virginia \u2014 for Schultz. (For convenience sake, I have assumed Nebraska\u2019s and Maine\u2019s electoral votes are not split.)\n\nSome \u201ccompetitive\u201d states that didn\u2019t make either list for partisanship or ideology also seem like a stretch for Schultz, including Georgia, Indiana, North Carolina and Texas.\n\nCulturally, Schultz seems most out of touch with the Trump states, which limits his options about where to compete. Does anyone really think that he is going to carry the Deep South, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma or Idaho?\n\nHis only hope of getting 270 electoral votes is to swipe states like New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Connecticut from the Democratic nominee, and to win swing, suburban states that are clearly trending Democratic, including Colorado and Virginia.\n\nHouse always wins\n\nTo the extent that he can do that, he all but destroys the Democratic nominee\u2019s chances. But what if Schultz fails to reach 270 electoral votes but does well enough to deny an electoral vote majority to either of the major party nominees? In that case, the House would select the next president (with each state getting one vote), and that would be Donald Trump.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a majority of 26 House delegations, to 22 for the Democrats. Two states (Michigan and Pennsylvania) have equal numbers of Republican and Democratic members, so they would not vote. But might not GOP House members faced with four more years of Trump look for another option, like Schultz?\n\nNo. That wouldn\u2019t happen. Partisans behave like partisans, and House Republicans are not an independent, centrist bunch.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that voters will take a look at Schultz and decide that they don\u2019t like him, don\u2019t want him as president or regard him as little more than a spoiler.\n\nA year from now, everyone may be wondering why anyone got excited about a Howard Schultz candidacy.\n\nBut it is more likely that, if he runs, Schultz becomes a factor in the 2020 presidential contest, if only because of his resources and the extreme positioning of the two parties.\n\nA detailed look at state politics suggests that Schultz\u2019s chances of winning the presidency outright are small, probably microscopic.\n\nIf he has any impact, it will be among suburban voters, a group that was significantly more Democratic in 2018 than in 2016.\n\nSchultz isn\u2019t likely to have much appeal among Trump\u2019s rural, culturally conservative, white evangelical base. And that means he would be likely to do much greater damage to the Democratic nominee\u2019s vote than to Trump\u2019s. And that\u2019s why Democrats have reason to be worried about Schultz\u2019s candidacy.\n\n(Note to readers: If this column seems vaguely familiar, it may be because you may recall a similar analysis in my Feb. 16, 2016 column about Michael Bloomberg.)"

The Russians allegedly ran the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm that used social media to serve divisive content to U.S. audiences before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTwo Washington-based lawyers are now defending the alleged funder of the troll operation, Concord Management and Consulting, in D.C. federal court. Some court watchers suspect that development is an effort by Russia to obtain sensitive discovery documents from the U.S. government.\n\nMueller last week objected to the company\u2019s request that \u201csensitive\u201d discovery files be disclosed to its employees for the purpose of trial preparation, and in doing so he revealed that some evidence had already been used in an apparent disinformation campaign to discredit the investigation.\n\nThe special counsel also wrote that lifting restrictions on the files \u2014 currently subject to a protective order issued by a federal judge in June \u2014 would expose information about \u201cuncharged individuals and entities\u201d suspected of engaging in operations \u201clike those activities charged in the indictment.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSecond, information within the sensitive discovery identifies sources, methods, and techniques used to identify the foreign actors behind these interference operations,\u201d Mueller wrote.\n\nIn a January filing, he also acknowledged an active grand jury probe tied to that case.\n\n\u201cMy hunch is that we are going to see more indictments of Russians,\u201d said Glenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe special counsel has charged more than two dozen Russians and six Trump associates in connection with the investigation. Mueller has separately indicted a dozen Russian intelligence officers for allegedly hacking the Democratic National Committee and U.S. election infrastructure.\n\nNone of the charges have alleged any conspiracy involving both the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\n\nIn Manafort\u2019s case, Mueller last month asked for permission to redact certain evidence regarding the former Trump aide\u2019s alleged lies to federal officials, noting that \u201cthe redactions relate to ongoing law enforcement investigations or uncharged individuals, and public disclosure of certain information in the submission could unduly risk harming those efforts.\u201d\n\nManafort pleaded guilty last year to charges stemming from his Ukraine lobbying work and agreed to cooperate in the probe. Mueller later accused him of lying to investigators in breach of his plea deal. Manafort has contested that allegation.\n\nIt is possible that the reference to potential targets in Manafort\u2019s case falls out of the scope of Mueller\u2019s investigation. Manafort is accused of lying about an unknown Justice Department probe run out of another district, and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are said to be investigating other lobbying firms that did work for Manafort, though it is unclear whether Manafort has cooperated with that inquiry.\n\nWhile Mueller appears to be investigating unnamed potential targets, that does not guarantee future charges.\n\n\u201cI think that oftentimes in a federal criminal investigation, things just get left,\u201d Sharman said. \u201cIn other words, they simply don\u2019t get acted upon because prosecutors decide there is not enough probable cause or there is a strategic reason for not moving things forward.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment for this story.\n\nMueller has faced mounting pressure from the White House to wrap up his investigation, which is also said to be exploring whether Trump has obstructed the probe. The president has maintained his campaign did not collude with Russia and regularly derides the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nLast month Mueller unveiled charges against longtime Trump ally Roger Stone Roger Jason StoneTrump: 'The collusion delusion is over' Fox's Tucker Carlson attacks CNN: 'It's a super PAC' Tucker Carlson: Flynn, Papadopoulos, Stone deserve pardons 'now' MORE for allegedly lying to the House Intelligence Committee about his interactions regarding WikiLeaks, the organization that disseminated troves of Democratic emails before the election, with U.S. intelligence agencies later saying Russia was responsible for obtaining the hacked documents. Stone, who has pleaded not guilty, is also charged with witness tampering and obstructing a congressional investigation.\n\nDays later, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said he believed the Mueller investigation to be \u201cclose\u201d to completion. Some have questioned that assertion.\n\n\u201cAll outward signs \u2026 suggest that Mueller\u2019s investigation is still active and ongoing,\u201d said Randall Eliason, a George Washington University law professor. \u201cI think there is reason to believe something else is coming.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see any outward signs this investigation is close to wrapping up,\u201d added Eliason, a former assistant U.S. attorney in D.C.\n\nThe Justice Department said they obtained a significant amount of electronic evidence in searches of Stone\u2019s residences, and prosecutors recently requested more time to bring the case to trial. Mueller and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in D.C. are jointly handling Stone\u2019s case.\n\nMueller is also locked in at least two subpoena battles with witnesses, including a mystery foreign government-owned company that is petitioning to take the case to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn addition, Mueller has repeatedly sought to delay former Trump campaign aide Richard Gates\u2019s sentencing, citing his cooperation with several ongoing investigations.\n\nFurthermore, a federal court in D.C. extended Mueller\u2019s grand jury before it expired in January. A grand jury can be extended for up to six months, though there was no timeline given with the extension.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can draw from that alone that there\u2019s six months\u2019 worth of additional investigating to be done,\u201d said Kirschner. \u201cIt could be that he\u2019s got 30 days\u2019 worth.\u201d"

    "text": "24k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nA new report says that New York\u2019s new Attorney General is set to investigate the Trump 2020 Campaign \u2013 already \u2013 for the illegal practice of law after a Massachusetts lawyer filed a complaint with her office.\n\nAttorney J. Whitfield Larrabee filed the complaint after determining that Trump 2020 is paying the Trump Organization for \u201clegal consulting\u201d even though New York state law prohibits corporations from practicing law and can result in a criminal conviction and penalties.\n\nIf any of the eleven payments went towards defending Donald Trump or Michael Cohen during the Stormy Daniels lawsuits, then they could turn out to be incriminating payments for the President.\n\nNew York AG Letitia James won last year\u2019s election with a pledge to leave no stone unturned investigating the state\u2019s most infamous resident, President Trump, and according to the New York Daily News, they\u2019re paying very close attention to this complaint:\n\nA person familiar with the matter said the AG\u2019s office is \u201caware\u201d of the allegations outlined in Larrabee\u2019s complaint and may move toward pursuing them\u2026 Federal Election Commission filings show the Trump 2020 campaign paid the Trump Corporation $178,300 for \u201clegal consulting\u201d between June 2017 and August 2018. In June 2017 alone, the campaign dished out $89,651 on such consulting services, according to the filings.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a matter of Trump using his political campaign to perpetrate a scheme of grossly unjust self-enrichment.\n\nNew York law criminally prohibits corporations from most acts of legal services or representation unless they\u2019re a non-profit or organized to offer indigent services to people who cannot afford a lawyer.\n\nAs Larrabee\u2019s complaint explains in more detail, Donald Trump should be on the hook for his allegations because of his personal ownership of the Trump Organization, and even his sons could face jail time. The Bay state lawyer explained more in a blog post:\n\n\u201cBy allowing his campaign to pay The Trump Corporation $178,300 in 11 payments for legal consulting, Trump could face charges for assisting the corporation in the illegal practice of law. Eric and Don, Jr. could also be charged with assisting in the crimes by allowing the corporation to engage in the illegal practice of law. The Trumps are facing up to a year in jail for each violation if they are charged and convicted.\u201d\n\nLarrabee told the News that Trump\u2019s latest form of graft is also legally similar to the federal charges Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) is facing for misappropriation of campaign funds.\n\nThe Trump Organization accepted 11 checks for \u201clegal consulting\u201d but it\u2019s totally unclear what, if any, lawsuits the Trump 2020 Campaign has become embroiled in already. Alan Garten is the Chief Legal Officer at Trump\u2019s company and general counsel for more than the last decade.\n\nHowever, we do know that Donald Trump used extensive legal services from the Trump Organization\u2019s Jill Martin, who defended him in the Stormy Daniels case.\n\nIt would be extremely ironic if Trump\u2019s campaign claimed those particular legal bills as campaign expenses. His former personal lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s criminal conviction for making illegal hush money payments last year came about because they were unreported campaign donations and expenses, which is something Trump denies because admitting that they were campaign-related would be admitting to the crime.\n\n\u201cEven a kindergartener can understand this complaint,\u201d said the attorney who filed it, Larabee, to the Washington Press. \u201cThe payments went on for so long and so many instances, there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll be able to claim that it\u2019s just a paper mistake. With the amount involved nearing $180,000, even if you\u2019re a lawyer making $1000-per hour \u2013 which some of these people do \u2013 then almost 180 hours is a whole lot of work, a month full time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis guy Garten is like a Michael Cohen,\u201d said Larrabee. \u201cHe\u2019s a sitting duck.\u201d\n\nState crimes aren\u2019t subject to the presidential pardon power, and that makes this complaint a potentially potent vector of attack for prosecutors seeking to stop the Trump family from committing more crimes.\n\nRead the entire complaint here:\n\nThe revelation that the Trump Campaign paid $178,300 to The Trump Corporation for legal consulting puts the Trumps in jeopardy of NY & federal criminal charges. The illegal consulting fees could be a link between the Trumps & Michael Cohen's crimes. https://t.co/UrjdqH0W6C \u2014 J Whitfield Larrabee (@jwlarrabee) February 2, 2019\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "15.4k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nA bombshell new report from BuzzFeed News has just added another deeply suspicious wrinkle to what we know about the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and surrogates of the Russian government during the 2016 campaign. It\u2019s been established that the Trump campaign associates were hoping to get dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russians, but much of what was said in that room is still shrouded in mystery.\n\nNow, BuzzFeed has discovered that a lobbyist who attended the meeting received $500,000 spread out over several suspicious payments before and after the face-to-face took place. The man in question, Rinat Akshmetshin is a former Soviet military officer who now works as a lobbyist.\n\nBank investigators flagged his deposits leading up to and following the meeting, because they lacked explanation, came from a foreign source, and may have constituted a violation of lobbying regulations. The information about the payments has since been handed over to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, although his office refuses to say whether or not they have investigated them further.\n\nWhen BuzzFeed approached Akshemetshin at his house to ask him about the story, he said, \u201cGet the f*ck out of here, okay?\u201d\n\nVeselnitskaya also refused to offer comment on the story, and told Buzzfeed in Russian, \u201cDon\u2019t bother with questions. Your article is paid for and you have your text ready. Don\u2019t be distracted from what you consider the meaning of life.\u201d\n\nOne of the installments was paid directly by Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman whose foundation was used to disperse several of the other payments. Previously, Katsyv\u2019s company Prevezon Holdings was accused of money laundering by the Department of Justice.\n\nKatsyv also supported efforts by Akshmetsin and Russian attorney Natalya Veselnitskaya (who also attended the Trump Tower meeting) to lobby for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act, an American law that sanctions numerous Russian officials. Repealing the act is a primary goal for the Russian government and all its interrelated criminal organizations.\n\n\u201cBeyond his work with Katsyv and Veselnitskaya, investigators discovered that Akhmetshin had received large, mostly unexplained wire transfers from companies in Latvia and Panama, and payments from longtime American political insiders, one of whom is a veteran Republican operator with ties to the Trump campaign,\u201d writes BuzzFeed.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear if Akshmetshin was receiving the money in relation to the meeting, the timing is highly suspect. At the very least, this new update shows that there is still much we don\u2019t know about the Trump Tower meeting. Hopefully, now that Democrats have control of the House of Representatives and the subpoena power that comes with it we will finally get the full truth.\n\nOriginal reporting by Emma Loop, Anthony Cormier, Jason Leopold, Tanya Kozyreva, and John Templon of BuzzFeed News.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

ABC News reports:\n\n\u201cIn one email, an NRA employee appears to help Butina make travel arrangements for a delegation that included former NRA president David Keene, future NRA president Pete Brownell, NRA fundraiser Joe Gregory, NRA benefactor Dr. Arnold Goldschlager and his daughter Hilary, Outdoor Channel CEO Jim Liberatore, and prominent NRA advocate and Trump campaign surrogate David Clarke, then the sheriff of Milwaukee County.\u201d \u201cOther emails suggest that the NRA would pay for travel expenses for two delegation members and provide formal NRA \u201cgifts\u201d for the delegation to present to their Russian hosts.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that the NRA\u2019s big Moscow adventure was also extensively documented on Facebook.\n\nPhotos and social media posts make it clear that the group\u2019s former president David Keene and ex-Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke the African-American anti-Black Lives Matter politician arrived as representatives of the group, according to ABC:\n\n\u201cThe delegation of the world\u2019s largest social organization for supporters of weapons, the National Rifle Association USA (The NRA) made an official visit to Moscow and met with supporters of the movement, Right to Arms,\u201d the posts reads when translated from Russian. \u201cThis is the first time this has happened in Russia\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nStory continues below image:\n\nRussian spy Mariia Butina pled guilty in December to facilitating the trip and years worth of engagement with the NRA to ingratiate herself with the Republican Party. While there, the NRA\u2019s delegation met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the sanctioned Deputy Prime Minister for Russia\u2019s Defense Industry Dmitiri Rogozin.\n\nRogozin made headlines earlier this year when Trump\u2019s new head of NASA mistakenly invited him to America, even though he\u2019s still sanctioned, then had to rescind the invite.\n\nEven without the NRA\u2019s ties to Moscow, they\u2019d be facing a serious and potentially criminal investigation of their electioneering efforts on behalf of Donald Trump, whom they supported with $30 million.\n\nThat\u2019s because Mother Jones caught the Trump Campaign coordinating its expenditures illegally with the NRA by hiring the same company to purchase both of their television ad campaigns in 2016. Outside expenditure groups like the NRA aren\u2019t allowed to coordinate their spending with a campaign.\n\nPublic support for the NRA has waned since the 2016 election in the wake of their Russian ties being exposed and their perceived role in enabling mass murders like the Las Vegas Shooting and the Parkland school massacre.\n\nLuckily, that has resulted in an NRA which is struggling to keep its digital TV station on the air and can\u2019t even afford coffee for its office workers after admitting that it might go out of business for good.\n\nNo wonder its murder promoting CEO Wayne LaPierre and others are deathly afraid that the complete details of their subjugation by Russia could be the coup de grace for their gun rights extremist group.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "Polling on Howard Schultz for President\n\nChange Research Blocked Unblock Follow Following Feb 1\n\nThere\u2019s been much speculation about the impact of Howard Schultz running for president as an independent.\n\nChange Research conducted a poll from January 31-February 1 of 1,338 likely 2020 general election voters to assess former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz\u2019s potential independent candidacy for President in 2020.\n\nSchultz is less known to the electorate than other declared and potential presidential candidates (56% have never heard of him or don\u2019t have an opinion). Among those who have an opinion, just 4% view him favorably compared to 40% unfavorably \u2014 a 10:1 unfavorable to favorable ratio, far higher than any other candidate tested (for comparison, 52% of respondents rate President Trump unfavorably vs. 42% favorably).\n\nSchultz is viewed unfavorably by Democrats (50% unfavorable \u2014 4% favorable), Republicans (43% unfavorable \u2014 4% favorable), and Independents (31% unfavorable \u2014 4% favorable).\n\nChange Research tested hypothetical matchups with and without Schultz of Trump running against different Democrats: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O\u2019Rourke, and Bernie Sanders, with the order shown randomized.\n\nSchultz takes an average of four points away from what the Democratic candidate receives in a two-way race, while taking just 1% away from Donald Trump. That means Schultz\u2019s presence in the race makes Trump\u2019s margins between 2 and 4 points better than they would be without him in the race.\n\nIn every three-way matchup except against Biden (who leads both candidates), President Trump has plurality support.\n\nIn every two-way matchup except against Biden (who once again has a significant lead), the Democrat narrowly leads President Trump. A Schultz candidacy could pull more from the Democratic nominee than the Republican nominee if held today.\n\nWhile Schultz voters are disproportionately Independent, they are also more likely to be Democrats than Republicans.\n\nAfter the initial ballot, respondents read brief sentences about the candidates\u2019 bios from their campaign websites, including the following one for Schultz:\n\n\u201cHoward Schultz is a true American success story. After growing up in public housing in New York City, he went on to start the Starbucks coffee company. Starbucks is the largest coffee company in the world, known for treating its employees exceptionally well. He believes that the system is broken and there are extremists on both sides, and only an independent centrist can solve the problems that Republicans and Democrats refuse to fix.\u201d\n\nThis has little effect on voters\u2019 support for Schultz: when the three-way ballot was asked again, he fails to get higher than 9% against any candidate.\n\nWith Schultz on the ballot, Trump continues to hold a narrow lead over all candidates but Biden:\n\nOnce more, voters read brief sentences about most of the candidates in regards to their stances on issues, including the following about Schultz:\n\n\u201cHoward Schultz believes that everyone deserves the right to have access to quality health care, and believes there should be a fair and equitable way for unauthorized immigrants in the US to become citizens. He is concerned about the national debt and thinks the Republican tax cuts of 2017 gave a free ride to business and believes we should have been more modest with the tax cuts. He also thinks it was a tremendous mistake for President Trump to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement.\u201d\n\nSchultz gets to as high as 10% in these matchups but lags far behind both Trump and the potential Democratic nominee. He does not come close to either Ross Perot\u2019s 18.9% in 1992 or Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s 27.4% in 1912, the two most successful, albeit losing, independent national campaigns since the Civil War:\n\nWhen asked about their likelihood to vote for Schultz, without other candidates being named, 75% say that they would either definitely or probably not vote for him.\n\nA plurality of respondents (45%) think that a Howard Schultz candidacy would only help re-elect Donald Trump. While Democrats (53%) are most likely to believe this, a plurality of Republicans (40%) and Independents (39%) concur.\n\nThis survey was undertaken by Change Research to determine the enthusiasm for a potential Schultz candidacy. The data indicates little appetite for an independent Schultz candidacy in 2020 exists even after voters learn more about him. It would likely only pull away votes from the eventual Democratic nominee if it has any impact at all.\n\nChange Research surveyed 1,338 likely 2020 voters from January 31-February 1. The survey was conducted online, using Change Research\u2019s Bias Correct Engine. Post-stratification was done on age, gender, ethnicity, and 2016 presidential vote. The margin of error as traditionally calculated is +/-2.7%.\n\nThis is one of over 100 polls Change Research will be conducting this year on the 2020 election, via 2020 Change. Most will be available to subscribers only. Please contact us for more information about 2020 Change.\n\nContact: Pat Reilly, patr@changeresearch.com"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The Trump administration announced Friday that it would suspend its obligations under a decades old Cold War arms control pact with Russia on Saturday, citing Moscow's violations of the treaty.\n\nThe White House announced the decision to stop complying with the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in a statement from President Trump Donald John TrumpMigrants cleared from enclosure beneath El Paso bridge after outcry North Korea calls for probe into 'terror attack' on embassy in Spain Buttigieg: 'I have enormous respect' for Hillary Clinton MORE early Friday, just before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addressed the move in remarks from the State Department.\n\n\u201cRussia has refused to take any steps to return to real and verifiable compliance over these 60 days,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe United States will therefore suspend its obligations under the INF Treaty effective Feb. 2, and we will provide Russia and the other treaty parties with formal notice that the United States is withdrawing from the INF Treaty effective in six months pursuant to Article 15 of the treaty,\u201d he continued.\n\nIn his statement, Trump pledged the United States would \u201cmove forward with developing our own military response options\u201d to Russia\u2019s violations and work with allies to \u201cdeny Russia any military advantage from its unlawful conduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor arms control to effectively contribute to national security, all parties must faithfully implement their obligations,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe stand ready to engage with Russia on arms control negotiations that meet these criteria, and, importantly, once that is done, develop, perhaps for the first time ever, an outstanding relationship on economic, trade, political and military levels. This would be a fantastic thing for Russia and the United States, and would also be great for the world.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has publicly accused Russia of violating the treaty since 2014 during the Obama administration by fielding a cruise missile known as the 9M729. The agreement, signed by then-President Reagan and Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, bans nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied violating the treaty, leading to an impasse in diplomatic talks aimed at bringing Moscow back into compliance.\n\n\u201cWe provided Russia an ample window of time to mend its ways and for Russia to honor its commitment,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cTomorrow, that time runs out.\u201d\n\nPompeo on Friday accused Moscow of \u201cjeopardizing\u201d U.S. national security with its violations.\n\n\u201cRussia has jeopardized the United States\u2019s security interests and we can no longer be restricted by the treaty while Russia shamelessly violates it,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement was expected. Trump signaled back in October that the U.S. would withdraw from the treaty, citing Moscow\u2019s violations as a key reason for doing so. In December, Pompeo gave Moscow 60 days to come back into compliance before the U.S. would suspend its commitments.\n\nWhile current and former officials broadly agree Russia has violated the treaty for years, the U.S. move has nevertheless triggered concerns about the impact on the global strategic environment.\n\nArms control advocates in particular worry withdrawing from the INF Treaty could trigger a Cold War-style arms race, thereby upending stability in Europe and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cFlipping over the negotiating table and storming out of the room may have worked in real estate, but when you\u2019re dealing with nuclear treaties, the risk of misplaying your hand isn\u2019t a failed business venture \u2014 it\u2019s an arms race and possibly nuclear war,\u201d Derek Johnson, executive director of Global Zero, said in a statement. \u201cThe administration\u2019s decision does nothing to make America safer and does not bode well for the future of nuclear arms control.\u201d\n\nPompeo pushed back on those fears Friday when questioned by reporters, suggesting Russia\u2019s violations had themselves spurred the risk of an arms race.\n\n\u201cThe very risk that you identified is the one that we are suffering from today,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nA senior administration official later told reporters that the blame for any arms race would fall on Russia, suggesting Moscow was forcing the administration\u2019s hand with its violations.\n\n\u201cThe United States has tried everything it could since May of 2013 to make Russia understand that its interests are best served in the treaty,\u201d the official said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an arms race, it\u2019s Russia that\u2019s started it.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear what military steps the United States will take now that it has suspended its obligations to the treaty.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAsked Friday about developing new missiles, senior administration officials said it would take \u201csome time\u201d to make decisions.\n\n\u201cIt will take us time to make decisions about what kind of capability would we deploy, what kind of capability would we test. What we do know is that we are some time away from a flight test,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe are certainly time away from an acquisition decision and from an eventual deployment decision.\u201d\n\n\"We are only looking at conventional options at this time,\" the official added.\n\nThe official stressed that any decision would be made in consultation with U.S. allies in Europe.\n\nPompeo in his remarks gave a \u201cspecial thanks\u201d to NATO allies for backing the United States on its move. Trump\u2019s October announcement was said to have caught allies off guard, but Pompeo consulted with NATO at a December ministerial and allies released a statement of support then.\n\nOn Friday, NATO\u2019s political decisionmaking body released a eight-paragraph statement outlining Russia\u2019s violations of the treaty, adding that allies \u201cfully support\u201d the U.S. suspension.\n\n\u201cUnless Russia honours its INF Treaty obligations through the verifiable destruction of all of its 9M729 systems, thereby returning to full and verifiable compliance before the U.S. withdrawal takes effect in six months, Russia will bear sole responsibility for the end of the treaty,\u201d the North Atlantic Council statement said.\n\nThe move is likely to irritate existing tensions between the U.S. and Russia, despite Trump\u2019s oft-cited desire to improve relations with Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPompeo indicated Friday that U.S. officials would continue to have discussions with their Russian counterparts in the hopes of bringing Moscow back into compliance with the treaty over the next six months.\n\nPompeo also said the administration is \u201chopeful\u201d the relationship between Washington and Moscow can be improved, but he put the onus on Russia to change its behavior.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Bob Menendez Robert (Bob) MenendezThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Manafort sentenced to total of 7.5 years in prison Acting Defense chief calls Graham an 'ally' after tense exchange William Barr is right man for the times MORE (D-N.J.) slammed Friday\u2019s announcement as a \u201cgeostrategic gift\u201d to Putin and accused Trump of lacking \u201can appreciation or understating of the importance\u201d of arms control treaties.\n\n\u201cThrough its actions, the Kremlin bears responsibility for the degradation of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty,\u201d Menendez said in statement. \u201cThroughout this process however, I have had serious concerns that the Trump administration lacks a coherent strategy to address the threat new Russian cruise missiles pose to the interests of the United States and those of our allies.\u201d\n\nMenendez also raised the issue of the New START agreement, which caps the number of nuclear warheads the United States and Russia are allowed to deploy. New START comes up for renewal in February 2021, and some fear the INF withdrawal also portends the end of New START.\n\n\u201cWith the renewal of the New START agreement coming up next year, I strongly urge the administration try a new approach and develop a coherent strategy to stabilize our arms control regime,\u201d Menendez said.\n\nRepublicans in Congress, meanwhile, applauded Friday\u2019s move as long overdue.\n\n\u201cThe Russian government has had endless opportunities to change their bad behavior, and over the past 60 days has proven its disinterest in doing so,\u201d Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch James (Jim) Elroy RischChris Evans plans politics website 'to create informed, responsible and empathetic citizens' Trump pick for Saudi ambassador defends US relationship with Riyadh Briefing calms senators' nerves after Trump-Kim summit MORE (R-Idaho) said in a statement. \u201cThe time has come to set the treaty aside and develop alternative avenues toward the security the treaty once provided.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 2:31 p.m."

    "text": "Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said Friday that he will seek the Democratic nomination for president, adding his name to a growing and increasingly diversified field of 2020 candidates intent on taking on President Trump.\n\nBooker made his announcement via video Friday morning. He also spread the news through a round of interviews and at an afternoon conference outside his house in Newark, where he reiterated his intention to run a campaign \u201cnot just to beat the Republicans but to unite Americans.\u201d\n\nHis news conference, which he interrupted to call out \u201chermana\u201d to a neighbor watching across the street, included numerous references to his efforts as mayor of Newark. It also included much of his signature rhetoric about the power of love to overcome society\u2019s most troublesome issues.\n\n\u201cWe used to be a people who could look at the sky, point at the moon and change it from a dream to a destiny,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThere\u2019s no Democratic or Republican way to get there. You definitely don\u2019t get there by fighting each other, tearing each other down or dividing people against each other.\u201d\n\nBooker joined a field that already included three other senators \u2014 Kamala D. Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York \u2014 as well as several other candidates. He was immediately called upon to differentiate himself from his colleagues.\n\nHarris made headlines earlier this week when she said she would be in favor of doing away with private health insurance as part of transitioning the country to Medicare-for-all. Booker was asked if he would do away with private health care.\n\n\u201cEven countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care,\u201d Booker said. \u201cSo, no.\u201d\n\nIn a midday interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d Booker said his campaign would be distinguished from other campaigns by his entree into politics and his continued residence in Newark.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to see a very different, not usual path,\u201d he said of voters.\n\nBooker also emphasized his past work to lessen incarceration rates and criticized the president\u2019s border policy, particularly the decision to separate young children from their families.\n\n\u201cThis is a moral vandalism on the ideals of our country,\u201d he said.\n\nView Graphic Who is hoping to challenge Trump for president in 2020?\n\nLike many of his fellow Democratic candidates, Booker \u2014 who has received corporate PAC money in the past and criticism from those on the left and right for his close ties to Wall Street and Silicon Valley donors \u2014 declared he will not accept corporate PAC money for his campaign.\n\nBooker\u2019s decision to run did not come as a surprise. He has been traveling to early-voting states for months, teasing his eventual entrance. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, he visited South Carolina, the first of the early-voting states in which black voters dominate.\n\nThat same day, Harris announced that she was running for president. Booker also played into symbolism, joining the race on the first day of Black History Month, a fact he noted on \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s entry makes this the first nomination contest with at least two major African American contenders. Former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. is also considering a run.\n\nBooker\u2019s announcement came toward the close of a week that raised the prospect of a significantly more complicated 2020 campaign. Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, confirmed on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he was considering an independent run for the presidency.\n\nWhile Schultz, a billionaire, argued that both major political parties were broken \u2014 and he plans to spend lavishly to make his point \u2014 Booker implicitly defended the Democratic Party and its policy priorities.\n\nBooker, 49, has been looked at as a potential presidential contender for most of his political life. In 2002, when he made his first, unsuccessful bid for mayor, he was followed by reporters and documentary crews; a chronicle of the campaign, \u201cStreet Fight,\u201d was nominated for an Academy Award. Four years later, Booker ran again and won by a landslide.\n\nFrom City Hall, Booker became one of the country\u2019s best-known mayors, leveraging his fame into attention and lucrative investments for Newark. Months after taking office, the digital audio start-up Audible moved its headquarters to Newark. Months after Booker won a second term, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg plowed $100 million into a fund to improve the city\u2019s schools.\n\nThe mayor found plenty of critics, who argued that his effervescent Twitter presence and willingness to visit constituents at their homes masked persistent problems with public services. In 2012, Booker angered liberals by criticizing President Barack Obama\u2019s attacks on Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, saying that painting Wall Street with \u201cbroad brushes\u201d was unfair to \u201cthe good people who work there.\u201d\n\nBut in 2013, when the death of Frank Lautenberg opened one of New Jersey\u2019s U.S. Senate seats, Booker zoomed through a special election and won easily, with a donor list that included Ivanka Trump. Booker was the first black Democrat to join the chamber since Obama had left it, and he quickly established himself as a business-friendly liberal.\n\nAfter winning a full term in 2014, Booker began to make moves on the left. He broke with Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) to back Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran and helped protect states that had legalized medical marijuana.\n\nIn 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) quietly vetted Booker as a potential running mate. In 2017, Booker endorsed Sanders\u2019s Medicare-for-all heath-care plan, as well as legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nDespite that, Booker has been viewed skeptically by his party\u2019s left and been ridiculed by conservatives, who say his image has been carefully manufactured.\n\nBooker is the rare bachelor to seek the presidency; none has been elected since 1856.\n\nIn his announcement video sent to supporters, Booker talked of his upbringing in New Jersey, one that he noted distinguishes him from the rest of the Senate \u2014 as well as his competitors in the presidential race.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a baby, my parents tried to move us into a neighborhood with great public schools, but Realtors wouldn\u2019t sell us a home because of the color of our skin,\u201d he said. \u201cA group of white lawyers, who had watched the courage of civil rights activists, were inspired to help black families in their own community, including mine. And they changed the course of my entire life. Because in America, courage is contagious.\n\n\u201cMy dad told me, \u2018Boy, never forget where you came from or how many people had to sacrifice to get you where you are.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost"

    "text": "The massive leak of documents known as the Panama Papers illustrates how Donald J. Trump and others seek to profit off his very name alone.\n\nThe real estate mogul and billionaire doesn\u2019t appear to be the direct owner of any offshore company formed by Mossack Fonseca, the Panamanian law firm that is now the subject of multiple investigations after its documents were leaked to journalists.\n\nThe Trump name shows up on 3,540 of those leaked documents, many shedding light on what has become a business model. Some of his associates and business partners are also in the files.\n\nEarly in his career, Trump developed properties. Over the decades, he has increasingly let others invest the capital and take the risks. He sells them his name and reputation, and is paid millions in return.\n\nThat\u2019s the case with the Trump Ocean Club International Hotel & Tower in Panama. In the law firm\u2019s files, it is the most frequent association with Trump\u2019s name, since his business partners in the project appear as buyers of condo units, some of whom create offshore shell companies with Mossack Fonseca for the purchase.\n\nMore on that shortly.\n\nSome Trumps aren\u2019t Trumps\n\nMcClatchy's reporters are among 400 journalists across the globe coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that are searching the leaked law firm's documents. The 11.5 million files contain emails, financial information, passports and incorporation papers for offshore companies.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate has disclosed that he has 515 companies, with 378 registered in Delaware, he said last week while campaigning.\n\nIn many cases, others, like Trump, seek to capitalize on his famous name.\n\nTrump Wise Investment Ltd. was created by the Hong Kong firm Instant Companies Limited and registered in the British Virgin Islands from 1998 to late 2005. The secret documents show Mossack Fonseca did not even know who the shareholders were.\n\nSimilarly, Trump World Capital Ltd in the British Virgin Islands was opened in late 2006 by Mossack Fonseca\u2019s Singapore office. It remains active, with shareholders listing addresses in Palembang, Indonesia. One shareholder is a young woman whose LinkedIn profile describes her as merchandising supervisor at a small clothing retailer.\n\nNeither of these appear to be connected to Trump in any way.\n\nSHARE COPY LINK Offshore corporations have one main purpose - to create anonymity. Recently leaked documents reveal that some of these shell companies, cloaked in secrecy, provide cover for dictators, politicians and tax evaders.\n\nBrand Trump\n\nTrump is distinctive because his name, in many ways, is actually his business. His name is a brand, synonymous with both luxury and brashness. The simple use of his name garners licensing fees and royalties. Panama offered him entry into a new line of business for the Trump empire \u2014waterfront resorts in Central America.\n\nIn a promotional video ahead of the opening on July 6, 2011, Trump said he fell in love with the country during one of the Miss Universe contests he owned.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re now doing a great, great project in Panama that\u2019s selling like hotcakes, and I think it\u2019s one of the most beautiful buildings in the world,\u201d Trump said, speaking in the collective and sounding like an investor. \u201cSo I\u2019m really honored to be involved in Panama.\u201d\n\nHowever, the fine print on the resort\u2019s webpage, reveals the hallmark of Trump\u2019s business model.\n\n\u201cTrump Ocean Club International Hotel & Tower Panama is not owned, developed or sold by Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization or any of their principals or affiliates,\u201d it reads. \u201cNewland International Properties, Corp., the owner and developer of the property, uses the \u2018Trump\u2019 name and mark under license from Trump Marks Panama LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.\u201d\n\nNewland, the project developer, paid Trump for the right to have his name splashed all over the 70-story mega condo, hotel, marina and casino constructed in the shape of massive sail. A draft contract found in the secret files suggests Trump also gets from Newland a small percentage from every condo sold, something later confirmed by the original developer.\n\nTo ensure that the hotel meets his quality standards, Delaware-based Trump Panama Hotel Management LLC manages the hotel operations. And K Group, owned by developer Newland, pays Trump Marks Panama about $5 million annually for the Trump name, the candidate\u2019s financial disclosures show.\n\n\u201cYou know Donald Trump. First it\u2019s we, we, we, we, but after a while it\u2019s me, me, me, me,\u201d said Roger Khafif, who had the vision for the project and ran the company that developed the Trump resort. \u201cThat\u2019s the art of the deal.\u201d\n\nNewland raised about $220 million in bond sales to fund the resort\u2019s construction, but the bonds were downgraded just months after the ribbon-cutting ceremony. By 2013, the developer of the luxury resort that bore Trump\u2019s name \u2014 despite his having little financial investment \u2014filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to restructure what it owed bondholders.\n\nThe bankruptcy affected Trump's licensing fees, according to an Oct. 11, 2015, report by the Associated Press that said Trump's total payout remained between $32 million and $55 million. The upper-end figure suggests his payment consumed a quarter of the money raised from the bonds.\n\nTrumpless in Cartagena\n\nFernando March, an Ecuador-based investment banker and CEO of S&F Managers LTD, used Mossack Fonseca to create a trust so investors could contribute to projects such as one in Cartagena, Colombia. He asked Trump to invest in a multi-use development that included two hotels, condos and a golf course.\n\nMarch said he met twice with Trump in 2013 but the billionaire wasn't willing to invest any money. He did offer the use of his name \u2014 for a fee. March even offered to change the posh Delano or Mondrian Hotels into a Trump-named hotel.\n\n\u201cHe was not willing to invest and at that time we needed someone to put the money down,\u201d said March. \u201cWe were not willing to use his name without any money. That is the kind of business he would love to do.\u201d\n\nNaming names\n\nOver decades Trump has built a sprawling global real-estate empire, along with clothing lines and even a now-defunct university program that bears his name. So it\u2019s no surprise that his business partners might appear in the documents that leaked from Mossack Fonseca.\n\nMuch like Hillary Clinton, the subject of an earlier Panama Papers story by McClatchy, Trump\u2019s ties to people in the documents or their offshore companies are indirect. Like Clinton, he\u2019s associated with people who turn up in the offshore world.\n\nVincent H.S. Lo appears in the documents. The Hong Kong businessman is seen as a Trump-like Asian celebrity businessman. Like Trump, Lo had his own TV show, called \u201cThe Winner.\u201d He made a fortune developing China\u2019s business capital of Shanghai.\n\nA decade ago, Trump sued Lo for $1 billion over the sale of a Manhattan property they jointly owned. The sale in 2005 was at the time viewed as the biggest residential retail sale in New York history, and Trump thought the $1.76 billion sale price was too low.\n\nLo\u2019s company, Shui On, owns SOCAM Development Limited, which operates an active offshore company in the Bahamas called T.H. Industrial Management Limited that was registered in 1994. SOCAM officials did not return emails requesting comment.\n\nCamilo Benedetti, an investment banker for one of Trump\u2019s partners, Yun Capital Group, provided his passport to Mossack Fonseca to create what his lawyer called \u201ca virtual office.\u201d Often offshore companies use virtual offices to give the appearance of a brick-and-mortar firm. Calls and emails to company officials in Hong Kong and New York weren\u2019t returned.\n\nYun Capital Group, a frequent partner on Trump projects around the world, and Trump are partnering on a planned luxury tower in Bogota.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign declined to comment about his partners or his business practices.\n\nHaving associations with business people who use the offshore world won\u2019t likely damage Trump politically, said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nThat, said Tanner, is because \u201cessentially he\u2019s running on, \u2018I\u2019m a rich guy and I know rich guys.\u2019 He\u2019s not trying to hide it in any way.\u201d\n\nOffshore shell companies are legal and have legal uses. But they can often be abused, as the leaked documents show, for everything from laundering drug money to hiding the fruits of corruption and tax evasion.\n\nTrump campaign aide\u2019s links\n\nFormer partners and associates of Trump campaign strategist Paul Manafort, a lawyer and lobbyist, appear in the Panama Papers too. One is a Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, currently suing Manafort and investment partners in a Cayman Islands court over a $26 million offshore entity that went bust about eight years ago.\n\n\u201cHe and others gave deposition testimony last year under the auspices of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, at the request of a Cayman Islands court,\u201d Richard Hibey, Manafort\u2019s lawyer, confirmed, adding Manafort has never done business through Mossack Fonseca. \u201cThe proceeding in the Virginia federal court is \u2018terminated.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe documents show Deripaska as the true owner of Batu Mining Limited, an offshore company opened in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and designed, the documents said, for investments in the Mongolian coal mining business. Attempts to reach Deripaska through his website and a Cyprus firm handling his offshore went unanswered.\n\nA 2009 British lawsuit names Ziad Takieddine, a Franco-Lebanese businessman, as the owner of an offshore company called Warwick Estates Limited in the British Virgin Islands. The lawsuit, found in Mossack Fonseca files, suggests the offshore was a holding company for pricey London property.\n\nManafort and Takieddine have both become involved with an investigation of an ongoing scandal in France from 1995. The inquiry was about arm sales and the campaign funds of former French President Edoard Balladur, who Manafort was then advising.\n\n\u201c(Manafort) was interviewed by USDOJ (Justice Department) at the request of the French authorities. He was thanked for his cooperation. Nothing more transpired,\u201d Hibey said, denying Manafort had any relationship with Takieddine.\n\nThe ties that wind\n\nTrump partners or customers who appear in the leak of Mossack Fonseca documents now avoid association with the beleaguered Panamanian law firm.\n\nKhafif\u2019s, the resort developer, appears by name 118 times in the leak, mostly in contracts for the purchase of specific units. Khafif is working on the other side of Mossack Fonseca lawyers to close the sale.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. We have no relationship with Mossack Fonseca,\u201d said Khafif insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t know them.\u201d\n\nBut the buyers of these units, some of them Americans, are often using offshore companies set up by Mossack Fonseca. Payments are sometimes made through the firm\u2019s trust service.\n\nOne such offshore company was Trump Ocean Club Unit 2710 Inc., registered on May 7, 2007. Its shareholders include Connecticut lawyer Carlton Hume, who couldn\u2019t remember why he and partners tapped Mossack Fonseca to create his offshore company before the project was built.\n\n\u201cThey were obviously pitching stuff to folks in the U.S. to buy in their development,\u201d Hume said. \u201cIf I had to guess, I would guess that it was the developer who recommended them to us.\u201d\n\nWhile the documents show they formed an offshore company in Panama to buy the unit, Hume said they backed out when the project appeared to be in trouble.\n\nSeeing green in Trump\n\nAn industrial engineer, Carlos Saravia was Newland\u2019s chief operating officer for the Trump-named Panama resort project. Reached by phone, the Colombian businessman first denied ever working with the Panama Papers law firm.\n\nBut when confronted with his email exchanges with Mossack Fonseca lawyer Ramses Owens, Saravia offered that maybe the Panamanian firm pitched its services to the Trump-named project.\n\n\u201cBecause they offered, and we received them, and we heard them out and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe solicited bids from various Panamanian firms.\u201d\n\nThe emails show Saravia reached out to Mossack Fonseca, even agreeing to pay travel expenses up to $2,500 for each of two Mossack Fonseca lawyers.\n\nAfter internal debate about who should go, Owens responded to Saravia. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this with the upper management. It will be a great pleasure visiting you in Colombia,\u201d he said.\n\nMcClatchy reporters William Douglas and Lesley Clark contributed, as did Nicolas Richter of Panama Papers partner Suddeutsche Zeitung."

    "text": "A bill that would allow school districts to teach Florida students alternatives to concepts deemed \u201ccontroversial theories\u201d \u2014 such as human-caused climate change and evolution \u2014 has been filed in the state Legislature.\n\nThe language of the bill sounds fairly unremarkable, requiring only that schools \u201cshall\u201d teach these \u201ctheories\u201d in a \u201cfactual, objective, and balanced manner.\u201d But the group that wrote the bill, the Florida Citizens Alliance, says the bill is needed because curriculum currently taught in Florida schools equates to \u201cpolitical and religious indoctrination,\u201d according to their managing director, Keith Flaugh.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, said that schools need to teach \u201cdifferent worldviews\u201d on issues like evolution and climate change. He asserts that textbooks now skew toward \u201cuniformity\u201d of thought.\n\n\u201cNothing is ever settled if it\u2019s science, because people are always questioning science,\u201d Baxley said. \u201cIf you look at the history of human learning, for a long time the official worldview was that the world was flat. Anything you now accept as fact comes from a perspective and you learn from examining different schools of thought.\u201d\n\nBoth evolution and climate change are well-established fact in the scientific community.\n\n\u201cIt is resolved,\u201d said Ben Kirtman, a professor of Atmospheric Sciences the University of Miami, in reference to climate change. \u201cI find this a way to create artificial doubt about the science to control policy conversation, which is antithetical to the way we do things in this country \u2026 The danger is you\u2019re going to have people who don\u2019t have a fundamental understanding of the way science works.\u201d\n\nTeaching alternative concepts would also take time away from what occupies already-packed curriculum schedules \u2014 established science, said Brandon Haught, a founding board member of Florida Citizens for Science who also teaches freshman environmental science at a high school about 45 minutes north of Orlando.\n\n\u201cIn K-12, keep in mind, we\u2019re laying the basic foundation for the rest of their lives \u2026 I want to teach them science, period,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only have a handful of days for dedicated lesson on this topic (climate change), so I don\u2019t have time to say, \u2018This is what other people think.\u2019\u201d\n\nBaxley\u2019s bill also touches on history lessons, requiring that \u201cgovernment and civics content shall strictly adhere to the founding values and principles of the United States.\u201d\n\nBaxley is known as a lightning rod for contentious issues, running bills in the past from everything to allowing guns in churches to banning designated protest areas called \u201cfree speech zones\u201d on college campuses. He was also one of the authors of the 2005 \u201cstand your ground\u201d bill. Flaugh said that language is designed to guard against certain textbooks, such as those made by the textbook giant Pearson, which he argues are \u201cteaching Socialism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re actually undermining our principles and values,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the biggest things they do is they\u2019re teaching our kids that the Electoral College is out-of-date. That\u2019s the only vestige of our Constitutional republic that\u2019s left.\u201d\n\nThe bill would allow school boards to adopt a core curriculum that differs from the state\u2019s current state standards, as long as they are \u201cequivalent to or more rigorous\u201d in terms of difficulty.\n\nThis bill was also filed last year and has a long road ahead with four committee assignments in the Senate. Flaugh said he expects a House version to be filed shortly.\n\nBut the Alliance\u2019s priorities will have a better shot this year than they ever have.\n\nThat\u2019s because this group has been gaining influence in the state for the past few years, going from a grassroots movement in the Naples area to advising Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nFlaugh and another member of the Florida Citizens Alliance were appointed to DeSantis\u2019 committee that advised his transition team on education. Flaugh said he and another leader of the group met with DeSantis during his primary campaign.\n\nIn 2017, the group successfully got another bill passed, which created a process for all community members \u2014 rather than just parents of public school students \u2014 to object to textbooks and other classroom materials being taught in each school district. It also required districts to make public its list of educational materials.\n\nFlaugh said the group has grown its mailing list from 20,000 people to 50,000 in the past 18 months. And they\u2019re continuing to grow \u201ccommunity watchdog teams\u201d in different Florida counties to evaluate social studies textbooks and file challenges with the districts.\n\nHe pointed to DeSantis\u2019 three conservative picks for the state Supreme Court as well as the appointment of Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran as reasons that support for the educational policies of the Alliance will continue to grow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for six years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m more optimistic now than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d"

    "text": "\"[T]hey have unbelievable vehicles. They make a lot of money. They have the best vehicles you can buy. They have stronger, bigger and faster vehicles than our police have and than ICE has, and the Border Patrol have.\"\n\nWhen making his case for a giant border wall, Donald Trump has turned to a variety of strange talking points. At a White House event earlier this month, for example, the president marveled at the quality of the vehicles used by human traffickers\n\nAbout a week later, Trump published a tweet intended to raise public anxieties about activities at the U.S./Mexico border.\n\n\"Border rancher: 'We've found prayer rugs out here. It's unreal.' Washington Examiner People coming across the Southern Border from many countries, some of which would be a big surprise.\"\n\nLast week, the Republican turned to one of his go-to stories, which he's peddled many times.\n\n\"Human traffickers -- the victims are women and children. Maybe to a lesser extent, believe or not, children. Women are tied up. They're bound. Duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths. In many cases, they can't even breathe. They're put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks.\"\n\nIt's tempting to dismiss all of this as just another round of nonsense from a president who too often has no idea what he's saying, but in this case, these three Trump talking points have two things in common.\n\nFirst, they're demonstrably false. There's nothing especially amazing about smugglers' vehicles; there's no evidence at all of prayer rugs being found in the dirt by the border (in fact, the whole idea is kind of silly); and experts have marveled at how bizarre Trump's claims are about women tied up with tape.\n\nSecond, each of these appeared in a recent fictional movie.\n\nNo, seriously. As Rachel noted on the show last night, there's a movie called Sicario:\n\nDay of the Soldado, which was released last summer, and which included a woman being tied up with tape, smugglers driving vast vehicles, and officials finding prayer rugs in the dirt near the border.\n\nAgain, just so we're all clear, the movie is real, but the story is fictional. The script was written by screenwriters, not documentarians. The plot of the film is made up, as are the characters and developments that unfolded on screen.\n\nAs Rachel added, \"In a normal administration, it would be insane to suggest\" the president of the United States saw stuff in a movie and maybe thought it reflected reality. And who knows, maybe it's just a coincidence.\n\nBut let's not miss the forest for the trees: Donald Trump's observations about the border are so at odds with reality that there are reasonable questions as to how in the world he even came up with such strange ideas.\n\nI can't say with any certainty whether the president took a fictional movie a little too seriously, but that's not really the point. Rather, what matters is that we're left to wonder how and why Trump comes up with these stories, which he peddles to the public, despite being wrong."

    "text": "In the first 24 hours since Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) announced her 2020 bid, the senator raised $1.5 million in online contributions from more than 38,000 individual donors, according to her aides. The Wall Street Journal first reported the figures.\n\nAround $1 million of that was raised in the first 12 hours of her candidacy alone; and the average contribution from all donors was $37.\n\nIn 2015, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), another big small-dollar fundraiser, reported raking in more than $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of his 2016 campaign. That haul came from a reported 35,000 individual donors, which would put him just behind Harris\u2019 donor tally in the first 24 hours\u2014a tally the Harris campaign believes could constitute the most individual online donors ever in the first day of a campaign.\n\nFurthermore, Harris aides said the campaign made more than $110,000 in revenue from the senator\u2019s online store in 12 hours, and received an individual online contribution from every state in the first 30 minutes after she announced her bid. The campaign also claimed its email list grew by 20 percent on Monday, and her official announcement video, which teased an upcoming rally in Oakland, was viewed at least six million times.\n\n\u201cThese numbers reveal a campaign powered by the people\u2014an energetic, nationwide movement eager to elect Senator Harris and support her vision of an America that actually works for the people,\u201d said Mike Nellis, president of Authentic Campaigns, a digital communications firm working for Harris.\n\nShelby Cole\u2014who also works at the firm and was previously heralded as a mastermind of Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s massively successful fundraising haul during his Senate run\u2014sat with Harris\u2019 husband Doug to co-write an email to the campaign email list on Monday evening, aides said. That email, featuring pictures that he took throughout the launch day, raised six figures within the first few hours, the campaign said."

Open the door.\u201d Watch exclusive CNN footage of the FBI arresting longtime Trump associate Roger Stone. Stone has been indicted by a grand jury on charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. https://t.co/5QHKDB2mfA pic.twitter.com/UeKo7CmXWo \u2014 CNN (@CNN) January 25, 2019\n\nThe Special Counsel\u2019s Office has filed a 7 felony, 24-page indictment which nationally recognized legal and intelligence experts say points the finger at President Donald J. Trump for directing his senior campaign staff to use Roger Stone as a back channel to online transparency organization Wikileaks in July 2016.\n\nCharging documents also highlight Stone\u2019s attempts to obstruct Congressional investigators, intimidate witnesses and lie to Congress as part of a cover-up of his foreknowledge of Wikileaks\u2019 plans to release the emails Russians hacked from the DNC and Clinton campaign.\n\nMueller\u2019s indictment connects the President and his longtime political confidant to the Russian collusion plot on July 22nd, 2016, when a senior campaign official was \u201cdirected to contact Stone\u201d just five days before the then-Republican nominee Trump publicly begged Russia for Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails:\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pointed out on CNN how this passage clearly fingered the titular head of the Trump campaign in coordinating with Russia through Roger Stone. Mediate reports:\n\n\u201cClearly it does show a connection,\u201d Clapper said, noting this was his personal observation and not a legal one. \u201cCoordination, synchronization, whatever you want to call it.\u201d Clapper pointed out the \u201cstriking parallels and similarities between what the Russians were saying and doing, and what the Trump campaign was saying and doing, particularly and specifically about Hillary Clinton.\u201d \u201cI think to assert that this has nothing to do with the president, either as a president or as a candidate or the White House, is just silly.\u201d\n\n\"I think the White House denials are getting increasingly hollow and they simply don't pass the giggle test,\" says former Dir. National Intelligence, James Clapper, reacting to Stone's indictment, the sixth Trump associate to be charged in Mueller's probe https://t.co/AcVWVGMxbn pic.twitter.com/ZRuCJkBEIK \u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) January 25, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to understate the importance of Roger Stone\u2019s indictment for lying to Congress because nearly all of his lies relate directly to his two back channels to Wikileaks, who were the recipients of Russia\u2019s hacked emails.\n\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Steve Bannon is also heavily implicated in Mueller\u2019s indictment of Stone, who asked Bannon to send him money from his right-wing billionaire patrons, the Mercer family. The CEO of Bannon\u2019s campaign data analysis company, Cambridge Analytica, later met with Wikileaks about the campaign.\n\nEven more damning, \u201cPerson 1\u201d aka \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, sent Stone written messages indicating that the source of Wikileaks dramatic email dumps were hackers.\n\nThe Washington Post reported just yesterday that Stone responded by giving Corsi a hush money gig as a writer at white supremacist conspiracy theory website InfoWars.\n\nToday\u2019s indictment reveals that Stone simultaneously actively intimidated a witness by buying off his other co-conspirator. Stone threatened \u201cPerson 2,\u201d the radio host Randy Credico in late 2017 and told him in writing that he planned to steal his emotional support dog.\n\nFor a time, Stone\u2019s tactics stalled Credico\u2019s testimony by directing him to plead the 5th Amendment in order to avoid Congressional testimony.\n\nRoger Stone personally told me that he\u2019d been advising Donald Trump for 30 years in an interview just two weeks before Robert Mueller\u2019s appointment to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office in May 2017.\n\nWhen asked about his role in the Trump campaign after leaving the post of campaign manager in the summer of 2015, Stone revealed that he continued to speak with the candidate about electoral business throughout the campaign, which he refused to tell other news outlets after the President fires James Comey.\n\nRoger Stone\u2019s indictment ties together Mueller\u2019s Russian collusion investigation by implicating multiple senior campaign officials with the people he knew that spoke with Julian Assange.\n\nIronically, Stone\u2019s lies and cover up haven\u2019t hidden anything, but instead turned into a virtual roadmap of the Trump campaign\u2019s coordination with Russia to beat Hillary Clinton.\n\nListen to this exclusive interview with Roger Stone:\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

The New York Times reported earlier this month that Trump has privately considered withdrawing from NATO, which Pelosi says would be a \"massive victory for Putin.\""

These have included the sale of \u201cRoger stones, actual signed stones,\u201d and a bizarre video campaign featuring his dogs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting case to be Roger Stone going through all of this,\u201d she said.\n\nWatch the video below.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "5.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nA Florida man who spent just weeks atop the state\u2019s electoral machinery as Secretary of State has just resigned after inexcuseable photos of him dressed in blackface emerged in the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper.\n\nFormer Florida Secretary of State Michael Ertel was only appointed to the role in late December by new Gov. Ron DeSantis, who made headlines for calling his African-American opponent a \u201cmonkey\u201d on Fox News.\n\nErtel resigned within only a few hours of the newspaper asking Gov. DeSantis for comment this morning on the egregious photographs, which depicted his Secretary of State dressing in drag and outrageously pretending to be a victim of Hurricane Katrina which devastated New Orleans in 2005. The Democrat wrote:\n\nAfter the Democrat texted the photos to him last week, Ertel, 49, identified himself as the white man in blackface and red lipstick, wearing earrings and a New Orleans Saints bandanna, and falsies under a purple T-shirt that had \u201cKatrina Victim\u201d written on it. The photo was taken in 2005, eight months after Ertel was appointed Seminole County supervisor of elections and two months after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.\n\nMike Ertel was appointed to the role of county election supervisor by former Gov. Jeb Bush only months before the offensive photos, and easily won re-election in the heavily Republican county the next year and since then.\n\nHe even participated in monitoring the 2006 New Orleans mayoral election the following year.\n\nErtel\u2019s job as Florida Secretary of State put him in the middle of the most consequential question in the swing state about voting rights after the people voted overwhelmingly to enact Amendment 4 last November, which would automatically give the franchise back to convicted felons who have served their time.\n\nThe state\u2019s last Republican Governor lost an embarrassing federal court decision after he openly discriminated against African-American ex-felons begging him for their rights back while helping white applicants who promised to vote for him.\n\nMoreover, Ertel\u2019s appointment to such a high-ranking position shows that Florida\u2019s new Republican Governor who surprised many by being less harmful to the environment is still nothing more than a typical Trump-ally.\n\nLast week, DeSantis turned around and appointed a Trump Administration lawyer to the Florida Supreme Court, who gave Trump University a free pass while working in the state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s office. Even worse the Trump official he nominated has absolutely no judicial experience.\n\nFlorida\u2019s elections have had enough problems recently between outdated equipment and out of control Republican Governors.\n\nSadly, the Sunshine State\u2019s newest GOP governor has continued the trend of turning Florida\u2019s elections into a laughing stock by appointing someone who is pretty much openly racist to be Secretary of State.\n\nHere are the racist photos of Florida\u2019s disgraced former Secretary of State via the Tallahassee Democrat:\n\nOriginal reporting by Jeffrey Schweers at the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "13k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nHouse Democrats just announced a major investigation into the Trump family\u2019s security clearances which will expose the president\u2019s son-in-law and daughter to public scrutiny.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) Chairman of the House Oversight Committee announced an \u201cin-depth investigation\u201d today, which kicked off with a demand letter to the White House for information about Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka, both of whom are White House advisors. His committee has a virtually unlimited power to subpoena the Trump White House.\n\nChairman Cummings is going to zero in on Trump\u2019s family and one other high-ranking Trump officials, forcing all of them to sit for questioning within the next twenty days. According to The Hill, the requests focus upon:\n\n\u201c\u2026officials like national security adviser John Bolton and Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser who\u2019s also President Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Cummings requested that officials from the White House Personnel Security Office who handle security clearance adjudications make themselves available for sit-down, transcribed interviews with his committee starting Feb. 11.\u201d\n\nThe Maryland Democrat sent his letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, noting that he believes that the White House covered up its contacts with Russia during the transition.\n\nCummings also says that Trump is violating a federal law requiring his executive office to give a report to Congress detailing how security clearance decisions are reached after the FBI submits its findings. He wrote:\n\n\u201cThe goals of this investigation are to determine why the White House and Transition Team appear to have disregarded established procedures for safeguarding classified information to evaluate the extent to which the nation\u2019s most highly guarded secrets were provided to officials who should not have had access to them\u2026 The Committee on Oversight and Reform is launching an in-depth investigation of the security clearance process at the White House and Transition Team in response to grave breaches of national security at the highest levels of the Trump Administration, including by former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and others.\u201d\n\nRep. Cummings worked for two years as the Oversight Ranking Member in order to assemble today\u2019s letter. Its seven-pages reference six prior requests for information which he formulated and sent to the White House dating back to November 2016, as well as two responses from former Trump officials.\n\nIn fact, all the way back in November 2016 Cummings personally warned Vice President Mike Pence that Gen. Flynn, the now-convicted former Trump National Security Advisor, would probably not pass security clearance after being an unregistered foreign agent of Turkey.\n\nBut the Trump Transition team ignored the Democrat\u2019s advice and Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, in part to cover up for his secret Turkish lobbying efforts, which resulted in two indictments and one arrest late last year right before his own botched sentencing hearing.\n\nDemocrats spent years cursing Republican misuse of the Oversight Committee\u2019s vast powers, now, they\u2019ll finally get to see untouchables like Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have to expose their secrets to the panel.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement by Chairman Cummings amounts to a sea change in relations between the White House and Congress now that spineless Republicans like Trey Gowdy have left office and Trump\u2019s toadies like Devin Nunes have lost their chairs meaning that the American people will once again see laws enforced against the President.\n\nHere is Rep. Elijah Cummings\u2019 letter to the White House:\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "President Trump has called it a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d but Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, and the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin has yielded 37 indictments or guilty pleas and four prison sentences over the past year and a half. The recent six-month extension of Mueller\u2019s grand jury suggests there will be more to come. As the public breathlessly waits to see what will (or won\u2019t) be revealed in Mueller\u2019s final report, here\u2019s a timeline of the special counsel\u2019s indictments, pleas and sentences to date, plus a few extras resulting from investigations referred by Mueller to other offices of the Justice Department, which resulted in, among other things, a prison sentence for Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nOctober 5th, 2017\n\nTrump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Kremlin-linked professor Joseph Mifsud, who told him the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos served 12 days in prison for the charge this past fall.\n\nOctober 30th, 2017\n\nTrump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and aide Rick Gates were indicted on 12 counts for a series of alleged crimes related to their lobbying for a pro-Russia government in Ukraine. Charges included acting as unregistered agents of the Ukraine, laundering millions of dollars through offshore accounts and conspiracy against the United States. Gates later pleaded guilty and testified against Manafort, his former mentor. In August, after a trial, Manafort was found guilty of fraud charges unrelated to the campaign and later pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice, entering a cooperation agreement with the special counsel. But in November Mueller\u2019s office accused Manafort of violating the deal by lying repeatedly. Manafort\u2019s tentative sentencing date is March 5th.\n\nDecember 1st, 2017\n\nNational Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contact with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn\u2019s plea began his \u201csubstantial\u201d cooperation with the special counselor\u2019s office, which recommended in December 2018 that he serve little to no jail time (the federal judge in charge of sentencing seemed unpersuaded). Flynn\u2019s sentencing was delayed in December and may not take place until the fall.\n\nFebruary 12th, 2018\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old California computer enthusiast Richard Pinedo pleaded guilty to identity fraud in connection with the Russian election interference. Pinedo had for years illegally created bank accounts using stolen identities and sold them to buyers, including to Russians who used stolen identities on social media to disrupt the 2016 U.S. election. Pinedo was sentenced to six months in prison.\n\nFebruary 16th, 2018\n\nThirteen Russian nationals and three businesses, including the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency, were charged with conspiracy to defraud the U.S. They were accused of stealing U.S. citizen\u2019s identities, sowing discord via fake posts on social media and seeking to subvert the 2016 election to benefit the Trump campaign.\n\nFebruary 16th, 2018\n\nLawyer Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch national, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contact with Trump campaign associate Rick Gates as well as about his work for the Ukrainian government. He served a 30-day prison sentence last May.\n\nMay 22nd, 2018\n\nGene \u201cTaxi King\u201d Freidman, who owned a fleet of New York City taxicabs in partnership with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, reached a plea deal for criminal tax fraud with the New York attorney general\u2019s office and reportedly agreed to cooperate in government prosecutions against Cohen.\n\nJune 8th, 2018\n\nLongtime Manafort business partner Konstantin Kilimnik, who has alleged ties to Russian intelligence, was charged, along with Manafort, for conspiracy and obstruction of justice after allegedly trying to persuade witnesses to lie in testimony. Kilimnik is reportedly based in Russia and not expected to turn up in a U.S. court any time soon.\n\nJuly 13th, 2018\n\nTwelve Russian intelligence officers were charged with computer crimes and identity theft for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign emails. The indictment details an alleged plan by the Russian government to cause chaos and sabotage the Clinton campaign in the months leading up to the election.\n\nAugust 21st, 2018\n\nMichael Cohen pleaded guilty to tax fraud, bank fraud and campaign finance violations, and asserted the illegal payments made to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal \u2014 to silence them on their alleged affairs with Trump \u2014 were directed by Trump himself, implicating the president in a federal crime.\n\nAugust 31st, 2018\n\nCharged by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in D.C., lawyer W. Samuel Patten pleaded guilty to acting as an unregistered foreign agent while working for a Ukrainian politician and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel. He also admitted to illegally funneling Ukrainian money into Trump\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nNovember 29th, 2018\n\nCohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump organization\u2019s pursuit of a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign. (BuzzFeed reported Cohen lied at the explicit request of Trump but the special counsel\u2019s office has strongly refuted that reporting.) In December, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress.\n\nJanuary 25th, 2019\n\nFormer Trump adviser Roger Stone was indicted over his dealings with WikiLeaks, which published the trove of Democratic emails stolen by the Russians during the election. Stone was charged with seven counts, including witness tampering, making false statements and obstruction of an official proceeding."

    "text": "In the summer of 2017, Trump announced via Twitter that the US military would no longer allow most transgender troops to serve, baselessly asserting that these individuals burden the military. Ex-Secretary of Defense James Mattis released the official policy banning many transgender people from military service in 2018, despite a complete lack of evidence that transgender people\u2019s service harms the US military in any way.\n\nSeveral lower courts issued injunctions blocking the ban\u2019s implementation, pending a ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court on the rule\u2019s legality. However, the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to override these injunctions and allow the ban to go into effect even as lower courts review the policy. On January 22nd, a divided Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be reinstated for now, despite ongoing litigation in the lower courts. Now, the over 8,000 transgender individuals who serve in the US military face an uncertain future.\n\nTo address this issue, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Representative Jackie Speier (D-CA) have introduced legislation to allow transgender military members to continue their service, uninterrupted by Trump\u2019s bigoted and hateful transgender service ban. Call your reps and make sure they support this much needed legislation."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "By Anthony Salvanto, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus and Kabir Khanna\n\nSeven in 10 Americans don't think the issue of a border wall is worth a government shutdown, which they say is now having a negative impact on the country. But partisans don't want their own side to budge: 65 percent of Republicans say President Trump should refuse a budget unless it includes wall funding, and 69 percent of Democrats think congressional Democrats should keep refusing to fund it.\n\nAmong Americans overall, and including independents, more want to see Mr. Trump give up wall funding than prefer the congressional Democrats agree to wall funding. Comparably more Americans feel House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is handling negotiations better than the president is so far.\n\nRepublicans are more divided than Democrats are on whether the shutdown is worth it.\n\nPelosi is seen as doing a better job than Mr. Trump on handling the negotiations over the shutdown. Partisans divide on this, while independents give the edge to Pelosi.\n\nAmericans believe the partial government shutdown is having an impact. Six in 10 think it is causing serious problems for the country. Republicans think the shutdown is causing problems, but they are less likely than Democrats or independents to call them serious.\n\nIn addition, about 1 in 5 Americans report being personally impacted by the cutback in services or programs caused by the shutdown.\n\nMr. Trump is scheduled to give his State of the Union address Jan. 29. The public is divided on whether he should give his address if the government is still shutdown. Most Republicans (and independents) think he should, while most Democrats think he should postpone it until the government is reopened.\n\nPresidential Job Ratings\n\nMr. Trump's overall approval rating has dipped three points from November to 36 percent today. Fifty-nine percent of Americans now disapprove of the job he is doing \u2014 a high for his presidency, although just one point above his previous high. The president's ratings have not varied much over the course of his term so far.\n\nOverall, more Americans say congressional Democrats care about the needs and problems of people like them than say that about President Trump. Most younger Americans, women and racial minorities say Democrats in Congress care about their needs and problems.\n\nOn specific issues, Mr. Trump gets relatively stronger ratings on his handling of the economy and the threat of terrorism. He gets more negative ratings on immigration and health care. The president continues to get high approval from Republicans on these issues.\n\nThere is a bit of difference since the fall in the president's overall ratings among some groups that have supported him and voted for him in strong numbers, but these ratings have seen other small fluctuations up and down in the past two years, and many in these groups still think the president cares about people like them.\n\nThese groups still think Mr. Trump is doing a better job handling the shutdown than Pelosi.\n\nGenerally, these groups feel the president is still behind them. Majorities of Republicans, conservatives and whites without a college degree continue to say he cares a lot or some about them. These percentages have changed little since the first year of his presidency.\n\nLeaders in Congress\n\nIn evaluating the overall job performance of leaders in Congress, Pelosi gets higher approval ratings than GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, although more Americans are unable to offer an opinion of McConnell.\n\nPelosi gets higher marks from the rank and file in her party, compared to the ratings McConnell gets from his party. About 7 in 10 Democrats approve of the job Pelosi is doing, while just 43 percent of Republicans approve of McConnell.\n\nThe Economy\n\nAmericans continue to have positive views of the nation's economy. Sixty-eight percent say they economy is very good or fairly good. Since early 2017, at least 6 in 10 Americans have held positive views of the nation's economy.\n\nMajorities of both Republicans (89 percent) and Democrats (56 percent) say the nation's economy is in good shape, but Republicans are especially likely to feel that way.\n\nLooking ahead, most Americans are optimistic about the condition of the economy over the next year, although roughly 4 in 10 are pessimistic. Expectations differ little by income, but there are partisan differences.\n\nEighty-three percent of Republicans (and most independents) are optimistic about the state of the economy over the next year, while 62 percent of Democrats are pessimistic.\n\nThis poll was conducted by telephone Jan. 18-21, 2019 among a random sample of 1,102 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cellphones.\n\nThe poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.\n\nInterviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.\n\nThe error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly. This poll release conforms to the Standards of Disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls.\n\nToplines"

    "text": "21.1k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nAs the holiday honoring him approaches, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is likely spinning in his grave after Vice President Mike Pence perverted the martyred civil rights leader\u2019s primary message by using a quote from Reverend King to make the case for congressional funding of President Trump\u2019s border wall \u2014 a wall that repudiates the very values that King gave his life to fight for.\n\nPence appeared on CBS\u2018s Face the Nation this morning when he attempted to siphon an appearance of virtue from Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech in his defense of Trump\u2019s attempts to hold the reopening of the government hostage over the funding of a wall that is rejected as an effective solution to border security by a majority of the American people.\n\nAfter trying to convince viewers that Trump\u2019s compromise \u2014 already rejected by Democrats who have stood steadfast in their refusal to negotiate until the president ends his government shutdown and federal workers are again receiving their paychecks \u2014 Pence tried to imply that Dr. King would approve of Trump\u2019s proposed solution to the crisis that he himself created.\n\n\u201cBut one of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was, \u2018Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy,\u2019\u201d Pence said, in a quote from the \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. \u201cYou think of how he changed America. He inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what President Trump is calling on the Congress to do,\u201d the vice president continued. \u201cCome to the table in a spirit of good faith. We\u2019ll secure our border, we\u2019ll reopen the government and we\u2019ll move our nation forward as the president said yesterday to even a broader discussion about immigration reform in the months ahead.\u201d\n\nThe idea of a hostage taker with a historic record of mendacity coming to the table in \u201ca spirit of good faith\u201d is a laughable proposition, and Pence\u2019s perversion of Dr. King\u2019s words in this context is a grave insult to the memory of a civil rights leader who fought against racism and economic suppression of minorities like the immigrants seeking refuge as our country has already agreed to in the human rights treaties to which we are signatories.\n\nIf you can stomach it, you can watch a clip of Vice President Mike Pence sacrilegiously misusing Dr. King\u2019s words and reinterpreting history in the video below.\n\nPence quotes from Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have A Dream\" speech to argue for Trump's latest pitch for wall money: \"Now is the time to make real the promises of Democracy.\" pic.twitter.com/oJPZEG59BQ \u2014 Matt Shuham (@mattshuham) January 20, 2019\n\nFollow Vinnie Longobardo on Twitter.\n\nOriginal reporting by Brett Samuels at The Hill.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "16k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThe extremist right-wing zealots who pressured President Trump into rejecting the stop-gap funding bill passed by the Senate in December because it didn\u2019t contain funding for his border wall \u2014 subsequently causing the Government shutdown now entering its second month \u2014 are now turning on President Trump as he desperately tries to use leverage he doesn\u2019t have to negotiate a supposed compromise that would still give him the money for the wall.\n\nTrump held a media event at the White House this afternoon to offer a deal that had already been rejected in advance by Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Senior Democrats are sticking to their promise of refusing to fund what the majority of Americans see as a huge waste of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective solution to the problems Trump falsely claims are caused by illegal immigration.\n\nTrump tried to entice the Democrats with an offer to temporarily end his fight to end deportation protections for immigrants covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and temporary protected status (TPS) programs in exchange for the full $5.7 billion he has asked for the wall after initially including only $1.6 billion in his 2019 budget request a few months ago.\n\nTrump will now try to shift blame for the shutdown to Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer after proposing a \u201ccompromise\u201d that they had already pointedly told him was unacceptable before he formally announced it on TV, refusing to negotiate with the President until he stopped holding the salaries of hundreds of thousands of federal workers hostage.\n\nEven the hint of compromise, even one preordained to failure, sent the acolytes of xenophobia and bigotry into spasms of apoplexy at what they considered a betrayal of the president\u2019s sacred duty toward his white nationalist base.\n\nOne of the right-wing extremists\u2019 most consistent harpies, Ann Coulter, took to Twitter to condemn Trump in real time while the President made his pitch public, despite knowing it would be rejected.\n\nTrump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb! \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) January 19, 2019\n\n100 miles of border wall in exchange for amnestying millions of illegals. So if we grant citizenship to a BILLION foreigners, maybe we can finally get a full border wall. \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) January 19, 2019\n\nAnother xenophobic Trump-supporting loony \u2014 Jacob Wohl, the same man who held a press conference in a failed attempt to frame Special Counsel Robert Mueller for sexual misconduct \u2014 compared Trump\u2019s new proposal to that of his unsuccessful GOP presidential rival Jeb Bush.\n\nThis bill that President Trump just proposed is identical to Jeb\u2019s 2016 immigration platform \u2014 Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) January 19, 2019\n\nConspiracy theorist and Pizzagate promoter Mike Cernovich was also disappointed with Trump\u2019s proposal and saw the political machinations behind the knowingly fruitless offer.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1086735260207837185\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1086736002104713216\n\nIf anyone still cares what Rep. Steve King (R-IA) thinks \u2014 fresh off the stripping of his positions on congressional committees after his much-derided comments defending white nationalism \u2014 he predictably also railed against any compromise on immigration.\n\nA Big Beautiful Concrete Border Wall will be a monument to the Rule of Law, the sovereignty of the USA, & @RealDonaldTrump. If DACA Amnesty is traded for $5.7 billion(1/5 of a wall), wouldn\u2019t be enough illegals left in America to trade for the remaining 4/5. NO AMNESTY 4 a wall! \u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) January 19, 2019\n\nTrump is now in a lose-lose situation. He knows that he and the GOP are being blamed for the shutdown, and now his base is turning on him for his insincere attempt at compromise in the face of certain defeat. Rather than reopen the government and then negotiating terms of any potential border security legislation, Trump plays more transparent political games and makes federal workers and the nation\u2019s economy continue to suffer.\n\nFollow Vinnie Longobardo on Twitter.\n\nOriginal reporting by Martin Cizmar at Raw Story.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "In a meeting with Mr. Trump in the Situation Room Wednesday morning, seven House Republicans and seven Democrats who are members of the Problem Solvers Caucus told Mr. Trump that they were eager to have a bipartisan discussion with him about border security, among other matters, but that he needed to first sign legislation to get government funding flowing again.\n\n\u201cBoth sides listened to each other, and believe that there\u2019s a way forward,\u201d said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey, who attended the session. He called it a \u201cproductive conversation,\u201d but added, \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we reopen the government first, for our safety, our security, our economy.\u201d\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, called the meeting \u201cconstructive,\u201d and said, \u201cThey listened to one another, and now both have a good understanding of what the other wants.\u201d\n\nAnother attendee who insisted on anonymity to describe the private discussion said neither side considered it a negotiating session, and Mr. Trump did not embrace the idea of reopening the government before the border barrier issue was settled. The president began the session with an extended talk about what he described as the crisis at the border, while lawmakers told him about the effects of the shutdown on their districts.\n\nIn the Senate, a group of Republicans and Democrats was also working to persuade the president that no progress was possible as long as the government remained shuttered. It circulated a letter that called on Mr. Trump to drop his demand for wall funding as a condition of ending the shutdown, urging him to agree to sign a three-week stopgap government funding measure to allow time to forge a \u201cbroad bipartisan agreement\u201d on border security spending.\n\n\u201cWe commit to working to advance legislation that can pass the Senate with substantial bipartisan support,\u201d said the letter, which was spearheaded by Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. \u201cDuring those three weeks, we will make our best efforts following regular order in the appropriate committees and mark up bipartisan legislation relating to your request.\u201d"

It has always seemed self-evident to me that even if I drank a lot, I would still be responsible for my actions,\u201d Rao wrote. \u201cA man who rapes a drunk girl should be prosecuted. At the same time, a good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober.\u201d\n\nOf a woman who is sexually assaulted while drunk, Rao wrote: \u201cIf she drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice.\u201d\n\nRao currently serves as head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which falls within the White House Office of Management and Budget. Trump in November announced her nomination to the District of Columbia Circuit, a powerful body sometimes thought of as the second-highest court in the country because it hears cases pertaining to government and executive power.\n\nIt has also been a stepping stone to the Supreme Court for a number of justices, including Kavanaugh, whose own confirmation hearing was marred by multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nRao is also on the administration\u2019s list of potential Supreme Court nominees in the event of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s departure from the bench, Politico reported.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Rao\u2019s op-eds. In a statement to HuffPost, Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said Rao\u2019s writings were \u201cintentionally provocative.\u201d"

Matt Stone/Louisville Courier Journal\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, one of the fiercest political critics of socialized medicine, will travel to Canada later this month to get hernia surgery.\n\nPaul, an ophthalmologist, said the operation is related to an injury in 2017 when his neighbor, Rene Boucher, attacked him while Paul was mowing his lawn. The incident left Kentucky's junior senator with six broken ribs and a bruised lung.\n\nHe is scheduled to have the outpatient operation at the privately adminstered Shouldice Hernia Hospital in Thornhill, Ontario during the week of Jan. 21, according to documents from Paul's civil lawsuit against Boucher filed in Warren Circuit Court.\n\nCheck out: This obit blamed Trump for hastening a woman's death.

It means you believe in slavery,\" Paul said in 2011. \"You are going to enslave not only me but the janitor at my hospital, the person who cleans my office, the assistants, the nurses. \u2026 You are basically saying you believe in slavery.\u201d\n\nBoucher pleaded guilty in March to attacking Paul after they reached a breaking point over lawn maintenance.\n\nMore: This rural Kentucky lawmaker is turning his back on the NRA for 'common sense action'\n\nCheck out: Man allegedly threatens to chop up Rand Paul and his family with an ax\n\nAlso: Rand Paul sues neighbor-turned-attacker for medical and legal fees\n\nPaul was mowing his yard on Nov. 3, 2017, at his home in the Rivergreen gated community in Bowling Green when Boucher saw Paul stacking brush onto a pile near his property, according to court records.\n\nBoucher \"had enough,\" ran downhill toward Paul \u2014 who was wearing headphones and only noticed Boucher at the last second \u2014 and tackled him. A medical expert said the tackle is comparable to a chest trauma that would be seen in a 25-mile-per-hour car crash, according to a Jan. 11 court document filed by Paul's attorney.\n\nPaul is suing for $4,000 in medical costs related to the attack but said the final amount \"will continue to be updated through trial and will certainly include the hernia surgery that is currently scheduled to take place in Ontario, Canada.\"\n\nA jury trial related to the case is scheduled for Jan. 28 in Bowling Green.\n\nLISTEN: Sen.

    "text": "37.1k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThree high-ranking Democratic Congressional Chairmen just issued a grave warning to President Trump for what he said in an erratic interview on Fox News last night (video below).\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump\u2019s convicted former personal lawyer Michael Cohen agreed to testify in public to the House Oversight Committee on February 7th, surely infuriating the President.\n\nLast night, Donald Trump went on Fox News to rant and rave about reports that the FBI believes him to be a Russian agent.\n\nDuring the interview with Jeanine Pirro, the President called out by name Cohen and publicly demanded the news network investigate his former lawyer\u2019s father-in-law as retaliation for his upcoming testimony to Congress about his role in Trump Tower Moscow and funneling illegal hush money payments to Playmates and porn stars at Trump\u2019s orders.\n\nTrump tries to squeeze his former attorney who's cooperating with Mueller, telling Fox News host Jeanine Pirro that Michael Cohen's father-in-law should be investigated after Congress announced the lawyer's public testimony will commence on February 7th.pic.twitter.com/0KJzrO5Xei \u2014 Grant Stern (@grantstern) January 13, 2019\n\nThe three House Democrats leading the Government Oversight, Intelligence, and Judiciary Committees, Reps. Elijah Cummings (MD), Adam Schiff (CA), and Jerry Nadler (NY), just responded by releasing a strongly worded joint statement flatly accusing Trump of tampering with their witness, which is a crime.\n\nThey wrote:\n\n\u201cThe integrity of our process to serve as an independent check on the Executive Branch must be respected by everyone, including the President. Our nation\u2019s laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate, or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress. The President should make no statement or take any action to obstruct Congress\u2019 independent oversight and investigative efforts, including by seeking to discourage any witness from testifying in response to a duly authorized request from Congress.\u201d\n\nWitness tampering is a federal crime under Title 73 which deals with obstruction of justice and makes it illegal to interfere with a witness set to testify to any Congressional committee.\n\nBut Fox News host Jeanine Pirro \u2013 a former New York state attorney herself \u2013 was all too happy to help Donald Trump intimidate Michael Cohen on national television.\n\nPirro responded the President\u2019s corrupt attack on a Congressional witness who committed crimes with Trump, not by admonishing him about potentially breaking the law, but by asking for Cohen\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s name live on Fox News.\n\nMichael Cohen\u2019s two guilty pleas in federal court implicate the President in serious campaign finance crimes and a shady Russian real estate deal that Trump denied happening for years but has since been proven to be very real.\n\nCohen is still cooperating with Mueller\u2019s prosecutors and indicated at his sentencing that he would come clean with Congress before beginning a three-year prison term in March.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s co-conspirator in two campaign finance felonies involving unreported hush money payments during key moments of the Presidential campaign, his former lawyer is also a witness against him in any future action as well.\n\nThat\u2019s probably why Trump is so upset about Cohen\u2019s testimony since he\u2019s facing a January 22nd deadline to provide documents to the House Oversight Committee about his hush money payments before Cohen\u2019s February 7th appearance.\n\nIf Trump fails to produce, he could face a very consequential subpoena from Oversight Chairman Cummings before the month\u2019s end.\n\nTrump\u2019s former lawyer began his turn away from team Trump over the summer by declaring on ABC News that he was putting his \u2018country and family first.\u2019\n\nWhen Donald Trump said that Michael Cohen\u2019s father in law deserves to be exposed, it was an unambiguous, direct attack on his family and an obvious Presidential attempt to sway his former counsel\u2019s testimony to Congress next month.\n\nHere\u2019s the statement:\n\nBREAKING: House Chairmen issue warning after #president\u2019s statements on Cohen testimony https://t.co/YF8XeLbdsi \u2014 Oversight Committee (@OversightDems) January 13, 2019\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) will run for president, she announced Friday, entering a soon-to-be-crowded field of Democrats hoping to unseat Donald Trump. But Gabbard will stand out from her competitors, not for her progressive domestic agenda, but for her support of nationalists and authoritarians abroad. At a time when members of both parties worry about the rise of autocrats, dictators, and nationalist movements around the world, Gabbard has embraced some of them.\n\nGabbard\u2019s foreign policy has become a major part of her identity. Back home in Hawaii, it has prompted primary challenges, and in Washington, DC, she\u2019s drawn attention for her support for Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad and right-wing nationalists in India. In 2017, a Washington Post columnist dubbed her \u201cAssad\u2019s mouthpiece in Washington.\u201d Around the same time, the Daily Beast described her as a \u201cself-styled \u2018progressive,\u2019\u201d raising questions about where her true political beliefs lie. As she enters the Democratic primary, the question is whether\u2014or how\u2014she convinces liberal voters to look past this record.\n\nGabbard attracted this attention, both at home and in Washington, after she made an unannounced trip to Syria to visit Assad shortly after the 2016 elections. Gabbard was accompanied on the trip by two officials of a \u201cpolitical party and paramilitary organization founded in Lebanon in 1932, and currently actively engaged in the Syrian civil war on the side of the Assad regime,\u201d according to an investigation by the Daily Beast. Her office said the trip was sponsored by an Ohio-based group, but the funds came from one of the party officials who accompanied Gabbard, Bassam Khawam. Khawam, a longtime Assad ally in the United States, is an official in the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), which has a history of domestic violence at home in Lebanon, including the assassination of the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1951. More recently in Syria, the SSNP has sent between 6,000 and 8,000 fighters across the border, as the Daily Beast described it, \u201cto help the Assad regime annihilate its opponents, to whom the SSNP officially refers as the \u2018Jews of the interior\u2019 and \u2018an essential arm of the racist Jewish enemy.\u2019\u201d\n\nGabbard\u2019s office described the two SSNP officials who accompanied her on the trip as \u201clongtime peace advocates.\u201d The trip became a PR nightmare, and she agreed to pay back the costs. Shortly after her visit, Gabbard defended Assad against evidence that he was behind a chemical weapons attack on his own people in the spring of 2017.\n\nGabbard has drawn attention for her support for Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad and right-wing nationalists in India.\n\nHer work on behalf of Assad is not the only foreign connection that could get in the way of Gabbard\u2019s higher political ambitions. Gabbard is the first Hindu member of Congress, and she has ties to American Hindus who support nationalist causes in India. According to the Intercept, Gabbard has embraced American supporters of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and they have embraced her as a pro-Modi force in Congress. Modi, a nationalist politician, has a history of fostering violence against religious minorities. In 2002, an outbreak of violence resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 Muslims in the state where he was chief minister.\n\nIn December 2013, Gabbard opposed a House resolution calling on Modi to protect \u201cthe rights and freedoms of religions minorities.\u201d According to the Intercept, Gabbard later protested that \u201cthere was a lot of misinformation that surrounded the event in 2002.\u201d\n\nAn Iraq War veteran, Gabbard quickly became a rising progressive star after her election to Congress in 2012. She was named vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, only to resign in 2016 when she endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, boosting her popularity among his supporters. This past November, she had the support of Democratic-allied groups, from the AFL-CIO to Planned Parenthood, in her reelection campaign. She was also supported by Our Revolution, a group started by Sanders\u2019 supporters after the 2016 elections, and easily won her contest.\n\nThe fault lines between Gabbard and most of her party began to emerge years ago. In 2015, she was among a minority contingent of Democrats who joined a Republican bill to restrict refugees coming to the United States from Syria and Iraq. She embraced the term \u201cradical Islam\u201d and, alongside Republicans, attacked former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for not using it, even though many see it as a way to demonize Muslims.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, Gabbard met with President-elect Trump, who was reportedly considering her for several administration posts. The two aligned on some key foreign policy goals. Gabbard said at the time that she used the meeting to discuss her legislation to end what she described as \u201cour country\u2019s illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government.\u201d Her name was missing from a letter from 169 House Democrats around that time condemning Steve Bannon\u2019s White House appointment.\n\nNow that she\u2019s running for president, it will be impossible for Gabbard to avoid questions about her foreign policy record, in interviews and on debate stages later this year\u2014a forum she has avoided for the past four years by declining to debate primary challengers running against her in Hawaii who wanted to confront her over her foreign policy agenda.\n\nSome progressives won\u2019t give her time to make her case and are already looking to replace her. The national progressive group Daily Kos, for instance, has found this record reason enough not to support her. \u201cDaily Kos is very interested in supporting a credible progressive candidate who has strong local grassroots support and wants to run for #HI02,\u201d David Nir, the group\u2019s political director, tweeted Saturday. \u201cOur community has no tolerance for apologists for murderous dictators.\u201d"

    "text": "46k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nA group of nine Republican Senators just filed a bill aimed to end government shutdowns forever, starting with President Trump\u2019s ongoing and soon-to-be-longest-in-history border wall shutdown.\n\nThe End Government Shutdowns Act would automatically fund the government if appropriations bills are not passed on time by October 1st, but reduce funding levels by 1% every 90 days if Congress can\u2019t finish passing its funding bills.\n\nAlaska\u2019s radio WTUU reports:\n\nThe bill, called the End Government Shutdowns Act, was introduced Friday by U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Rob Portman (R-OH), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Steve Daines (R-MT), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Mike Enzi (R-WY), John Barrasso (R-WY), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Mike Lee (R-UT). According to them, the bill will \u201cpermanently prevent the federal government from shutting down, ensuring that essential government services aren\u2019t disrupted and protecting taxpayers who must bear the resulting cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cShutdowns don\u2019t work. Yet we\u2019re seeing them happen time and time again,\u201d Sen. Daines said in a press release. \u201cThe End Government Shutdowns Act will hold Congress accountable to funding the government and ensure that hardworking folks aren\u2019t paying the price for the partisan, political games being played in DC.\u201d\n\nHaving a group of nine Republican Senators who want to finally put an end to their party\u2019s frequent extortion tactic of shutting down government represents a major break inside the Republican Party\u2019s three-vote Senate majority.\n\nGOP leader McConnell has stubbornly stymied all attempts at voting on government reopening legislation passed by the body just last month, dutifully enabling the President\u2019s disgraceful border wall tantrum.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that Republicans are proposing to kill shutdowns forever, since it has been their weapon of choice for nearly forty years. Enabled by a 1980 decision by Pres. Jimmy Carter\u2019s Attorney General, it was Republican President Ronald Reagan who began the political tactic of using the veto to shut down large parts of the government when he didn\u2019t get his way. Even then, critics accurately pointed out that government shutdowns cost more money than Republicans fight about.\n\nBut it was Republican ex-Speaker Newt Gingrich who turned the government shutdown into the GOP\u2019s political weapon of choice, beginning in 1990 and continuing through the Clinton presidency, which was when the GOP set the previous record of a 21-day stoppage of payments.\n\nRepublicans revived Gingrich\u2019s politics of extortion after the Tea Party election of 2010 and since then have used both the archaic economy-destabilizing \u201cdebt ceiling\u201d and the government shutdown as their twin tools of extortion.\n\nAs the 38-year history of the government shutdown demonstrates amply, it\u2019s nothing but a Republican Party weapon of mass extortion.\n\nIf this Senate GOP-sponsored End Government Shutdowns Act passes, it would represent a sharp rebuke to the Republican Party\u2019s political extortionists and provide a small silver lining for weary and frustrated American federal workers, who still see no light at the end of this dark and stupid tunnel.\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"

    "text": "No evidence has emerged publicly that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials. An F.B.I. spokeswoman and a spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office both declined to comment.\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, a lawyer for the president, sought to play down the significance of the investigation. \u201cThe fact that it goes back a year and a half and nothing came of it that showed a breach of national security means they found nothing,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said on Friday, though he acknowledged that he had no insight into the inquiry.\n\nThe cloud of the Russia investigation has hung over Mr. Trump since even before he took office, though he has long vigorously denied any illicit connection to Moscow. The obstruction inquiry, revealed by The Washington Post a few weeks after Mr. Mueller was appointed, represented a direct threat that he was unable to simply brush off as an overzealous examination of a handful of advisers. But few details have been made public about the counterintelligence aspect of the investigation.\n\nThe decision to investigate Mr. Trump himself was an aggressive move by F.B.I. officials who were confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Mr. Comey and enduring the president\u2019s verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nA vigorous debate has taken shape among some former law enforcement officials outside the case over whether F.B.I. investigators overreacted in opening the counterintelligence inquiry during a tumultuous period at the Justice Department. Other former officials noted that those critics were not privy to all of the evidence and argued that sitting on it would have been an abdication of duty.\n\nThe F.B.I. conducts two types of inquiries, criminal and counterintelligence investigations. Unlike criminal investigations, which are typically aimed at solving a crime and can result in arrests and convictions, counterintelligence inquiries are generally fact-finding missions to understand what a foreign power is doing and to stop any anti-American activity, like thefts of United States government secrets or covert efforts to influence policy. In most cases, the investigations are carried out quietly, sometimes for years. Often, they result in no arrests."

    "text": "On 1 November 2016, the liberal blog Occupy Democrats posted a story headlined, \u201cFBI Just Announced It\u2019s Looking Into the Trump Campaign\u2019s Ties to Russia\u201d that made it appear as if a criminal case against Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, were imminent:\n\nIt\u2019s official. NBC is now reporting that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign management has fallen under the scrutiny of an FBI inquiry, which is sure to blossom into a formal criminal investigation centered on Trump\u2019s disgraced ex-manager Paul Manafort\u2019s stewardship of the Republican campaign and his close ties to Ukraine. When he departed, Manafort was facing felony charges, and now the FBI\u2019s suspicions have been confirmed by the evidence. New York Times found Ukrainian documents which outlined $12.7 million in previously unreported payments from a Ukrainian political party to Manafort, precipitating his departure from the campaign.\n\nIn August 2016, the New York Times published a report that a secret ledger had been unearthed in Ukraine showing $12.7 million in payments designated from Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s pro-Russian political party to Manafort between 2007 and 2012. When the story was published, anti-corruption officials in Ukraine told the paper that they had not yet determined whether Manafort had actually received the money.\n\nThe Occupy Democrats story was based on a later 1 November 2016 NBC report:\n\nThe FBI has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s foreign business connections, law enforcement and intelligence sources told NBC News. Word of the inquiry, which has not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation, comes just days after FBI Director James Comey\u2019s disclosure that his agency is examining a new batch of emails connected to an aide to Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile an unnamed source apparently spoke to NBC, the FBI at that time had not not announced an inquiry into Manafort\u2019s activities \u2014 the Bureau, generally, does not officially confirm whether or not they are investigating a matter, and they responded to our inquiry by saying just that. Similarly, they gave no formal statement to NBC.\n\nBut on 20 March 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey broke from that practice to announce the FBI was in fact investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. During a public hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey said:\n\nThe FBI, as part of our counterintelligence effort, is investigating the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 president election.\n\nLess than two months later, President Trump fired Comey, prompting Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein, who had been given oversight of the Russia investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself amid questions about his own communications with Russians, hired Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nOn 26 July 2017, FBI agents conducted an early-morning raid on the home of then-candidate Trump\u2019s former campaign chair Paul Manafort. On 27 October 2017, CNN reported that Mueller had filed the first charges in the investigation and at least one person was expected to be in custody within days."

    "text": "Authorities in Chechnya have renewed detentions of gay men and women in the Russian republic, Russia\u2019s leading investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported Friday.\n\nCiting posts on Russian social media network VKontakte, Novaya Gazeta, which broke the story of the Chechen crackdown in April 2017, reported that several men and women were recently detained by authorities and are seeking help. Igor Kochetkov, the head of the Russian LGBT Network that has helped Chechens affected by previous pogroms confirmed to the Associated Press that there have been renewed arrests since December but did not specify how many.\n\n\u201cI ask everyone who\u2019s still free to take this message seriously and run away from the republic as soon as possible,\u201d reads a post from the group on VK in Russian, referring people to a hotline set up by the Russian LGBT Network.\n\nIn a statement emailed through a spokesperson, Human Rights Campaign global director Ty Cobb said, \u201cHuman rights violators in Chechnya must be held accountable and be brought to justice. Lives are hanging in the balance.\u201d Cobb also called on the White House to take action and help end the persecutions.\n\nIt has been estimated that over a hundred people were arrested, detained, and forced to flee from the previous gay pogroms in Chechnya. Victims described inhumane conditions and brutal beatings by government forces. One survivor, who found a new home in Canada, told BuzzFeed News he was beaten so badly his bruises had a rotting smell by the time he was released.\n\n\u201cThey administered electric shocks, but they mostly hit me with a pipe,\u201d he said. \u201cMy legs were swollen. I couldn\u2019t take a normal breath in or out because of the pain in my back. Overall, they liked to hit victims who were skinny, smaller, more attractive men.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Russian investigative outlet RBC, the press secretary for Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, denied that new detentions are taking place.\n\n\u201cAll of this, to speak in literary language, is lies and disinformation,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThere are no prisons or places of detention in the Chechen Republic that are not part of the [Federal Penitentiary Service].\u201d\n\nPreviously, Kadyrov insisted there are no gay people in Chechnya."

    "text": "New York lawmakers say they plan to pass a number of voting reforms on Monday, a move that would bring long-sought change to a state where advocates say election rules are antiquated and the state\u2019s elections are dysfunctional.\n\nVoter turnout in New York elections is consistently low, and Democrats pledged to move quickly to change the state\u2019s election laws after they gained a majority in the state Senate in November, giving them control of both chambers of the legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nOne of the expected bills would establish an early voting period before any election (New York is one of just 12 states that do not have early voting). The early voting period would begin 10 days prior to an election and end two days before it, and would have to include at least two full weekends. The bill would require local election boards to establish one early voting site for every 50,000 voters in their jurisdiction, up to seven sites \u2015 though they could vote to authorize more. The measure would take effect for the 2019 general election.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity, now that we have a Democratic majority, to include more people in the democratic process. One of those ways, a commonsense way, is to give people more time to vote,\u201d said state Sen. Zellnor Myrie (D), the chair of the Senate\u2019s elections committee and the sponsor of the early voting bill. \u201cAnyone that finds themselves as an opponent of having more people vote and more people involved in the democratic process should really question why they are opposing. This is not a Democratic increase, this is not a Republican increase. This is a voter increase in participation.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, New York was the only state to have separate primary contests for state and federal elections, something advocates said was duplicative, a waste of money and responsible for lowering voter turnout. A separate bill Democrats plan to pass Monday would consolidate the state and federal primaries to a single date. Officials say the money saved could help pay for the cost of establishing early voting, which is estimated to cost $10 million.\n\nAnother measure would permit 16- and 17-year-olds to \u201cpre-register\u201d to vote (which 13 states and the District of Columbia already allow). New Yorkers have to update their voter registration when they move to a different county, but another bill Democrats plan to pass would require the state to automatically update someone\u2019s voter registration when they receive information the person has moved.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS New York state Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins and fellow Democrats say they will pass election reform Monday.\n\nDemocrats also plan to pass a measure to bring campaign contribution limits for limited liability companies in line with limits for corporations, and to require more transparency \u2015 tightening up, but not completely closing, a loophole that allows donors to evade contribution limits.\n\n\u201cAfter 3 decades of election reformers seemingly banging our heads against a brick wall of Albany obstruction, it\u2019s incredible to see this package of election bills advance,\u201d said Neal Rosenstein, government reform coordinator at the New York Public Interest Research Group, which supports the new laws. \u201cNone of these bills should be at all controversial and have equivalents in place across the country.\u201d\n\nRich Azzopardi, a spokesman for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), said the governor supports and intends to sign the measures. He pointed to a December speech in which Cuomo called on the state to pass election reforms, including the ones Democrats plan to push Monday.\n\n\u201cDid you listen to the FDR speech two weeks ago? Then you know that every one of those items are part of his 100-day agenda,\u201d Azzopardi said. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited the legislature is going to pass these very important reforms that are part of the governor\u2019s 100-day agenda, and we look forward to working with them to do more to pass public campaign financing, to make Election Day a holiday and to ban corporate contributions once and for all.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for state Sen. John Flanagan, the Republican leader in the state Senate, did not respond to a request for comment on the bills. Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for the state Republican Party, also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter 3 decades of election reformers seemingly banging our heads against a brick wall of Albany obstruction, it\u2019s incredible to see this package of election bills advance. Neal Rosenstein, NYPRIG government reform coordinator\n\nDemocrats also want to change New York\u2019s voting law to allow people to register to vote on the same day they cast a ballot, and to let people cast an absentee ballot without supplying an excuse. Those changes will take more time, however, because they require amending the state constitution. To do that, lawmakers will have to pass constitutional amendments in two consecutive legislative sessions, and voters then have to approve it through a statewide referendum. Democrats say they plan to pass constitutional amendments to implement no-excuse absentee voting and eliminate the 10-day registration cutoff in the state constitution, but the next legislative session \u2015 the second of two in which they would have to pass those measures \u2015 doesn\u2019t begin until 2021.\n\nMike Long, the chairman of the state\u2019s Conservative Party, told The Buffalo News that establishing early voting would help boost Democratic turnout. But a 2017 paper from political scientists at the University of Wisconsin found that early voting established without same-day registration \u2015 which will be the circumstances in New York, at least temporarily \u2015 actually boosts GOP turnout.\n\nDemocrats also support legislation to automatically register voters when they interact with a state agency, but that measure isn\u2019t among those lawmakers plan to take up Monday. The first pieces of legislation likewise don\u2019t address the extremely early cutoff date by which voters must change their party if they want to vote in a primary contest.\n\nState Sen. Michael Gianaris, a top Democrat, told The New York Times lawmakers will act on more legislation as the session progresses.\n\nSusan Lerner, executive director of the New York chapter of Common Cause, a good government group that has championed the reforms, said it was significant that lawmakers were focusing on voting in the first substantive bill they would pass. She said she expected to work with lawmakers on more reforms like automatic voter registration and restoring voting rights to people with felony convictions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very ambitious to expect that the legislature would end basically 100 years of drought on election reform in one day in one bill,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThat said, they are passing what is truly meaningful reform. And it\u2019s a fabulous first step towards catching New York up with the rest of the country. That doesn\u2019t mean that there still isn\u2019t plenty to be done.\u201d"

    "text": "25.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nAs much as white nationalist Congressman Steve King (R-IA) may protest that he\u2019s simply a western civilization-supporting American nationalist, the rest of the world finds it difficult to interpret the statement Rep. King made yesterday \u2014 \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d \u2014 as anything but the rantings of a neo-Nazi sympathizer at best.\n\nRep. King\u2019s views are so extremist that even fellow Republicans are beginning to squirm in embarrassment as much as they do privately over the deranged behavior of President Trump.\n\nSenator Tim Scott (R-SC), the sole African-American Republican in the Senate, was so concerned that Rep. King\u2019s openly racist statements were painting the GOP as the party of white supremacists that he took to the op-ed page of The Washington Post to urge his party to break their silence on King\u2019s public expressions of morally unacceptable policies.\n\nSenator Scott begins his editorial with some obligatory praise for Republican stewardship of the economy they actually inherited from the Obama administration before turning to the elephant in the GOP\u2019s room. He cites Rep. King\u2019s statement questioning the offensiveness of white supremacy as an example of the reason the Republican party brand has become inextricably linked with racism.\n\n\u201cI will admit I am unsure who is offended by the term \u201cWestern civilization\u201d on its own, but anyone who needs \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d or \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d defined, described and defended does lack some pretty common knowledge,\u201d Senator Scott writes.\n\nThe senator goes on to recount multiple examples of murderous white supremacist violence that have taken place in this country over the past few years, ranging from the shooting of two black people in a Kentucky parking lot to the killing of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia last year to massacre that took place in the Charleston, South Carolina church, among others.\n\n\u201cWhen people with opinions similar to King\u2019s open their mouths, they damage not only the Republican Party and the conservative brand but also our nation as a whole. They want to be treated with fairness for some perceived slights but refuse to return the favor to those on the other side,\u201d Scott perceptively observes. \u201cSome in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism \u2014 it is because of our silence when things like this are said. Immigration is the perfect example, in which somehow our affection for the rule of law has become conflated with a perceived racism against brown and black people,\u201d Senator Scott claims.\n\nThe senator then goes on to state that his support for border security is based not on ethnicity or skin color but on his support for the rule of law.\n\n\u201cI do support border security not because I want to keep certain ethnicities out of our nation, but because I support enforcing our laws. I do not care if you come from Canada, France or Honduras, if you break our laws, there should be consequences. But it has become almost impossible to have a reasonable conversation along those lines,\u201d Scott declares.\n\nSenator Scott tries to reclaim the definition of conservative principles that he believes have been hijacked by the hateful rhetoric of Rep. King \u2014 and, although he doesn\u2019t mention him by name, also by the essentially identical comments made by President Trump.\n\n\u201cKing\u2019s comments are not conservative views but separate views that should be ridiculed at every turn possible. Conservative principles mean equal opportunity for all to succeed, regardless of what you look like or where you are from. It is maddening to see so many folks who believe this and have only good intentions in their hearts tarnished by these radical perspectives,\u201d the senator laments.\n\nThe indefensibility and unsustainability of this extremist control of the Republican party are paramount in the senator\u2019s mind as he outlines the danger these racist politicians pose to both the party and the nation as a whole.\n\n\u201cThat is why silence is no longer acceptable. It is tempting to write King \u2014 or other extremists on race issues, such as black-nationalist Louis Farrakhan \u2014 as lonely voices in the wilderness, but they are far more dangerous than that. They continue to rip at the fabric of our nation, a country built on hope, strength and diversity. It is the opposite of civility and fairness and will lead only to more pain and suffering.\u201d \u201cWe have made significant progress in our nation, and while there is still work to do, we cannot let these intolerant and hateful views hold us back. This is a uniquely fractured time in our nation\u2019s history, not our worst but far from our best, and it is only together that we will rebuild the trust we seem to have lost in each other,\u201d Senator Scott advises.\n\nHe ends his op-ed with a plea for Rep. King to change his evil ways.\n\n\u201cWe must work to lead our nation forward. In the future, I hope Steve King takes the opportunity to join us,\u201d the senator concludes.\n\nThe singular Black Republican senator hopefully will inspire at least a few of his more moderate colleagues to reconsider their reluctance to criticize a fellow member of the GOP, but in the end, a fish rots from the head, so any reconsideration of ending their silence on comments such as those made by the House\u2019s most prominent white supremacist would beg the question of how long they can remain silent about the bigotry emanating from the Oval Office.\n\nFollow Vinnie Longobardo on Twitter.\n\nOriginal reporting by The Washington Post\n\nAdd your name to reject Trump\u2019s \u201chereby demand\u201d for baseless investigation into Obama administration!"
