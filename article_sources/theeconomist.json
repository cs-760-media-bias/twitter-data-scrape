    "text": "IT WAS NOTHING like Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone. But the two-hour show on March 25th put on by Tim Cook, Jobs\u2019s less histrionic successor as boss of Apple, may nevertheless be remembered as a milestone for the company\u2014and the entertainment industry. Mr Cook did not announce the latest sleek gadget. Instead, he unveiled a suite of products and services, including video streaming, news, games and even a credit card. As theatre, it was underwhelming\u2014star-studded supporting cast including Oprah Winfrey notwithstanding. As a business case, it looks more compelling.\n\nApple\u2019s 900m iPhones worldwide, more than six times as many as Netflix has subscribers, grant it access to a massive potential audience. Analysts speculate that Apple will eventually offer them a variant of Amazon Prime, where customers pay a flat monthly fee for some combination of news, games, cloud storage, music and video, and which could possibly connect with the company\u2019s iPhone subscriptions. Mr Cook stopped short of announcing a unique subscription service, promising instead to roll out five separate offerings, some of which are merely older services in nicer packaging. Together, they nevertheless threaten fellow tech giants, Hollywood and banks.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nApple TV+, which got featured billing from Mr Cook, will offer original programming from Ms Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Sesame Street and others in more than 100 countries. The money Apple plans to spend on original shows\u2014perhaps $1bn to $2bn thus far\u2014is dwarfed by that of Netflix, which will splurge as much as $15bn this year on original and licensed content, or Disney, whose own video-streaming is expected shortly. But Apple\u2019s high-profile shows are for now meant chiefly to lure customers into its universe of apps and services. That includes subscription services for games, a catalogue of big American magazines (and a few newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal), and, in America, pay-TV networks such as HBO, Showtime and Starz. You can pay for it all using your new Apple Card, developed with bankers at Goldman Sachs. The credit card puts Apple in direct competition with banks: it has no fees and will give users 2% cash back on purchases made via Apple Pay, the company\u2019s payments system\u2014or 3% on purchases of Apple kit and services.\n\nAlthough Apple continues to earn most of its money from devices, its business in services is growing quickly, accounting for nearly $40bn of revenues of $266bn in 2018 (see chart). The new subscription offerings, which are easier to click and buy than their predecessors, should accelerate that trend. Its new partners hope to be along for the ride. Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that Apple may convert 10% of the 85m monthly users of its free News app into paying subscribers, for instance. Amazon Channels, which Apple TV channels aped, has boosted subscriptions for HBO, Showtime and Starz. Apple gets a cut of newspaper and TV subscriptions sold through its services, just as it gets a cut of sales in its app store.\n\nSome content providers are leery. The New York Times and Washington Post have spurned Apple\u2019s advances on behalf of its news service. Netflix and Disney will not partake in Apple TV+, which they view as more a threat than an opportunity.\n\nThey are right to be cautious. The future of media will belong to whoever controls relationships with consumers, industry insiders say. Thanks to its ubiquitous devices, Apple has hundreds of millions of customer relationships. With that comes the power to get more of their time and money, and to cut out competitors. Mr Cook may put on a lacklustre show, but his rivals had better watch him regardless."

    "text": "T HE AVERAGE woman in Niger has seven children. The average South Korean has barely one. The future size of the world\u2019s population depends largely on how quickly child-bearing habits in places like Niger become more like those in South Korea. If women in high-fertility countries keep having lots of babies, the number of people will keep swelling. The sooner they curb their fecundity, the sooner it will peak and start falling.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe UN projects that fertility will fall gradually and that lifespans will increase, so the world\u2019s population will rise from 7.7bn today to 11.2bn by 2100. (This is its best estimate; the UN says it is 95% confident that the true figure will lie between 9.6bn and 13.2bn.) Opinions are divided over the effects of such growth. For some, a more crowded planet will be an environmental disaster. For others, those billions of extra brains will help humanity devise ever more cunning solutions to its problems.\n\nBut what if the projection is wrong? Some demographers argue that the UN underestimates how fast fertility will decline. It has already tumbled dramatically. Data from before the Industrial Revolution are spotty but evidence from countries that kept good records, such as America, suggests that a typical woman had seven or more children. By 1960 the global fertility rate had fallen to five. Today it is 2.4. This is only just above the \u201creplacement rate\u201d of 2.1, at which the population remains stable, with each generation replacing itself but no more. (The rate is more than two because not every baby grows up to be able to have children.)\n\nNearly all rich countries have sub-replacement fertility rates: the OECD average is 1.7. Middle-income countries are close, at 2.3. Only in poor countries is fertility still high enough to fuel rapid population growth. In sub-Saharan Africa it is 4.8; in \u201cheavily indebted poor countries\u201d (as the World Bank calls them) it is 4.9. Pre-industrial fertility rates persist only in the poorest parts of the poorest countries.\n\nThe decline in fertility in Africa was recently smaller than expected. If this is a long-term trend rather than a blip, then the world\u2019s future population will be much larger than today\u2019s. But Wolfgang Lutz, a demographer at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, argues that it is indeed a blip. It happened because spending on education stalled during the 1990s. Many women born around 1980 received less education than the previous generation. The UN extrapolates from past trends, so the stalling in Africa makes its model predict higher fertility far into the future. However, the decline in education has reversed. The long-term trend is for ever more women to complete a basic education (see chart 1). After a lag (since schooling starts several years before puberty), this should allow fertility to resume its downward slide.\n\nEducated guesses\n\nModels that take education into account produce wildly different projections. Mr Lutz and his team have produced a range. If progress in education and other social indicators stalls, the global population will be 12bn by 2100. If current progress continues, it will peak at 9.4bn in 2075 and then fall to 8.9bn by 2100. If progress is a bit brisker, the world\u2019s population will peak at around 9bn and decline back to 7bn\u2014today\u2019s level\u2014by 2100 (see chart 2). These estimates are based on three scenarios devised by climate-change wonks. Both the medium and optimistic ones are significantly lower than the UN \u2019s 95% confidence range. To assess whether this is plausible, it is important to understand why some women have lots of children and others very few. A good way to start is to ask them.\n\nOumou Nyero lives in Torodi, a rustic district in Niger. She has had eight children, one of whom died. Though tragic, this is not unusual in rural Niger, where nearly one child in six dies before the age of five. Ms Nyero is 43 and assumes that her child-bearing days are over, unless God wills it. She is Muslim, conservative and veiled. Yet she is happy to discuss procreation, smiling and giggling as she does so. Giving birth eight times was not easy. Asked if any of her children were twins, Ms Nyero grins, raises her forefinger and says: \u201cNo. One. One. One. One.\u201d At every \u201cone\u201d she waves her finger around and puffs out her face to emphasise how hard it was.\n\nShe is intensely proud of her brood\u2014three surviving boys and four girls, aged between two and 21, and delighted that there are so many of them. \u201cIt is very, very important to have children,\u201d she says, sitting on a wicker chair in the shade of a dusty tree.\n\nMs Nyero\u2019s view is typical for someone in her circumstances, and perfectly rational. Her family are poor and rural. Her husband is a small farmer, one of the most precarious jobs in the world. She works for five hours a day selling millet snacks by the side of the road. Having lots of children is an investment that pays off quickly. From a young age, her brood can help in the fields, gather wood, fetch water and do all kinds of odd jobs to eke out the family budget. A local proverb sums it up: \u201cA child comes with two hands and only one mouth.\u201d\n\nHaving a large family is also an insurance policy. Some may die, others may turn out to be feckless. \u201cIt is better to have many children, because you cannot tell if you will need them or not,\u201d says Ms Nyero. In the absence of a public safety-net, \u201cchildren will take care of you in old age.\u201d\n\nThere are intangible benefits, too. For a woman, \u201cit raises your value if you have more [children],\u201d says Ms Nyero. \u201cIf you have many, even the friends of your children pay you respect.\u201d By contrast, a failure to breed carries a social stigma. In rural Niger, a woman is not considered an adult unless she has children, observes Alison Heller of the University of Maryland, the author of \u201cFistula Politics: Birthing Injuries and the Quest for Continence in Niger\u201d. In parts of the country, women whose children all die are known as wabi, meaning a tree whose fruit falls off without ripening.\n\nMarried men in Niger say they want, on average, 12 children. Asked if her husband would like more, Ms Nyero says: \u201cYes, of course.\u201d She adds: \u201cIf he had money, he would marry more wives and have more children. But he hasn\u2019t got money. So, he has to stick to one wife.\u201d\n\nMs Nyero adds with a chuckle that she pities childless people, such as the correspondent from The Economist interviewing her. Her approach to child-rearing is loving, fatalistic and far removed from the \u201chelicopter parenting\u201d so common in rich countries. Asked where her two-year-old son is, she grins nonchalantly and looks around the yard. \u201cHe was around playing here, but he has wandered off into the fields,\u201d she shrugs.\n\nNon-productive cost-centres\n\nFor people in rich countries, the economics of child-rearing are different. Rather than start earning at the age of five, the little darlings consume huge amounts of time, resources and parental attention for at least the first 18 years, and possibly far longer. Instead of putting them to work in the fields, their parents try to cram them with education, hoping they will get into a good university and eventually land a good job. All this is costly, so they can afford to do it only once or twice.\n\nChung Yeon-jeong lives in Seoul, the bustling capital of South Korea. She works as a translator for a small pharmaceutical company, but is currently on maternity leave. She is still 34, the age at which she had her one child, a boy, and one at which women in Niger are quite likely to be grandmothers. (The median age at which to have one\u2019s first baby in Niger is 18.)\n\nShe is vastly richer than Ms Nyero, but finds even one child a financial strain. She moved in with her parents elsewhere in the country for five months after the birth, because she and her husband could not afford an apartment big enough for three in Seoul, where the average home costs $640,000. \u201cWe lived in a small studio flat, which was just about fine for the two of us, but it would have been miserable raising a child there,\u201d she says. Raising seven children in a mudbrick home with no running water, as Ms Nyero does, is hard to imagine.\n\nWhereas people who are hungry think only of food, those with full fridges crave less tangible things: a fulfilling career, a spouse who is also a soulmate, quality time with each individual child. Ms Nyero never so much as mentions any of these first-world luxuries. For Ms Chung they are important\u2014but also hard to combine with having lots of children.\n\nHaving her parents to help was great, she says, but in other ways it was a tough time. Her husband worked in Seoul and came to see them only at weekends. \u201cThe idea was that he would spend time with our son or with me when he came, but sometimes he\u2019d just sit in his room and work, so I didn\u2019t get to spend any time with him, or even have any time to myself, because I had to look after the baby.\u201d\n\nMs Chung has now moved back to Seoul. Her husband has found a new job with a broadcasting company that lets him get home at a reasonable hour every night. This is unusual in South Korea, where male white-collar workers are expected to put in punishing hours and then go drinking with colleagues. The husbands of Ms Chung\u2019s friends are rarely home before midnight.\n\nThe pressure on South Korean mothers is unusually intense. Their bosses often assume that they will quit. Employers are legally obliged to offer 12 months of maternity leave, but often find ways to avoid it, complains Ms Chung. The average Korean husband does far less child care or housework than his Western peer.\n\nMoreover, the competition to get one\u2019s children into the right university is ferocious. Families spend a fortune on cram schools, despite attempts by the government to restrict them. Mothers spend hours nagging their children to study and preparing snacks so they can stay longer in the library. Ms Chung wants her son to have the best education possible, which will be horribly expensive. She would like more children but doubts that would be compatible with her desire to go back to work. Also, if she had several kids she could not afford to educate them properly, she says.\n\nSome young South Korean women go further, and say that even one child is too many. \u201cI look at my mother and how she\u2019s sacrificed everything and people don\u2019t even notice. I don\u2019t want my life to be like that,\u201d says a 22-year-old student in Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea is an extreme example, but women in other rich countries make the same basic calculation. Instead of starting to have babies shortly after they reach puberty, as women have done throughout history, they postpone motherhood until they have spent years in education and then established themselves in a career. If they have children, they typically have only one or two, because giving them the best start in life is expensive. They assume, with good cause, that none of their offspring will die young.\n\nWomen in middle-income countries (ie, most women) behave a lot like women in rich countries, which is why their fertility rate is but a whisker above the replacement level. In China, the norm of having just one child has become so ingrained since the one-child policy was introduced in 1979 that even after its progressive relaxation in recent years, the birth rate has continued to fall. Officially, the fertility rate is 1.6, but some demographers suspect it is actually lower. In India, which is far poorer, the rate is nonetheless only 2.3.\n\nStuck in the middle with two\n\nIt is unlikely that the trend towards lower fertility will reverse. \u201cOnce having one or two children becomes the norm, it stays the norm,\u201d write Darrell Bricker and John Ibbitson in \u201cEmpty Planet: The Shock of Global Population Decline\u201d. \u201cCouples no longer see having children as a duty\u2026to their families or their god. Rather, they choose to raise a child as an act of personal fulfilment. And they are quickly fulfilled.\u201d\n\nThe big question-mark hangs over women in poor, high-fertility countries. By 2025 only 1% will live in places where the fertility rate is above 5.0; however, a hefty 32% will live in places where it is between 2.1 and 5.0, predicts the UN . Some people argue that having big families is part of the culture of such places and unlikely to change. Many locals would agree, and their religious leaders would add that God wants them to multiply. But a similar \u201ccultural\u201d preference for large families once prevailed almost everywhere and has changed beyond recognition. So there is no reason to assume that it is immutable.\n\nOthers assume that the important factor is the availability of contraception. However, using household surveys in Africa, Mr Lutz found that less than a tenth of women who researchers thought might need birth control cited cost or lack of access as reasons for not using it. The main reasons were lack of knowledge, misplaced fear of health risks and opposition to family planning. None of these things can be changed by handing out free condoms. All require a change of mindset. (Or, in some cases, contraception that a woman can use without her husband knowing.)\n\nSeveral factors correlate strongly with smaller families. One, as mentioned, is income. Another is urbanisation. Probably the most important, however, is educating girls. The more years they spend in school, the fewer babies they have.\n\nThis is hard to disentangle from the other two\u2014richer countries tend to be more urban and to educate girls better. And it is theoretically possible that causality could flow the other way\u2014women who get pregnant as teenagers may be forced to drop out of school. But this effect is likely to be small. When researchers look only at the education that girls receive before they become sexually mature, they still find that more years in school means fewer babies later in life. That suggests that learning reduces fertility, not the other way round.\n\nA truckload of academic studies supports this argument. Education reduces fertility by giving women other options. It increases their chances of finding paid work. It reduces their economic dependence on their husbands, making it easier to refuse to have more children even if he wants them. It equips them with the mental tools and self-confidence to question traditional norms, such as having as many children as possible. It makes it more likely that they will understand, and use, contraception. It transforms their ambitions for their own children\u2014and thus the number that they choose to have.\n\nEducation also takes a long time. A woman who studies until she is 25 and then spends ten years building a career has just a few years left to get pregnant before she no longer can. Technology may someday remove this constraint, but for now it is hard to have eight children unless, like Ms Nyero, you start early.\n\nThe difference that education makes is especially notable in countries where fertility has only just started to fall. In Ethiopia, for example, a household survey in 2005 found that the fertility rate for women with no formal schooling was 6.1; for women with secondary education or more, it was only 2.0. Educating girls better is one of the few goals that nearly every government agrees is important. So it would be surprising if the girls of the future were worse educated than today\u2019s. The proportion worldwide who complete primary school has risen from 76% in 1997 to 90%. The last mile may be the hardest, but there is no doubt what parents and voters want.\n\nA transition that took 200 years in the West, from seven children to two, can now take place astonishingly fast. When rural folk move to the city, it can happen in a single generation. Consider Dorothy Achieng, a 29-year-old receptionist at an accountancy firm in Nairobi. Her mother had eight children, one of whom died. Dorothy has two. Whereas her mother could barely read and put her older children to work on a small family farm, Ms Achieng hopes to keep hers in school.\n\nMs Achieng is typical of those who move from the countryside to the city. The rural fertility rate in Kenya is 4.5; the urban one, 3.1. Most of Ms Achieng\u2019s friends, like her, have far fewer children than their parents did. No one she knows has seven or eight children.\n\nAlthough she lives in a slum and has no running water in her modest two-room flat, Ms Achieng is part of the aspiring middle class. Indeed, on her salary of just $200 a month, she pays for a private school that costs $50 per child, per term. It is a strain, but she thinks it is worth it. She does not plan to have more children. If she did, she says, she could not \u201cgive them the best\u201d.\n\nAsked what they want to be when they grow up, her two boys stop whizzing around her flat in pursuit of a remote controlled car. \u201cA doctor,\u201d says Crispian, who is nine. Lennox-Lewis, aged seven, chimes in: \u201cAnd I want to be a lawyer.\u201d"

    "title": "Economics is uncovering its gender problem",
    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "A T THE HEART of economics is a belief in the virtues of open competition as a way of using the resources you have in the most efficient way you can. Thanks to the power of that insight, economists routinely tell politicians how to run public policy and business people how to run their firms. Yet when it comes to its own house, academic economics could do more to observe the standards it applies to the rest of the world. In particular, it recruits too few women. Also, many of those who do work in the profession say they are treated unfairly and that their talents are not fully realised. As a result, economics has fewer good ideas than it should and suffers from a skewed viewpoint. It is time for the dismal science to improve its dismal record on gender.\n\nFor decades relatively few women have participated in STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and maths. Economics belongs in this list (see article). In the United States women make up only one in seven full professors and one in three doctoral candidates. There has been too little improvement in the past 20 years. And a survey by the American Economics Association ( AEA ) this week shows that many women who do become academic economists are treated badly.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nOnly 20% of women who answered the AEA poll said that they are satisfied with the professional climate, compared with 40% of men. Some 48% of females said they have faced discrimination at work because of their sex, compared with 3% of male respondents. Writing about the survey results, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, both former chairs of the Federal Reserve, and Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist of the IMF , said that \u201cmany members of the profession have suffered harassment and discrimination during their careers, including both overt acts of abuse and more subtle forms of marginalisation.\u201d\n\nTo deal with its gender shortfall, economics needs two tools that it often uses to analyse and solve problems elsewhere: its ability to crunch data and its capacity to experiment. Take data first. The AEA study is commendable, but only a fifth of its 45,000 present and past members replied to its poll. More work is needed to establish why women are discouraged from becoming economists, or drop out, or are denied promotion. More benchmarking is needed against other professions where women thrive. Better data are needed to capture how work by female economists is discriminated against. There is some evidence, for example, that they are held to higher standards than men in peer reviews and that they are given less credit for their co-writing than men. And economics needs to study how a lack of women skews its scholarly priorities, creating an intellectual opportunity cost. For instance, do economists obsess more about labour-market conditions for men than for women? The more comprehensive the picture that emerges, the sooner and more easily action can be taken to change recruitment and to reform professional life.\n\nThe other priority is for economists to experiment with new ideas, as the AEA is recommending. For a discipline that values dynamism, academic economics is often conservative, sticking with teaching methods, hiring procedures and social conventions that have been around for decades. The AEA survey reveals myriad subtle ways in which those who responded feel uncomfortable. For example 46% of women have not asked a question or presented an idea at conferences for fear of being treated unfairly, compared with 18% of men. Innovation is overdue. Seminars could be organised to ensure that all speakers get a fair chance. Job interviews need not typically happen in hotel rooms, a practice that men regard as harmless but which makes some women uncomfortable. The way that authors\u2019 names are presented on papers could ensure that it is clear who has done the intellectual heavy lifting.\n\nInstead of moving cautiously, the economics profession should do what it is best at: recognise there is a problem, measure it objectively and find solutions. If the result is more women in economics who are treated better, there will be more competition for ideas and a more efficient use of a scarce resource. What economist could possibly object to that?"

    "text": "REMEMBER THE village from the Asterix stories? The popular comic books by Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and Albert Uderzo centre on a small tribe of Gauls somewhere in northern France around 50BC, surrounded by Roman invaders and holding out nonetheless thanks to a magic potion endowing them with superhuman strength. That hold-out image rather sums up Europe\u2019s self image today; at least in the eyes of some of its most powerful leaders. When this afternoon the European Parliament in Strasbourg endorsed a contentious new Copyright Directive, it was just another instance of this Asterixian thinking, which is most pronounced in Brussels, Paris and Berlin.\n\nThe directive, which passed by 348 votes to 274, seeks to update the EU\u2019s copyright legislation in light of recent technological changes. Its most controversial elements, passed much more narrowly, are Article 11, a \u201clink tax\u201d requiring social networks and news aggregators to pay publishers to display snippets of their output, and most of all Article 13, an \u201cupload filter\u201d making larger online publishers like YouTube responsible for copyright infringements in material uploaded by their users. The directive now goes to the Council, which is expected to ratify it on April 9th.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThat caps two years of fraught debates and campaigning about the new rules. Supporters include musicians and publishers who say that it will help to protect artists in an age where unauthorised copying is drastically easier than it used to be. Opponents, which include net freedom campaigners and the likes of Google, say it amounts to censorship and will curb the use of established material to make memes or other parodies. Both sides have lobbied hard in Brussels and national capitals, deploying high-profile supporters like Lady Gaga and Paul McCartney (in favour) and Tim Berners-Lee (against). The anti-Article 13 campaign was particularly vocal in Germany.\n\nThough it attracted an unusual degree of interest for a piece of EU legislation, the Copyright Directive ought not to be viewed in isolation. By purporting to protect artists from the side effects of new technology, it represents a typical example of what Emmanuel Macron, the French president and a supporter of the reform, calls \u201cl\u2019Europe qui prot\u00e8ge\u201d, or \u201cthe Europe that protects\u201d. Mr Macron believes that the rise of populism and public angst about globalisation demands an EU that, rather than merely welcoming the bracing winds of change, does more to shelter established interest groups from them. Though they use different language, the European Commission and the German government among others take a similar view.\n\nOther instances include the new Franco-German push (this one at odds with the Commission) to rejig competition rules to allow takeovers shielding European industry from unfair competition from American and in particular Chinese giants; new protections for European firms deemed strategically important; a more permissive approach to certain forms of state aid; digital consumer protections like the new General Data Protection Regulation; measures to tackle Russian-backed disinformation campaigns; a crackdown on tax avoidance; and tougher controls on migration at Europe\u2019s outer borders and the pursuit of criminals within them. The European election manifesto of Germany\u2019s Christian Democrats, published yesterday, was typical of the genre: \u201cour Europe strengthens: security, peace and prosperity\u201d it proclaimed (its most striking proposal was the creation of a \u201cEuropean FBI\u201d to take on cross-border crime). So too were the warnings about \u201crespecting European unity\u201d issued by Mr Macron and Angela Merkel at their meeting with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, in Paris on Tuesday, March 26th.\n\nAll of which reflects a Europe that, seen from its most powerful capitals, looks like Asterix\u2019s village: surrounded by threats. To the east: a malign Russia and increasingly aggressive China. To the south: a demographically churning Africa and an unstable Middle East. To the west: an unpredictable America. And within European societies: criminals and economic shifts and transformative technological developments that threaten established players and ways of life (to which, for example, the gilets jaunes protests in France might be considered one particularly prominent reaction). Europe\u2019s core is determined to strengthen its defences against these threats. To protect an open Europe, goes the logic, Europe needs more protection against the excesses of openness.\n\nThat seems sensible. And some of the measures implemented in the name of a protective Europe are reasonable enough. But it all poses some difficult questions deserving more of a debate than they have received. Openness is supposed to be a European strength\u2014its magic potion, to extend the Asterix metaphor\u2014in an age when America is pulling up the drawbridge and China\u2019s more closed model is making strides. But where do the limits of this strength lie? Which forms of protection are valid and which represent unacceptable compromises with more closed systems like the Chinese one? And where does that openness itself need protection? The Copyright Directive is one fault line in this much wider debate, one that goes to the heart of Europe\u2019s values. The looming European election campaign is a rare chance to conduct that debate openly and on a continent-wide scale. It should not be missed."

Norton; \u00a319.99.\n\nG RAHAM GREENE\u2019S life was a gift to biographers. They\u2014and the author himself\u2014have amply chronicled his adventurous stints in exotic locations, his work as a secret agent, his love affairs and his Catholicism. Christopher Hull touches on all of these themes in his focused and entertaining account of the making of Greene\u2019s novel of espionage, \u201cOur Man in Havana\u201d.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThat book is set in Cuba, which Greene (pictured) first visited by accident in 1954, after he was deported from Puerto Rico. (He had unwisely revealed that, as a student prank, he was once a member of the Communist Party.) Greene disliked the authoritarian regime of Fulgencio Batista but enjoyed the climate and the seedy nightlife, returning frequently over the next dozen years.\n\nEver anti-American, Greene approved when Fidel Castro overthrew Batista, Washington\u2019s client, in 1959; he admired Castro\u2019s social reforms but rued the puritanical clampdown on Havana\u2019s fleshpots. Rather than merely witnessing the communist takeover, he tried to assist it, using his clandestine contacts to lobby against the supply of weapons to Batista and help furnish Castro with British buses.\n\nThese half-baked efforts were worthy of his own comic novels, of which \u201cOur Man in Havana\u201d\u2014published just months before the revolution\u2014may be the best loved. The protagonist is James Wormold, a vacuum-cleaner salesman recruited by the British secret service. Learning that the more information he provides the greater his remuneration, he invents a network of agents and increasingly farcical intelligence, to the delight of his minders in London. His masterstroke is a report of strange goings-on in the mountains, which he backs up with what are supposedly aerial photographs of sinister constructions. In reality they have been adapted from diagrams of vacuum cleaners.\n\nIn \u201cOur Man Down in Havana\u201d Mr Hull argues that, as well as drawing on his secret-service experience to describe the bumbling nature of much intelligence work, Greene was eerily prophetic about the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, which arose when reconnaissance flights proved that the Soviet Union was constructing missile sites on the island. He makes a game case, but some readers might conclude that coincidence is a more apt judgment than prescience. Mr Hull even sees Greene\u2019s \u201cclairvoyance\u201d at work in the faulty evidence of weapons of mass destruction on which the invasion of Iraq was based in 2003.\n\nIt would be interesting to know what the novelist would make of that reverent appraisal. Still, Mr Hull\u2019s book is a delicious companion to the tale Greene confected from the incompetence of spooks and an island in turmoil."

    "text": "FEW PAINTERS can have been saddled with a more inappropriate pseudonym than \u201cTintoretto\u201d. With its tinkling consonants, his nickname\u2014\u201clittle dyer\u201d, referring to the profession of his father\u2014might have sat well on a creator of Rococo pastoral idylls, but is hopelessly inappropriate for an artist of such earnest intent and almost inhuman gusto.\n\nTintoretto (born Jacopo Comin) painted faster and bigger than any of his Venetian contemporaries. He was possessed of monstrous ambition, not just for fame and reward, but for lasting artistic glory. For a celebration of the 500th anniversary of his birth in 1518 or 1519, a major exhibition has travelled from Venice to Washington. \u201cTintoretto: Artist of Renaissance Venice\u201d opened at the National Gallery of Art (NGA) on March 24th and runs until July 7th.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nAstonishingly, it is the first-ever retrospective in America of the painter, an artist that some critics have put in the first rank of Renaissance Masters. John Ruskin thought Tintoretto the equal of Michelangelo; subsequent fans included Jean-Paul Sartre, who claimed him for the proletariat. But various factors have contributed to a decline in Tintoretto\u2019s popularity over the past century and a half.\n\nOne is the sheer difficulty of staging an exhibition that offers a representative selection of his work. Many of his greatest paintings have to be admired in the poorly lit churches of Venice because they adorn walls and ceilings, or are simply too enormous to go through the doors or fit in the rooms of modern exhibition spaces. Another obstacle has been the attribution to Tintoretto of scores of works of variable quality, often created by his assistants and imitators. The two curators of the Washington show, Robert Echols, a scholar, and Frederick Ilchman, who chairs the Art of Europe department at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, have also been responsible for a drastic reduction in Tintoretto\u2019s accepted oeuvre. They have rejected more than 150 works, including some well-known paintings such as \u201cChrist and the Adulteress\u201d (it continues to be exhibited at Palazzo Barberini in Rome as a work by Tintoretto). Many of the master\u2019s paintings have also suffered from dirt and decay and, in some cases, coats of varnish deliberately applied to give them more of an \u201cOld Master\u201d look. Several of the works on display in Washington have been restored to their original brightness. \u201cTintoretto as a brilliant colourist is going to be a revelation to many people,\u201d Mr Echols says.\n\nThe show comprises 46 paintings, most of which have come from the vast, twin-sited exhibition at the Doge\u2019s Palace and the Accademia in Venice. Others are already on display at the NGA. Some have been loaned, including his \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d (pictured, above), one of Tintoretto\u2019s most audacious and enigmatic works, taken from the church of San Trovaso in the Dorsoduro district of Venice. Tintoretto put his slightly ragged apostles in the back room of a tavern; it looks as if\u2014until the moment the painting captures, when Jesus tells them that one of them will betray him\u2014they have not been stinting on the wine. A cat is hunting for scraps under the table. In one corner is a mysterious figure who, it has been speculated, is the artist\u2019s much-loved daughter, Marietta, who worked with him in his studio.\n\n\u201cThe Last Supper\u201d is a counterpoint to the notion that Tintoretto is all maudlin Madonnas and saints with uplifted eyes. So too is a section of the show devoted to his portraits. \u201cI hope people will come out of this exhibition thinking that he was one of the great portraitists of the 16th century along with Titian and Bronzino,\u201d Mr Ilchman says. Maybe. Some of his portraits are formal and disclose little of their subjects\u2019 inner selves. But this is unquestionably an exhibition that does justice to Tintoretto\u2019s thundering genius."

    "text": "\u201cIT WAS a complete and total exoneration!\u201d crowed Donald Trump on March 24th, shortly after his attorney-general released a four-page summary of Robert Mueller\u2019s findings. \u201cThis was an illegal takedown that failed.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s euphoria was understandable. After spending 22 months investigating the Russian campaign to rig the 2016 election in Mr Trump\u2019s favour, the special counsel did not find that the president had a case to answer. Yet nor did he exonerate him on all counts.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nFirst the good news for Mr Trump. On the most serious area of wrongdoing Mr Mueller considered, according to Attorney-General William Barr\u2019s summary, he \u201cdid not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in election interference activities.\u201d\n\nThat does not mean Mr Trump\u2019s campaign did not cooperate with the Russian effort. Over the course of Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation several apparent instances of cooperation have come to light. Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman\u2014who thanks to Mr Mueller is now serving a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence\u2014shared campaign polling data with an alleged Russian agent, for example. And it is possible that Mr Mueller found more such instances. Yet he clearly found no \u201csmoking-gun\u201d evidence that the Trump team were witting participants in the Russian plot. Their dealings with Russians, according to the summary, did not amount to a \u201cconspiracy\u201d or an \u201cagreement\u2014tacit or express...on election interference\u201d.\n\nIt will take a fuller disclosure of Mr Mueller\u2019s findings, which Mr Barr has promised, to ascertain quite how reassuring this conclusion is. But it is nonetheless a big win for the president. Despite the nagging caveats\u2014given his team\u2019s many lies, evasions and demonstrable openness to receiving Russian help\u2014it comes as close to corroborating the president\u2019s \u201cNO COLLUSION!!\u201d assertion as he could possibly have hoped.\n\nIt will not deter House Democrats from continuing their ongoing congressional probes into Mr Trump\u2019s affairs and Russia. Nor should it. Congressional oversight is different from special counsel investigations. It aims to provide a public reckoning of behaviour antithetical to the public interest, even when that does not rise to the level of criminality, the yardstick Mr Mueller was mandated to consider. And there remain many unanswered questions about Mr Trump\u2019s strange relationship with Russia (for example, why was it so keen to see him elected in the first place?) that it seems Mr Mueller either did not consider or has not resolved.\n\nNonetheless, the special counsel appears to have allayed the biggest fear of all: that America\u2019s sitting president was a traitorous accomplice to the Russia plot. Good as this is for Mr Trump, it is even better for America, and the Democrats\u2019 oversight effort should be guided by it. If Mr Mueller did not find a smoking gun, they should not expect to.\n\nThe other main part of Mr Mueller\u2019s inquiry was a closer run thing. Mr Barr\u2019s summary confirms that the special counsel looked into \u201ca number of actions by the president\u201d that might have constituted an illegal effort to obstruct investigations into the Russian plot. The main investigation, by the FBI, was handed over to Mr Mueller in part because of Mr Trump\u2019s decision to sack the bureau\u2019s then director, James Comey. That was one such action. The president\u2019s subsequent effort to sack Mr Mueller, whose investigation he dubbed a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d, perhaps constituted another.\n\nBoth steps looked bad for the president. Yet it was always moot whether they could be conclusively seen as obstruction, given that Mr Trump was empowered by his office to remove both men. Most legal experts think a president can be guilty of obstruction, even when exercising the legitimate powers of his office, if his motives are malign. And sacking Mr Comey in an effort to shut down the Russian investigation would certainly appear to fit that description.\n\nOther experts\u2014not insignificantly including Mr Barr\u2014maintained that a president could not be guilty of obstruction when acting within his legal powers. In the end Mr Mueller, mindful of this thorny legal disagreement, decided not to try to settle it.\n\nAccording to the attorney-general\u2019s summary of his conclusions, he relayed his findings on Mr Trump\u2019s dubious actions without concluding whether or not they constituted clinching evidence of obstruction. Instead Mr Mueller provided arguments on both sides of the question. According to Mr Barr, \u201cthe special counsel states that \u2018while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it does not exonerate him either.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe attorney-general\u2014who last month returned to the helm of the Justice Department, having previously run it for George H. W. Bush\u2014took it upon himself to settle the matter. He and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, duly concluded that the evidence provided by Mr Mueller was not sufficient to \u201cestablish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offence.\u201d Given Mr Barr\u2019s afore-stated views, this was not terribly surprising. Though the attorney-general in fact offered a different argument in support of their finding. As Mr Mueller had not found the president to be engaged in a conspiracy with Russia, Mr Barr argued, it would be hard to establish that Mr Trump\u2019s quasi-obstructive exercise of his powers was ill-intended.\n\nThat might sound like a stretch. The many dodgy ties between Mr Trump and Russia, and his and his associates\u2019 record of lying about them, suggested he had highly questionable motives\u2014short of a grand election-rigging conspiracy\u2014to shut the Russia probe down. In any event, Mr Trump\u2019s opponents will home in on the implication that Mr Mueller provided evidence of obstruction, which he felt unable to exonerate the president on, notwithstanding the legal arguments in favour of doing so. The Democrats will now fight to obtain the details of Mr Mueller\u2019s reporting on this issue.\n\nThat battle will shortly take on a political life of its own. In his summary Mr Barr reiterated that, \u201cmindful of the public interest in this matter\u201d, he hoped to make as much of the special counsel\u2019s report public as he could, \u201cconsistent with applicable law, regulations, and departmental policies.\u201d Yet that could keep a lot of Mr Mueller\u2019s report under wraps.\n\nMr Barr noted a provision against disclosure of information brought before a grand jury, which Mr Mueller made heavy use of. He also noted his need to protect material relevant to ongoing investigations, of which Mr Mueller has sparked several, notably including one by the US attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York that is looking into various aspects of Mr Trump\u2019s affairs. Democrats who feel bruised by Mr Mueller\u2019s failure to hang the president will console themselves by getting stuck into the new fight with Mr Barr over disclosure.\n\nBut they should not feel bruised. The notion that the special counsel was about to take down Mr Trump has long owed more to feverish Democratic imaginations than reality. The reams of evidence the special counsel has already made public, in hundreds of pages of court filings, did not point to a grand conspiracy between the Trump team and Russian agents. The obstruction case looked hard to prove.\n\nIf anything, the heavy burden of proof the special counsel was labouring under made his investigation look like a distraction from the more salient political questions surrounding Mr Trump\u2019s dealings with Russia. For example: do American voters think it acceptable that their president continues to deny the existence of an attack on their democracy by a hostile power, which he has consistently lied about his links to, may owe his job to, and which he has done hardly anything to deter from continuing its assault?\n\nDemocrats might also feel Mr Mueller has done them a tactical favour. A more damning report on Mr Trump, including a clear allegation of criminality, would have made it hard for them to avoid impeaching him. Yet that course of action has always looked like a hiding to nothing. Protected by his party, Mr Trump almost certainly could not be removed by impeachment proceedings, and might well be strengthened by a failed effort. Democratic leaders know this perfectly well. Despite well-publicised calls for Mr Trump\u2019s impeachment from a few hotheads, most Democrats in Congress are against it.\n\nThe best they could have hoped for from Mr Mueller was therefore a report that justified their continuing oversight operations against Mr Trump, without forcing them to impeach him. The special counsel appears to have delivered something close to that.\n\nIn a more abstract sense, indeed, his report appears almost as a rebuke to those who look to the law to solve political problems. Mr Mueller would not put it like this: the celebrated prosecutor is too fastidious and discreet. Yet his conclusions, in so far as Mr Barr has represented them accurately, appear to have added a few important embellishments to the Trump saga, and then kicked it back into the political realm where it belongs. Voters, not prosecutors, will ultimately decide whether Mr Trump is fit to occupy the White House. That is as it should be.\n\nFurther reading: Our background briefing on the Mueller report"

    "title": "Slower growth in ageing economies is not inevitable",
    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "F OR THE first time in history, the Earth has more people over the age of 65 than under the age of five. In another two decades the ratio will be two-to-one, according to a recent analysis by Torsten Sl\u00f8k of Deutsche Bank. The trend has economists worried about everything from soaring pension costs to \u201csecular stagnation\u201d\u2014the chronically weak growth that comes from having too few investment opportunities to absorb available savings. The world\u2019s greying is inevitable. But its negative effects on growth are not. If older societies grow more slowly, that may be because they prefer familiarity to dynamism.\n\nAgeing slows growth in several ways. One is that there are fewer new workers to boost output. Workforces in some 40 countries are already shrinking because of demographic change. As the number of elderly people increases, governments may neglect growth-boosting public investment in education and infrastructure in favour of spending on pensions and health care. People in work, required to support ever more pensioners, must pay higher taxes. But the biggest hit to growth comes from weakening productivity. A study published in 2016, for example, examined economic performance across American states. It found that a rise of 10% in the share of a state\u2019s population that is over 60 cuts the growth rate of output per person by roughly half a percentage point, with two-thirds of that decline due to weaker growth in productivity.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nWhy are older economies less productive? The answer is not, as one might suppose, that older workers are. Though some capabilities, notably physical ones, deteriorate with age, the overall effect is not dramatic. A study of Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector published in 2016 failed to detect a drop-off in productivity in workers up to the age of 60. Companies can tweak employees\u2019 roles as they get older in order to make best use of the advantages of age, such as extensive experience and professional connections.\n\nFurthermore, if weak productivity growth was caused by older workers producing less, pay patterns should reflect that. Wages would tend to rise at the beginning of a career and fall towards its end. But that is not what usually happens. Rather, according to a recent paper by economists at Moody\u2019s Analytics, a consultancy, wages are lower for everyone in companies with lots of older workers. It is not older workers\u2019 falling productivity that seems to hold back the economy, but their influence on those around them. That influence is potent: the authors reckon that as much as a percentage point of America\u2019s recent decline in annual productivity growth could be associated with ageing.\n\nHow this influence makes itself felt is unclear. But the authors suggest that companies with more older workers might be less eager to embrace new technologies. That might be because they are reluctant to make investments that would require employees to be retrained, given the shorter period over which they could hope to make a return on that training for those near the end of their careers. Or older bosses might be to blame. Research indicates that younger managers are more likely to adopt new technologies than are older ones. This may seem obvious: older people\u2019s greater aversion to new technology is a clich\u00e9. And at least anecdotally, greying industries do seem more averse to change.\n\nIf the evidence suggested that ageing economies struggled primarily because of slow-growing labour forces and fast-growing pension costs, it would make sense to focus policy efforts on keeping people in work longer\u2014by raising retirement ages, for example. But if, as seems to be the case, reluctance to embrace new technologies is a bigger issue, other goals should take priority\u2014in particular, boosting competition. In America, increasing industrial concentration and persistently high profits are spurring renewed interest in antitrust rules. The benefits of breaking up powerful firms and increasing competition might be even bigger than thought, if conservative old firms are thereby spurred to make better use of newer technologies.\n\nThere are other measures that could help. Removing barriers to job-switching, for example by making benefits more portable, could shorten average tenures and help stop companies\u2019 cultures becoming ossified. Best of all would be more immigration. An influx of young foreign workers would address nearly all the ways in which population ageing depresses growth. It would not only expand the labour force and create new taxpayers, but would mean more and younger companies, and greater openness to new technologies. And there would be plenty of willing takers in poorer countries with younger populations.\n\nNo men for old country\n\nSocieties with lots of older workers are also societies with lots of older voters, however. Those voters are, on average, more politically conservative than younger people, and less likely to support increased immigration. People of all ages would gain from policies that boosted growth and productivity. But given the choice between a dynamic but unfamiliar society and a static but familiar one, older countries tend to opt for the second. In hindsight, the demographic boom that coincided with industrialisation in rich countries may have had an underappreciated benefit: it created a big constituency in favour of embracing new technologies and the opportunities they provided.\n\nTechnology may at some point overcome the stifling effect of ageing. In a new paper Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University find that when young workers are sufficiently scarce, manufacturers invest in more automation, and experience faster productivity growth as a result. Robots have yet to make a big impact in the service sector and beyond, but as their capabilities improve and jobs for younger people go begging that may change. The world could use more flexibility and productivity now. But stagnation may end eventually, once the robots are promoted to management."

    "text": "MATHEMATICAL MODELS of climate change predict that the severity of natural disasters will increase as the world warms. The cyclone that hit Mozambique on March 14th, killing perhaps 1,000 people, has further focused attention on the risks posed by rising temperatures. Even so, the man-made carbon emissions that drive global warming continue to grow. According to a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), a think-tank based in Paris, energy-related CO2 emissions rose by 1.7% last year, to 33.1 gigatonnes. The increase, of 560 metric tonnes compared with 2017, was equivalent to a full year\u2019s worth of emissions from international aviation.\n\nCarbon emissions have been driven higher by increasing demand for all types of energy. Broadly speaking, changes in energy demand track the fortunes of the world economy. Robust global GDP growth of 3.7% last year caused energy demand to rise by some 2.3%, its fastest pace for a decade. And although energy efficiency did improve and use of renewable sources did increase\u2014solar power generation rose by 31%\u2014these gains were dwarfed by the growth in the use of fossil fuels, which accounted for 70% of the rise in global energy consumption.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nBurning of coal, the most egregious source of carbon, accounted for a third of the growth in emissions. A new generation of coal-fired power plants in Asia was responsible for nearly all the additional global demand. Those power plants are expected to remain active for another 40 years. Much more encouragingly, and despite President Donald Trump\u2019s advocacy for America\u2019s coal industry, America\u2019s abundant supply of natural gas has led firms rapidly to switch from coal to gas power. Natural-gas consumption in the United States increased by 10% last year, equivalent to Britain\u2019s total annual consumption.\n\nPerhaps the most worrying finding in the report is the threat of a feedback loop between severe weather events and carbon emissions. According to the IEA, a hotter-than-average summer and colder-than-average winter led to greater use of heating and air conditioning, which together were responsible for about half of the rise in energy demand in America and roughly a fifth of the worldwide increase. If humans keep burning fuel to shield themselves from extreme temperatures, and the emissions produced by that activity cause temperatures to become ever more extreme, the worst-case scenarios for climate change are more likely to materialise."

Four colleagues nod in approval. \u201cBut only for a month,\u201d prompts one, following the text as he recites it. Ayalkibet skips over that proviso; his colleagues look up in alarm. So begins a recent episode of \u201cMin Litazez?\u201d (\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d), a hit Ethiopian sitcom, in which the temporary manager schemes to extend his time in office.\n\nWho might this represent? Not, surely, Ethiopia\u2019s new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who has convulsed the country\u2019s politics by promising free elections next year and to step down if he loses. And, indeed, \u201cMin Litazez?\u201d is too clever for such clunky comparisons. But the audience is invited to draw their own, and many viewers have seen a reflection of Abiy in the protagonist. In previous seasons there was no doubt that Ayalkibet\u2014then a petty tyrant of the workplace\u2014stood in for the ruling party\u2019s authoritarian old guard, whom Abiy shoved aside last March. Now, as Ethiopians acclimatise to a more gentle leadership, the character has been transformed. No longer a dictator, he is a well-meaning but pompous honcho with a weakness for the limelight.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\u201cMin Litazez?\u201d is revolutionary, in an understated way. Not only does it lampoon Ethiopia\u2019s leaders; it does so on a national channel owned by the ruling party. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had anything like this,\u201d says Elias Wondimu, an intellectual who made a guest appearance last year. The show\u2019s popularity, and the imitations it has spawned, illustrate how subversive comedy is tiptoeing into the Ethiopian mainstream, upturning decades, even centuries, of cultural norms. Amid the laughs, the high-jinks offer a glimpse into the psyche of a conservative society loosening up fast.\n\nUntil 1974 Ethiopia was an imperial monarchy. Next came a Marxist junta known as the Derg, and then, after 1991, the iron-fisted rule of the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front. Each regime upheld an absolutist conception of power that left little room for public dissent, least of all satire. Under the Derg this meant a total ban on the free press. The constitution of 1994 theoretically prohibited censorship, but it continued in practice. Until last year the government would insist on cuts to films, TV shows and plays\u2014or ban them altogether.\n\nThe flipside of this draconian approach was a sophisticated culture of concealment, in which resistance was disguised as obedience. \u201cYou bow in front and fart behind\u201d, as a local proverb has it. In Amharic, the most widespread language, this is known as samna\u2014warq, or \u201cwax and gold\u201d: the studied use of words for ambiguous purposes. For centuries poets and azmaris, the bards and original satirists of highland Ethiopia, celebrated the glory of feudal overlords in songs that shrewdly hid their true meaning. \u201cThe more repressive the government was, the more vocal the oral satirists became,\u201d says Tigab Bezie of Bahir Dar University. In diluted form, the technique still persists in everyday humour. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed a keen sense of self-censorship,\u201d says Elias. \u201cYou use wax-and-gold strategies to save yourself.\u201d\n\nBut the subterfuge has gradually become less necessary. After disputed elections triggered mass protests and a fierce crackdown in 2005, a CD of jokes making fun of the then-prime minister, Meles Zenawi, became an underground sensation. The government quickly pulled \u201cRepressed Jokes\u201d, as the recording was known, from the market. Since then dissident humour has migrated\u2014and flourished\u2014online. There is a booming industry of political memes and what Engdawork Endrias, an Ethiopian literary scholar, calls \u201cinformal essays\u201d: writings, often posted on Facebook, which can be savagely satirical. YouTube offers a platform for risqu\u00e9 sketch shows such as \u201cFugera News\u201d (though that programme, now discontinued, was made abroad and its presenter hid his identity).\n\nFunny ha-ha\n\nNow such material is making the leap to television. \u201cYaz Leqeq\u201d (\u201cTemperamental\u201d), a sketch show that aired on a satellite channel last autumn, offered impersonations of prominent politicians (including the prime minister). New sitcoms tackle current affairs with increased daring, while some older ones, such as \u201cBetoch\u201d (\u201cFamilies\u201d), are tentatively following suit. In January Eshetu Melese, a stand-up comedian, performed his hour-long show about torture under Abiy\u2019s predecessors on television. He says he has since been approached by several producers keen to bring a version of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d to Ethiopian audiences.\n\nThese innovations share some common themes. The programmes tend to be self-consciously didactic. In \u201cYeemama Bet\u201d (\u201cMama\u2019s House\u201d), a sitcom set in a traditional drinking den, the six characters, who represent various ethnic backgrounds, come together at the end of each episode and resolve their differences. So do those in \u201cAleme\u201d (\u201cMy World\u201d), which is set in a guesthouse. Eshetu says that during his stand-up he explains the political messages at the end of each joke, pointing out, for example, that Ethiopia needs a proper human-rights commission.\n\nIn their open political boldness, all these innovations follow in the footsteps of Bereket Belayneh, a playwright whose sensationally popular one-man show, \u201cEyayu Fungus\u201d\u2014first staged three years ago and soon to air on television\u2014made fun of low-level officials as well as Ethiopians themselves. His protagonist, a madman, excoriates the audience for their failures, moral and otherwise. The new trend is \u201cnot about entertainment\u201d, says Behailu Wassie, the director of \u201cMin Litazez?\u201d \u201cThe intention is to get a better country.\u201d\n\nThe hope is that humour can act as a tonic for long-standing ethnic tensions that have persisted, even worsened, since Abiy\u2019s arrival in office. Surafel Daniel, director of \u201cYeemama Bet\u201d, says its angriest critics are those who wrongly perceive a gag to be made at the expense of a particular ethnicity. With time, he hopes, audiences may become less sensitive. Abel Asrat, a humorist and commentator, is more upbeat. \u201cI see different ethnicities laughing at the same joke,\u201d he says."

The European election manifesto of Germany\u2019s Christian Democrats, published yesterday, was typical of the genre: \u201cour Europe strengthens: security, peace and prosperity\u201d it proclaimed (its most striking proposal was the creation of a \u201cEuropean FBI\u201d to take on cross-border crime). So too were the warnings about \u201crespecting European unity\u201d issued by Mr Macron and Angela Merkel at their meeting with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, in Paris on Tuesday, March 26th.\n\nAll of which reflects a Europe that, seen from its most powerful capitals, looks like Asterix\u2019s village: surrounded by threats. To the east: a malign Russia and increasingly aggressive China. To the south: a demographically churning Africa and an unstable Middle East. To the west: an unpredictable America. And within European societies: criminals and economic shifts and transformative technological developments that threaten established players and ways of life (to which, for example, the gilets jaunes protests in France might be considered one particularly prominent reaction). Europe\u2019s core is determined to strengthen its defences against these threats. To protect an open Europe, goes the logic, Europe needs more protection against the excesses of openness.\n\nThat seems sensible. And some of the measures implemented in the name of a protective Europe are reasonable enough. But it all poses some difficult questions deserving more of a debate than they have received. Openness is supposed to be a European strength\u2014its magic potion, to extend the Asterix metaphor\u2014in an age when America is pulling up the drawbridge and China\u2019s more closed model is making strides. But where do the limits of this strength lie? Which forms of protection are valid and which represent unacceptable compromises with more closed systems like the Chinese one? And where does that openness itself need protection? The Copyright Directive is one fault line in this much wider debate, one that goes to the heart of Europe\u2019s values. The looming European election campaign is a rare chance to conduct that debate openly and on a continent-wide scale. It should not be missed."

    "text": "MATHEMATICAL MODELS of climate change predict that the severity of natural disasters will increase as the world warms. The cyclone that hit Mozambique on March 14th, killing perhaps 1,000 people, has further focused attention on the risks posed by rising temperatures. Even so, the man-made carbon emissions that drive global warming continue to grow. According to a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), a think-tank based in Paris, energy-related CO2 emissions rose by 1.7% last year, to 33.1 gigatonnes. The increase, of 560 metric tonnes compared with 2017, was equivalent to a full year\u2019s worth of emissions from international aviation.\n\nCarbon emissions have been driven higher by increasing demand for all types of energy. Broadly speaking, changes in energy demand track the fortunes of the world economy. Robust global GDP growth of 3.7% last year caused energy demand to rise by some 2.3%, its fastest pace for a decade. And although energy efficiency did improve and use of renewable sources did increase\u2014solar power generation rose by 31%\u2014these gains were dwarfed by the growth in the use of fossil fuels, which accounted for 70% of the rise in global energy consumption.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nBurning of coal, the most egregious source of carbon, accounted for a third of the growth in emissions. A new generation of coal-fired power plants in Asia was responsible for nearly all the additional global demand. Those power plants are expected to remain active for another 40 years. Much more encouragingly, and despite President Donald Trump\u2019s advocacy for America\u2019s coal industry, America\u2019s abundant supply of natural gas has led firms rapidly to switch from coal to gas power. Natural-gas consumption in the United States increased by 10% last year, equivalent to Britain\u2019s total annual consumption.\n\nPerhaps the most worrying finding in the report is the threat of a feedback loop between severe weather events and carbon emissions. According to the IEA, a hotter-than-average summer and colder-than-average winter led to greater use of heating and air conditioning, which together were responsible for about half of the rise in energy demand in America and roughly a fifth of the worldwide increase. If humans keep burning fuel to shield themselves from extreme temperatures, and the emissions produced by that activity cause temperatures to become ever more extreme, the worst-case scenarios for climate change are more likely to materialise."

    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "F OR THE first time in history, the Earth has more people over the age of 65 than under the age of five. In another two decades the ratio will be two-to-one, according to a recent analysis by Torsten Sl\u00f8k of Deutsche Bank. The trend has economists worried about everything from soaring pension costs to \u201csecular stagnation\u201d\u2014the chronically weak growth that comes from having too few investment opportunities to absorb available savings. The world\u2019s greying is inevitable. But its negative effects on growth are not. If older societies grow more slowly, that may be because they prefer familiarity to dynamism.\n\nAgeing slows growth in several ways. One is that there are fewer new workers to boost output. Workforces in some 40 countries are already shrinking because of demographic change. As the number of elderly people increases, governments may neglect growth-boosting public investment in education and infrastructure in favour of spending on pensions and health care. People in work, required to support ever more pensioners, must pay higher taxes. But the biggest hit to growth comes from weakening productivity. A study published in 2016, for example, examined economic performance across American states. It found that a rise of 10% in the share of a state\u2019s population that is over 60 cuts the growth rate of output per person by roughly half a percentage point, with two-thirds of that decline due to weaker growth in productivity.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nWhy are older economies less productive? The answer is not, as one might suppose, that older workers are. Though some capabilities, notably physical ones, deteriorate with age, the overall effect is not dramatic. A study of Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector published in 2016 failed to detect a drop-off in productivity in workers up to the age of 60. Companies can tweak employees\u2019 roles as they get older in order to make best use of the advantages of age, such as extensive experience and professional connections.\n\nFurthermore, if weak productivity growth was caused by older workers producing less, pay patterns should reflect that. Wages would tend to rise at the beginning of a career and fall towards its end. But that is not what usually happens. Rather, according to a recent paper by economists at Moody\u2019s Analytics, a consultancy, wages are lower for everyone in companies with lots of older workers. It is not older workers\u2019 falling productivity that seems to hold back the economy, but their influence on those around them. That influence is potent: the authors reckon that as much as a percentage point of America\u2019s recent decline in annual productivity growth could be associated with ageing.\n\nHow this influence makes itself felt is unclear. But the authors suggest that companies with more older workers might be less eager to embrace new technologies. That might be because they are reluctant to make investments that would require employees to be retrained, given the shorter period over which they could hope to make a return on that training for those near the end of their careers. Or older bosses might be to blame. Research indicates that younger managers are more likely to adopt new technologies than are older ones. This may seem obvious: older people\u2019s greater aversion to new technology is a clich\u00e9. And at least anecdotally, greying industries do seem more averse to change.\n\nIf the evidence suggested that ageing economies struggled primarily because of slow-growing labour forces and fast-growing pension costs, it would make sense to focus policy efforts on keeping people in work longer\u2014by raising retirement ages, for example. But if, as seems to be the case, reluctance to embrace new technologies is a bigger issue, other goals should take priority\u2014in particular, boosting competition. In America, increasing industrial concentration and persistently high profits are spurring renewed interest in antitrust rules. The benefits of breaking up powerful firms and increasing competition might be even bigger than thought, if conservative old firms are thereby spurred to make better use of newer technologies.\n\nThere are other measures that could help. Removing barriers to job-switching, for example by making benefits more portable, could shorten average tenures and help stop companies\u2019 cultures becoming ossified. Best of all would be more immigration. An influx of young foreign workers would address nearly all the ways in which population ageing depresses growth. It would not only expand the labour force and create new taxpayers, but would mean more and younger companies, and greater openness to new technologies. And there would be plenty of willing takers in poorer countries with younger populations.\n\nNo men for old country\n\nSocieties with lots of older workers are also societies with lots of older voters, however. Those voters are, on average, more politically conservative than younger people, and less likely to support increased immigration. People of all ages would gain from policies that boosted growth and productivity. But given the choice between a dynamic but unfamiliar society and a static but familiar one, older countries tend to opt for the second. In hindsight, the demographic boom that coincided with industrialisation in rich countries may have had an underappreciated benefit: it created a big constituency in favour of embracing new technologies and the opportunities they provided.\n\nTechnology may at some point overcome the stifling effect of ageing. In a new paper Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University find that when young workers are sufficiently scarce, manufacturers invest in more automation, and experience faster productivity growth as a result. Robots have yet to make a big impact in the service sector and beyond, but as their capabilities improve and jobs for younger people go begging that may change. The world could use more flexibility and productivity now. But stagnation may end eventually, once the robots are promoted to management."

    "text": "\u201cI HAVE a very nightmarish imagination,\u201d Scott Walker said in 2006. \u201cI\u2019ve had very bad dreams all my life.\u201d The musician, who died on March 22nd, fashioned brilliant compositions from this darkness; the jarring, unexpected and gloomy songs were unlike anything produced by his contemporaries. He took traditional instruments and pushed them towards abstraction, detuning guitars and rattling timpani; his influence can be felt in the music of David Bowie, Nick Cave and Pulp. In \u201c30 Century Man\u201d (2006), a documentary about Mr Walker\u2019s songwriting, Brian Eno described the music as \u201chumiliating\u201d. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got any further than this,\u201d he laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace, really.\u201d\n\nMr Walker, born Noel Scott Engel in Ohio in 1943, rose to fame in the 1960s as part of the Walker Brothers, a crooning vocal group (they were not in fact related). After a stint as the bass guitarist\u2014he had worked as a session musician on the Sunset Strip as a teenager\u2014he became the band\u2019s lead vocalist. His melancholy baritone on \u201cThe Sun Ain\u2019t Gonna Shine (Anymore)\u201d and \u201cMake It Easy On Yourself\u201d helped to turn the group into teen idols, particularly in Britain. The band offered an alternative to Beatlemania, recording ballads by Burt Bacharach, Bob Dylan and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, as well as standards such as \u201cSummertime\u201d and \u201cLand of 1000 Dances\u201d. When the group began to release original tunes as B-sides in order to make money on royalties, Mr Walker offered moody character sketches including \u201cOrpheus\u201d, a track about an affair with a married woman, and \u201cGenevieve\u201d. The group officially disbanded in 1968.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nFreed from the constraints of commercial pop music but still considered a bankable star, Mr Walker made a quartet of solo albums. They included baroque pop, covers and ballads, but also showcased his innovative ideas. With \u201cThe Amorphous Humphrey Plugg\u201d, \u201cPlastic Palace People\u201d and \u201cBig Louise\u201d he transformed the pop song by making it epic in scale, inhabited by vivid, bizarre characters. Obsessed with European film\u2014one song, \u201cThe Seventh Seal\u201d, was a nod to Ingmar Bergman\u2014and British kitchen-sink drama, Mr Walker reflected on disease, death and existentialism. He recorded songs by Jacques Brel, rendering them in cinematic orchestral arrangements. \u201cScott\u201d (1967), \u201cScott 2\u201d (1968), \u201cScott 3\u201d (1969) were hits with both critics and audiences. He was so popular that the BBC gave him his own television series.\n\nBy the time \u201cScott 4\u201d was released in 1969, though, Mr Walker had tuned out the crowd-pleasing ballads and amped up the weirdness. Many listeners moved on to rock. Mr Walker retreated for most of the 1970s, recording substandard covers on mediocre albums, perhaps to meet contractual obligations, and reuniting with the Walker Brothers for a string of unremarkable soft-rock records. But \u201cNite Flights\u201d (1978), the band\u2019s avant-garde swansong, reignited his ambition. He wrote four tracks for the album, and returned to solo work with \u201cClimate of the Hunter\u201d (1984).\n\nA number of records followed, increasingly adventurous in form and lyrical content. The seminal \u201cTilt\u201d (1995) featured \u201cFarmer in the City\u201d, a haunting song envisioning the real-life murder of Pier Paolo Pasolini, an Italian poet and film director. \u201cThe Drift\u201d (2006) explored similarly grim subject matter with songs such as \u201cCossacks Are\u201d and \u201cClara\u201d, a track inspired by the newsreel footage of Mussolini\u2019s death that had haunted Mr Walker since his youth.\n\nMr Walker\u2019s output was visionary, re-evaluating sounds as well as the song form. He worked slowly and devotedly, challenging his musicians to avoid practising or even knowing the melodies; he tasked producers with finding the sound of braying donkeys, or of raw meat being punched, to create an original soundscape. He found inspiration in strange and dark corners, and his genius was to wrest an unruly beauty from those nightmares."

As theatre, it was underwhelming\u2014star-studded supporting cast including Oprah Winfrey notwithstanding. As a business case, it looks more compelling.\n\nApple\u2019s 900m iPhones worldwide, more than six times as many as Netflix has subscribers, grant it access to a massive potential audience. Analysts speculate that Apple will eventually offer them a variant of Amazon Prime, where customers pay a flat monthly fee for some combination of news, games, cloud storage, music and video, and which could possibly connect with the company\u2019s iPhone subscriptions. Mr Cook stopped short of announcing a unique subscription service, promising instead to roll out five separate offerings, some of which are merely older services in nicer packaging. Together, they nevertheless threaten fellow tech giants, Hollywood and banks.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nApple TV+, which got featured billing from Mr Cook, will offer original programming from Ms Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Sesame Street and others in more than 100 countries. The money Apple plans to spend on original shows\u2014perhaps $1bn to $2bn thus far\u2014is dwarfed by that of Netflix, which will splurge as much as $15bn this year on original and licensed content, or Disney, whose own video-streaming is expected shortly. But Apple\u2019s high-profile shows are for now meant chiefly to lure customers into its universe of apps and services. That includes subscription services for games, a catalogue of big American magazines (and a few newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal), and, in America, pay-TV networks such as HBO, Showtime and Starz. You can pay for it all using your new Apple Card, developed with bankers at Goldman Sachs. The credit card puts Apple in direct competition with banks: it has no fees and will give users 2% cash back on purchases made via Apple Pay, the company\u2019s payments system\u2014or 3% on purchases of Apple kit and services.\n\nAlthough Apple continues to earn most of its money from devices, its business in services is growing quickly, accounting for nearly $40bn of revenues of $266bn in 2018 (see chart). The new subscription offerings, which are easier to click and buy than their predecessors, should accelerate that trend. Its new partners hope to be along for the ride. Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that Apple may convert 10% of the 85m monthly users of its free News app into paying subscribers, for instance. Amazon Channels, which Apple TV channels aped, has boosted subscriptions for HBO, Showtime and Starz. Apple gets a cut of newspaper and TV subscriptions sold through its services, just as it gets a cut of sales in its app store.\n\nSome content providers are leery. The New York Times and Washington Post have spurned Apple\u2019s advances on behalf of its news service. Netflix and Disney will not partake in Apple TV+, which they view as more a threat than an opportunity.\n\nThey are right to be cautious. The future of media will belong to whoever controls relationships with consumers, industry insiders say. Thanks to its ubiquitous devices, Apple has hundreds of millions of customer relationships. With that comes the power to get more of their time and money, and to cut out competitors. Mr Cook may put on a lacklustre show, but his rivals had better watch him regardless."

    "text": "I T IS TEMPTING to lump Europe\u2019s two big southern countries together. Italians and Spaniards talk loudly, eat late, drive fast and slurp down life-prolonging quantities of tomatoes and olive oil (such, at least, are the clich\u00e9s). They were cradles of European anarchism in the 19th century and fascism in the 20th century; brushing dictatorship under the carpet before embracing Europe in the post-war years. During the euro-zone crisis from 2009 they were two components of the ugly acronym \u201c PIGS \u201d (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain) denoting particularly indebted economies. Today once more they are being mentioned in the same breath.\n\nItalian volatility appears to be arriving on the Iberian peninsula. Spain\u2019s once boringly bi-party politics has become a five-party kaleidoscope with the emergence of the hard-left Podemos, the centre-right Ciudadanos and most recently the hard-right Vox. It is increasingly polarised by battles over Catalan independence. Last summer Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s centre-left Socialists ( PSOE ), backed by Catalan nationalists, toppled a centre-right People\u2019s Party ( PP ) government. But the Catalans refused to back the new government\u2019s budget, forcing Mr S\u00e1nchez to call an election for April 28th. A right-wing coalition of PP , Ciudadanos and Vox (which would surely inflame Catalan nationalism) or a deadlock and new elections are the most likely outcomes.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIt can ill-afford either. The country\u2019s recovery belies the urgency of pension, education and labour reforms, as well as nagging corruption and a rise in trans-Mediterranean migration. Years of political instability would leave these priorities unattended. Eurocrats note that Spain last year missed more deadlines for implementing EU legislation than any other member state. The sudden emergence of Vox and its embrace by other parties (it props up a PP -led government in Andalusia) evokes at once the country\u2019s Francoist past and alarming parallels with Italy. There, the Northern League, once a peripheral Vox-like party, now dominates a chaotic, Eurosceptic coalition that is spooking markets as decades of negligible growth make its debt pile teeter.\n\nYet despite all that, fundamental differences to do with national metabolism, lost on some northern European officials, separate the two countries. Italy is shackled by conservatism and stasis. Its euro-zone crisis was (and is) the mild acceleration of a long-term national slump. GDP has barely grown since the late 1990s, making a debt mountain accumulated in earlier times unsustainable. Spain meanwhile hurtles forward, having grown by almost half during that period. Its euro-zone misery was more sharp and dramatic: a hyperactive construction boom raced off a cliff during the banking crisis, causing a spike in unemployment.\n\nThe difference between slow-metabolism Italy and fast-metabolism Spain goes beyond economic statistics. Decline has been the defining Italian experience of the past decades, so the new looks threatening and unwelcome there. But Spaniards have experienced the past decades as a time of rising prosperity and freedom after the drab Franco years. They are neophiles, willing to try anything that smacks of the future. The contrast between the two countries is that between Spain\u2019s urban spaces, which gleam with futuristic architecture and public works, and Italy\u2019s peeling cities; between Spaniards\u2019 openness to social change and Italians\u2019 conservatism; between the existential melancholy of Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s films and the freneticism of Pedro Almod\u00f3var.\n\nA fast national metabolism has its downsides. Some of Spain\u2019s shiny new infrastructure is wasteful and some Spaniards, especially in rural areas, resent the pace of change and are turning to Vox in protest. But it does also make Spain\u2019s descent into reactionary Italy-style stagnation improbable. For one thing, its economy is fitter. Spain had a deeper euro-crisis but recovered faster, thanks to drastic economic reforms and spending cuts. Exports and FDI surged. Its GDP per person in purchasing-power terms overtook that of Italy in 2017 and is forecast to be 7% higher within five years. Heavy investment in roads and high-speed rail has made Spain\u2019s infrastructure the tenth best in the world, says the World Economic Forum. Italy is 21st.\n\nA sunny country\n\nAll of which translates into an outward-looking optimism. Mr S\u00e1nchez, who wants Spain to become a third partner in the Franco-German alliance, is particularly pro- EU , but the PP \u2019s Pablo Casado admires Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats in Germany and Albert Rivera of Ciudadanos brandishes EU flags at his rallies. According to Eurobarometer, 68% of Spaniards view the EU positively compared with 36% of Italians. Vox directs its anti-establishment ire not at the EU so much as at feminists and separatist Catalans.\n\nIt also talks about immigration, but less than other European right-populist parties. Why? The foreign-born share of the population rose from 3% to 14% in the two decades to 2008, but Spaniards are more likely than any other EU population to declare themselves comfortable in social interactions with migrants (83% compared with 40% of Italians). Despite rising immigration from Africa and new efforts to improve border security, none of Spain\u2019s main parties proposes to close ports or indulges in Mr Salvini\u2019s brand of anti-migrant posturing. In other areas, too, Spaniards have left the chauvinism of the Franco years behind; a broad consensus backs gender equality and gay rights (equal marriage was introduced in 2005, behind only Belgium and the Netherlands).\n\nYears of political chaos could threaten this picture. But if that applies to Spain, it applies to other European countries too, where the same fragmentation is taking place. Last year\u2019s change of government, though fraught, was procedurally exemplary and proof that Spain\u2019s young constitutional order now has at least the maturity of its western European neighbours. It is Italy, with its decades-old fractiousness and stagnation, that looks more out of kilter. Spain is different, goes the old saying. But Italy is more so."

    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "A ROUND 19 IN every 20 European internet searches are carried out on Google. Not those done by Margrethe Vestager. The European Union\u2019s competition chief says she mostly looks stuff up on Qwant, which prides itself on not tracking users in the manner its larger rival does. Forget also Google Maps, or Gmail, or any other product from the Alphabet stable: \u201cI have better alternatives that provide me with more privacy,\u201d the Danish politician recently told a crowd at SXSW , an annual festival of tech, music and thought in Austin, Texas.\n\nMs Vestager is hardly at the vanguard of a movement: even in its domestic French market, Qwant has less than 1% market share. Nor, at first, might her focus on privacy seem linked to her trustbusting brief. But, as she has explained, popular services like Facebook use their customers as part of the \u201cproduction machinery\u201d. You may not pay in cash to like a friend\u2019s pictures, or every time you ask Alexa what a \u201ccup\u201d of butter is in grams\u2014but you might as well do, given how much personal data you have to fork over. Rather melodramatically, Ms Vestager says what seem to be free services are ones for which you \u201cpay with your life\u201d.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThose appointed, by governments or themselves, to worry about competition have a strong interest in big tech firms such as Google and its parent Alphabet, Apple, Amazon and Facebook. How could they not, given how quickly those firms have come to dominate the business landscape. On both sides of the Atlantic, the reputation that big-tech companies other than Apple have for making free with people\u2019s data has led to rules being tightened, and there is talk of tightening them more. There are other concerns, too. Europeans have a fairly strong feeling that the firms do not pay enough tax. Everywhere there are worries about the content which they spread\u2014such as, for a while, video of the massacre in Christchurch\u2014and that which they are thought to suppress.\n\nTech groups have hordes of lobbyists experienced in weathering these various issues. Occasional losses\u2014such as the \u20ac1.5bn ($1.7bn) that Google was fined on March 20th for abusing its clout in the online-advertising market\u2014can to some extent just be treated as a cost of doing business. What they are not so well prepared for is the crossing of some of these streams of complaint. European regulators are bringing together concerns about privacy and rules about competition to create constraints that could up-end the way companies do business online.\n\nCommon market power\n\nCampaigners have long lamented that, although the users of online platforms tell pollsters that they care about privacy, they do not act as if they do. If privacy becomes tied to antitrust concerns, though, users do not need to care. They merely need to be content that regulators armed with big sticks\u2014European regulators are empowered to levy fines on companies operating in Europe that are a significant fraction of their global revenue\u2014should care on their behalf. Ms Vestager and her colleagues seem happy to do the honours.\n\nThe premise for bringing together concerns about privacy and competition is that the tight grip which big tech companies have over user data is what has turned them into entrenched, and perhaps abusive, incumbents. As Andreas Mundt, head of Germany\u2019s competition watchdog, the Bundeskartellamt, puts it, \u201cEurope says\u2026that data can provide market power.\u201d In February, his agency startled technology companies and those who analyse them with a ruling against Facebook built on such an analysis. In a 300-page finding it argued that Facebook was only able to gather so much data because of its dominant position amid social networks.\n\nThe measure of market power usually used to justify action on competition grounds is, roughly speaking, that a company is able to raise prices without losing customers. Such an ability suggests that the level of competition in the market needs at least looking into, and perhaps redressing. Facebook, being free to its public users (though not to the advertisers who buy the users\u2019 attention), cannot have its market power analysed in this way. But Mr Mundt says that the company\u2019s ability to encroach ever more on its users\u2019 privacy without seeing them leave\u2014for example, by starting to track them while they browse sites not connected to Facebook\u2014is also a measure of market power.\n\nThis analysis is leading to strict new rules on the amount of data Facebook can collect from German users. It can no longer mesh together the data it gathers from its various services, including WhatsApp and Instagram, as it has said it wants to do. There are also restrictions on how much it can track its users when they browse the internet beyond Facebook. Mr Mundt compares these new constraints on the flow of information inside the company to Facebook being \u201cinternally broken up\u201d.\n\nThe logical step beyond limiting the accrual of data is demanding their disbursement. If tech companies are dominant by virtue of their data troves, competition authorities working with privacy regulators may feel justified in demanding they share those data, either with the people who generate them or with other companies in the market. That could whittle away a big chunk of what makes big tech so valuable, both because Europe is a large market, and because regulators elsewhere may see Europe\u2019s actions as a model to copy. It could also open up new paths to innovation.\n\nEurope is not an impressive performer when it comes to creating tech behemoths. It is as well represented among big global tech companies as companies other than Google are in search-engine statistics: there is just one ( SA P , a business software company) in the top 20. Look at the top 200 internet companies and things are, if anything, a touch worse; just eight. But in regulatory heft the EU punches far above its members\u2019 business weight.\n\nThere are various ways of explaining this. One is that Europe\u2019s keenness to regulate stops its tech firms from growing in the way that hands-off America encourages. Another is that the rigours of its zealous regulation are experienced, in the main, only by foreigners\u2014which makes them more palatable to, or even popular with, politicians and the public. \u201cWould Brussels be so tough on big tech companies if they were French or German?\u201d asks one American executive, rhetorically.\n\nThere is also the consideration that the companies potentially \u201cdisrupted\u201d by internet innovators include European carmakers, telecoms companies and media groups, about whom European politicians care a lot. New copyright regulations being voted on by the European Parliament next week have been widely criticised for putting the interests of copyright holders, which largely means media companies, far ahead of the interests of online companies and, indeed, the free expression of users.\n\nRegardless of motive, though, this is now the way of the world. A look at the annual reports of big tech companies clearly shows that they have a lot of European issues to face, including taxes (see chart 1). And this means that differences between the ways in which Europeans and Americans think about competition and privacy matter a lot.\n\nBrussels rules\n\nTake competition first. Much of the underlying law governing cartels, mergers and competition is quite similar on both sides of the Atlantic. But the continents\u2019 approaches to handling big companies are leagues apart.\n\nIn recent decades, American antitrust policy has been dominated by free-marketeers of the so-called Chicago School, deeply sceptical of the government\u2019s role in any but the most egregious cases. Dominant firms are frequently left unmolested in the belief they will soon lose their perch anyway: remember MySpace? The lure of fat profits is, after all, what motivates firms to innovate in the first place. While there is healthy academic debate over whether online businesses naturally, or even inevitably, have a tendency towards monopoly, it has yet to have much effect on regulation. American courts view dominant firms as a problem only if their position does clear harm to consumers.\n\nBy contrast, \u201cEurope is philosophically more sceptical of firms that have market power,\u201d says Cristina Caffarra at Charles River Associates, an economics consultancy. Its regulators want to see competitors that have been less successful continue to exist, and even thrive. Competition is seen as valuable in and of itself, to ensure innovation happens beyond one firm that has conquered the market.\n\n\u201cThe debate on whether there has been underenforcement of antitrust is far more dynamic in Europe\u2014there is a sense of urgency,\u201d says Isabelle de Silva, head of France\u2019s competition authority. Germany and Austria have changed laws to allow them to scrutinise takeovers of startups, in the belief tech incumbents are taking out future rivals before they have time to hatch into real competitors. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have together taken over a company per week for the past five years.\n\nThere is not just more interest in regulating big tech in Europe; there is also more power to do so. William Kovacic, a former boss of the Federal Trade Commission in America, said recently that Brussels is \u201cthe capital of the world\u201d for antitrust, leaving its American counterparts \u201cin the shade\u201d. American antitrust typically involves prosecuting the case in front of a judge. The European Commission can decide and impose fines by itself, without the approval of national governments, though the decisions are subject to appeal in the courts. And whereas, in America, only federal agencies can apply federal law, European antitrust law can be applied both by national authorities and the commission.\n\nEvery major tech group has had run-ins with European antitrust rules. Since 2017, Google has been sanctioned three times, running up \u20ac8.2bn in fines for promoting its own shopping-comparison service in search results and edging out rivals with its Android phone software, as well as for abusing its strength in advertising. It is appealing the decisions. In 2017 Facebook was fined \u20ac110m for misinforming the EU about its plans for integrating WhatsApp with its flagship social network.\n\nIn the same year Amazon was rebuked for the way it sold e-books, agreeing to change its practices. It is now under an early-stage investigation both in Germany and Europe-wide for the way it uses sales data from its \u201cMarketplace\u201d platform to compete with the independent retailers who sell through it. On March 13th Spotify, a Swedish music-streaming service, demanded that the commission step in to stop Apple levying hefty fees from those who sell services through its App Store.\n\nThen there is privacy. In the past century almost all European countries have experienced dictatorship, either home-grown or imposed through occupation, which has raised sensitivities. \u201cPrivacy is a fundamental right at EU level, in a way that it is not in America,\u201d says Andrea Renda of the Centre for European Policy Studies, a think-tank. That right is enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in the same way that free speech is protected by America\u2019s constitution. Polls show Europeans, and particularly Germans, to be more concerned about the use of their personal data by private companies than Americans are.\n\nWhen American tech companies first encountered these concerns they were relatively trifling. In 2010 German authorities demanded Google blur the homes of anyone who objected to appearing in its Street View service. (Rural Germany remains one of the last places where well-off people live beyond the service\u2019s coverage.) Four years later, an EU -wide \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d provided some circumstances in which citizens could expunge stories about them from search results.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), which came into force last May, raised the issue to a new level. Beyond harmonising data protection across Europe, it also established a principle that individuals should be able to choose how the information about them is used. This is an issue not just for the companies which currently dominate the online world\u2014the provisions of the GDPR were central to the German ruling on Facebook\u2014but also for that world\u2019s basic business model.\n\nThe data about their users collected by apps and browsers is the bedrock of online advertising\u2014a business which in 2018 was worth $108bn in America according to eMarketer, a consultancy. The most valuable part of the industry works by selling the user\u2019s attention to the highest bidder, a simple-sounding proposition which requires a labyrinthine and potentially leaky \u201cadtech\u201d infrastructure.\n\nEnterprises called \u201csupply-side platforms\u201d use data from apps and from cookies in browsers to pass a profile of every person who visits an advertising-supported page to an advertising exchange. There the rights to show adverts are auctioned off user by user. Bidders use the data from the supply-side, along with further data procured from brokers, to decide how likely the user is to act on their ad, and thus how much it is worth to show it to him. The highest bidder gets to put its ad on the user\u2019s screen (see chart 2). Meanwhile, data associated with the transaction are used to update the brokers\u2019 records.\n\nThe more pertinent data the bidders get, the more the winning advertiser is likely to bid. This builds in incentives to get as much data to as many bidders as feasible. And that is not particularly conducive to the protection of privacy.\n\nThe introduction of the GDPR spurred legal challenges to this system across Europe (see article). Some decisions are already headed to appeal, and it seems sure that eventually at least a few will make it all the way up the tree to the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe price of freedom\n\nThose cases will help determine the long-term impact of the GDPR . So will the degree to which other countries take up ideas like those of Mr Mundt, the German regulator. European regulators do not all see eye to eye on mingling privacy and antitrust, according to Alec Burnside of Dechert, a law firm. But he notes that there is something much closer to consensus on it than there would be in America. The way Ms Vestager talks about privacy seems quite in line with her German counterpart.\n\nTech lobbyists in Brussels worry that Ms Vestager agrees with those who believe that their data empires make Google and its like natural monopolies, in that no one else can replicate Google\u2019s knowledge of what users have searched for, or Amazon\u2019s of what they have bought. She sent shivers through the business in January when she compared such companies to water and electricity utilities, which because of their irreproducible networks of pipes and power lines are stringently regulated.\n\nSometimes the power of such networks gets them broken up: witness AT&T . Elizabeth Warren, a senator who wants to be the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential candidate in 2020, has suggested Facebook and Google could also be split up. Ms Vestager pours cold water on the idea. But Europe\u2019s privacy-plus-antitrust approach offers a halfway house: force the companies to share their data, thus weakening their market power and empowering the citizenry.\n\nIn mid-March a panel appointed by the British government and led by Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who was an adviser in Barack Obama\u2019s White House, advocated such an approach, suggesting a regulator empowered to liberate data from firms to which it provided \u201cstrategic market status\u201d. An EU panel with a similar remit is expected to issue recommendations along the same lines soon.\n\nThe idea is for consumers to be able to move data about their Google searches, Amazon purchasing history or Uber rides to a rival service. So, for example, social-media users could post messages to Facebook from other platforms with approaches to privacy that they prefer. The innovative engineers of the tech incumbents would still have vast troves of data to work with. They could just no longer count on privileged access to them. The same principle might also lead to firms being able to demand anonymised bulk data from Google to strengthen rival search engines. Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger of Oxford University points to precedent: large German insurers have to share data with smaller rivals to help them gauge risk.\n\nThis may not be as fine a solution as it might sound. Getting lots of personal data to move freely while also keeping it safe is not straightforward. Users would be required to give serious thought to the question of with whom they wanted to share their information, as opposed to blindly clicking \u201cAccept\u201d buttons to get rid of pop-ups, as mostly happens today. Anonymising a large dataset\u2014such as a compendium of Google searches which might then be used to train a rival\u2019s algorithms\u2014is harder than it might seem. Identifiable data about individuals can seep regardless.\n\nAnd there may not be much appetite for it. Following Britain\u2019s lead, the EU has forced banks to allow their clients to move their data to third parties. But demand for services that let personal-finance apps look at your bank statements has yet to take off. Google and Facebook offer their users the possibility of downloading a portion of the data those users have provided to the firms (though those taking the offer up are best advised to have a large hard drive). But few rivals have invested in complementary systems that allow you to upload those data, suggesting that a lack of user data is not the factor limiting their ability to take on today\u2019s incumbents.\n\nStill, the assumption remains that a combined focus on antitrust and privacy could, over time, both reduce the incumbents\u2019 market power and open up new routes to competition. Enthusiasts point to IBM , faced with antitrust action, divorcing its software and hardware businesses in 1969. That created a new industry for software writers to explore. A world of social networks empowered to share aspects of Facebook\u2019s map of who knows whom and likes what, while being free to explore business models other than advertising could produce all sorts of profitable, socially useful innovation by firms in Europe and around the world. And though Facebook might not do as well in such a future as it would if given free rein, it could still prosper. The past half-century has not been an irredeemably shabby one for IBM."

    "text": "\u201cW E WERE SHOCKED ,\u201d says Brad Lister, of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe the first results. I remember [in the 1970s] butterflies everywhere after rain. On the first day back [in 2012], I saw hardly any.\u201d Dr Lister is describing the Luquillo forest of Puerto Rico, where he recently carried out a census of insect life and found it had been almost wiped out in 40 years. But he could be talking about many other places. Over the past few years, scores of scientific studies have found declines in different measures of insect life and health, all of the order of 50-80%, in areas as far apart as Germany, California and Borneo.\n\nThe findings have triggered alarm, almost panic. Animals, mostly insects, pollinate 87% of flowering plants, according to a recent study by the UN \u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ). Without insects, most plants could not reproduce. They break down and recycle the nutrients that plants need for photosynthesis. They decompose organic waste and feed a large proportion of all birds and bats. E.O. Wilson, an American biologist, calls insects \u201cthe heart of life on Earth.\u201d\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe studies suggest that such life is in peril. One talks of \u201cthe dreadful state of insect biodiversity\u201d. Its authors give warning of \u201cthe extinction of 40% of the world\u2019s insect species over the next few decades\u201d. If insects really do face extinction, it would be an immense environmental crisis. But how real is that possibility? What do the data actually tell us?\n\nIn terms of the number of species, insects are by far the most abundant of life forms. Scientists have identified and described over 1m species of insect, compared with only about 6,000 mammals and 18,000 birds. Insects are so numerous that they contain three times as much mass as humans and 30 times that of all wild mammals. \u201cTo judge by his creation,\u201d a geneticist, J.B.S. Haldane, once quipped \u201cGod must have an inordinate fondness for stars and beetles.\u201d\n\nLittle about this astonishing bounty is known. Using computer models of ecosystems, Nigel Stork of Griffith University, Queensland, estimates there are 5.5m species of insect and 6.8m of terrestrial arthropods (the wider category that includes spiders and crustaceans). That implies over 80% of insects remain undiscovered. Arthur Shapiro of the University of California, Davis, tells the story of travelling by bus across Patagonia, when he broke down in the middle of nowhere. In the two hours it took to mend the engine, and while he stayed within sight of the vehicle the whole time, he found three species of butterfly new to science. \u201cThat\u2019s how little we know.\u201d\n\nEven when individual species are described, the process yields only partial information. Scientists have little hard data on what the vast majority of insects eat, how mobile they are or what determines their reproductive success. There has been almost no long-term monitoring of their numbers. \u201cAround and beneath our feet,\u201d writes Dr Wilson, \u201clies the least explored part of the planet\u2019s surface.\u201d\n\nFor many years, it did not seem possible or necessary to study insect populations. In their murmuring trillions, insects seemed safe from the pressures that were driving predatory mammals towards extinction. It was unimaginable that so many could disappear. As a haiku by Basho, a Japanese monk, puts it, \u201cNothing in the cry of cicadas suggests they are about to die.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s a few disturbing signs of decline began to appear. Long-distance drivers across America and Europe reported that their windscreens were no longer splattered with bugs. Pilots in the Arctic Circle now describe the same thing. Urban streetlights are no longer enveloped by clouds of photophilous moths. Insect-eating birds began to disappear. But these signs could be explained away by, say, more aerodynamic car designs, or changes to farming. The evidence was anecdotal.\n\nThere are, though, a few exceptions to the rule that no long-term databases of insect populations exist. The biggest is kept by Butterfly Conservation, a charity based in Dorset in southern England. It has records from 1690 but its most important data begin in 1976 when, concerned by the anecdotes of decline, two government scientists designed a simple monitoring system. Every week in summer, volunteer butterfly-spotters walk slowly along fixed paths, or \u201ctransects\u201d, and log every butterfly and moth they see within 2.5 metres of their path. In Hethfelton Wood, near Wool, in Dorset, the path loops through a forest that, now partially felled, is reverting to heathland. Volunteers have logged 35 species of butterfly there since 2000, ranging from Graylings and White Admirals to thriving species such as the Silver-Washed Fritillary, which is rare elsewhere.\n\nThe project, called the United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme ( UKBMS ), proved such a hit with Britain\u2019s amateur naturalists that the scientists were overwhelmed with data. Now, 2,000 volunteers monitor more than 2,500 sites and produce 3m records a year. It is by far the most detailed insect data set in the world and, unlike most, measures both whether a species occurs in an area and how abundant it is. It shows that between 1976 and 2014, 32 of Britain\u2019s 56 native butterflies declined in numbers, 21 by more than 40%. The biggest falls were among species classed as habitat specialists, with limited ranges or which feed on a small number of plants.\n\nA second long-term set of data also monitors butterflies, is older and, heroically, is conducted by just one person. Every two weeks since 1972, Professor Shapiro of UC Davis has trekked along ten transects in central California, noting the butterflies he sees (159 species and subspecies). Since 1972, the number of species has fallen in half the transects and risen in one; 2017-18, he says, was \u201ca terrible, perhaps even catastrophic butterfly year\u201d.\n\nThe third data set is kept by the Krefeld Entomological Association, a group of professional and amateur naturalists in a town near Dusseldorf in western Germany. Their headquarters is lined with wooden cases full of insect specimens found in the surrounding grasslands, dunes and woods, meticulously labelled. In 1989 the society began setting up so-called Malaise traps, large tent-like structures that trap flying insects, in local sites in spring and summer. There are now 63 sites. This collection method records the total biomass of insects in the trap, a good measure of the amount of food available to birds and other predators but which tells you nothing about which species are being caught or how many of each there are. More than half the traps have only been checked once since 1989 and even those that are checked more than once are not monitored in consecutive years. The results are not those of a classic longitudinal study.\n\nBuggy data\n\nBut when Caspar Hallmann of Radboud University in the Netherlands combed through the data in 2017, all doubts about their significance were silenced. Between 1989 and 2016 he found the biomass of flying insects in this corner of western Germany fell 77%, or over 5% a year. Making the results more remarkable is that the traps were set up in nature reserves which, though hardly pristine, are better protected from clouds of insecticides than most land in western Europe. \u201cWe were amazed,\u201d says Dave Goulson of the University of Sussex, one of the co-authors. The study was the third most frequently cited scientific study (of all kinds) in the media in 2017 and pushed the governments of Germany and the Netherlands into setting up programmes to protect insect diversity.\n\nSince then, more surveys have confirmed the results. Early this year, Francisco S\u00e1nchez-Bayo of the University of Sydney and Kris Wyckhuys of the University of Queensland, reviewed all the studies they could find mentioning insect decline. Theirs was the first study of studies. The authors found that 53% of lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) were in decline; 49% of coleoptera (beetles) and 46% of hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants and sawflies). Over a third of insect species, they claimed, are threatened with extinction.\n\nFishing for insects\n\nThat species are failing in some places is not in dispute. What is less clear is whether the decline is global. Drs S\u00e1nchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys found a mere 73 papers. That is not enough, argues Alex Wild of the University of Texas, Austin, to say much about anything globally.\n\nThere have been no surveys of wild insect numbers in India, China, Siberia, the Middle East or Australia and only a single study each in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. These areas include almost all the tropics where the majority of insect species are thought to live.\n\nMost of the biggest declines have been measured in Europe and the United States, where the human footprint lies heaviest on the landscape and where modern agricultural methods are almost universal. Given the paucity of evidence, it is impossible to say whether insect numbers really have declined the most in these two areas or whether they have fallen everywhere but these are the places that have been studied.\n\nIt is true that all 73 studies show declines. But that is because the authors went looking for that result. They typed the search terms [insect*] and [declin*] and [survey] into a database. \u201cEstimates based on this \u2018unidirectional\u2019 methodology,\u201d argues Chris Thomas of the University of York in Britain, \u201care not credible.\u201d Nor do all studies show a decline (though they were not captured by the search). A recent study found pollinators are increasing in undisturbed habitats in south-eastern Spain. \u201cThis provides evidence,\u201d that report says, \u201cthat pollinator declines are not universal beyond anthropogenic ecosystems.\u201d\n\nNo less important, the relationship between declining insect numbers and damage to ecosystems is not a simple linear one. Both Drs S\u00e1nchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys and the UKBMS found that generalist pollinators (such as Brown Argus and Gatekeeper butterflies) are doing less badly than specialists, such as the White Admirals, which are now extinct in some regions. Generalists are presumably moving into niches vacated by specialists, a process that is not without risks. At low levels of diversity, ecosystems become vulnerable to diseases that can sweep through a single species. Nevertheless, this process is a reminder that insect ecosystems are more resilient than they sometimes appear.\n\nThat is also true of the floral ecosystems that depend on insect pollinators. Jane Memmott of the University of Bristol investigated what happens when insect species die out by gradually removing one pollinator after another in a controlled environment and keeping track of what happened to the plants. She found that, depending on which species was removed first, most plants managed to hang on even after more than two-thirds of insects had been removed, illustrating the resilience of ecosystems. Only when more than 90% of insect species were removed, did floral diversity collapse.\n\nBuzz off\n\nAll of this provides reasons to be cautious about extrapolating too far from the data. But there are still three big reasons to worry about what is known.\n\nFirst, the scale. Declines of more than 50% in most measures of insect health seem more severe than the diminution in other taxonomic ranks. A British study from 2004 found that insect species are declining faster than birds or plants. Almost all species and subspecies are affected, regardless of the altitude at which they live. Declines have been drastic even in protected reserves.\n\nSecond, it is worrying that so many influences are contributing to the decline. It is as if, in the insects\u2019 world, everything is going wrong at once. The main causes seem to be, in order of importance: habitat loss (97% of wildflower meadows have been grubbed up in Britain since the 1930s); intensive farming, which leaves fewer unproductive parcels of land for wildlife; pesticide use; and the spread of diseases and parasites such as the varroa mite, once confined to East Asia where local bees had a measure of resistance, but which is now killing honeybees worldwide. David Wagner of the University of Connecticut calls this \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d.\n\nThird, insects pose a less familiar sort of environmental problem, that of dwindling abundance. Biologists often think of biodiversity loss in terms of extinctions, especially of top-of-the-pile predators. But when a species is abundant, ecosystems come to depend on profusion, and a decline short of extinction can disrupt their workings profoundly. As Dr Memmott\u2019s experiment showed, the impact may be delayed but it will occur eventually.\n\nOne of the unnerving possibilities of insect decline is that it may have been going on decades before long-term monitoring started. After all, modern agricultural practices were well under way in the 1920s. This in turn could mean that the decline documented in Europe and America is even greater than it seems. That does not mean a global insect collapse is imminent, but the data do suggest there are good reasons for concern. \u201cIn the past three months,\u201d says Dr Lister, \u201cmy fear level has gone up. I worry that we might be reaching a point where insect decline becomes irreversible.\u201d"

    "text": "\u201cF OR ME, NOTHING\u2019S gonna change,\u201d says a police sergeant, hands on hips, huddled with colleagues in a station in a scruffy, violent district on Chicago\u2019s West Side. He sounds relaxed as the city begins its term under a \u201cconsent decree\u201d, a court-ordered process that imposes federal monitors to oversee police reforms. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good officer, it won\u2019t change anything,\u201d agrees another man in uniform.\n\nAs they will soon discover, much in fact will have to be done differently if a history of often unconstitutional policing in the Windy City is to end. Even as Los Angeles and New York have cut murder rates to historic lows over the past three decades, Chicago\u2019s remain three times higher. Officers have long proved trigger-happy and quick to cover up colleagues\u2019 wrongdoing. One calculation in 2016 found that they fired at a member of the public every five days, and had killed 92 people in the previous six years. And young black men are overwhelmingly the victims of police abuse.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nReform in Chicago has been hampered by strong police unions and politicians who dared not make enemies by confronting the 13,000 men in blue. Chicago long failed, for example, to train its officers properly. Eddie Johnson, the superintendent, recalls he was educated in use-of-force rules as a novice at the police academy in 1988 but not retrained for 28 years, until he became the top cop in 2016.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s appointment came after protests over an egregious killing, in which a white officer was filmed shooting a disoriented black teenager, Laquan McDonald, 16 times in 2014. (The officer was convicted of murder, a rarity in Chicago, last October.) Since then a new \u201cpointing policy\u201d discourages quick draws, though it has caused consternation in the force. Mr Johnson said recently that officers grumbled so much, \u201cit is the bane of my life.\u201d\n\nThough he talks of other recent improvements, such as officers\u2019 use of body cameras, he admits that difficulties linger. These include ongoing use of \u201cracist techniques\u201d and the fact \u201cwe treat part of the city inappropriately\u201d. He means his police are most likely to abuse Latino or black residents. This, Mr Johnson reckons, is the fault of a few rotten apples. \u201cWe need to identify the bad actors and get them out.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the problems are structural. The compensation doled out for wrongdoing by his force provides an illustration. Since 2010, such settlements plus interest have amounted to over $930m (not far off the $1.5bn annual budget for the police). In 2015 the city agreed to pay reparations of $5.5m to victims of a detective, Jon Burge, who led a team known as the \u201cMidnight Crew\u201d. For much of the 1970s and 1980s they beat, burned, raped, electrocuted or subjected to mock executions 118 suspects, probably many more, to get confessions.\n\nSuch systemic failings explain why the mayor, Rahm Emanuel, at last agreed to a consent decree. He says that after \u201cseven attempts in 100 years to reform\u201d, he is proud that bigger changes will come. The decree was in the works for two years, as first the Justice Department and then Illinois\u2019s attorney-general demanded it. It allows federal monitors to insist on openness and accountability across many departments, not only the police, says Walter Katz, who negotiated for the city. The experiences of other cities which have had decrees, such as Los Angeles, suggest it will last a decade or more.\n\nConsent decrees were made possible by legislation from 1994 (passed after riots in 1992 in Los Angeles, sparked by the acquittal of police officers who had beat a black motorist, Rodney King.) The Justice Department each year has typically picked two or three targets for reform from 18,000 police departments. It usually responds to a prominent case of police malpractice. According to a Justice Department review of two decades\u2019 use of decrees, there have been 69 formal investigations and 40 decrees covering police departments.\n\nDo they work? Because they apply to only a few of America\u2019s 18,000 police departments, it is hard to prove that consent decrees lead to fewer police shootings. (America\u2019s police killed 998 people in 2018, on a par with recent years.) But Stephen Rushin of Loyola University in Chicago, author of a book on consent decrees, says their benefits far outweigh costs. He says police use less \u201ccategorical force\u201d when being monitored, meaning acts that send members of the public to hospital rather than a morgue. Surveys also often show that public support for the police rises when decrees are in place. And Mr Rushin argues that cities can expect to pay less in civil suits after decrees take effect.\n\nWhat of objections that constrained police are less able to get on with arresting criminals? Heather MacDonald, author of \u201cThe War on Cops\u201d, has argued that violent crime rises when police pull back from \u201cproactive\u201d measures such as stop-and-frisks of potential suspects. In 2016 she said that increases in violence in cities like Chicago or Baltimore could be because police felt hamstrung.\n\nMr Rushin, aided by evidence from the past couple of years in which crime began to fall again, rejects that. He agrees that consent decrees hurt police morale and could make officers leave. His study of \u201cdepolicing\u201d did suggest a short-lived but \u201csignificant\u201d uptick in some crime rates, when police complain of \u201cgrowing pains\u201d from external oversight. But he suggests this involves property crime, not the violent sort. In the case of gun violence police typically reacted to shootings, and did not act proactively to prevent them. Nor does he see arrest rates generally falling.\n\nBeyond Chicago, the chance for new research on decrees will be limited. Under Barack Obama the Justice Department was keen on decrees, but Donald Trump\u2019s administration has frozen them, saying state or local authorities, not federal ones, should take charge. That stance won Mr Trump support from police unions, just as it infuriated civil-rights activists.\n\nThat need not mean the end of reforms, however. Individual cities can study the Justice Departments\u2019s 69 investigations of police departments and find ideas for change. The best processes are often the most open. In Chicago the first draft of the consent decree was made public, passed round 13 focus groups (including police officers) and took hundreds of hours to negotiate. Mr Rushin thinks more open-minded police departments, state and local governments can find lessons to apply for themselves, even without federal pressure."

    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "S IR VINCE CABLE revealed his plans to quit as leader of the Liberal Democrats in the same way as he led the party: without attracting much attention. A YouTube stream of his valedictory speech at the party\u2019s spring conference on March 17th has so far received fewer than 1,000 views. By the time he had finished, an orderly queue to replace the 75-year-old had formed. Jo Swinson, the deputy leader, and Layla Moran, the party\u2019s education spokeswoman, who was elected only in 2017, are the bookmakers\u2019 favourites. Sir Ed Davey, who served in the coalition government of 2010-15 and has the knighthood to prove it, is also mulling a run.\n\nWhoever takes over faces a tricky task. The Lib Dems, who were in government with the Tories only four years ago, putter along at barely 10% in the polls. They struggle to make the headlines\u2014an unfortunate exception being this week, when they suspended a former leader, Lord Steel, after he said he had failed to report his \u201cassumption\u201d that Cyril Smith, a late Lib Dem MP, had sexually abused children. The party\u2019s finances are shaky, with staff cuts at its headquarters before Christmas. Its opposition to Brexit has failed to return a political dividend. And new outfits such as the Independent Group (TIG) of former Labour and Tory MP s offer an alternative without the baggage that the Lib Dems picked up during their time in coalition.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nYet pathological optimism is a prerequisite for any Lib Dem. And there exist the outlines of a path to recovery. Local elections, in which the party has a justified reputation for viciously effective campaigning and an army of volunteers that belies its polling position, are due on May 2nd. An even bigger prize is on offer later that month if Britain ends up having to hold elections to the European Parliament, which uses proportional representation. Freed from the iniquities of first-past-the-post, the Lib Dems may scoop up Remainers wanting to cast a protest vote against Brexit. If the party can start posting decent election results, donors may return.\n\nSome Lib Dems think the best way to achieve those results would be through an alliance with TIG. This would scoop up 38 seats in a general election, based on current polling, according to Ceri Fowler and Chris Butler of Manchester University. That would see the Lib Dems overtake the Scottish nationalists to become the third-biggest party again. At the Lib Dems\u2019 conference, Ms Swinson argued for a close relationship, and shared a chummy panel with Anna Soubry, an ex-Tory TIG ger.\n\nOthers, including Sir Ed, want to know more about TIG\u2019 s policies first. And persuading members to approve a tie-up may be hard. Lib Dem activists are just as tribal as any other party\u2019s footsoldiers, as anyone who has witnessed their glee club singing \u201cTony Blair can fuck off and die\u201d to the tune of \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d can attest. At the conference, they voted down a plan to allow non-members to vote for their leader and even balked at letting non- MP s stand for the job.\n\nTIG gers also have doubts. Chris Leslie, a Labour defector, has pooh-poohed the idea of jumping into bed with the Lib Dems, saying they are still tainted by their time in coalition. Privately, some of the group say the Lib Dems are done for and want nothing to do with them. Nonsense, retorts Tim Farron, an irrepressibly bouncy former leader. \u201cYou always get people who are awkward. Most people think it is a real opportunity.\u201d\n\nA decent showing in May\u2019s elections and a new leader could yet reinvigorate Britain\u2019s exhausted fourth party. The danger is that a newer centrist option may eclipse it at the last minute. Even if things go in their favour, the Lib Dems still risk being overlooked."

    "text": "I N THE CUT-THROAT realm of reality TV, \u201cWanted Down Under\u201d is a survivor. A daytime fixture that has just finished its 13th season, the BBC documentary follows Britons contemplating relocating to Australia or New Zealand. Equal parts travel, property and life-makeover programme, it has a rival, \u201cA New Life in Oz\u201d, on Channel 5. If a country\u2019s TV schedules reflect its preoccupations, Britain\u2019s must be bake-offs, island love and migration to the southern hemisphere.\n\nAlthough stories about immigration make the front pages, Britain has a long-standing emigration habit. It was a net exporter of people until 1979. And when Britons migrate, they most often go down under. No country has received more poms than Australia in the past three decades, in which an average of 30,000 a year have moved there for the long term (this excludes tourists, who also go south in droves). The second-favourite destination in the latest year, Spain, got little more than half as many.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nDespite its reputation as a destination for prisoners, Australia attracted flocks of free settlers from the 1790s. It soon entered the British imagination as a worker\u2019s paradise, with plenty of land, jobs and meat. Charles Dickens had such great expectations of Australia that he sent several of his fictional characters\u2014and two of his real sons\u2014there for better lives. This fantasy continues. \u201cI think the Australian dream is definitely mine and it has been since Kylie and Jason walked down the aisle in \u2018Neighbours\u2019 [an Australian soap opera],\u201d said a Manchester mum recently on \u201cWanted Down Under\u201d.\n\nYet fewer Britons now have that dream. In 2017 only 19,000 made the hemispheric swap, down from a recent peak of 49,000 in 2006. These official figures have a high margin of error. But the decline has been fairly steady. It partly mirrors a slowdown in the total rate of emigration among Britons, which fell by 38% in the same period, as weak global economic growth provided fewer temptations to move. Australia\u2019s economy has fared well, but its stronger currency has made moving pricier. In 2006 \u00a31 was worth around A $2.50. Now it buys A $1.85, making it harder to swap a London flat for a Melbourne mansion.\n\nPaul Arthur, head of the Emigration Group, a company which helps Britons move to Australia and New Zealand, adds that until there is greater clarity regarding Britain\u2019s position after Brexit, some of his clients will put off their moves. At least they will still have \u201cWanted Down Under\u201d. The show\u2019s producer says she is already busy at work on series 14."

    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "H E SEEMS to have been a classic \u201clone wolf\u201d. As far as police can tell, the man who murdered 50 worshippers, and critically wounded nine more, at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15th was not part of any organisation. The 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, claimed to have developed his violent beliefs on his own, surfing the internet and visiting Europe. He bought his weapons himself. He honed his skills at a suburban shooting-range. No one there suspected that he was preparing a massacre.\n\nYet he was part of something much bigger. The names and slogans scrawled on his weapons were familiar to extreme white nationalists all around the world\u2014but hardly anyone else. His ranting internet manifesto, \u201cThe Great Replacement\u201d, repeated a staple far-right conspiracy theory: that non-white and Muslim immigrants in Western countries are invaders, ushered in by scheming elites to replace ethnic-European populations. Variants of that once-fringe idea are now common, not just in social-media posts by anonymous wackos but in the speeches of elected politicians from Hungary to Iowa.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn another sense, too, the lone wolf had a pack. Attacks by neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other extreme-right types are growing more common. In America they outnumber those committed by Islamists. Of 263 domestic terrorism incidents in 2010-17, fully 92 were carried out by far-right attackers, compared with 38 by jihadists, according to an analysis of the Global Terrorism Database by the Washington Post. In Europe jihadist killings still predominate, but deaths from extreme-right terrorism have surged since 2010 (see chart).\n\nThe past six months have seen a rash of far-right terrorist incidents. Last autumn a white nationalist killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. France broke up a plot to kill Emmanuel Macron, the president, and Spain arrested a fascist hoping to assassinate Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the prime minister. Germany uncovered an extremist cell in the army, allegedly planning to kill the foreign minister and others. In February America\u2019s FBI arrested a Coast Guard officer who had an arsenal and a target-list of Democratic politicians.\n\nGlobally, white-nationalist terrorism is far less deadly than the jihadist variety. But it is more prevalent than authorities acknowledge, says Jacob Aasland Ravndal of Norway\u2019s Centre for Research on Extremism. Legal definitions of terrorism often require that an attack be planned in advance. Much extreme-right violence is spontaneous. Even burning down a refugee centre may count as a hate crime, not terrorism. Europol, the EU \u2019s law-enforcement agency, ascribed just 3% of terrorist attacks in 2017 to the far right. But Mr Ravndal\u2019s database of ideologically motivated violent incidents shows that in western Europe, though jihadists kill more people, the far right carry out more attacks.\n\nMore right than they know\n\nIf the threat from white nationalists is underestimated, that is partly because they are more publicity-shy. Mr Tarrant and his hero, Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011, were exceptions. They left manifestos and tried to maximise media exposure. Indeed, the Christchurch killer also resembled sophisticated jihadist outfits, both in the ostentatious cruelty of his crime and in his hope that it would polarise society, fuelling yet more extremism.\n\nThe Breivik tradition\n\nIslamic State tries to provoke the West into persecuting Muslims and thus driving sympathisers from the \u201cgrey zone\u201d towards radical participation. Right-wing extremists may also hope to provoke an Islamist backlash. Police are investigating a possible terrorist motive behind the murder of three people on a tram in Utrecht in the Netherlands, three days after the massacre in Christchurch. A Turkish-born suspect has been arrested.\n\nIn Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has seized on the attack in Christchurch as evidence of a broad conspiracy against Turkey and Islam. He has quoted from the killer\u2019s manifesto, which includes calls to expel Turks from Europe and to kill Mr Erdogan. The president\u2019s not-so-subtle message is that only he can protect Turks from rampant white nationalism.\n\nThe Christchurch killer also hoped to provoke stricter gun laws, so that gun-owners would rise up in revolt. There is not much chance of more gun control in America, Mr Tarrant\u2019s primary target. However, Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, is moving to tighten her country\u2019s lax gun laws. This will not start a civil war. New Zealand prides itself on multiculturalism (see article). Its politics are more moderate than Australia\u2019s.\n\nThat, along with its easy gun laws, may have been why Mr Tarrant picked New Zealand. He wrote that he wanted to prove that nowhere was safe. Muslims in Christchurch have lost all sense of security. Tofazzal Alam, who survived the attack, says he is now afraid \u201cto go to mosque, afraid of any crowd, afraid even to open the door\u201d.\n\nYet the killer\u2019s manifesto was inspired by events far away in Europe. He claimed he was converted to radical-right ideology on a trip to France in 2017, when he saw how much of the population was Muslim. He decorated his flak jacket with a \u201cblack sun\u201d, a symbol traced to a floor motif used in his castle by Heinrich Himmler, a Nazi leader. He decorated his weapons with the names of victims of jihadist attacks in Stockholm and Paris. Before the shootings, he listened in his car to \u201cGod is a Serb\u201d, a song written in 1993 in support of Radovan Karadzic\u2014a Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide for his role in the massacre of 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995.\n\nThe idea that Muslims and non-whites are \u201cinvaders\u201d imported by a cosmopolitan elite to replace ethnic Europeans has its roots in thinkers of the French \u201cnew right\u201d of the 1970s, such as Alain de Benoist and Renaud Camus. It is often linked to the belief that multicultural societies, far from promoting diversity, extinguish it by mixing distinct cultures and races together. The nuttiest apostles of such notions equate immigration with genocide.\n\nThese ideas attracted the anti-Muslim populist politicians who sprung up across Europe around the turn of the millennium, especially after the September 11th attacks in America. They inspired the far-right youth network Generation Identity. But the big impetus came in 2015-16, when some 2m asylum-seekers, mostly from the Middle East, poured into Europe.\n\nFor right-wing populists, this crisis was a godsend. Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, built a fence against the migrants and began calling himself a defender of Christian Europe. A frenzied opposition to Muslim immigration (real or imaginary) is the lodestar of populist-right parties in Germany, Poland, Sweden and Italy. At the European Parliament this month, Javier Ortega Smith of Vox, a new far-right Spanish party, thundered that had Spanish and Venetian fleets not won the battle of Lepanto against the Turks in 1571, every female MEP \u201cwould be wearing a burqa\u201d.\n\nDaniel Koehler of the German Institute on Radicalisation and De-radicalisation Studies says that it is no coincidence that extreme-right violence jumped during the migrant crisis, along with the fortunes of far-right parties: \u201cIf you think you have \u2026to protect against \u2018invaders\u2019\u2014how do you do that without using force?\u201d\n\nIn America, too, the rise in extreme-right violence is linked to mainstream politics. Between 2009 and 2018, white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists. In 2016, the year Donald Trump won the presidency, more anti-Muslim assaults were reported to the FBI (127) than in any year since 2001 (93).\n\nSuch attacks rose steeply after Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008. Daryl Johnson, who spent 15 years studying right-wing terrorist groups, including at the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ), wrote a paper in 2009 warning that the arrival that year of a black person in the White House could spark far-right violence. Demonised by conservatives for this, he left the DHS in 2010. Today, he says, it has no experts in right-wing terrorism. A spokesman did not deny this, but, in an email, said that the DHS is \u201ccommitted to combating all forms of violent extremism, especially those that espouse racial supremacy or bigotry\u201d.\n\nIn denial\n\nMr Trump has played down the threat of right-wing extremists, calling them \u201ca small group of people that have very, very serious problems\u201d. In 2017 his administration cancelled grants to groups combating white-supremacism. Peter Singer, a cyber-security expert at the New America Foundation who was invited to speak to Mr Trump\u2019s national-security staff that year, said that they dismissed white-supremacist terrorism as \u201ca law-enforcement issue\u201d, and denied that it is transnational.\n\nIn fact, the ties between American and European extreme-right groups are ever closer. Europe\u2019s Generation Identity groups are linked to Identity Evropa, one of the the American far-right organisations that planned a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, where a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd and killed a counter-protester. Marchers at that rally chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d, referring to the same \u201cgreat replacement\u201d thesis shared by European extremists and the Christchurch killer.\n\nMr Trump has played the role for American white nationalists that such leaders as Mr Orban played for Europe\u2019s, says Brian Levin, who heads the Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. These groups, he says, saw their ideas, such as building a wall like Mr Orban\u2019s, and banning or deporting Muslims, \u201cgetting into the mainstream tent\u201d. They took this as a \u201cgreen light\u201d for violence. And he notes that, like the young on Europe\u2019s extremist right, they have softened their image in the past decade. Shaved heads and combat boots have given way to army haircuts, polo shirts and corduroy jackets.\n\nFar-right groups lack the state sponsors and safe havens enjoyed by some jihadists. Many on the extreme right admire Russia but it does not fit the bill. It has cultivated ties with far-right parties in Europe, but has snuffed out extremists at home. In the 2000s hate-motivated attacks, often directed at immigrants and internal migrants from the north Caucasus, reached nearly 700 a year, as the state flirted with nationalist movements. Clashes in Moscow in 2011 between police and far-right groups mixed with football hooligans showed the dangers of tolerating the ultranationalists. After they joined anti-government protests in 2011-12, the state began shutting them down, detaining the most violent. In 2014 war with Ukraine split the movement into pro-government and pro-Ukrainian factions. The SOVA Centre, an independent monitor, recorded just 57 hate-motivated attacks in 2018.\n\nThe Ukrainian model\n\nOther Western white nationalists look to Ukraine itself, a hotbed of far-right activity since the Maidan uprising in 2014. Quasi-fascist militias, such as the Azov Battalion, have fought Russia in the east and taken a role in policing. So Kiev is \u201ca place of attraction for the global far-right\u201d, says Anton Shekhovtsov, of the University of Vienna. Some European radicals have joined Ukrainians on the front lines. American white supremacists have been spotted in Kiev. But as Mr Shekhovtsov puts it, \u201cmigration is a first-world problem\u201d, and, whereas earlier far-right groups would beat up foreigners from Africa and Asia, Azov is keener on disrupting gay-pride marches. In any case, Ukrainian men seeking romantic violence have plenty to do in the east.\n\nA more pressing concern for Western governments is far-right radicalism within their armed forces. Soldiers, obviously, are trained and have access to weapons. In America the DHS warned a decade ago that right-wing extremists will attempt to \u201crecruit and radicalise\u201d veterans, recalling the terrorist attacks of the 1990s by bitter ex-soldiers, such as the Oklahoma City bombing. A study of 119 lone-actor terrorists across America and Europe since 1990 found that 26% had done military service.\n\nRacial tension is rising in the armed services. A recent poll by Military Times, a newspaper, found that over half of non-white American service members had suffered racism in 2018, up from 42% in the previous year. In 2017 two marines were arrested for hanging a white-supremacist banner on a building in North Carolina. On March 18th the Huffington Post, a news website, identified seven serving American soldiers as active in Identity Evropa.\n\nThe German authorities are investigating some 450 cases of suspected right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr. Last year the security services identified dozens of police and soldiers as members of Reichsb\u00fcrger, a far-right movement. In Britain in September 2017 four soldiers were arrested for membership of National Action, a banned neo-Nazi group. \u201cIf we get enough of us into the Army,\u201d suggested one, \u201cwe\u2019ll be in the right place when things start to collapse.\u201d\n\nArmies are tightening their vetting procedures and becoming more vigilant. They insist that adherence to law is drilled into recruits. But, for good reason, most armed forces are prohibited from conducting political education.\n\nTracking sources of danger is hard because, as Mr Koehler, the German scholar, points out, far-right violence typically involves loose groups of individuals radicalised on social media. He calls this \u201chive terrorism\u201d. It is practically impossible to predict when someone will go from wishing others dead to actually killing them.\n\nThe Christchurch killer is a perfect example. He spent time on 8chan, a messageboard that prides itself on allowing users to post anything not illegal under American law. (After the attack, its administrators said they would co-operate with police.) It concerns itself with everything from Japanese cartoons to role-playing games. Anonymous posting is the norm.\n\nThe board\u2019s \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d subsections are far-right haunts. Their culture is a self-consciously puerile mishmash of memes, absurdism and irony, making it hard to know how seriously to take anything posted there. When Mr Tarrant declared on 8chan that he was about to commit murder, and proceeded to live-stream it on Facebook, many replies expressed surprise (often pleased) that the promised shooting spree was actually happening.\n\nThe killer\u2019s manifesto, too, is steeped in 8chan-like irony, a style sometimes termed \u201cshitposting\u201d. Serious rants about low European birth-rates alternate with claims to have been radicalised by \u201cSpyro the Dragon 3\u201d, a children\u2019s video game. If the media took such claims seriously, they would prove their own cluelessness.\n\nSince the attacks, there have been calls for internet platforms to do a better job of restricting violent right-wing content. Facebook has been blamed for letting the live-stream of the attack go on for 17 minutes. The platform says it began vigorously blocking the video as soon as it discovered it, removing 1.5m attempts to repost it. But internet users could still find copies hours after the attack. (It did not help that some \u201cmainstream\u201d media sites\u2014and even Mr Erdogan\u2014used some of it.)\n\nBig internet platforms could do more, but they face a gargantuan task. The underlying problem, says Ben Nimmo of the Oxford Internet Institute, is that \u201cradicalising content is not constant\u201d\u2014one viewer\u2019s trigger to violence is another\u2019s harmless satire. Hopes that artificial intelligence might do much of the filtering have not worked out; armies of human reviewers are still needed, and even they often err.\n\nHowever hard it is to stop terrorists exploiting the internet, other citizens can, at least, refuse to help them. The Christchurch killer\u2019s fixation on the former Yugoslavia is apt: as in that war, white nationalists seek to use spectacular violence and propaganda to turn citizens against each other. In New Zealand Ms Ardern has turned this on its head. She has tried to use horrific slaughter to unite a country in opposition to a creed whose most famous new exponent she refuses to name."

    "text": "\u201cI AM SIMPLY thrilled about all the folks you were able to admit,\u201d David Ellwood, the then dean of Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government, wrote to the then admissions dean, William Fitzsimmons, in a 2013 email entitled \u201cMy hero\u201d. \u201cAll big wins. [Name redacted] has already committed to a building.\u201d\n\nCharges brought against rich and famous people who are accused of illegally buying university places for their children has focused attention on an oddity in American higher education: that while it was illegal for these people to buy places, others can do so quite legally. This issue is normally hidden behind the veil of the \u201cholistic\u201d admissions policy which selective universities run. But a case in the Supreme Court in which Asian-American plaintiffs allege that Harvard\u2019s admissions system is racially biased has thrown a light on preference given to different groups, including \u201clegacies\u201d\u2014the children of alumni. Their parents do not have to fork out for them to be favoured, but since alumni are universities\u2019 principal source of donations after foundations, institutions that practice legacy preference defend it as essential.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nA survey by the Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, found that 29% of the class of 2021 had a close relation who had been at the university; 18% had at least one parent there. Nor is the practice confined to the top institutions. A survey of 499 admissions directors by Inside Higher Ed found that 42% of those at private universities used legacy preference.\n\nLegacy preference is, as Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and editor of \u201cAffirmative Action for the Rich\u201d, points out, both entirely un-American and uniquely American. It flies in the face of the ideals on which America was founded\u2014the rejection, as Thomas Jefferson put it, of the \u201cartificial aristocracy\u201d based on birth, which had corrupted Britain, in favour of a \u201cnatural aristocracy\u201d based on \u201cvirtue and talents\u201d. No other serious university system permits it. Universities in Britain, the only other country represented in the Times Higher Education league of the world\u2019s top ten universities, use test scores supplemented, in some institutions, with an interview.\n\nIn the 1920s, Ivy League college administrators feared that relying too much on exams to screen applicants would yield a high number of Jewish students. They set up admissions systems which embedded legacy preference. In the egalitarianism of the post-war era, universities tried to get rid of legacies, but were defeated by passionate opposition from their alumni.\n\nA nice fat tip\n\nNo combination of money and alumni clout, however powerful, will get a thick kid a place at a good university. University administrators point out that legacy applicants\u2019 SAT scores tend to be higher than average\u2014not surprising, since they tend to be richer and therefore better-prepared. In an interview with the Crimson, Mr Fitzsimmons referred to legacy as a \u201ctip\u201d which, other things being substantially equal, could win an applicant a place. But recent data suggest it is more than that. Michael Hurwitz, then at Harvard, calculated that, controlling for all relevant characteristics, being related to an alumnus of one of America\u2019s top 30 universities increased an applicant\u2019s chance threefold. Thomas Espenshade at Princeton found that it was the equivalent of 160 points on a SAT score where the maximum is 1,600.\n\nThe trial has forced Harvard to publicise its own numbers (see chart). The biggest advantage goes to athletes, but they are sometimes the same people as legacies\u2014as some of the sports which ease students in (lacrosse, rowing, golf) suggest. \u201cThe best donors\u201d, says an insider, \u201care sports scholars who went on to Harvard Business School. They \u2018bleed crimson\u2019.\u201d\n\nUniversities that favour legacy applicants say doing so helps pay for need-blind admissions, under which universities pay the bills of poorer students. But as Richard Reeves of the Brookings Institution points out, \u201cthey admit so few poor people that this is pocket change for them.\u201d According to Harvard\u2019s Raj Chetty, the university has 14 times as many students from the top than the bottom economic quintile. Legacies take places that might go to poorer people: Mimi Doe of Top Tier Admissions points out that half of places at top universities are fenced off by racial, athletic and legacy preferences. \u201cFor students who don\u2019t have any interesting \u2018hooks\u2019 on their cvs, acceptance rates of 10% of applicants come down to more like 5%.\u201d\n\nMIT , which does not favour legacies, has need-blind admissions. A study of 100 universities found that \u201cthe presence of legacy preference policies does not result in significantly higher alumni giving\u201d; those with legacy preference got more money from alumni, but that was because they had richer alumni. Abandoning the practice might be in the universities\u2019 interest. A study into the \u201cchild-cycle of alumni giving\u201d found that donations increased when alumni\u2019s children reached their early teens, and then dropped to below their original level when the child was turned down. Hell hath no fury like an alumnus whose child has been scorned.\n\nSome institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley, the University of California, Los Angeles and Texas A&M , have abandoned the practice. More than two-thirds of Americans are against it. Mr Kahlenberg notes that universities are increasingly unpopular among Americans. \u201cSome of this has to do with the idea that these are liberal bastions where students are being indoctrinated. But it is also about the fact that these are seen as gated communities where the privileged protect their positions in society.\u201d A majority of the admissions directors surveyed by Inside Higher Ed opposed it, including 11% of those who practised it. The Crimson wants it ended. \u201cIt would make it a happier place,\u201d says a Harvard insider. \u201cSo many of the students have impostor syndrome.\u201d\n\nRon Wyden, a Democratic senator, plans to help legacy preference on its way by introducing a bill to limit tax breaks on donations before or while a child is enrolled. It is a condition of tax exemption that a donor should get no direct benefit from a donation; and although universities are very careful to make it clear that there is no quid pro quo, their defence of legacy preference\u2014that it raises money\u2014implicitly admits the connection."

    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "I N A BRIGHTLY lit, immaculately clean room, 16 cadavers await the next batch of students at Anglia Ruskin medical school. Not all universities still use them, but \u201cwe like to get young hands working,\u201d says Stephen Hughes, the course leader. The focus on practical skills goes beyond the anatomy room. Students start placements in the practices of GP s (family doctors) in their first year, the idea being to inoculate them against medical snobbery about such work. The school opened last year after the government agreed to fund 100 places for students there, to tackle a shortage of doctors in the area.\n\nThe shortage is particularly acute in Essex, but it is a problem across the country. The National Health Service is the biggest employer in Europe, with 1.2m workers. Another 1.1m toil in social care. Yet experts agree that many more recruits are needed. Recent work by three think-tanks\u2014the Health Foundation, King\u2019s Fund and Nuffield Trust\u2014found that NHS hospitals, mental-health providers and community services have 100,000 vacancies and that there are another 110,000 gaps in adult social care. If things stay on their current trajectory, the think-tanks predict that there will be 250,000 NHS vacancies in a decade.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nSigns of strain are becoming apparent, as waiting times continue to rise. Problems are hard to contain. Shortages of staff in social care means more work for GP s, which makes it harder to get an appointment, which means more people turn up in accident and emergency departments. By most measures, more staff are leaving each year, and the most cited reason for doing so is dissatisfaction with their work-life balance. The Care Quality Commission, a regulator, has warned that \u201cworkforce problems have a direct impact on people\u2019s care.\u201d Little surprise, then, that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said solving the workforce problem is his priority.\n\nAlthough the number of medics has risen in recent years, it has not been fast enough to match growing demand. In 2007 there were 8.7m people over the age of 65; today there are 10m. But it not just an ageing population that calls for more staff. Official guidelines published after care failures in the late 2000s warn that patients are at greater risk of harm if a nurse often has to care for more than eight patients on a ward during the day.\n\nPlanning a health workforce is difficult, partly because of the time frames involved (a hospital consultant takes 14 years to train, for example). Last year the government announced 1,500 new places in medical schools, as well as five new institutions, in Chelmsford, Sunderland, Lancashire, Lincoln and Canterbury\u2014all areas where shortages are biting. In Chelmsford, such is the enthusiasm for the school, a couple of locals have even popped in to offer their bodies for research.\n\nBut it is hard to direct students to the specialisms where shortages are most severe. Although they can be encouraged to become GP s or psychiatrists, a lot still like \u201cthe idea of putting on wellies\u201d as a surgeon, says Dr Hughes. And the government has a big shortfall to make up because of deep cuts to spending on training. In the past five years funding for health education has fallen by 17%, compared with a 13% rise in the budget of NHS England.\n\nIn search of a cure\n\nThe government\u2019s job would be easier if planning were not so fragmented. According to one estimate, the system involves 40 statutory bodies, 15 royal colleges, 18 trade unions and more than 100 professional bodies. Things have improved recently, but \u201cthere has been a tendency for [the organisations] to point their fingers at one another\u201d over problems, says Finn O\u2019Dwyer-Cunliffe of NHS Providers, a trade association.\n\nThere has also been a tendency for government departments to work at cross-purposes. The NHS used to rely on international recruitment as \u201ca get-out-of-jail-free card\u201d to make up for poor planning, says Anita Charlesworth of the Health Foundation. That has got harder recently, as the Home Office has tightened immigration rules. Since 2011 it has limited the number of visas for skilled workers from outside Europe to 20,700 a year. Last year it exempted doctors and nurses from this cap, but restrictions on other health workers remain. All are stung by pricier visas. And although the NHS escaped the worst of austerity, pay was frozen or capped from 2010-11 to 2017-18, meaning the starting salary for a nurse fell by almost 10% in real terms. Many social-care workers are paid the minimum wage.\n\nEven with laxer immigration rules, foreigners could not fill all the shortages. GP s, for instance, are hard to hire from abroad, partly because the same job does not exist in many other countries. The NHS will thus have to find different ways of working. New roles such as the \u201cphysician associate\u201d (who provides support to doctors) could help. But their roll-out has been slowed by the fact that regulators are yet to set out exactly what the jobs should involve."

      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nP HILOSOPHERS FROM Aristotle to the Beatles have argued that money does not buy happiness. But it seems to help. Since 2005 Gallup, a pollster, has asked a representative sample of adults from countries across the world to rate their life satisfaction on a scale from zero to ten. The headline result is clear: the richer the country, on average, the higher the level of self-reported happiness. The simple correlation suggests that doubling GDP per person lifts life satisfaction by about 0.7 points.\n\nYet the prediction that as a country gets richer its mood will improve has a dubious record. In 1974 Richard Easterlin, an economist, discovered that average life satisfaction in America had stagnated between 1946 and 1970 even as GDP per person had grown by 65% over the same period. He went on to find a similar disconnect in other places, too. Although income is correlated with happiness when looking across countries\u2014and although economic downturns are reliable sources of temporary misery\u2014long-term GDP growth does not seem to be enough to turn the average frown upside-down.\n\nThe \u201cEasterlin paradox\u201d has been hotly disputed since, with some economists claiming to find a link between growth and rising happiness by using better quality data. On March 20th the latest Gallup data were presented in the World Happiness Report, an annual UN-backed study. The new data provide some ammunition for both sides of the debate but, on the whole, suggest that the paradox is alive and well.\n\nThere are important examples of national income and happiness rising and falling together. The most significant\u2014in terms of population\u2014is China, where GDP per person has doubled over a decade, while average happiness has risen by 0.43 points. Among rich countries Germany enjoys higher incomes and greater cheer than ten years ago. Venezuela, once the fifth-happiest country in the world, has become miserable as its economy has collapsed. Looking across countries, growth is correlated with rising happiness.\n\nYet that correlation is very weak. Of the 125 countries for which good data exist, 43 have seen GDP per person and happiness move in opposite directions. Like China, India is a populous developing economy that is growing quickly. But happiness is down by about 1.2 points in the past decade. America, the subject of Easterlin\u2019s initial study, has again seen happiness fall as the economy has grown. In total the world\u2019s population looks roughly equally divided between places where happiness and incomes have moved in the same direction over the past ten years, and places where they have diverged.\n\nSources: World Happiness Report, by John Helliwell, Richard Layard & Jeffrey Sachs (eds), UN, 2019; World Bank\n\nGet the data"

    "title": "\u201cThe White Crow\u201d is a good depiction of Rudolf Nureyev, the man",
    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "RUDOLF NUREYEV was marked out as different from birth, delivered to a peasant family on a train in Siberia in 1938. He was unusual in coming to formal ballet training late, aged 17. He stood out at school in caring about passion and storytelling as much as technical precision. He embarrassed the Soviet Union by defecting in 1961, whereafter he became a global sensation. He died from AIDS in 1993. Little surprise, then, that the title of a new film about the dancer should seek to emphasise Nureyev\u2019s uniqueness: \u201cThe White Crow\u201d means \u201csomething other\u201d.\n\nThe film does not take a chronological approach to his life, leaping between Nureyev\u2019s impoverished childhood in Ufa, his training at the Vaganova Academy and his time with the Kirov Ballet as its male star. The bulk of the action takes place in May 1961, as the Kirov performs in Paris. Nureyev (Oleg Ivenko, a Ukrainian ballet dancer in his first dramatic role, pictured) is enchanted by the city, and befriends Clara Saint (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos), a socialite, despite the orders of his handlers not to mingle with Westerners. It ends on June 17th 1961, as he seeks asylum from French police at Le Bourget airport.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nDespite the scenes being somewhat jumbled together, a clear picture of Nureyev\u2019s personality emerges. He is charismatic, combining a searching intelligence with a reckless egotism and Mr Ivenko, who looks rather like his subject, captures this well. Steadfast in his belief in his own superiority, Nureyev is also prone to monstrous outbursts. In one scene at Vaganova, he spots a man watching the rehearsal led by Alexander Pushkin (Ralph Fiennes, who also directs). Nureyev turns on the man, whom he accuses of talking. He has no business amid such talent, Nureyev says, and he refuses to continue until the man departs (it transpires that it was Konstantin Sergeyev, the Kirov\u2019s artistic director). In Paris, he is furious with an elderly waiter in a Russian restaurant for bringing his steak with sauce, but tries to force Clara to complain on his behalf. She considers him \u201cthe most selfish man [she has] ever known\u201d.\n\nYet the beauty of his ballet, which should have acted as a counterbalance, is not replicated. The dancing is rather ordinary\u2014though the audience is shown many training montages\u2014and the official performances feel low-key. Short extracts from classic works seem more dressy than dramatic, only hinting at the innovation, such as borrowing from female line and posture, that Nureyev brought to his art. This is disappointing given that the man is so famed for fiery theatricality. Before Nureyev, ballet \u201cwas lovely but boring,\u201d Sarah Crompton, a critic, wrote. \u201cHe gave it a shot in the arm.\u201d It was what, in the 1960s, made his face almost as recognisable as those of the Beatles. The film-makers\u2019 decision to end with the defection, rather than the end of his life, means that Nureyev\u2019s most celebrated and poignant years are left out.\n\nNor does the viewer get a sense of the full implications of his decision to flee the Soviet Union. In the film Pushkin, when interviewed by the KGB, says Nureyev just wanted to dance, but questions of creative freedom are not probed throughout. Some burly men follow Nureyev as he frequents caf\u00e9s and bars, and he gets told off by the Kirov\u2019s management for flouting the curfew, but there is little sense of a tangible threat, or the horror of the punishment that might await back home. The scene in Le Bourget is the only one that feels truly tense.\n\nThe film\u2014inspired by a biography by Julie Kavanagh\u2014is pleasant to watch, even if its narrative approach can grate. Mr Ivenko is undoubtedly glamorous, brooding when he needs to be, sometimes funny. Ms Kavanagh says that she feels \u201cThe White Crow\u201d does some justice to the point of her book, which was to portray Nureyev\u2019s obsession for dance, his artistic \u201ctunnel vision\u201d. But there could have been more sweat and physicality: this was, after all, the man who became the most famous dancer of the late 20th century. As it stands, the viewer does not quite grasp the importance of his legacy."

    "text": "A FANATIC WALKED into a house of worship and opened fire. Men, women, children; he made no distinction. Brenton Tarrant showed no mercy because he did not see his victims as fully human. When he murdered 50 people, he did not see mothers, husbands, engineers or goalkeepers. He saw only the enemy.\n\nThe massacre in New Zealand on March 15th was a reminder of how similar white-nationalist and jihadist killers really are. Though the two groups detest each other, they share methods, morals and mindsets. They see their own group as under threat, and think this justifies extreme violence in \u201cself-defence\u201d. They are often radicalised on social media, where they tap into a multinational subculture of resentment. Islamists share footage of atrocities against Muslims in Myanmar, Syria, Xinjiang and Abu Ghraib. White nationalists share tales of crimes against white people in New York, Rotherham and Bali. The alleged shooter in New Zealand, who is Australian, scrawled on a gun the name of an 11-year-old Swedish girl killed by a jihadist in 2017.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIt takes a vast leap of illogic to conclude that the murder of a young girl in Stockholm justifies the murder of Muslim children 17,500km away. But when extremists meet in the dark corners of the web, they inspire each other to greater heights of paranoia and self-righteousness. Their enemies want to destroy their people and their faith. It is a fight for survival. Apparently unconnected outrages are part of a global plot which, after great contortion, both jihadists and neo-Nazis often blame on the Jews.\n\nWorldwide, jihadists kill many more people than white supremacists do. However, in the West, white-nationalist violence is catching up with the jihadist variety and has in some places overtaken it (see article). The numbers are hard to pin down, but there is cause for alarm. By one estimate, between 2009 and 2018 white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists in America. Far-right networks with violent ambitions have been uncovered in the German army. The West has no white-nationalist equivalent of Islamic State, but plenty of angry racists there have access to guns. And recent events have fired them up. The Syrian refugee crisis, for example, created vivid images of Muslims surging into Europe, fuelling the fears of those who fret that non-whites are outbreeding whites and will one day \u201creplace\u201d them in their ancestral homelands.\n\nYet there is hope. Another reason the white racist threat looms relatively larger is that the West has grown better at thwarting the jihadist one. Since the attacks of September 11th 2001, security services have put huge efforts into infiltrating jihadist groups both in person and online, eavesdropping on their conversations and taking down their propaganda. Since jihadism crosses borders, intelligence services have also shared information and worked hand in hand to disrupt plots. Governments have strengthened the defences of obvious targets, starting with airline cockpits. They have foiled dozens of plots and jailed hundreds of jihadists. They have also worked to deradicalise extremists, or to prevent them from taking up arms.\n\nAll these methods should be used against violent white nationalists, too. More cash will be needed. It is absurd, for example, that America\u2019s Department of Homeland Security has no experts in far-right terrorism. But even with ample funds, the task will not be easy. People who post racist diatribes online often pretend that they are joking. Spotting potential killers among the much larger number of poison-pontificators is hard. So is finding the right people to deradicalise the far right. Would-be jihadists can sometimes be talked out of it by moderate imams, who ground their arguments in texts that both parties revere. This is trickier with neo-Nazis, but a mix of public ostracism and patient counselling can work.\n\nSensitivity is essential. Lots of non-violent people share at least some of the extremists\u2019 concerns, albeit in milder form. And just as the struggle against jihadism must be calibrated so as not to pick on peaceful Muslims\u2014or create that sense\u2014so the struggle against white extremism should avoid alienating peaceful whites who happen to oppose immigration or who occasionally say obnoxious things online.\n\nIt is an explosive problem, and one that would be easier to deal with if prominent politicians stopped throwing lighted matches at it. When President Donald Trump calls the flow of immigrants an \u201cinvasion\u201d, he lends cover to those who would repel them violently. Likewise Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, when he claims that a Jewish billionaire is plotting to flood Europe with Muslim migrants in order to swamp its Christian culture. And so too Turkey\u2019s strongman, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, when he says that the shooter in New Zealand is part of a grand plot against Turks. By contrast, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has struck the right note. She donned a headscarf, to show that an attack on Muslims is an attack on all New Zealanders. She is tightening the country\u2019s gun controls. She has shown how an assault on New Zealand\u2019s values of tolerance and openness is in fact a reason to strengthen them."

    "text": "THERE IS AN optimistic way of reading the international reaction to the massacre at a New Zealand mosque on March 15th which goes something like this. Appalled by the bloodbath, decent people all over the Western world came together to support their Muslim compatriots, and vowed to step up the fight against ultra-rightist and white-supremacist terror, a threat which had been underestimated. Muslims were grateful for this solidarity, and this duly helped to avoid the breakdown of social peace which is the purpose of most terrorists.\n\nIf there is any place where that description holds water, it might be in New Zealand itself, where Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, has been reaching out to traumatised Muslims in the name of democratic decency.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nElsewhere in the Western world, there was certainly great sympathy for the victims and all those affected by the tragedy, but worryingly little sign of consensus between Muslims and their fellow citizens over how diverse democracies should respond in the longer term.\n\nWestern Muslim commentators insisted that the rampage in New Zealand simply marked the far end of a spectrum of anti-Islamic feeling which they experience every day. A group called the \u201cCollective against Islamophobia in France\u201d happened to publish its annual report on the day of the Antipodean massacre. It said that from 2017 to 2018 the number of hostile incidents suffered by French Muslims (ranging from physical attacks or abuse to instances of discrimination) had jumped by more than half to 676. In 70% of cases the victims were female. The group pointedly chooses March 15th as the date for its annual assessment because that was the day in 2004 when headscarves and other religious symbols were banned from French schools in the name of secularism.\n\nIn Germany, police recorded 578 hate crimes against Muslims between January and September of 2018, resulting in 40 injuries, up from 27 injuries in the same period of 2017. Although the total number of incidents and anti-Muslim demonstrations in Germany has slipped downwards since the peak of the migrant crisis in 2015 and 2016, the level of violence seems to be rising. And in England and Wales, just over half the 5,680 \u201creligious hate\u201d incidents recorded in the year ended March 2018 concerned victims whose \u201cperceived religion\u201d was Islam.\n\nIn response to all this, Muslim representatives frequently stress that the problem of Islamophobia (a term that remains contentious in many countries) is by no means confined to a far-rightist fringe. They insist that an anti-Muslim climate has been created by politicians much closer to the respectable centre-right, or in the French case by zealous advocates of the century-old doctrine of la\u00efcit\u00e9, or strict secularism.\n\nAt Birmingham Central Mosque, one of the leading places of Islamic worship in Britain, the initial reaction to New Zealand\u2019s horror was one of inter-faith solidarity. Representatives of all local creeds gathered to offer sympathy and support. But mosque leaders say their people live daily with abuse, spitting, jostling and in the case of women, attempts to grab their scarves. Nassar Mahmood, a mosque trustee, says social peace in the city is challenged on many fronts. Reduced levels of policing (because of budget cuts) lead to a rise in petty crime that, he fears, may be blamed on Muslims. \u201cWe could very easily face attacks similar to those in New Zealand that would destabilise our social harmony,\u201d he says. In the early hours of March 21st, five mosques in Birmingham were attacked with sledgehammers.\n\nSalma Yaqoob, a local politician of the left who may be Birmingham\u2019s best-known Muslim woman, has been adamant that the problem goes far beyond an extremist white-nationalist fringe. Her response to the New Zealand massacre was to \u201ccall out\u201d mainstream Tory politicians who in her view played to the gallery with anti-Muslim innuendos.\n\nThe British government\u2019s Prevent programme, designed to nip in the bud any individuals tempted by extremism, has always been presented as an even-handed initiative to curb radical tendencies of all kinds, whether Islamist or white-supremacist. But among Muslim activists like Ms Yaqoob, the programme has been excoriated both as anti-Muslim in its emphasis and fundamentally flawed in other ways, on grounds that it gives teachers and university lecturers, among others, a police-like role.\n\nIt follows that any move by the authorities to redress the balance by applying more resources to fighting ultra-rightists will still fail to satisfy Prevent\u2019s critics. Feelings run high in Birmingham because identity politics, as played out in the city, present such a kaleidoscope. An attempt by conservative Muslim families to stop gay-friendly lessons in primary schools was praised by one of the country\u2019s far-right leaders, Nick Griffin. He said he wished other parents were as brave. (Ms Yaqoob has tweeted in response that Muslims should not be tempted into regarding people like Mr Griffin as a friend; it says something about the strangeness of Britain\u2019s culture wars that she feels the need to say that.)\n\nIn an ideal world, the Christchurch horror would be galvanising people in every democracy, across a broad political, ideological and cultural spectrum, to defend common values, including tolerance, freedom, mutual respect and the rule of law. To some extent this is happening. But neither before or after Christchurch has there been much sign of a clear consensus over what exactly those values are. Nor is there much agreement over how those values should be acted out by society\u2019s representatives, be they police officers, judges or teachers. Sadly, the image of a respectable, democratic mainstream fighting a violent fringe is too simple."

I was a lonesome freelancer in Central America before my internship in London, so I relished the weekly meetings where the whole staff debates world events and appreciated the intense editing of my stories.

I was free to write about the places and topics that most interested me, and my ideas were taken seriously. I had expected that, in a busy office, people would mostly ignore me. But instead I found that not only editors, but other correspondents, were often interested to hear about what I was working on and to offer advice. I have learnt a huge amount from the weekly editorial meetings, where The Economist discusses its editorial line on everything from school summer holidays to Zambian debt.

    "text": "H ORUS, AN ANCIENT Egyptian sky god, was often depicted as a sharp-eyed falcon. Lord Buddha\u2019s eyes are supposed to be able to look in four directions at once. The god of Abraham sees everything, always. A \u201cBig God\u201d of this sort\u2014a supernatural \u201ceye in the sky\u201d who cares whether people do right by others\u2014is a feature of most of the world\u2019s top religions. But it was not always so. Anthropological research suggests that the gods who watch over small societies tend to demand only that people show deference to them. Big Gods come later.\n\nOne theory holds that this is because small societies do not need a supernatural policeman. If everyone knows everyone else, antisocial elements are easily managed. But as societies grow, and especially as they absorb ethnically and culturally diverse groups through conquest, a different policing mechanism is needed. What could be better than an all-seeing eye that enforces co-operation between friends and strangers alike?\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIf this theory is correct, it raises another question: which comes first, a Big God that permits a big society, or a big society that requires a Big God? That question is addressed by a paper published in this week\u2019s Nature by Harvey Whitehouse of Oxford University and his colleagues.\n\nOver the past eight years the team has built a historical database, dubbed Seshat after a goddess of knowledge who was Horus\u2019s contemporary. With the help of a small army of historians and archaeologists, they have accumulated data on more than 400 societies that have existed in the past 10,000 years.\n\nIn previous research, the group identified 51 highly correlated variables that gauge a society\u2019s complexity, such as population size, the presence of bureaucrats or paper money. They have now asked how this composite indicator of social complexity relates to the presence, or absence, of moralising gods.\n\nSeshat divides the globe arbitrarily into 30 regions. Twelve housed societies that offered data on their complexity before and after the emergence of Big Gods. In ten of these 12 regions, Big Gods appeared about 100 years after a society took a leap forward in complexity, with populations in the region of 1m.\n\nThat suggests Big Gods are a consequence of big societies, not a cause of them. But interrogation of Seshat revealed another religious phenomenon that played a role in driving societies towards greater complexity: frequent, collective rituals such as daily food offerings to gods. These rituals predate Big Gods in nine of the 12 regions by long periods of time, around 1,100 years on average.\n\nDr Whitehouse\u2019s hypothesis is that, because they were easy to learn and were performed often, such rituals may have allowed beliefs and practices to spread to much larger populations than had previously been possible, helping to unify those populations around a common identity. Only subsequently do Big Gods emerge. Both innovations seem to have consolidated or stabilised societies that had recently expanded. If true, this would fit with findings the same group published last year.\n\nOn that occasion they tested a theory that has been popular for several decades: that societies became recognisably \u201cmodern\u201d in the mid-first millennium BC , during the so-called \u201cAxial Age\u201d, the period in which figures such as Plato, Buddha and Zoroaster appeared on the scene, promulgating moralising ideologies."

    "text": "FEW PAINTERS can have been saddled with a more inappropriate pseudonym than \u201cTintoretto\u201d. With its tinkling consonants, his nickname\u2014\u201clittle dyer\u201d, referring to the profession of his father\u2014might have sat well on a creator of Rococo pastoral idylls, but is hopelessly inappropriate for an artist of such earnest intent and almost inhuman gusto.\n\nTintoretto (born Jacopo Comin) painted faster and bigger than any of his Venetian contemporaries. He was possessed of monstrous ambition, not just for fame and reward, but for lasting artistic glory. For a celebration of the 500th anniversary of his birth in 1518 or 1519, a major exhibition has travelled from Venice to Washington. \u201cTintoretto: Artist of Renaissance Venice\u201d opened at the National Gallery of Art (NGA) on March 24th and runs until July 7th.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nAstonishingly, it is the first-ever retrospective in America of the painter, an artist that some critics have put in the first rank of Renaissance Masters. John Ruskin thought Tintoretto the equal of Michelangelo; subsequent fans included Jean-Paul Sartre, who claimed him for the proletariat. But various factors have contributed to a decline in Tintoretto\u2019s popularity over the past century and a half.\n\nOne is the sheer difficulty of staging an exhibition that offers a representative selection of his work. Many of his greatest paintings have to be admired in the poorly lit churches of Venice because they adorn walls and ceilings, or are simply too enormous to go through the doors or fit in the rooms of modern exhibition spaces. Another obstacle has been the attribution to Tintoretto of scores of works of variable quality, often created by his assistants and imitators. The two curators of the Washington show, Robert Echols, a scholar, and Frederick Ilchman, who chairs the Art of Europe department at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, have also been responsible for a drastic reduction in Tintoretto\u2019s accepted oeuvre. They have rejected more than 150 works, including some well-known paintings such as \u201cChrist and the Adulteress\u201d (it continues to be exhibited at Palazzo Barberini in Rome as a work by Tintoretto). Many of the master\u2019s paintings have also suffered from dirt and decay and, in some cases, coats of varnish deliberately applied to give them more of an \u201cOld Master\u201d look. Several of the works on display in Washington have been restored to their original brightness. \u201cTintoretto as a brilliant colourist is going to be a revelation to many people,\u201d Mr Echols says.\n\nThe show comprises 46 paintings, most of which have come from the vast, twin-sited exhibition at the Doge\u2019s Palace and the Accademia in Venice. Others are already on display at the NGA. Some have been loaned, including his \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d (pictured, above), one of Tintoretto\u2019s most audacious and enigmatic works, taken from the church of San Trovaso in the Dorsoduro district of Venice. Tintoretto put his slightly ragged apostles in the back room of a tavern; it looks as if\u2014until the moment the painting captures, when Jesus tells them that one of them will betray him\u2014they have not been stinting on the wine. A cat is hunting for scraps under the table. In one corner is a mysterious figure who, it has been speculated, is the artist\u2019s much-loved daughter, Marietta, who worked with him in his studio.\n\n\u201cThe Last Supper\u201d is a counterpoint to the notion that Tintoretto is all maudlin Madonnas and saints with uplifted eyes. So too is a section of the show devoted to his portraits. \u201cI hope people will come out of this exhibition thinking that he was one of the great portraitists of the 16th century along with Titian and Bronzino,\u201d Mr Ilchman says. Maybe. Some of his portraits are formal and disclose little of their subjects\u2019 inner selves. But this is unquestionably an exhibition that does justice to Tintoretto\u2019s thundering genius."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "One afternoon in August 2010, in a conference hall perched on the edge of San Francisco Bay, a 34-year-old Londoner called Demis Hassabis took to the stage. Walking to the podium with the deliberate gait of a man trying to control his nerves, he pursed his lips into a brief smile and began to speak: \u201cSo today I\u2019m going to be talking about different approaches to building\u2026\u201d He stalled, as though just realising that he was stating his momentous ambition out loud. And then he said it: \u201c AGI \u201d.\n\nAGI stands for artificial general intelligence, a hypothetical computer program that can perform intellectual tasks as well as, or better than, a human. AGI will be able to complete discrete tasks, such as recognising photos or translating languages, which are the single-minded focus of the multitude of artificial intelligences ( AI s) that inhabit our phones and computers. But it will also add, subtract, play chess and speak French. It will also understand physics papers, compose novels, devise investment strategies and make delightful conversation with strangers. It will monitor nuclear reactions, manage electricity grids and traffic flow, and effortlessly succeed at everything else. AGI will make today\u2019s most advanced AI s look like pocket calculators.\n\nThe only intelligence that can currently attempt all these tasks is the kind that humans are endowed with. But human intelligence is limited by the size of the skull that houses the brain. Its power is restricted by the puny amount of energy that the body is able to provide. Because AGI will run on computers, it will suffer none of these constraints. Its intelligence will be limited only by the number of processors available. AGI may start by monitoring nuclear reactions. But soon enough it will discover new sources of energy by digesting more physics papers in a second than a human could in a thousand lifetimes. Human-level intelligence, coupled with the speed and scalability of computers, will make problems that currently appear insoluble disappear. Hassabis told the Observer, a British newspaper, that he expected AGI to master, among other disciplines, \u201ccancer, climate change, energy, genomics, macro-economics [and] financial systems\u201d.\n\nThe conference at which Hassabis spoke was called the Singularity Summit. \u201cThe Singularity\u201d refers to the most likely consequence of the advent of AGI , according to futurists. Because AGI will process information at high speed, it will become very smart very quickly. Rapid cycles of self-improvement will lead to an explosion of machine intelligence, leaving humans choking on silicon dust. Since this future is constructed entirely on a scaffolding of untested presumptions, it is a matter of almost religious belief whether one considers the Singularity to be Utopia or hell.\n\nJudging by the titles of talks, the attendees at the conference tended towards the messianic: \u201cThe Mind and How to Build One\u201d; \u201c AI against Aging\u201d; \u201cReplacing Our Bodies\u201d; \u201cModifying the Boundary between Life and Death\u201d. Hassabis\u2019s speech, by contrast, appeared underwhelming: \u201cA Systems Neuroscience Approach to Building AGI \u201d.\n\nHassabis paced between the podium and a screen, speaking at a rapid clip. He wore a maroon jumper and a white button-down shirt like a schoolboy. His slight stature seemed only to magnify his intellect. Up until now, Hassabis explained, scientists had approached AGI from two directions. On one track, known as symbolic AI , human researchers tried to describe and program all the rules needed for a system that could think like a human. This approach was popular in the 1980s and 1990s, but hadn\u2019t produced the desired results. Hassabis believed that the brain\u2019s mental architecture was too subtle to be described in this way.\n\nThe other track comprised researchers trying to replicate the brain\u2019s physical networks in digital form. This made a certain kind of sense. After all, the brain is the seat of human intelligence. But those researchers were also misguided, said Hassabis. Their task was on the same scale as mapping every star in the universe. More fundamentally, it focused on the wrong level of brain function. It was like trying to understand how Microsoft Excel works by tearing open a computer and examining the interactions of the transistors.\n\nInstead, Hassabis proposed a middle ground: AGI should take inspiration from the broad methods by which the brain processes information \u2013 not the physical systems or the particular rules it applies in specific situations. In other words it should focus on understanding the brain\u2019s software, not its hardware. New techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (f MRI ), which made it possible to peer inside the brain while it engaged in activities, had started to make this kind of understanding feasible. The latest studies, he told the audience, showed that the brain learns by replaying experiences during sleep, in order to derive general principles. AI researchers should emulate this kind of system.\n\nA logo appeared in the lower-right corner of his opening slide, a circular swirl of blue. Two words, closed up, were printed underneath it: DeepMind. This was the first time the company had been referred to in public. Hassabis had spent a year trying to get an invitation to the Singularity Summit. The lecture was an alibi. What he really needed was one minute with Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who funded the conference. Hassabis wanted Thiel\u2019s investment.\n\nHassabis has never spoken about why he wanted Thiel\u2019s backing in particular. (Hassabis refused multiple interview requests for this article through a spokesperson. 1843 spoke to 25 sources, including current and former employees and investors. Most of them spoke anonymously, as they were not authorised to talk about the company.) But Thiel believes in AGI with even greater fervour than Hassabis. In a talk at the Singularity Summit in 2009, Thiel had said that his biggest fear for the future was not a robot uprising (though with an apocalypse-proof bolthole in the New Zealand outback, he\u2019s better prepared than most people). Rather, he worried that the Singularity would take too long coming. The world needed new technology to ward off economic decline.\n\nDeepMind ended up raising \u00a32m; Thiel contributed \u00a31.4m. When Google bought the company in January 2014 for $600m, Thiel and other early investors earned a 5,000% return on their investment.\n\nFor many founders, this would be a happy ending. They could slow down, take a step back and spend more time with their money. For Hassabis, the acquisition by Google was just another step in his pursuit of AGI . He had spent much of 2013 negotiating the terms of the deal. DeepMind would operate as a separate entity from its new parent. It would gain the benefits of being owned by Google, such as access to cash flow and computing power, without losing control.\n\nHassabis thought DeepMind would be a hybrid: it would have the drive of a startup, the brains of the greatest universities, and the deep pockets of one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Every element was in place to hasten the arrival of AGI and solve the causes of human misery.\n\nDemis Hassabis was born in north London in 1976 to a Greek-Cypriot father and a Chinese-Singaporean mother. He was the eldest of three siblings. His mother worked at John Lewis, a British department store, and his father ran a toy shop. He took up chess at the age of four, after watching his father and uncle play. Within weeks he was beating the grown-ups. By 13 he was the second-best chess player in the world for his age. At eight, he taught himself to code on a basic computer.\n\nHassabis completed his A -levels in 1992, two years ahead of schedule. He got a job programming videogames with Bullfrog Productions. Hassabis wrote Theme Park, in which players designed and ran a virtual amusement park. It was a huge success, selling 15m copies and forming part of a new genre of simulation games in which the goal is not to defeat an opponent but to optimise the functioning of a complex system like a business or a city.\n\nAs well as making games, he was brilliant at playing them. As a teen, he\u2019d run between floors at board-game competitions to compete in simultaneous bouts of chess, scrabble, poker and backgammon. In 1995, while studying computer science at Cambridge University, Hassabis wandered into a student Go tournament. Go is an ancient board game of strategy that is considerably more complex than chess. Mastery is supposed to require intuition acquired by long experience. No one knew if Hassabis had even played before.\n\nFirst, Hassabis won the beginners\u2019 tournament. Then he beat the winner of the experienced players, albeit with a handicap. Charles Matthews, the Cambridge Go master who ran the tournament, remembers the expert player\u2019s shock at being thrashed by a 19-year-old novice. Matthews took Hassabis under his wing.\n\nHassabis\u2019s intellect and ambition have always expressed themselves through games. Games, in turn, sparked his fascination with intelligence. As he observed his own development at chess, he wondered whether computers might be programmed to learn as he had, through accumulated experience. Games offered a learning environment that the real world couldn\u2019t match. They were neat and contained. Because games are hived off from the real world, they can be practised without interference and mastered efficiently. Games speed up time: players build a crime syndicate in a couple of days and fight the battle of the Somme in minutes.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Hassabis travelled to Japan. That May, IBM \u2019s Deep Blue computer had beaten Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion. This was the first time a computer had defeated a grandmaster at chess. The match captured the world\u2019s attention and raised concerns over the growing power and potential menace of computers. When Hassabis met Masahiko Fujuwarea, a Japanese board-game master, he spoke of a plan that would combine his interests in strategy games and artificial intelligence: one day he would build a computer program to beat the greatest human Go player.\n\nHassabis approached his career methodically. \u201cAt the age of 20, Hassabis was taking a view that certain things have to be in place before he could go into artificial intelligence at the level he wanted to,\u201d says Matthews. \u201cHe had a plan.\u201d\n\nIn 1998 he started a game studio of his own called Elixir. Hassabis focused on one hugely ambitious game, Republic: The Revolution, an intricate political simulation. Years earlier, when still in school, Hassabis had told his friend Mustafa Suleyman that the world needed grand simulations in order to model its complex dynamics and solve the toughest social problems. Now, he tried do so in a game.\n\nHis aspirations proved harder than expected to wrangle into code. Elixir eventually released a pared-down version of the game, to lukewarm reviews. Other games flopped (one was a Bond-villain simulator called Evil Genius). In April 2005 Hassabis shut down Elixir. Matthews believes that Hassabis founded the company simply to gain managerial experience. Now, Hassabis lacked just one crucial area of knowledge before embarking on his quest for AGI . He needed to understand the human brain.\n\nIn 2005, Hassabis started a P h D in neuroscience at University College London ( UCL ). He published influential research on memory and imagination. One paper, which has since been cited over 1,000 times, showed that people with amnesia also had difficulty imagining new experiences, suggesting that there is a connection between remembering and creating mental images. Hassabis was building up an understanding of the brain required to tackle AGI . Most of his work came back to one question: how does the human brain obtain and retain concepts and knowledge?\n\nHassabis officially founded DeepMind on November 15th 2010. The company\u2019s mission statement was the same then as it is now: to \u201csolve intelligence\u201d, and then use it to solve everything else. As Hassabis told the Singularity Summit attendees, this means translating our understanding of how the brain accomplished tasks into software that could use the same methods to teach itself.\n\nHassabis does not pretend that science has fully comprehended the human mind. The blueprint for AGI could not simply be drawn from hundreds of neuroscience studies. But he clearly believes enough is known to begin work on AGI in the manner he would like. Yet it is possible that his confidence outruns reality. We still know very little for certain about how the brain actually functions. In 2018 the findings of Hassabis\u2019s own P h D were called into question by a team of Australian researchers. The statistics are devilish and this is just a single paper, but it shows that the science that underwrites DeepMind\u2019s work is far from settled.\n\nSuleyman and Shane Legg, an AGI -obsessed New Zealander whom Hassabis also met at UCL , joined as co-founders. The firm\u2019s reputation grew rapidly. Hassabis reeled in talent. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a magnet,\u201d says Ben Faulkner, DeepMind\u2019s former operations manager. Many new recruits came from Europe, beyond the terrible gaze of Silicon Valley giants like Google and Facebook. Perhaps DeepMind\u2019s greatest accomplishment was moving early to hire and retain the brightest and best. The company set up shop in the attic of a terraced house on Russell Square in Bloomsbury, across the road from UCL .\n\nOne machine-learning technique that the company focused on grew out of Hassabis\u2019s twin fascination with games and neuroscience: reinforcement learning. Such a program is built to gather information about its environment, then learn from it by repeatedly replaying its experiences, much like the description that Hassabis gave of human-brain activity during sleep in his Singularity Summit lecture.\n\nReinforcement learning starts with a computational blank slate. The program is shown a virtual environment about which it knows nothing but the rules, such as a simulation of a game of chess or a video game. The program contains at least one component known as a neural network. This is made up of layers of computational structures that sift through information in order to identify particular features or strategies. Each layer examines the environment at a different level of abstraction. At first these networks have minimal success but, importantly, their failures are encoded within them. They become increasingly sophisticated as they experiment with different strategies and are rewarded when they are successful. If the program moves a chess piece and loses the game as a result, it won\u2019t make that mistake again. Much of the magic of artificial intelligence lies in the speed at which it repeats its tasks.\n\nDeepMind\u2019s work culminated in 2016 when a team built an AI program that used reinforcement learning alongside other techniques to play Go. The program, called AlphaGo, caused astonishment when it beat the world champion in a five-game match in Seoul in 2016. The machine\u2019s victory, watched by 280m people, came a decade earlier than experts had predicted. The following year an improved version of AlphaGo thrashed the Chinese Go champion.\n\nLike Deep Blue in 1997, AlphaGo changed perceptions of human accomplishment. The human champions, some of the most brilliant minds on the planet, no longer stood at the pinnacle of intelligence. Nearly 20 years after he had confided his ambition to Fujuwarea, Hassabis fulfilled it. Hassabis has said that the match brought him close to tears. Traditionally, a student of Go pays back their teacher by beating them in a single contest. Hassabis thanked Matthews by beating the entire game.\n\nDeepBlue won through the brute strength and speed of computation, but AlphaGo\u2019s style appeared artistic, almost human. Its grace and sophistication, the transcendence of its computational muscle, seemed to show that DeepMind was further ahead than its competitors on the quest for a program that could treat disease and manage cities.\n\nHassabis has always said that DeepMind would change the world for the better. But there are no certainties about AGI . If it ever comes into being, we don\u2019t know whether it will be altruistic or vicious, or if it will submit to human control. Even if it does, who should take the reins?\n\nFrom the start, Hassabis has tried to protect DeepMind\u2019s independence. He has always insisted that DeepMind remain in London. When Google bought the company in 2014, the question of control became more pressing. Hassabis didn\u2019t need to sell DeepMind to Google. There was plenty of cash on hand and he had sketched out a business model in which the company would design games to fund research. Google\u2019s financial heft was attractive, yet, like many founders, Hassabis was reluctant to hand over the company he had nurtured. As part of the deal, DeepMind created an arrangement that would prevent Google from unilaterally taking control of the company\u2019s intellectual property. In the year leading up to acquisition, according to a person familiar with the transaction, both parties signed a contract called the Ethics and Safety Review Agreement. The agreement, previously unreported, was drawn up by senior barristers in London.\n\nThe Review Agreement puts control of DeepMind\u2019s core AGI technology, whenever it may be created, in the hands of a governing panel known as the Ethics Board. Far from being a cosmetic concession from Google, the Ethics Board gives DeepMind solid legal backing to keep control of its most valuable and potentially most dangerous technology, according to the same source. The names of the panel members haven\u2019t been made public, but another source close to both DeepMind and Google says that all three of DeepMind\u2019s founders sit on the board. (DeepMind refused to answer a detailed set of questions about the Review Agreement but said that \u201cethics oversight and governance has been a priority for us from the earliest days.\u201d)\n\nHassabis can determine DeepMind\u2019s destiny by other means too. One is loyalty. Employees past and present say that Hassabis\u2019s research agenda is one of DeepMind\u2019s greatest strengths. His programme, which offers fascinating and important work free from the pressures of academia, has attracted hundreds of the world\u2019s most talented experts. DeepMind has subsidiary offices in Paris and Alberta. Many employees feel more affinity with Hassabis and his mission than with its revenue-hungry corporate parent. As long as he retains their personal loyalty, Hassabis holds considerable power over his sole shareholder. Better for Google to have DeepMind\u2019s AI talent working for it by proxy than for those people to end up at Facebook or Apple.\n\nDeepMind has another source of leverage, though it requires constant replenishment: favourable publicity. The company excels at this. AlphaGo was a PR coup. Since the Google acquisition, the firm has repeatedly produced marvels that have garnered global attention. One piece of software can spot patterns in an eye scan that are indicators of macular degeneration. Another program learned to play chess from scratch using similar architecture to AlphaGo, becoming the greatest chess player of all time after just nine hours playing against itself. In December 2018 a program called AlphaFold proved more accurate than competitors at predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins from a list of their composites, potentially paving the way to treat diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nDeepMind is particularly proud of the algorithms it developed that calculate the most efficient means to cool Google\u2019s data centres, which contain an estimated 2.5m computer servers. DeepMind said in 2016 that they had reduced Google\u2019s energy bill by 40%. But some insiders say such boasts are overblown. Google had been using algorithms to optimise its data centres long before DeepMind existed. \u201cThey just want to have some PR so they can claim some value added within Alphabet,\u201d says one Google employee. Google\u2019s parent Alphabet pays DeepMind handsomely for services like these. DeepMind billed \u00a354m to Alphabet companies in 2017. That figure pales in comparison to DeepMind\u2019s overheads. It spent \u00a3200m on staff alone that year. Overall, DeepMind lost \u00a3282m in 2017.\n\nThis is a pittance for the cash-rich giant. But other Alphabet subsidiaries in the red have attracted the attention of Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s parsimonious chief financial officer. Google Fiber, an effort to build an internet-service provider, was put on hiatus after it became clear that it would take decades to make a return on investment. AI researchers wonder privately whether DeepMind will be \u201cPorated\u201d.\n\nDeepMind\u2019s careful unveiling of AI advances forms part of its strategy of managing up, signalling its reputational worth to the powers that be. That\u2019s especially valuable at a time when Google stands accused of invading users\u2019 privacy and spreading fake news. DeepMind is also lucky to have a sympathiser at the highest level: Larry Page, one of Google\u2019s two founders, now chief executive of Alphabet. Page is the closest thing that Hassabis has to a boss. Page\u2019s father, Carl, studied neural networks in the 1960s. Early in his career, Page said that he built Google solely to found an AI company.\n\nDeepMind\u2019s tight control needed for press management doesn\u2019t gel with the academic spirit that pervades the company. Some researchers complain that it can be difficult to publish their work: they have to battle through layers of internal approval before they can even submit work to conferences and journals. DeepMind believes that it needs to proceed carefully to avoid scaring the public with the prospect of AGI . But clamming up too tightly could start to sour the academic atmosphere and weaken the loyalty of employees.\n\nFive years after the acquisition by Google, the question of who controls DeepMind is coming to a crunch point. The firm\u2019s founders and early employees are approaching earn-out, when they can leave with the financial compensation that they received from the acquisition (Hassabis\u2019s stock was probably worth around \u00a3100m). But a source close to the company suggests that Alphabet has pushed back the founders\u2019 earn-outs by two years. Given his relentless focus, Hassabis is unlikely to jump ship. He is interested in money only in so far as it helps him achieve his life\u2019s work. But some colleagues have already left. Three AI engineers have departed since the start of 2019. And Ben Laurie, one of the world\u2019s most prominent security engineers, has now returned to Google, his previous employer. This number is small, but DeepMind offers such an exhilarating mission and handsome pay that it is rare for anyone to leave.\n\nSo far, Google has not interfered much with DeepMind. But one recent event has raised concerns over how long the company can sustain its independence.\n\nDeepMind had always planned to use AI to improve health care. In February 2016, it set up a new division, DeepMind Health, led by Mustafa Suleyman, one of the company\u2019s co-founders. Suleyman, whose mother was an NHS nurse, hoped to create a program called Streams that would warn doctors when a patient\u2019s health deteriorated. DeepMind would earn a performance-based fee. Because this work required access to sensitive information about patients, Suleyman established an Independent Review Panel ( IRP ) populated by the great and good of British health care and technology. DeepMind was wise to proceed with care. The British information commissioner subsequently found that one of the partner hospitals broke the law in handling patient data. Nonetheless by the end of 2017, Suleyman had signed agreements with four large NHS hospitals.\n\nOn November 8th 2018, Google reported the creation of its own health-care division, Google Health. Five days later, it was announced that DeepMind Health was to be rolled into its parent company\u2019s efforts. DeepMind appeared to have had little warning. According to information gained from Freedom of Information requests, it gave its partner hospitals only three days\u2019 notice of the change. DeepMind refused to say when discussions about the merger began but said that the short gap between the notification and a public announcement was in the interests of transparency. Suleyman had written in 2016 that \u201cat no stage will patient data ever be linked or associated with Google accounts, products or services.\u201d His promise seemed to have been broken. (In response to 1843\u2019s questions, DeepMind said that \u201cat this stage, none of our contracts have moved across to Google, and they only will with our partners\u2019 consent. Streams becoming a Google service does not mean the patient data...can be used to provide other Google products or services.\u201d)\n\nGoogle\u2019s annexation has angered employees at DeepMind Health. According to people close to the health team, more employees plan to leave the company once the absorption is complete. One member of the IRP , Mike Bracken, has already walked out on Suleyman. According to multiple people familiar with the event, Bracken quit in December 2017 over concerns that the panel was more about window-dressing than genuine oversight. When Bracken asked Suleyman if he would give panel members the accountability and governance powers of non-executive directors, Suleyman scoffed. (A spokesperson for DeepMind said they had \u201cno recollection\u201d of the incident.) Julian Huppert, the head of the IRP , argues that the panel delivered \u201cmore radical governance\u201d than Bracken expected because members were able to speak openly and not bound by a duty of confidentiality.\n\nThis episode shows that peripheral parts of DeepMind\u2019s operation are vulnerable to Google. DeepMind said in a statement that \u201cwe all agreed that it makes sense to bring these efforts together in one collaborative effort, with increased resources.\u201d This begs the question of whether Google will apply the same logic to DeepMind\u2019s work on AGI .\n\nFrom a distance, DeepMind looks to have taken great strides. It has already built software that can learn to perform tasks at superhuman levels. Hassabis often cites Breakout, a videogame for the Atari console. A Breakout player controls a bat that she can move horizontally across the bottom of the screen, using it to bounce a ball against blocks that hover above it, destroying them on impact. The player wins when all blocks are obliterated. She loses if she misses the ball with the bat. Without human instruction, DeepMind\u2019s program not only learned to play the game but also worked out how to cannon the ball into the space behind the blocks, taking advantage of rebounds to break more blocks. This, Hassabis says, demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning and the preternatural ability of DeepMind\u2019s computer programs.\n\nIt\u2019s an impressive demo. But Hassabis leaves a few things out. If the virtual paddle were moved even fractionally higher, the program would fail. The skill learned by DeepMind\u2019s program is so restricted that it cannot react even to tiny changes to the environment that a person would take in their stride \u2013 at least not without thousands more rounds of reinforcement learning. But the world has jitter like this built into it. For diagnostic intelligence, no two bodily organs are ever the same. For mechanical intelligence, no two engines can be tuned in the same way. So releasing programs perfected in virtual space into the wild is fraught with difficulty.\n\nThe second caveat, which DeepMind rarely talks about, is that success within virtual environments depends on the existence of a reward function: a signal that allows software to measure its progress. The program learns that ricocheting off the back wall makes its score go up. Much of DeepMind\u2019s work with AlphaGo lay in constructing a reward function compatible with such a complex game. Unfortunately, the real world doesn\u2019t offer simple rewards. Progress is rarely measured by single scores. Where such measures exist, political challenges complicate the problem. Reconciling the reward signal for climate health (the concentration of CO\u2082 in the atmosphere) with the reward signal for oil companies (share price) requires satisfying many human beings with conflicted motivations. Reward signals tend to be very weak. It is rare for human brains to receive explicit feedback about the success of a task while in the midst of it.\n\nDeepMind has found a way around this by employing vast amounts of computer power. AlphaGo takes thousands of years of human game-playing time to learn anything. Many AI thinkers suspect this solution is unsustainable for tasks that offer weaker rewards. DeepMind acknowledges the existence of such ambiguities. It has recently focused on StarCraft 2, a strategy computer game. Decisions taken early in the game have ramifications later on, which is closer to the sort of convoluted and delayed feedback that characterises many real-world tasks. In January, DeepMind software beat some of the world\u2019s top human players in a demo that, while heavily constrained, was still impressive. Its programs have also begun to learn reward functions by following the feedback of human taskmasters. But putting human instruction in the loop risks losing the effects of scale and speed that unadulterated computer-processing offered.\n\nCurrent and former researchers at DeepMind and Google, who requested anonymity due to stringent non-disclosure agreements, have also expressed scepticism that DeepMind can reach AGI through such methods. To these individuals, the focus on achieving high performance within simulated environments makes the reward-signal problem hard to tackle. Yet this approach is at the heart of DeepMind. It has an internal leaderboard, in which programs from competing teams of coders vie for mastery over virtual domains."

    "text": "B ABY-BOOMERS may recall, perhaps wistfully, how the golden-arched sign outside every McDonald\u2019s restaurant would proclaim how many customers had been served by the chain. As they became adults, the number kept on climbing: 5bn in 1969; 30bn in 1979; 80bn in 1990. Jerry Seinfeld, a wry chronicler of the trivial, was moved to ask: \u201cWhy is McDonald\u2019s still counting?\u201d Do we really need to know about every last burger? Just put up a sign that says, \u201cWe\u2019re doing very well.\u201d\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe counting stopped. The signs said simply: \u201cBillions and billions served\u201d. If this seems unhelpfully vague, that is how the counting business sometimes is. Many of America\u2019s biggest companies, including McDonald\u2019s, report a negative book value, a gauge of a firm\u2019s net assets. Many more have a book value that is small relative to their market value: their shares look dear on a price-to-book basis. Much of this is down to the complexity of valuing a firm\u2019s assets in the digital age. But the result is that price-to-book is a bad guide to a stock\u2019s true value.\n\nStockpickers make a distinction between the price of a share and what it is truly worth. Price is a creature of fickle sentiment, of greed and fear. Value, in contrast, depends on a firm\u2019s capabilities. There are various shorthand measures for this, but true \u201cvalue\u201d investors put the greatest store by the price-to-book ratio. It is the basis for inclusion in benchmarks such as the Russell value index. Countless studies have shown that buying stocks with a low price-to-book is a winning strategy.\n\nBut not recently. For much of the past decade, value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, their antithesis. Perhaps this is because, as the industrial age gives way to the digital age, the intangible assets that increasingly matter are not easy to put a value on. The tangible world is easier. Factories, machines, land and office buildings count as capital assets on a firm\u2019s books, because they will generate profits for many years. It is a fairly straightforward business to come up with a value for them: it is what the firm paid. This value is gradually written off (depreciated) over time to reflect wear and tear and obsolescence.\n\nSuch fixed capital assets, along with current assets (cash, stocks of unsold goods, and so on) typically make up the bulk of book value. The problem is what it leaves out. These days, the value of a firm lies as much in its reputation, its processes, the know-how of staff and relationships with customers and suppliers as in tangible assets. Putting an accounting value on these intangibles is notoriously tricky. By their nature, they have unclear boundaries. Not every dollar of R&D or advertising spending can be ascribed to a well-defined asset, such as a brand or patent. That is in large part why, with a few exceptions, such spending is treated as a running cost, like rent or electricity.\n\nIncreasingly price is detached from book value. The median price-to-book of S&P 500 stocks is 3.0. But plenty of well-known companies, whose competitive edge rests on brands or patents, have much higher ratios or even negative book values (see chart). McDonald\u2019s has considerable brand value, which is not on its balance-sheet. It also has property assets that have been fully depreciated.\n\nThe effect of mergers is to make things murkier. If, say, one firm pays $100m for another that has $30m of tangible assets, the residual $70m is counted as an intangible asset\u2014either as brand value, if that can be gauged, or as \u201cgoodwill\u201d. That distorts comparisons. A firm that has acquired brands by merger will have those reflected in its book value, says Simon Harris, of GMO , a fund-management firm; a firm that has developed its own brands will not. Share buy-backs make things murkier still. For any firm with a price-to-book greater than one, a buy-back will diminish book by proportionately more than it lowers the value of outstanding stock. So price-to-book rises further."

    "text": "Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again. By Eric Topol.Basic Books; 400 pages; $17.99.\n\nF OR ALL the technological wonders of modern medicine, from gene-editing to fetal surgery, health care\u2014with its fax machines and clipboards\u2014is often stubbornly antiquated. This outdated era is slowly drawing to a close as, belatedly, the industry catches up with the artificial-intelligence ( AI ) revolution. And none too soon, argues Eric Topol, a cardiologist and enthusiast for digital medicine.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nDr Topol\u2019s vision of medicine\u2019s future is optimistic. He thinks AI will be particularly useful for repetitive, error-prone tasks, such as sifting images, scrutinising heart traces for abnormalities or transcribing doctors\u2019 words into patient records. It will be able to harness masses of data to work out optimal treatments (for both conditions and individuals), and improve workflows in hospitals. In short, AI is set to save time, lives and money.\n\nMuch of this is hypothetical\u2014but AI is already outperforming people in a variety of narrow jobs for which it has been trained. Eventually it may be able to diagnose and treat a wider range of diseases. Even then, Dr Topol thinks, humans would oversee the algorithms, rather than being replaced by them.\n\nThe fear the author harbours is that AI will be used to deepen the assembly-line culture of modern medicine. If it confers a \u201cgift of time\u201d on doctors, he argues that this bonus should be used to prolong consultations, rather than simply speeding through them more efficiently.\n\nThat is a fine idea, but as health swallows an ever-bigger share of national wealth, greater efficiency is exactly what is needed, at least so far as governments and insurers are concerned. Otherwise, rich societies may fail to cope with the needs of ageing and growing populations. An extra five minutes spent chatting with a patient is costly as well as valuable. The AI revolution will also empower managerial bean-counters, who will increasingly be able to calibrate and appraise every aspect of treatment. The autonomy of the doctor will inevitably be undermined, especially, perhaps, in public-health systems which are duty-bound to trim inessential costs.\n\nThe Hippocratic Oath holds that there is an art to medicine as well as a science, and that \u201cwarmth, sympathy and understanding may outweigh the surgeon\u2019s knife or the chemist\u2019s drug\u201d. That is not just a platitude: the patients of sympathetic physicians have been shown to fare better. As Dr Topol says, it is hard to imagine that a robot could really replace a human doctor. Yet as demand for health care outstrips the supply of human carers, the future may involve consultations on smartphones and measurements monitored by chatbots. The considerately warmed stethoscope, placed gently on a patient\u2019s back, may become a relic of the past.\n\nIn the end technology may even be able to solve the empathy deficit. Japanese engineers are working on robots that simulate human presence, or sonzai-kan. A machine could never truly develop the shared humanity that helps patients heal. That doesn\u2019t mean it cannot be faked."

    "text": "I N THE DAYS of pre-internet capitalism the troubles of one dominant company in an industry tended to be good news for its rivals. In today\u2019s hyperconnected world a threatened ban by Western governments of Huawei, the Chinese market leader in telecoms gear, is also a worry for its competitors. Both Ericsson, a Swedish company, and Nokia, a Finnish one, would prefer the geopolitical saga to end, the better to focus on competing for contracts related to the launch of super-speedy \u201cfifth generation\u201d (5 G ) mobile-phone networks.\n\nThe American government is not letting up its campaign to persuade allies to freeze Huawei out of 5 G tenders. It worries that Huawei\u2019s kit may contain \u201cback doors\u201d\u2014deliberate security flaws inserted to allow Chinese spooks eavesdrop on, or attack, phone networks. Earlier this month, in a letter to Germany\u2019s economics minister, America\u2019s envoy to Berlin, Richard Grenell, threatened to cut back American co-operation with German security agencies if the country allowed Huawei or other Chinese firms to participate in the roll-out of 5 G . Mike Pompeo, America\u2019s secretary of state, suggested in Hungary recently that doing business with Huawei could tip decisions on where America stations troops.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nSo far Britain and Germany, among others, have not yielded to American demands. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said on March 19th that she does not believe in excluding a company from the German market \u201csimply because it\u2019s from a certain country\u201d, though a final decision is pending. Even if America prevailed in Europe, as it has in Australia and Japan, Ericsson and Nokia are unlikely to win back much of the market they have lost in recent years. Between 2015 and 2018 Huawei\u2019s share rose from 24% to 28%; Nokia\u2019s dipped from 20% to 17% and Ericsson\u2019s from 15% to 13%. An escalation in the war on Huawei might prompt Beijing to retaliate by kicking Western firms out of China.\n\nThat would be a blow to the Nordic duo. China accounted for 10% of Ericsson\u2019s 211bn krona ($24.2bn) in global sales last year. The company runs two research and development sites in China. Nokia derives a similar share of revenues from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Extra sales in Europe in the event of a Huawei ban would not offset losses in China, argues Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research, not least because the Chinese will launch 5 G a year or two earlier.\n\nMore important, worries B\u00f6rje Ekholm, chief executive of Ericsson, a ban on Huawei would slow down the launch of 5 G in Europe. The continent is already lagging three to four years behind America in 4 G , the current generation of wireless technology, he says. Uncertainty over regulation, pricing and, most of all, how to deal with Huawei, is likely to slow Europe down further. European operators are lobbying hard to maintain the choice between three purveyors; many prefer Huawei wares, which are often cheaper (and some say better).\n\nThe spectre of a Huawei ban is putting a damper on Germany\u2019s auction for 5 G mobile spectrum that kicked off on March 18th in Mainz. The auction, which drew four big operators, is expected to last several weeks. All four bidders already make extensive use of Huawei hardware, such as antennae or routers. Upgrading to 5 G will require splurging on new kit. Huawei wants to be one of their principal suppliers (though it may first need to meet more stringent security requirements which the German government is mulling). In November the Chinese company opened a lab in Bonn, the base of Germany\u2019s cyber-security regulator, where its equipment can be tested.\n\nThough it is possible to ban Huawei completely from Europe, its biggest market outside of China, industry insiders warn that it would be hugely complex and costly. It would be especially disruptive in countries where Huawei is deeply embedded, such as Italy, Poland and Britain, says St\u00e9phane T\u00e9ral of IHS Markit, a research firm. With only a hint of hyperbole Bengt Nordstrom of Northstream, a consultancy, likens the resulting shock to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Most of Europe\u2019s roughly 200 operators of mobile networks use Huawei\u2019s 4 G gear."

    "text": "A YALKIBET, A PORTLY man in a garish white suit, is taking an oath. Hand raised, expression sombre, he reads a pledge to administer his caf\u00e9 wisely. Four colleagues nod in approval. \u201cBut only for a month,\u201d prompts one, following the text as he recites it. Ayalkibet skips over that proviso; his colleagues look up in alarm. So begins a recent episode of \u201cMin Litazez?\u201d (\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d), a hit Ethiopian sitcom, in which the temporary manager schemes to extend his time in office.\n\nWho might this represent? Not, surely, Ethiopia\u2019s new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who has convulsed the country\u2019s politics by promising free elections next year and to step down if he loses. And, indeed, \u201cMin Litazez?\u201d is too clever for such clunky comparisons. But the audience is invited to draw their own, and many viewers have seen a reflection of Abiy in the protagonist. In previous seasons there was no doubt that Ayalkibet\u2014then a petty tyrant of the workplace\u2014stood in for the ruling party\u2019s authoritarian old guard, whom Abiy shoved aside last March. Now, as Ethiopians acclimatise to a more gentle leadership, the character has been transformed. No longer a dictator, he is a well-meaning but pompous honcho with a weakness for the limelight.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\u201cMin Litazez?\u201d is revolutionary, in an understated way. Not only does it lampoon Ethiopia\u2019s leaders; it does so on a national channel owned by the ruling party. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had anything like this,\u201d says Elias Wondimu, an intellectual who made a guest appearance last year. The show\u2019s popularity, and the imitations it has spawned, illustrate how subversive comedy is tiptoeing into the Ethiopian mainstream, upturning decades, even centuries, of cultural norms. Amid the laughs, the high-jinks offer a glimpse into the psyche of a conservative society loosening up fast.\n\nUntil 1974 Ethiopia was an imperial monarchy. Next came a Marxist junta known as the Derg, and then, after 1991, the iron-fisted rule of the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front. Each regime upheld an absolutist conception of power that left little room for public dissent, least of all satire. Under the Derg this meant a total ban on the free press. The constitution of 1994 theoretically prohibited censorship, but it continued in practice. Until last year the government would insist on cuts to films, TV shows and plays\u2014or ban them altogether.\n\nThe flipside of this draconian approach was a sophisticated culture of concealment, in which resistance was disguised as obedience. \u201cYou bow in front and fart behind\u201d, as a local proverb has it. In Amharic, the most widespread language, this is known as samna\u2014warq, or \u201cwax and gold\u201d: the studied use of words for ambiguous purposes. For centuries poets and azmaris, the bards and original satirists of highland Ethiopia, celebrated the glory of feudal overlords in songs that shrewdly hid their true meaning. \u201cThe more repressive the government was, the more vocal the oral satirists became,\u201d says Tigab Bezie of Bahir Dar University. In diluted form, the technique still persists in everyday humour. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed a keen sense of self-censorship,\u201d says Elias. \u201cYou use wax-and-gold strategies to save yourself.\u201d\n\nBut the subterfuge has gradually become less necessary. After disputed elections triggered mass protests and a fierce crackdown in 2005, a CD of jokes making fun of the then-prime minister, Meles Zenawi, became an underground sensation. The government quickly pulled \u201cRepressed Jokes\u201d, as the recording was known, from the market. Since then dissident humour has migrated\u2014and flourished\u2014online. There is a booming industry of political memes and what Engdawork Endrias, an Ethiopian literary scholar, calls \u201cinformal essays\u201d: writings, often posted on Facebook, which can be savagely satirical. YouTube offers a platform for risqu\u00e9 sketch shows such as \u201cFugera News\u201d (though that programme, now discontinued, was made abroad and its presenter hid his identity).\n\nFunny ha-ha\n\nNow such material is making the leap to television. \u201cYaz Leqeq\u201d (\u201cTemperamental\u201d), a sketch show that aired on a satellite channel last autumn, offered impersonations of prominent politicians (including the prime minister). New sitcoms tackle current affairs with increased daring, while some older ones, such as \u201cBetoch\u201d (\u201cFamilies\u201d), are tentatively following suit. In January Eshetu Melese, a stand-up comedian, performed his hour-long show about torture under Abiy\u2019s predecessors on television. He says he has since been approached by several producers keen to bring a version of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d to Ethiopian audiences.\n\nThese innovations share some common themes. The programmes tend to be self-consciously didactic. In \u201cYeemama Bet\u201d (\u201cMama\u2019s House\u201d), a sitcom set in a traditional drinking den, the six characters, who represent various ethnic backgrounds, come together at the end of each episode and resolve their differences. So do those in \u201cAleme\u201d (\u201cMy World\u201d), which is set in a guesthouse. Eshetu says that during his stand-up he explains the political messages at the end of each joke, pointing out, for example, that Ethiopia needs a proper human-rights commission.\n\nIn their open political boldness, all these innovations follow in the footsteps of Bereket Belayneh, a playwright whose sensationally popular one-man show, \u201cEyayu Fungus\u201d\u2014first staged three years ago and soon to air on television\u2014made fun of low-level officials as well as Ethiopians themselves. His protagonist, a madman, excoriates the audience for their failures, moral and otherwise. The new trend is \u201cnot about entertainment\u201d, says Behailu Wassie, the director of \u201cMin Litazez?\u201d \u201cThe intention is to get a better country.\u201d\n\nThe hope is that humour can act as a tonic for long-standing ethnic tensions that have persisted, even worsened, since Abiy\u2019s arrival in office. Surafel Daniel, director of \u201cYeemama Bet\u201d, says its angriest critics are those who wrongly perceive a gag to be made at the expense of a particular ethnicity. With time, he hopes, audiences may become less sensitive. Abel Asrat, a humorist and commentator, is more upbeat. \u201cI see different ethnicities laughing at the same joke,\u201d he says."

    "text": "A LMOST TWO years ago Masayoshi Son, a Japanese tycoon, broke all the rules of investing by setting up a new vehicle to back tech firms. The Vision Fund was unusual in several ways. Worth $100bn, it was enormous. Some $45bn of that came from Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, who got the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to contribute. It took huge bets on trendy \u201cunicorns\u201d\u2014unlisted firms worth over a billion dollars, such as Uber. And it gave almost total control to Mr Son.\n\nMany sceptics dismissed the Vision Fund as a vast pot of tainted money squandered on hyped-up assets. And by October last year it looked as if they were right. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist, cast Saudi Arabia and the fund into disrepute, while the shares of tech firms started to tank.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nNow, however, the Masa show is back on the road. The Khashoggi affair has receded and technology stocks have recovered. Several of the Vision Fund\u2019s biggest investments are due to float on the stockmarket at racy prices. And Mr Son plans to raise as much as $100bn, for the Vision Fund 2 (see article). He will soon do the rounds of the world\u2019s sovereign-wealth funds and pension giants, touting robots and artificial intelligence\u2014and, once again, his own magic touch.\n\nThese custodians of other people\u2019s money should be on their guard. Mr Son\u2019s relations with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund ( PIF ), which provided the $45bn, are reportedly strained. The reason is not the Khashoggi murder but the PIF \u2019s (privately expressed) dismay about the Vision Fund\u2019s governance.\n\nLooking in from the outside, the first problem is \u201ckey-man risk\u201d. As with Prince Muhammad\u2019s reign, Mr Son\u2019s rule at the fund is absolute. If he views a startup as sufficiently world-changing, next to nothing will stop him betting big. His is by far the strongest voice on the Vision Fund\u2019s three-member investment committee, which has the final say on what is bought. That is because the other two members are his employees. The PIF can veto investments only if they are for over $3bn.\n\nThe second worry is the potential for conflicts of interest between the Vision Fund and SoftBank, a giant conglomerate listed in Japan that Mr Son founded and still runs. In deals where the Vision Fund\u2019s investment process takes too long, Mr Son has in the past used SoftBank\u2019s balance-sheet to buy stakes in young companies which are in turn transferred to the Vision Fund. Often SoftBank makes a profit, as with its stake in Didi, a Chinese ride-sharing company, which it accumulated between 2015 and 2017 at a cost of $5.9bn and will soon transfer to the Vision Fund for $6.8bn. Very occasionally SoftBank makes a loss.\n\nSoftBank and the Vision Fund obey rules on investing and their fiduciary duties. The fund uses independent valuers, including big audit firms. And SoftBank has a big direct stake in the Vision Fund and thus an incentive to see it prosper. Nonetheless SoftBank has too much scope to manoeuvre unlisted investments in high-growth but loss-making firms. Worse is the scant disclosure on how investments are valued, or how much cash the Vision Fund\u2019s firms are burning up.\n\nYou do not need artificial intelligence to conclude that Vision Funds 1 and 2 need better governance. Both need independent boards. Bringing in a heavyweight technology executive to test Mr Son\u2019s convictions would lessen the risk of dud deals. Transfers between SoftBank and the Vision Funds should stop. Investors must be told how positions are valued.\n\nThe Vision Fund needs transparency\n\nMr Son\u2019s empire has become too big to get by with patchy, amateur governance. It has about $300bn of equity and debt, and stakes in 70 or so prominent startups which could be damaged if one of their leading sponsors blows up. When Mr Son comes asking for more money, investors should make it clear that the time has come for his style to change.\n\nCorrection: This piece stated that SoftBank bought a $5.9bn stake in Didi in 2017. In fact, it accumulated the stake in several transactions between 2015 and 2017. We apologise for the error"

To be published in England by Jonathan Cape in July; \u00a316.99.\n\nA TWO-MINUTE pause on a mountain road is long enough for an American unit to be blown up. As Vollie, short for Volunteer, realises, a convoy\u2019s orders could be distilled to one simple instruction: keep going, even if you get a flat tyre. This mantra shapes his life: \u201cif it obstructs the road you push it off the cliff, don\u2019t matter if your mother\u2019s inside.\u201d\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nVollie (a nickname from his childhood on a farm in Iowa) is one of three marines captured in the Cambodian jungle in Salvatore Scibona\u2019s second novel. Their presence beyond the Vietnamese border is illegal, so they do not qualify as prisoners-of-war. In \u201cthe tunnel\u201d, as the men call their subterranean prison, Vollie survives by eating his wounded comrades\u2019 food. After his release and recovery in Saigon, he requests a \u201chard clearing\u201d, meaning his records and identity are erased.\n\nThis intricate book spans decades and continents and incorporates multiple, looping stories. Returning to America, Vollie is dispatched to New York as a covert operative for an unnamed agency, with instructions to conduct surveillance on a supposed renegade Nazi. This assignment will haunt him. \u201cThe more excellent way is love,\u201d insists a woman whose death Vollie witnesses but feels powerless to prevent. \u201cAny one person is a grounds for love if you pick him,\u201d his old friend Bobby tells him. \u201cYou have to pick him is the thing.\u201d At a commune in New Mexico, where he washes up after New York, Vollie falls for Louisa, Bobby\u2019s ex, and brings up her son, setting in train another of the book\u2019s tales.\n\nA searing record of war and the lies people live by, \u201cThe Volunteer\u201d is also a map of an alternative America, populated by men sleeping on the beds of trucks and women scrounging cigarettes and beer. Along the way Mr Scibona explores the process of forgetting, the longing to be singled out for love and the price of saying \u201cno\u201d when you want to say \u201cyes\u201d. He is as adept at conjuring memorable images and sensations as in conveying his themes: a wind rolling off a bay and smelling of molasses, an empty mailbox filled only with sunlight.\n\nDespite all the destruction and despair, in this novel hope emerges as the wildest high. \u201cWho among us\u201d, Vollie asks, \u201chas lived only once?\u201d"

    "text": "D OWNTOWN JOHANNESBURG puts a bounce in your step. Streets bustle with noisy fruit-sellers and minibus drivers seeking custom. But South Africa\u2019s commercial capital can also put a knot of fear in your stomach. Jozi, as locals call it, is notorious for muggings and armed robbery. Corporate offices bristle with impenetrable security and armies of guards. Yet the area has grown less edgy since Schumpeter first visited, nearly two decades ago. For that, give some credit to Business Against Crime. The association pays for hundreds of CCTV cameras, and for staff to monitor them and alert police to mischief.\n\nSouth African bosses are far from alone in their concern over crime\u2014be it against their customers, employees or property. According to the World Bank, 17% of all firms (from a global survey of 135,000) count crime as a \u201cmajor constraint\u201d. In Brazil or Ivory Coast it is nearer to 70%. In El Salvador and Kenya four in five firms pay for private security. A survey in Mexico found that small businesses there spend 6% of their income on such protection, double the level of a decade ago. Companies distributing goods in gang-run neighbourhoods of Medellin, in Colombia, lose 8-15% of their revenues to theft, says Sergio Tob\u00f3n, who heads Proantioquia, which unites 50 of the country\u2019s biggest companies in the city, once home to Pablo Escobar. In the United States, a single killing depresses local property prices by 1.5% on average the following year. In Washington, DC , every homicide is associated with two businesses closing.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn truly lawless regions, the simplest solution is for companies to stay away\u2014or hire private armies. In peaceful places they help maintain order at a remove, by providing jobs, paying taxes and being good corporate citizens. But in locations that are, like Johannesburg, dangerous but too important to ignore, they increasingly push back directly.\n\nProantioquia bankrolls research into the best ways to combat organised criminals. Other Colombian firms urge banks to extend loans to their hard-pressed workers so that they avoid gota a gota, a vicious local species of loan shark. In Monterrey, a large industrial centre near Mexico\u2019s border with the United States, big local firms known as \u201cthe group of ten\u201d argued for reform of corrupt state police who had let violent criminals prosper. They helped pay for better police training and lobbied for higher wages and benefits for new recruits. More firms jointly commissioned regular surveys of public attitudes on crime, to focus politicians\u2019 minds.\n\nCorporate crime-fighting is not confined to violent parts of the emerging world. In Ferguson, Missouri, local businesses such as Emerson Electric and Centene, a health-care outfit, rushed to open offices and employ locals after anti-police protests five years ago. The idea was to snuff out popular anger before it fuelled violence. After a horrible spike in killings in Chicago three years ago, companies with a large presence there including Allstate, an insurer, and Boeing, pooled $40m to help stem gun-violence, for instance by paying for therapy and jobs training for vulnerable young men who might pull the trigger next. AT & T opened a call centre and hired 400 workers from the city\u2019s most blighted districts, to foster economic opportunities.\n\nCorporate caped crusaders have a range of motives. They fret that crime will hurt the wider economy and thus (eventually) them, too. Whitney Smith of JPMorgan Chase, a bank which has funnelled $150m into rehabilitating parts of Detroit and is now contributing to efforts in Chicago, says that companies, civic organisations and local government all feared the Windy City was earning a reputation for violence. \u201cIt felt like a threat to economic growth for everyone,\u201d she recalls. Last May Mexico\u2019s big business lobby, CCE , called violence the single \u201cgreatest obstacle\u201d to economic activity. Mr Tob\u00f3n says firms in Medellin pay to train ex-guerrillas for civilian jobs for the same reason.\n\nMax Kapustin of the University of Chicago estimates that every murder drives 70 residents from a city like his. Of the seven American cities most notorious for lawlessness, five lost a big share of their population in the past 30 years, notes Thomas Abt, author of a forthcoming book on urban violence called \u201cBleeding Out\u201d. Booming cities like Johannesburg might grow even faster with less of it.\n\nFirms\u2019 motivations can also be more immediately self-serving. Companies profit directly from crime-fighting. ShotSpotter has installed microphones on streets in 100 American cities to help police pinpoint where and when guns are fired. LoJack tracks stolen cars. Detective agencies such as Pinkerton and consultants like Control Risks advise multinationals on security. In Mexico corporate protection is big business, with 2,000 regulated companies and turnover of $1.5bn in 2016. Add another 8,000 informal firms and their combined 500,000 security guards outnumber Mexico\u2019s armed forces by 80%.\n\nOther firms see their anti-crime efforts as a tool to attract and retain workers. In Chicago local firms like being seen helping their hometown\u2014not least if it helps them to recruit and motivate employees. \u201cPeople want to work in an institution that has a mission,\u201d says Toni Irving, head of Get In Chicago, an anti-violence corporate group. Workers crave more meaningful activities, she reports, and enjoy volunteering with anti-crime groups. If that makes the city a safer place to take a stroll, so much the better.\n\nRisk capital\n\nFirms will not put an end to crime\u2014nor should they strive to. Not counting corporate taxes, Ms Irving reckons that business groups provide perhaps a tenth of Chicago\u2019s total spending on crime-prevention (the figure in emerging-world cities may be higher). In the end, public safety is the responsibility of governments. Still, until good policies render businesses\u2019 extra tithe unnecessary, it is best viewed as a kind of speculative investment in ideas that, if successful, public crime-busters can roll out at scale."

Norton; \u00a319.99.\n\nG RAHAM GREENE\u2019S life was a gift to biographers. They\u2014and the author himself\u2014have amply chronicled his adventurous stints in exotic locations, his work as a secret agent, his love affairs and his Catholicism. Christopher Hull touches on all of these themes in his focused and entertaining account of the making of Greene\u2019s novel of espionage, \u201cOur Man in Havana\u201d.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThat book is set in Cuba, which Greene (pictured) first visited by accident in 1954, after he was deported from Puerto Rico. (He had unwisely revealed that, as a student prank, he was once a member of the Communist Party.) Greene disliked the authoritarian regime of Fulgencio Batista but enjoyed the climate and the seedy nightlife, returning frequently over the next dozen years.\n\nEver anti-American, Greene approved when Fidel Castro overthrew Batista, Washington\u2019s client, in 1959; he admired Castro\u2019s social reforms but rued the puritanical clampdown on Havana\u2019s fleshpots. Rather than merely witnessing the communist takeover, he tried to assist it, using his clandestine contacts to lobby against the supply of weapons to Batista and help furnish Castro with British buses.\n\nThese half-baked efforts were worthy of his own comic novels, of which \u201cOur Man in Havana\u201d\u2014published just months before the revolution\u2014may be the best loved. The protagonist is James Wormold, a vacuum-cleaner salesman recruited by the British secret service. Learning that the more information he provides the greater his remuneration, he invents a network of agents and increasingly farcical intelligence, to the delight of his minders in London. His masterstroke is a report of strange goings-on in the mountains, which he backs up with what are supposedly aerial photographs of sinister constructions. In reality they have been adapted from diagrams of vacuum cleaners.\n\nIn \u201cOur Man Down in Havana\u201d Mr Hull argues that, as well as drawing on his secret-service experience to describe the bumbling nature of much intelligence work, Greene was eerily prophetic about the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, which arose when reconnaissance flights proved that the Soviet Union was constructing missile sites on the island. He makes a game case, but some readers might conclude that coincidence is a more apt judgment than prescience. Mr Hull even sees Greene\u2019s \u201cclairvoyance\u201d at work in the faulty evidence of weapons of mass destruction on which the invasion of Iraq was based in 2003.\n\nIt would be interesting to know what the novelist would make of that reverent appraisal. Still, Mr Hull\u2019s book is a delicious companion to the tale Greene confected from the incompetence of spooks and an island in turmoil."

Over the past few years, scores of scientific studies have found declines in different measures of insect life and health, all of the order of 50-80%, in areas as far apart as Germany, California and Borneo.\n\nThe findings have triggered alarm, almost panic. Animals, mostly insects, pollinate 87% of flowering plants, according to a recent study by the UN \u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ). Without insects, most plants could not reproduce.

What do the data actually tell us?\n\nIn terms of the number of species, insects are by far the most abundant of life forms. Scientists have identified and described over 1m species of insect, compared with only about 6,000 mammals and 18,000 birds. Insects are so numerous that they contain three times as much mass as humans and 30 times that of all wild mammals. \u201cTo judge by his creation,\u201d a geneticist, J.B.S. Haldane, once quipped \u201cGod must have an inordinate fondness for stars and beetles.\u201d\n\nLittle about this astonishing bounty is known. Using computer models of ecosystems, Nigel Stork of Griffith University, Queensland, estimates there are 5.5m species of insect and 6.8m of terrestrial arthropods (the wider category that includes spiders and crustaceans). That implies over 80% of insects remain undiscovered. Arthur Shapiro of the University of California, Davis, tells the story of travelling by bus across Patagonia, when he broke down in the middle of nowhere. In the two hours it took to mend the engine, and while he stayed within sight of the vehicle the whole time, he found three species of butterfly new to science. \u201cThat\u2019s how little we know.\u201d\n\nEven when individual species are described, the process yields only partial information. Scientists have little hard data on what the vast majority of insects eat, how mobile they are or what determines their reproductive success. There has been almost no long-term monitoring of their numbers. \u201cAround and beneath our feet,\u201d writes Dr Wilson, \u201clies the least explored part of the planet\u2019s surface.\u201d\n\nFor many years, it did not seem possible or necessary to study insect populations. In their murmuring trillions, insects seemed safe from the pressures that were driving predatory mammals towards extinction. It was unimaginable that so many could disappear. As a haiku by Basho, a Japanese monk, puts it, \u201cNothing in the cry of cicadas suggests they are about to die.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s a few disturbing signs of decline began to appear. Long-distance drivers across America and Europe reported that their windscreens were no longer splattered with bugs. Pilots in the Arctic Circle now describe the same thing. Urban streetlights are no longer enveloped by clouds of photophilous moths. Insect-eating birds began to disappear. But these signs could be explained away by, say, more aerodynamic car designs, or changes to farming. The evidence was anecdotal.\n\nThere are, though, a few exceptions to the rule that no long-term databases of insect populations exist. The biggest is kept by Butterfly Conservation, a charity based in Dorset in southern England. It has records from 1690 but its most important data begin in 1976 when, concerned by the anecdotes of decline, two government scientists designed a simple monitoring system. Every week in summer, volunteer butterfly-spotters walk slowly along fixed paths, or \u201ctransects\u201d, and log every butterfly and moth they see within 2.5 metres of their path. In Hethfelton Wood, near Wool, in Dorset, the path loops through a forest that, now partially felled, is reverting to heathland. Volunteers have logged 35 species of butterfly there since 2000, ranging from Graylings and White Admirals to thriving species such as the Silver-Washed Fritillary, which is rare elsewhere.\n\nThe project, called the United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme ( UKBMS ), proved such a hit with Britain\u2019s amateur naturalists that the scientists were overwhelmed with data. Now, 2,000 volunteers monitor more than 2,500 sites and produce 3m records a year. It is by far the most detailed insect data set in the world and, unlike most, measures both whether a species occurs in an area and how abundant it is. It shows that between 1976 and 2014, 32 of Britain\u2019s 56 native butterflies declined in numbers, 21 by more than 40%. The biggest falls were among species classed as habitat specialists, with limited ranges or which feed on a small number of plants.\n\nA second long-term set of data also monitors butterflies, is older and, heroically, is conducted by just one person. Every two weeks since 1972, Professor Shapiro of UC Davis has trekked along ten transects in central California, noting the butterflies he sees (159 species and subspecies). Since 1972, the number of species has fallen in half the transects and risen in one; 2017-18, he says, was \u201ca terrible, perhaps even catastrophic butterfly year\u201d.\n\nThe third data set is kept by the Krefeld Entomological Association, a group of professional and amateur naturalists in a town near Dusseldorf in western Germany. Their headquarters is lined with wooden cases full of insect specimens found in the surrounding grasslands, dunes and woods, meticulously labelled. In 1989 the society began setting up so-called Malaise traps, large tent-like structures that trap flying insects, in local sites in spring and summer. There are now 63 sites. This collection method records the total biomass of insects in the trap, a good measure of the amount of food available to birds and other predators but which tells you nothing about which species are being caught or how many of each there are. More than half the traps have only been checked once since 1989 and even those that are checked more than once are not monitored in consecutive years. The results are not those of a classic longitudinal study.\n\nBuggy data\n\nBut when Caspar Hallmann of Radboud University in the Netherlands combed through the data in 2017, all doubts about their significance were silenced. Between 1989 and 2016 he found the biomass of flying insects in this corner of western Germany fell 77%, or over 5% a year. Making the results more remarkable is that the traps were set up in nature reserves which, though hardly pristine, are better protected from clouds of insecticides than most land in western Europe. \u201cWe were amazed,\u201d says Dave Goulson of the University of Sussex, one of the co-authors. The study was the third most frequently cited scientific study (of all kinds) in the media in 2017 and pushed the governments of Germany and the Netherlands into setting up programmes to protect insect diversity.\n\nSince then, more surveys have confirmed the results. Early this year, Francisco S\u00e1nchez-Bayo of the University of Sydney and Kris Wyckhuys of the University of Queensland, reviewed all the studies they could find mentioning insect decline. Theirs was the first study of studies. The authors found that 53% of lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) were in decline; 49% of coleoptera (beetles) and 46% of hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants and sawflies). Over a third of insect species, they claimed, are threatened with extinction.\n\nFishing for insects\n\nThat species are failing in some places is not in dispute. What is less clear is whether the decline is global. Drs S\u00e1nchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys found a mere 73 papers. That is not enough, argues Alex Wild of the University of Texas, Austin, to say much about anything globally.\n\nThere have been no surveys of wild insect numbers in India, China, Siberia, the Middle East or Australia and only a single study each in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. These areas include almost all the tropics where the majority of insect species are thought to live.\n\nMost of the biggest declines have been measured in Europe and the United States, where the human footprint lies heaviest on the landscape and where modern agricultural methods are almost universal. Given the paucity of evidence, it is impossible to say whether insect numbers really have declined the most in these two areas or whether they have fallen everywhere but these are the places that have been studied.\n\nIt is true that all 73 studies show declines. But that is because the authors went looking for that result. They typed the search terms [insect*] and [declin*] and [survey] into a database. \u201cEstimates based on this \u2018unidirectional\u2019 methodology,\u201d argues Chris Thomas of the University of York in Britain, \u201care not credible.\u201d Nor do all studies show a decline (though they were not captured by the search). A recent study found pollinators are increasing in undisturbed habitats in south-eastern Spain. \u201cThis provides evidence,\u201d that report says, \u201cthat pollinator declines are not universal beyond anthropogenic ecosystems.\u201d\n\nNo less important, the relationship between declining insect numbers and damage to ecosystems is not a simple linear one. Both Drs S\u00e1nchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys and the UKBMS found that generalist pollinators (such as Brown Argus and Gatekeeper butterflies) are doing less badly than specialists, such as the White Admirals, which are now extinct in some regions. Generalists are presumably moving into niches vacated by specialists, a process that is not without risks. At low levels of diversity, ecosystems become vulnerable to diseases that can sweep through a single species. Nevertheless, this process is a reminder that insect ecosystems are more resilient than they sometimes appear.\n\nThat is also true of the floral ecosystems that depend on insect pollinators. Jane Memmott of the University of Bristol investigated what happens when insect species die out by gradually removing one pollinator after another in a controlled environment and keeping track of what happened to the plants. She found that, depending on which species was removed first, most plants managed to hang on even after more than two-thirds of insects had been removed, illustrating the resilience of ecosystems. Only when more than 90% of insect species were removed, did floral diversity collapse.\n\nBuzz off\n\nAll of this provides reasons to be cautious about extrapolating too far from the data. But there are still three big reasons to worry about what is known.\n\nFirst, the scale. Declines of more than 50% in most measures of insect health seem more severe than the diminution in other taxonomic ranks. A British study from 2004 found that insect species are declining faster than birds or plants. Almost all species and subspecies are affected, regardless of the altitude at which they live. Declines have been drastic even in protected reserves.\n\nSecond, it is worrying that so many influences are contributing to the decline. It is as if, in the insects\u2019 world, everything is going wrong at once. The main causes seem to be, in order of importance: habitat loss (97% of wildflower meadows have been grubbed up in Britain since the 1930s); intensive farming, which leaves fewer unproductive parcels of land for wildlife; pesticide use; and the spread of diseases and parasites such as the varroa mite, once confined to East Asia where local bees had a measure of resistance, but which is now killing honeybees worldwide. David Wagner of the University of Connecticut calls this \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d.\n\nThird, insects pose a less familiar sort of environmental problem, that of dwindling abundance. Biologists often think of biodiversity loss in terms of extinctions, especially of top-of-the-pile predators. But when a species is abundant, ecosystems come to depend on profusion, and a decline short of extinction can disrupt their workings profoundly. As Dr Memmott\u2019s experiment showed, the impact may be delayed but it will occur eventually.\n\nOne of the unnerving possibilities of insect decline is that it may have been going on decades before long-term monitoring started. After all, modern agricultural practices were well under way in the 1920s. This in turn could mean that the decline documented in Europe and America is even greater than it seems. That does not mean a global insect collapse is imminent, but the data do suggest there are good reasons for concern. \u201cIn the past three months,\u201d says Dr Lister, \u201cmy fear level has gone up. I worry that we might be reaching a point where insect decline becomes irreversible.\u201d"

    "text": "IT WAS NOTHING like Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone. But the two-hour show on March 25th put on by Tim Cook, Jobs\u2019s less histrionic successor as boss of Apple, may nevertheless be remembered as a milestone for the company\u2014and the entertainment industry. Mr Cook did not announce the latest sleek gadget. Instead, he unveiled a suite of products and services, including video streaming, news, games and even a credit card. As theatre, it was underwhelming\u2014star-studded supporting cast including Oprah Winfrey notwithstanding. As a business case, it looks more compelling.\n\nApple\u2019s 900m iPhones worldwide, more than six times as many as Netflix has subscribers, grant it access to a massive potential audience. Analysts speculate that Apple will eventually offer them a variant of Amazon Prime, where customers pay a flat monthly fee for some combination of news, games, cloud storage, music and video, and which could possibly connect with the company\u2019s iPhone subscriptions. Mr Cook stopped short of announcing a unique subscription service, promising instead to roll out five separate offerings, some of which are merely older services in nicer packaging. Together, they nevertheless threaten fellow tech giants, Hollywood and banks.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nApple TV+, which got featured billing from Mr Cook, will offer original programming from Ms Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Sesame Street and others in more than 100 countries. The money Apple plans to spend on original shows\u2014perhaps $1bn to $2bn thus far\u2014is dwarfed by that of Netflix, which will splurge as much as $15bn this year on original and licensed content, or Disney, whose own video-streaming is expected shortly. But Apple\u2019s high-profile shows are for now meant chiefly to lure customers into its universe of apps and services. That includes subscription services for games, a catalogue of big American magazines (and a few newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal), and, in America, pay-TV networks such as HBO, Showtime and Starz. You can pay for it all using your new Apple Card, developed with bankers at Goldman Sachs. The credit card puts Apple in direct competition with banks: it has no fees and will give users 2% cash back on purchases made via Apple Pay, the company\u2019s payments system\u2014or 3% on purchases of Apple kit and services.\n\nAlthough Apple continues to earn most of its money from devices, its business in services is growing quickly, accounting for nearly $40bn of revenues of $266bn in 2018 (see chart). The new subscription offerings, which are easier to click and buy than their predecessors, should accelerate that trend. Its new partners hope to be along for the ride. Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that Apple may convert 10% of the 85m monthly users of its free News app into paying subscribers, for instance. Amazon Channels, which Apple TV channels aped, has boosted subscriptions for HBO, Showtime and Starz. Apple gets a cut of newspaper and TV subscriptions sold through its services, just as it gets a cut of sales in its app store.\n\nSome content providers are leery. The New York Times and Washington Post have spurned Apple\u2019s advances on behalf of its news service. Netflix and Disney will not partake in Apple TV+, which they view as more a threat than an opportunity.\n\nThey are right to be cautious. The future of media will belong to whoever controls relationships with consumers, industry insiders say. Thanks to its ubiquitous devices, Apple has hundreds of millions of customer relationships. With that comes the power to get more of their time and money, and to cut out competitors. Mr Cook may put on a lacklustre show, but his rivals had better watch him regardless."

    "text": "\u201cW HY IS THIS an interesting question?\u201d \u00c9va Nagyp\u00e1l, then a junior economist presenting research at her first academic conference, had barely finished her opening sentence. She still remembers the interruption many years on. Later she came to learn that such rudeness was quite normal, and that economists were capable of worse. As a young woman, she also experienced some \u201cinappropriate\u201d behaviour, but brushed it off. \u201cI could handle it,\u201d she says. Being told she was \u201ctechnically good, but not very creative\u201d was harder to stomach. She left academic economics in 2009.\n\nEconomists have tended to be wary of reading too much into anecdotes like Ms Nagyp\u00e1l\u2019s. A single data point does not prove that women are picked on or pushed away. Even Ms Nagyp\u00e1l\u2019s departure from academia was complicated. She liked her colleagues at Northwestern University, but felt drawn to more collaborative, policy-relevant research. The pull of her family was also a factor.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nBut harder evidence of something amiss is building. Granted, more women are attaining senior positions in university economics. But women make up only around 30% of P h D students, and are likelier than men to drop away as they climb the career ladder. Among a group of 43 leading American universities, the female share of P h D students has been essentially flat for two decades (see chart 1). That of assistant professors has fallen since 2009. Progress seems to have been a little slower than in some natural sciences, and economics remains far behind other social sciences.\n\nQuantifying the effects of such fuzzy notions as behaviour and culture is hard. But the American Economics Association ( AEA ), the leading professional body for academic economists, has attempted to do just that. On March 18th the AEA published the findings of a survey of its members, examining the \u201cprofessional climate\u201d. The survey reveals many more data points than one, and finds plenty of evidence of harassment and discrimination.\n\nMore than 9,000 economists, or 20% of those eligible, completed the survey. Only two-fifths of respondents reported that they felt \u201cvalued within...economics\u201d. But women and non-whites tended to feel worst. They were more likely to report unfair treatment when seeking an academic job and in pay and promotion. Almost half of women reported experiencing discrimination based on their sex. Among non-whites of both sexes, 29% complained of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity.\n\nIt is possible that the sample is biased, pushing up the apparent frequency of discrimination. The disgruntled may have been especially keen to have their say. Against that, the survey may have struggled to reach those who had been so discouraged by their experience that they had left the profession altogether.\n\nIn any case, the survey yielded more than enough reports of sexual harassment. Nearly 2,000 respondents said they had been embarrassed or offended by inappropriate gestures, remarks or materials from other economists. Hundreds reported experiences of attempted or actual sexual assault by a colleague or student in the past ten years. And 267 reported that they would have been rewarded had they co-operated with unwanted sexual attention, or threatened with retaliation had they not.\n\nThese figures are still fairly raw. Later this year the AEA will release further analysis, for example comparing the results with surveys from other academic disciplines. However economics measures up, abuses of power are probably widespread. A meta-analysis of studies of the prevalence of sexual harassment in 2003 ranked academia second only to the armed forces.\n\nThe Economist has supplemented the AEA \u2019s survey by interviewing 30 members of the profession, some speaking on condition of anonymity, to understand where and why problems exist. Most were women and at highly regarded universities. Most had tenure. Most reported that their colleagues were kind and that they enjoyed academic life. But their experiences varied widely. And all of them said that the profession had its problems.\n\nOne reported receiving too many comments on her appearance. Another said a fellow graduate student had been stalked. Some spoke of a set of senior men who were notorious sources of unwanted attention after a few drinks. Others mentioned an academic who had been edged out of a university department after several complaints against him, including some by graduate students, of unwanted sexual advances. He was then promoted at a different university.\n\nOur interviewees found it much easier to name prominent bullies than notorious harassers. A senior professor said that she had seen a special nastiness reserved for people regarded as vulnerable, including women. Others claimed only to have seen \u201cassholes\u201d who were indiscriminate in their aggression.\n\nUncovering and fixing such faults is difficult. Like any profession, economics is hierarchical. As in other academic disciplines, success depends on peer review. A formal complaint against someone higher up the ladder invites retaliation. Your research may be trashed. Your chances of promotion may be blighted. If the perpetrator is at a different university, you may not even know who to complain to.\n\nThe potential for abuse of power starts early. There is a growing trend for young economists to work as research assistants to leading academics, as a pathway into prestigious P h D programmes. If the academic refuses to write them a good reference, their career may be over before it even starts. P h D students are just as reliant on their seniors. Success requires letters of recommendation, invitations to conferences, help with research ideas and perhaps joint research. In all these areas women were far likelier to report unfair treatment than men in the AEA \u2019s survey (see chart 2). Non-whites were also more likely to report it than whites.\n\nUnfair treatment can be unwitting. Senior professors may be unconsciously drawn to favour students who look like their younger selves. They may like chatting about work over a drink, which young women may find uncomfortable. One P h D student said she felt that female students found it harder to connect with male professors. She suspected that was partly due to unspoken worries about harassment.\n\nOn the job market, too, interviewees detected implicit bias. One senior woman recalled hearing statements such as \u201cHer paper is really good\u2014she works really hard\u201d alongside those like \u201cHis paper is OK but he\u2019s super-smart.\u201d Writers of recommendation letters may not take into account time off for child-rearing. Women may be held to higher standards in evaluations of their research. Two recent studies by Erin Hengel of the University of Liverpool found that their papers are more readable than those written by men and cited more often, suggesting a higher hurdle for publication. Heather Sarsons of the University of Toronto has found that women get a smaller boost than men in their chances of tenure from each paper they co-write.\n\nThen there is the style of seminars, for which economics is notorious. Interruptions and intense questioning are supposed to weed out errors and uncover sloppy thinking. And several interviewees told of supportive sub-fields and departments, where the primary purpose was not to tear down the speaker. But one said she felt like quitting after seeing how a female presenter was treated. Another economist reported being asked during a presentation whether she knew any economics, and being interrupted incessantly.\n\nEven if everyone gets the same treatment, minority groups (which in economics includes women) may find such an environment unpleasant. The P h D students we spoke to said they were put off by the seminar style. Among macroeconomists, whose field is both particularly short of women and infamous for bare-knuckled seminars, 40% of those responding to the AEA \u2019s survey felt \u201cdisrespected\u201d; among female macroeconomists, 70% did.\n\nChange will be slow. Assessments of young economists\u2019 potential will always be subjective to a degree. Some senior economists shudder, with justification, at the thought of sitting through a sloppy seminar in silence, and worry that a cuddlier environment will soften intellectual rigour.\n\nBut experimentation is happening. Some departments have begun to try different seminar styles, for example insisting that presenters should be allowed a minimum time to speak before being interrupted. Some have circulated reminders that people should raise a hand before asking a question, or be mindful of the time they are taking as they make their point.\n\nIdeas are circulating about ways to attract and support junior and female researchers. The most recent issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives contained a collection of papers on the determinants of women\u2019s success in P h D programmes and ways to \u201cmake economics work for women at every stage\u201d. One, by Leah Boustan and Andrew Langan of Princeton University, found that departments with better outcomes for junior women also hired more female faculty members, provided \u201ccollegial\u201d research seminars and were more aware of gender issues.\n\nAnother paper by Mr Langan, covering accounting, sociology and political science as well as economics, found that when women become department chairs, the female share of graduate students goes up with no deterioration in candidates\u2019 quality. Women in those departments also publish more papers and are likelier to get tenure. The difference may lie in female heads of department sharing out non-academic duties more fairly. Over 40% of the women in the AEA \u2019s survey reported being given a disproportionate load.\n\nYoung economists are also speaking out. Last year the New York Times reported that Roland Fryer, a prominent economist at Harvard, had been found by the university to have created a hostile work environment for research assistants in his laboratory, which he denies. After Mr Fryer resigned from the AEA \u2019s executive committee last December, several hundred research assistants and graduate students from dozens of universities signed an open letter in Medium, an online magazine, pointing out that bad behaviour was \u201ctoo often an open secret among graduate students and junior faculty\u201d.\n\nSome have accused economists of being slow to tackle discrimination in their profession because of their conviction that market forces would drive it out. \u201cIt was more like benign neglect,\u201d says Ben Bernanke, a former head of the Federal Reserve and the AEA \u2019s president. \u201cNobody said we should prevent women from becoming economists. But there weren\u2019t a lot of people saying we should take affirmative steps to make it more accessible to a broader range of people.\u201d\n\nNow the AEA is taking action. Mr Bernanke, Olivier Blanchard (his predecessor as president) and Janet Yellen (his successor and another ex-head of the Fed) announced several measures with the survey\u2019s findings. The AEA will pay for an ombudsman to hear and record complaints about harassment and discrimination, and to provide advice. Members will vote on proposals to add teeth to an expanded code of conduct. Penalties for misbehaviour include ejection from the AEA \u2019s activities, termination of membership and a notification to an offender\u2019s employer. Retaliation against anyone filing a complaint can also invite disciplinary action.\n\nThis amounts to recognising that although economists may like to believe that their profession is a meritocracy, in which the best rise to the top, the reality is much murkier. As things stand, good work may be crushed along with the bad. And change would, if nothing else, make many economists happier. Ms Nagyp\u00e1l cannot say whether she would have stayed in a more supportive environment. But she knows that \u201cit would have been nice to try.\u201d"

As in other academic disciplines, success depends on peer review. A formal complaint against someone higher up the ladder invites retaliation. Your research may be trashed. Your chances of promotion may be blighted. If the perpetrator is at a different university, you may not even know who to complain to.\n\nThe potential for abuse of power starts early. There is a growing trend for young economists to work as research assistants to leading academics, as a pathway into prestigious P h D programmes. If the academic refuses to write them a good reference, their career may be over before it even starts. P h D students are just as reliant on their seniors. Success requires letters of recommendation, invitations to conferences, help with research ideas and perhaps joint research. In all these areas women were far likelier to report unfair treatment than men in the AEA \u2019s survey (see chart 2). Non-whites were also more likely to report it than whites.\n\nUnfair treatment can be unwitting. Senior professors may be unconsciously drawn to favour students who look like their younger selves. They may like chatting about work over a drink, which young women may find uncomfortable. One P h D student said she felt that female students found it harder to connect with male professors. She suspected that was partly due to unspoken worries about harassment.\n\nOn the job market, too, interviewees detected implicit bias. One senior woman recalled hearing statements such as \u201cHer paper is really good\u2014she works really hard\u201d alongside those like \u201cHis paper is OK but he\u2019s super-smart.\u201d Writers of recommendation letters may not take into account time off for child-rearing. Women may be held to higher standards in evaluations of their research. Two recent studies by Erin Hengel of the University of Liverpool found that their papers are more readable than those written by men and cited more often, suggesting a higher hurdle for publication. Heather Sarsons of the University of Toronto has found that women get a smaller boost than men in their chances of tenure from each paper they co-write.\n\nThen there is the style of seminars, for which economics is notorious. Interruptions and intense questioning are supposed to weed out errors and uncover sloppy thinking. And several interviewees told of supportive sub-fields and departments, where the primary purpose was not to tear down the speaker. But one said she felt like quitting after seeing how a female presenter was treated. Another economist reported being asked during a presentation whether she knew any economics, and being interrupted incessantly.\n\nEven if everyone gets the same treatment, minority groups (which in economics includes women) may find such an environment unpleasant. The P h D students we spoke to said they were put off by the seminar style. Among macroeconomists, whose field is both particularly short of women and infamous for bare-knuckled seminars, 40% of those responding to the AEA \u2019s survey felt \u201cdisrespected\u201d; among female macroeconomists, 70% did.\n\nChange will be slow. Assessments of young economists\u2019 potential will always be subjective to a degree. Some senior economists shudder, with justification, at the thought of sitting through a sloppy seminar in silence, and worry that a cuddlier environment will soften intellectual rigour.\n\nBut experimentation is happening. Some departments have begun to try different seminar styles, for example insisting that presenters should be allowed a minimum time to speak before being interrupted. Some have circulated reminders that people should raise a hand before asking a question, or be mindful of the time they are taking as they make their point.\n\nIdeas are circulating about ways to attract and support junior and female researchers. The most recent issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives contained a collection of papers on the determinants of women\u2019s success in P h D programmes and ways to \u201cmake economics work for women at every stage\u201d. One, by Leah Boustan and Andrew Langan of Princeton University, found that departments with better outcomes for junior women also hired more female faculty members, provided \u201ccollegial\u201d research seminars and were more aware of gender issues.\n\nAnother paper by Mr Langan, covering accounting, sociology and political science as well as economics, found that when women become department chairs, the female share of graduate students goes up with no deterioration in candidates\u2019 quality. Women in those departments also publish more papers and are likelier to get tenure. The difference may lie in female heads of department sharing out non-academic duties more fairly. Over 40% of the women in the AEA \u2019s survey reported being given a disproportionate load.\n\nYoung economists are also speaking out. Last year the New York Times reported that Roland Fryer, a prominent economist at Harvard, had been found by the university to have created a hostile work environment for research assistants in his laboratory, which he denies. After Mr Fryer resigned from the AEA \u2019s executive committee last December, several hundred research assistants and graduate students from dozens of universities signed an open letter in Medium, an online magazine, pointing out that bad behaviour was \u201ctoo often an open secret among graduate students and junior faculty\u201d.\n\nSome have accused economists of being slow to tackle discrimination in their profession because of their conviction that market forces would drive it out. \u201cIt was more like benign neglect,\u201d says Ben Bernanke, a former head of the Federal Reserve and the AEA \u2019s president. \u201cNobody said we should prevent women from becoming economists. But there weren\u2019t a lot of people saying we should take affirmative steps to make it more accessible to a broader range of people.\u201d\n\nNow the AEA is taking action. Mr Bernanke, Olivier Blanchard (his predecessor as president) and Janet Yellen (his successor and another ex-head of the Fed) announced several measures with the survey\u2019s findings. The AEA will pay for an ombudsman to hear and record complaints about harassment and discrimination, and to provide advice. Members will vote on proposals to add teeth to an expanded code of conduct. Penalties for misbehaviour include ejection from the AEA \u2019s activities, termination of membership and a notification to an offender\u2019s employer. Retaliation against anyone filing a complaint can also invite disciplinary action.\n\nThis amounts to recognising that although economists may like to believe that their profession is a meritocracy, in which the best rise to the top, the reality is much murkier. As things stand, good work may be crushed along with the bad. And change would, if nothing else, make many economists happier. Ms Nagyp\u00e1l cannot say whether she would have stayed in a more supportive environment. But she knows that \u201cit would have been nice to try.\u201d"

    "text": "\u201cIT WAS a complete and total exoneration!\u201d crowed Donald Trump on March 24th, shortly after his attorney-general released a four-page summary of Robert Mueller\u2019s findings. \u201cThis was an illegal takedown that failed.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s euphoria was understandable. After spending 22 months investigating the Russian campaign to rig the 2016 election in Mr Trump\u2019s favour, the special counsel did not find that the president had a case to answer. Yet nor did he exonerate him on all counts.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nFirst the good news for Mr Trump. On the most serious area of wrongdoing Mr Mueller considered, according to Attorney-General William Barr\u2019s summary, he \u201cdid not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in election interference activities.\u201d\n\nThat does not mean Mr Trump\u2019s campaign did not cooperate with the Russian effort. Over the course of Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation several apparent instances of cooperation have come to light. Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman\u2014who thanks to Mr Mueller is now serving a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence\u2014shared campaign polling data with an alleged Russian agent, for example. And it is possible that Mr Mueller found more such instances. Yet he clearly found no \u201csmoking-gun\u201d evidence that the Trump team were witting participants in the Russian plot. Their dealings with Russians, according to the summary, did not amount to a \u201cconspiracy\u201d or an \u201cagreement\u2014tacit or express...on election interference\u201d.\n\nIt will take a fuller disclosure of Mr Mueller\u2019s findings, which Mr Barr has promised, to ascertain quite how reassuring this conclusion is. But it is nonetheless a big win for the president. Despite the nagging caveats\u2014given his team\u2019s many lies, evasions and demonstrable openness to receiving Russian help\u2014it comes as close to corroborating the president\u2019s \u201cNO COLLUSION!!\u201d assertion as he could possibly have hoped.\n\nIt will not deter House Democrats from continuing their ongoing congressional probes into Mr Trump\u2019s affairs and Russia. Nor should it. Congressional oversight is different from special counsel investigations. It aims to provide a public reckoning of behaviour antithetical to the public interest, even when that does not rise to the level of criminality, the yardstick Mr Mueller was mandated to consider. And there remain many unanswered questions about Mr Trump\u2019s strange relationship with Russia (for example, why was it so keen to see him elected in the first place?) that it seems Mr Mueller either did not consider or has not resolved.\n\nNonetheless, the special counsel appears to have allayed the biggest fear of all: that America\u2019s sitting president was a traitorous accomplice to the Russia plot. Good as this is for Mr Trump, it is even better for America, and the Democrats\u2019 oversight effort should be guided by it. If Mr Mueller did not find a smoking gun, they should not expect to.\n\nThe other main part of Mr Mueller\u2019s inquiry was a closer run thing. Mr Barr\u2019s summary confirms that the special counsel looked into \u201ca number of actions by the president\u201d that might have constituted an illegal effort to obstruct investigations into the Russian plot. The main investigation, by the FBI, was handed over to Mr Mueller in part because of Mr Trump\u2019s decision to sack the bureau\u2019s then director, James Comey. That was one such action. The president\u2019s subsequent effort to sack Mr Mueller, whose investigation he dubbed a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d, perhaps constituted another.\n\nBoth steps looked bad for the president. Yet it was always moot whether they could be conclusively seen as obstruction, given that Mr Trump was empowered by his office to remove both men. Most legal experts think a president can be guilty of obstruction, even when exercising the legitimate powers of his office, if his motives are malign. And sacking Mr Comey in an effort to shut down the Russian investigation would certainly appear to fit that description.\n\nOther experts\u2014not insignificantly including Mr Barr\u2014maintained that a president could not be guilty of obstruction when acting within his legal powers. In the end Mr Mueller, mindful of this thorny legal disagreement, decided not to try to settle it.\n\nAccording to the attorney-general\u2019s summary of his conclusions, he relayed his findings on Mr Trump\u2019s dubious actions without concluding whether or not they constituted clinching evidence of obstruction. Instead Mr Mueller provided arguments on both sides of the question. According to Mr Barr, \u201cthe special counsel states that \u2018while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it does not exonerate him either.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe attorney-general\u2014who last month returned to the helm of the Justice Department, having previously run it for George H. W. Bush\u2014took it upon himself to settle the matter. He and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, duly concluded that the evidence provided by Mr Mueller was not sufficient to \u201cestablish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offence.\u201d Given Mr Barr\u2019s afore-stated views, this was not terribly surprising. Though the attorney-general in fact offered a different argument in support of their finding. As Mr Mueller had not found the president to be engaged in a conspiracy with Russia, Mr Barr argued, it would be hard to establish that Mr Trump\u2019s quasi-obstructive exercise of his powers was ill-intended.\n\nThat might sound like a stretch. The many dodgy ties between Mr Trump and Russia, and his and his associates\u2019 record of lying about them, suggested he had highly questionable motives\u2014short of a grand election-rigging conspiracy\u2014to shut the Russia probe down. In any event, Mr Trump\u2019s opponents will home in on the implication that Mr Mueller provided evidence of obstruction, which he felt unable to exonerate the president on, notwithstanding the legal arguments in favour of doing so. The Democrats will now fight to obtain the details of Mr Mueller\u2019s reporting on this issue.\n\nThat battle will shortly take on a political life of its own. In his summary Mr Barr reiterated that, \u201cmindful of the public interest in this matter\u201d, he hoped to make as much of the special counsel\u2019s report public as he could, \u201cconsistent with applicable law, regulations, and departmental policies.\u201d Yet that could keep a lot of Mr Mueller\u2019s report under wraps.\n\nMr Barr noted a provision against disclosure of information brought before a grand jury, which Mr Mueller made heavy use of. He also noted his need to protect material relevant to ongoing investigations, of which Mr Mueller has sparked several, notably including one by the US attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York that is looking into various aspects of Mr Trump\u2019s affairs. Democrats who feel bruised by Mr Mueller\u2019s failure to hang the president will console themselves by getting stuck into the new fight with Mr Barr over disclosure.\n\nBut they should not feel bruised. The notion that the special counsel was about to take down Mr Trump has long owed more to feverish Democratic imaginations than reality. The reams of evidence the special counsel has already made public, in hundreds of pages of court filings, did not point to a grand conspiracy between the Trump team and Russian agents. The obstruction case looked hard to prove.\n\nIf anything, the heavy burden of proof the special counsel was labouring under made his investigation look like a distraction from the more salient political questions surrounding Mr Trump\u2019s dealings with Russia. For example: do American voters think it acceptable that their president continues to deny the existence of an attack on their democracy by a hostile power, which he has consistently lied about his links to, may owe his job to, and which he has done hardly anything to deter from continuing its assault?\n\nDemocrats might also feel Mr Mueller has done them a tactical favour. A more damning report on Mr Trump, including a clear allegation of criminality, would have made it hard for them to avoid impeaching him. Yet that course of action has always looked like a hiding to nothing. Protected by his party, Mr Trump almost certainly could not be removed by impeachment proceedings, and might well be strengthened by a failed effort. Democratic leaders know this perfectly well. Despite well-publicised calls for Mr Trump\u2019s impeachment from a few hotheads, most Democrats in Congress are against it.\n\nThe best they could have hoped for from Mr Mueller was therefore a report that justified their continuing oversight operations against Mr Trump, without forcing them to impeach him. The special counsel appears to have delivered something close to that.\n\nIn a more abstract sense, indeed, his report appears almost as a rebuke to those who look to the law to solve political problems. Mr Mueller would not put it like this: the celebrated prosecutor is too fastidious and discreet. Yet his conclusions, in so far as Mr Barr has represented them accurately, appear to have added a few important embellishments to the Trump saga, and then kicked it back into the political realm where it belongs. Voters, not prosecutors, will ultimately decide whether Mr Trump is fit to occupy the White House. That is as it should be.\n\nFurther reading: Our background briefing on the Mueller report"

    "text": "W HEN THE new Jawa motorcycle was unveiled last November, two years after the once-popular two-wheeler\u2019s return to India was first revealed, its website crashed. Millions of Indian motorheads wanted to catch a glimpse of the original Czechoslovak design reimagined for the 21st century. An undisclosed (but modest) number of online orders were later filled in an instant.\n\nThis triumphant return is the latest in a series of Jawa\u2019s stops and starts, which mirror India\u2019s post-independence economic development. In the 1950s then-high-tech motorcycles were imported from Czechoslovakia. A decade later steep tariffs forced production to move to India, and then, in 1971, further restrictions on foreign products prompted it to be renamed Yezdi. The 1980s ushered in efficient Japanese-led joint ventures, boosted from 1991 by liberalisation. These, together with Royal Enfield, a colonial-era brand with a cult following which has been in Indian hands since the 1950s, outcompeted Jawa, which was also under pressure at home in Europe from a botched nationalisation (and the fission of Czechoslovakia in 1993). The last Yezdi left the firm\u2019s factory in Mysore in 1996.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nJawa\u2019s swift resurrection reflects how Indian business has changed since the Licence Raj. In 2015 Anupam Thareja, a former director of Royal Enfield, forged a joint venture with Anand Mahindra, who heads a family-controlled conglomerate. Mahindra & Mahindra makes tractors, cars and scooters but has lagged behind in motorcycles. Jawa, whose brand rights in India the petrolhead investors had purchased, offered an inroad to the premium segment. Fancier models\u2014with bigger engines and a price tag of 200,000 rupees ($2,900) or so\u2014account for most of the profits in India\u2019s two-wheeler market, which is approaching 20m units a year. A recent slide in the fortunes of Royal Enfield\u2019s parent, Eicher Motors, left an opening.\n\nJawa\u2019s long-term prospects depend on harnessing nostalgia while eradicating performance flaws. Fiat 500 and MiniCooper prove that rebooting iconic vehicles is possible; Volkswagen\u2019s unloved new Beetle shows how it can misfire. Overwhelming demand suggests Jawa ticks the sentimental box. Mr Thareja promises that the new model goes faster and burns greener than the original. Mahindra\u2019s nationwide network should help with parts and servicing.\n\nYet the reboot also shows that India\u2019s ride to a free-market paradise is incomplete. After enterprising types created an independent auction site for the coveted online purchase rights, Jawa made them non-transferable. Jawa lovers must instead deposit 5,000 rupees with one of 100 dealers\u2014and hope for a call."

    "text": "I N THE DAYS of pre-internet capitalism the troubles of one dominant company in an industry tended to be good news for its rivals. In today\u2019s hyperconnected world a threatened ban by Western governments of Huawei, the Chinese market leader in telecoms gear, is also a worry for its competitors. Both Ericsson, a Swedish company, and Nokia, a Finnish one, would prefer the geopolitical saga to end, the better to focus on competing for contracts related to the launch of super-speedy \u201cfifth generation\u201d (5 G ) mobile-phone networks.\n\nThe American government is not letting up its campaign to persuade allies to freeze Huawei out of 5 G tenders. It worries that Huawei\u2019s kit may contain \u201cback doors\u201d\u2014deliberate security flaws inserted to allow Chinese spooks eavesdrop on, or attack, phone networks. Earlier this month, in a letter to Germany\u2019s economics minister, America\u2019s envoy to Berlin, Richard Grenell, threatened to cut back American co-operation with German security agencies if the country allowed Huawei or other Chinese firms to participate in the roll-out of 5 G . Mike Pompeo, America\u2019s secretary of state, suggested in Hungary recently that doing business with Huawei could tip decisions on where America stations troops.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nSo far Britain and Germany, among others, have not yielded to American demands. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said on March 19th that she does not believe in excluding a company from the German market \u201csimply because it\u2019s from a certain country\u201d, though a final decision is pending. Even if America prevailed in Europe, as it has in Australia and Japan, Ericsson and Nokia are unlikely to win back much of the market they have lost in recent years. Between 2015 and 2018 Huawei\u2019s share rose from 24% to 28%; Nokia\u2019s dipped from 20% to 17% and Ericsson\u2019s from 15% to 13%. An escalation in the war on Huawei might prompt Beijing to retaliate by kicking Western firms out of China.\n\nThat would be a blow to the Nordic duo. China accounted for 10% of Ericsson\u2019s 211bn krona ($24.2bn) in global sales last year. The company runs two research and development sites in China. Nokia derives a similar share of revenues from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Extra sales in Europe in the event of a Huawei ban would not offset losses in China, argues Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research, not least because the Chinese will launch 5 G a year or two earlier.\n\nMore important, worries B\u00f6rje Ekholm, chief executive of Ericsson, a ban on Huawei would slow down the launch of 5 G in Europe. The continent is already lagging three to four years behind America in 4 G , the current generation of wireless technology, he says. Uncertainty over regulation, pricing and, most of all, how to deal with Huawei, is likely to slow Europe down further. European operators are lobbying hard to maintain the choice between three purveyors; many prefer Huawei wares, which are often cheaper (and some say better).\n\nThe spectre of a Huawei ban is putting a damper on Germany\u2019s auction for 5 G mobile spectrum that kicked off on March 18th in Mainz. The auction, which drew four big operators, is expected to last several weeks. All four bidders already make extensive use of Huawei hardware, such as antennae or routers. Upgrading to 5 G will require splurging on new kit. Huawei wants to be one of their principal suppliers (though it may first need to meet more stringent security requirements which the German government is mulling). In November the Chinese company opened a lab in Bonn, the base of Germany\u2019s cyber-security regulator, where its equipment can be tested.\n\nThough it is possible to ban Huawei completely from Europe, its biggest market outside of China, industry insiders warn that it would be hugely complex and costly. It would be especially disruptive in countries where Huawei is deeply embedded, such as Italy, Poland and Britain, says St\u00e9phane T\u00e9ral of IHS Markit, a research firm. With only a hint of hyperbole Bengt Nordstrom of Northstream, a consultancy, likens the resulting shock to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Most of Europe\u2019s roughly 200 operators of mobile networks use Huawei\u2019s 4 G gear."

      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "T HE MANTRA of the Arab spring is back. \u201cThe people want the regime to go,\u201d chant hundreds of thousands of protesters in Algeria, hoping to end the 20-year rule of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Their cries are echoed in Sudan, where three months of demonstrations have rattled the regime of Omar al-Bashir, the leader for three decades. Protesters in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia and the Palestinian territories have also demanded better governance of late. Five years after the region\u2019s authoritarians silenced it, the Arab street is regaining its voice.\n\nThis has prompted talk of an Arab-spring sequel. As in 2011, the protests have been spontaneous, inclusive and bereft of leadership. The same grievances fuel today\u2019s unrest. But the context could not be more different. The wars and chaos that followed the Arab spring have cooled the ardour of activists and their regional patrons. Meanwhile, autocrats have sharpened their tools of repression in order to quash protests at home and stop those elsewhere from spreading. \u201cThey have rewired the entire region trying to prevent another Arab spring,\u201d says Marc Lynch of George Washington University.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nTurkey, Iran and Qatar helped spread the contagion in 2011, but their regional ambitions have taken a back seat to their own security concerns. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan tightened his grip in Turkey after protests in 2013 and an attempted coup three years later. The Islamist-leaning democratic model he once touted increasingly resembles the authoritarianism he lampooned. Iran\u2019s leaders were eager to fan the flames of the Arab spring\u2014until it threatened to burn their ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. They, too, are now rocked by protests at home. Qatar, though, has performed the biggest turnabout. Under siege by its neighbours, it needs all the friends it can buy. It hosted Mr Bashir in February and has kept mum on Algeria\u2019s troubles.\n\nEight years ago Al Jazeera, the Qatari satellite television network, was the Arab spring\u2019s soapbox. With rolling coverage and rousing promos, it egged on national protests and created a region-wide narrative. But its coverage of the upheaval in Algeria and Sudan, the Arab world\u2019s second and third most populous countries, has been paltry. Anchors depict the protests as isolated events on the periphery of the Arab world. Some highlight Algeria\u2019s linguistic peculiarities. (Its dialect is incomprehensible to many Arabs.) \u201cThey\u2019re deliberately disconnecting the dots,\u201d says Ahmed Mustafa, a monitor of Arab media in Abu Dhabi.\n\nDespots who fought change all along have cracked down on independent media. Information ministries dictate headlines, ban foreign journalists and harass local ones who don\u2019t co-operate. Investigative reporters and those who are critical of regimes are often denounced in state media as terrorists and traitors. Some are tortured. Saudi Arabia has established a \u201crapid intervention group\u201d to pursue those who flee, such as Jamal Khashoggi, a former Saudi newspaper editor, who was murdered and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe digital duel\n\nSocial media, the dynamo of the Arab spring, still bring crowds onto the streets. Algeria has one of the region\u2019s highest rates of Facebook usage coupled with perhaps its least technologically savvy regime. \u201cIts lack of knowledge left an empty space,\u201d says Ashraf Zeitoon, who ran Facebook\u2019s policy unit in the region. Still, there are no catchy hashtags linking the protests in different countries, and sharper autocrats have turned social media to their advantage. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have built troll farms (office blocks full of nerds feeding hundreds of fake social-media accounts) and bots (automated regurgitators) to spread official talking points. Intimidation, through spyware, hacking, abusive comments or simply arrest, reduces opposing messages.\n\nGovernments have also stepped up their old-fashioned repression. On the eve of Algeria\u2019s largest protest, Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, warned against copycat \u201criots\u201d. A politician in Bahrain was recently sentenced to six months in prison for calling on Mr Bashir to step down. Many countries have outright bans on large gatherings, while vaguely worded security laws enacted after the Arab spring allow governments to round up potential rabble-rousers. \u201cThe use of live ammunition even against small, symbolic protests has effectively reduced dissent to zero,\u201d says Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch, a pressure group.\n\nBeing less connected is not necessarily a bad thing for today\u2019s protesters. Those in Algeria and Sudan pride themselves on their independence and nationalism. For now, at least, they are displaying discipline and rejecting violence. \u201cWe\u2019re not Syria or Libya,\u201d they chant in Algeria, while self-interested leaders warn of chaos and bloodshed. The protesters show no sign of going home. Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank in London, doubts that they can be made to: \u201cThe ebb and flow of street protest is the region\u2019s new normal.\u201d"

    "text": "I N THE DAYS of pre-internet capitalism the troubles of one dominant company in an industry tended to be good news for its rivals. In today\u2019s hyperconnected world a threatened ban by Western governments of Huawei, the Chinese market leader in telecoms gear, is also a worry for its competitors. Both Ericsson, a Swedish company, and Nokia, a Finnish one, would prefer the geopolitical saga to end, the better to focus on competing for contracts related to the launch of super-speedy \u201cfifth generation\u201d (5 G ) mobile-phone networks.\n\nThe American government is not letting up its campaign to persuade allies to freeze Huawei out of 5 G tenders. It worries that Huawei\u2019s kit may contain \u201cback doors\u201d\u2014deliberate security flaws inserted to allow Chinese spooks eavesdrop on, or attack, phone networks. Earlier this month, in a letter to Germany\u2019s economics minister, America\u2019s envoy to Berlin, Richard Grenell, threatened to cut back American co-operation with German security agencies if the country allowed Huawei or other Chinese firms to participate in the roll-out of 5 G . Mike Pompeo, America\u2019s secretary of state, suggested in Hungary recently that doing business with Huawei could tip decisions on where America stations troops.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nSo far Britain and Germany, among others, have not yielded to American demands. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said on March 19th that she does not believe in excluding a company from the German market \u201csimply because it\u2019s from a certain country\u201d, though a final decision is pending. Even if America prevailed in Europe, as it has in Australia and Japan, Ericsson and Nokia are unlikely to win back much of the market they have lost in recent years. Between 2015 and 2018 Huawei\u2019s share rose from 24% to 28%; Nokia\u2019s dipped from 20% to 17% and Ericsson\u2019s from 15% to 13%. An escalation in the war on Huawei might prompt Beijing to retaliate by kicking Western firms out of China.\n\nThat would be a blow to the Nordic duo. China accounted for 10% of Ericsson\u2019s 211bn krona ($24.2bn) in global sales last year. The company runs two research and development sites in China. Nokia derives a similar share of revenues from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Extra sales in Europe in the event of a Huawei ban would not offset losses in China, argues Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research, not least because the Chinese will launch 5 G a year or two earlier.\n\nMore important, worries B\u00f6rje Ekholm, chief executive of Ericsson, a ban on Huawei would slow down the launch of 5 G in Europe. The continent is already lagging three to four years behind America in 4 G , the current generation of wireless technology, he says. Uncertainty over regulation, pricing and, most of all, how to deal with Huawei, is likely to slow Europe down further. European operators are lobbying hard to maintain the choice between three purveyors; many prefer Huawei wares, which are often cheaper (and some say better).\n\nThe spectre of a Huawei ban is putting a damper on Germany\u2019s auction for 5 G mobile spectrum that kicked off on March 18th in Mainz. The auction, which drew four big operators, is expected to last several weeks. All four bidders already make extensive use of Huawei hardware, such as antennae or routers. Upgrading to 5 G will require splurging on new kit. Huawei wants to be one of their principal suppliers (though it may first need to meet more stringent security requirements which the German government is mulling). In November the Chinese company opened a lab in Bonn, the base of Germany\u2019s cyber-security regulator, where its equipment can be tested.\n\nThough it is possible to ban Huawei completely from Europe, its biggest market outside of China, industry insiders warn that it would be hugely complex and costly. It would be especially disruptive in countries where Huawei is deeply embedded, such as Italy, Poland and Britain, says St\u00e9phane T\u00e9ral of IHS Markit, a research firm. With only a hint of hyperbole Bengt Nordstrom of Northstream, a consultancy, likens the resulting shock to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Most of Europe\u2019s roughly 200 operators of mobile networks use Huawei\u2019s 4 G gear."

    "text": "S O MUCH FOR the sepulchral calm of a German Sunday. On March 17th, after months of prodding from the German government and chatter in the financial press, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s two largest listed lenders, said that they would begin exploring a merger.\n\nA deal, both banks are at pains to add, is far from certain. If it happens, it would create Europe\u2019s third-biggest bank by assets, behind Britain\u2019s HSBC (which does most of its business in Asia) and France\u2019s BNP Paribas. It would also join together two chronic underperformers. Last year Deutsche\u2019s return on equity, a puny 0.4%, was its first positive figure for four years. Commerzbank\u2019s has bettered last year\u2019s anaemic 3% only once since 2011.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nCombining two struggling banks looks like an improbable method of creating the robust \u201cnational champion\u201d of which German ministers have been dreaming. Years of ultra-low interest rates and an overcrowded banking market\u2014most of which is served by public-sector and co-operative lenders\u2014have sapped profitability, even though both Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank are well capitalised and amply liquid. A merger is unlikely to change that.\n\nEncouragement from Berlin alone is not\u2014or should not be\u2014reason to merge, although the government is Commerzbank\u2019s biggest shareholder, with 15%. The right gauge is what all the shareholders of both banks would stand to lose or gain. You might suppose that Deutsche\u2019s should be keen on a fresh start. Its fall from grace since the financial crisis is a cautionary tale often told: its share price has fallen by 90% since 2007; not until 2015 did it accept that its global moneymaking machine, aka its investment bank, was kaputt; it is on its fourth chief executive in as many years; and so on. But its smaller neighbour may have the better (or rather, less bad) end of the bargain.\n\nTo both banks, a merger brings the promise of scale, especially in retail banking. Deutsche\u2019s share of the German market\u2014adding its upmarket \u201cblue\u201d Deutsche Bank brand to the more basic Postbank\u2014is around 11%, according to Autonomous Research; Commerzbank\u2019s is 8%. With one-fifth of the market, a combined entity would be by far the biggest in Germany, maybe enough to exert some pricing power. Cutting costs\u2014for instance by closing branches\u2014might take out 30% of Commerzbank\u2019s cost base, according to Magdalena Stoklosa of Morgan Stanley.\n\nShould the pair come to talking about takeover terms, Commerzbank\u2019s bargaining position looks far stronger than it could have dreamed of a few years ago. Neither bank can be called highly valued: the stockmarket prices Deutsche at a paltry 24% of net book value and Commerzbank at 31%. But so far has Deutsche fallen that its market capitalisation is now just twice Commerzbank\u2019s, against six times as much in 2013 (see chart). Even taking into account Deutsche\u2019s talent for attracting trouble, for Commerzbank the ratio may not get better than this.\n\nBesides extra bulk and the chance to serve more of the Mittelstand\u2014Germany\u2019s myriad, mainly family-owned, companies\u2014Commerzbank offers Deutsche improved funding. Commerzbank relies more than Deutsche on deposits, which are cheaper and stickier than funds from financial markets. Its \u20ac311bn ($363bn) of deposits at the end of September were worth 63% of its adjusted assets; Deutsche\u2019s \u20ac553bn, 52%. So deep have been Deutsche\u2019s woes that for most of the past three years its five-year credit-default-swap spreads\u2014the cost of insurance against its failure to honour a bond\u2014have been wider, often by half a percentage point or more, than those of the smaller bank. Last month it sold bonds at steepish yields.\n\nAlthough a merged bank would have more heft at home, it is hard to see what a takeover could do to restore Deutsche\u2019s fortunes as a global investment bank. Having wisely given up its own international investment-banking ambitions, Commerzbank has little to offer. Admittedly, Deutsche is not alone: since 2012, notes a new report by Morgan Stanley, European investment banks have lost nine percentage points of market share in America, while Wall Street firms have gained the same amount in Europe. Though Deutsche is still Europe\u2019s biggest, as well as its homeland\u2019s flag-bearer, it will need more than a merger to patch its tattered standard."

    "text": "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nP HILOSOPHERS FROM Aristotle to the Beatles have argued that money does not buy happiness. But it seems to help. Since 2005 Gallup, a pollster, has asked a representative sample of adults from countries across the world to rate their life satisfaction on a scale from zero to ten. The headline result is clear: the richer the country, on average, the higher the level of self-reported happiness. The simple correlation suggests that doubling GDP per person lifts life satisfaction by about 0.7 points.\n\nYet the prediction that as a country gets richer its mood will improve has a dubious record. In 1974 Richard Easterlin, an economist, discovered that average life satisfaction in America had stagnated between 1946 and 1970 even as GDP per person had grown by 65% over the same period. He went on to find a similar disconnect in other places, too. Although income is correlated with happiness when looking across countries\u2014and although economic downturns are reliable sources of temporary misery\u2014long-term GDP growth does not seem to be enough to turn the average frown upside-down.\n\nThe \u201cEasterlin paradox\u201d has been hotly disputed since, with some economists claiming to find a link between growth and rising happiness by using better quality data. On March 20th the latest Gallup data were presented in the World Happiness Report, an annual UN-backed study. The new data provide some ammunition for both sides of the debate but, on the whole, suggest that the paradox is alive and well.\n\nThere are important examples of national income and happiness rising and falling together. The most significant\u2014in terms of population\u2014is China, where GDP per person has doubled over a decade, while average happiness has risen by 0.43 points. Among rich countries Germany enjoys higher incomes and greater cheer than ten years ago. Venezuela, once the fifth-happiest country in the world, has become miserable as its economy has collapsed. Looking across countries, growth is correlated with rising happiness.\n\nYet that correlation is very weak. Of the 125 countries for which good data exist, 43 have seen GDP per person and happiness move in opposite directions. Like China, India is a populous developing economy that is growing quickly. But happiness is down by about 1.2 points in the past decade. America, the subject of Easterlin\u2019s initial study, has again seen happiness fall as the economy has grown. In total the world\u2019s population looks roughly equally divided between places where happiness and incomes have moved in the same direction over the past ten years, and places where they have diverged.\n\nSources: World Happiness Report, by John Helliwell, Richard Layard & Jeffrey Sachs (eds), UN, 2019; World Bank\n\nGet the data"

    "title": "Why white nationalist terrorism is a global threat",
    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "H E SEEMS to have been a classic \u201clone wolf\u201d. As far as police can tell, the man who murdered 50 worshippers, and critically wounded nine more, at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15th was not part of any organisation. The 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, claimed to have developed his violent beliefs on his own, surfing the internet and visiting Europe. He bought his weapons himself. He honed his skills at a suburban shooting-range. No one there suspected that he was preparing a massacre.\n\nYet he was part of something much bigger. The names and slogans scrawled on his weapons were familiar to extreme white nationalists all around the world\u2014but hardly anyone else. His ranting internet manifesto, \u201cThe Great Replacement\u201d, repeated a staple far-right conspiracy theory: that non-white and Muslim immigrants in Western countries are invaders, ushered in by scheming elites to replace ethnic-European populations. Variants of that once-fringe idea are now common, not just in social-media posts by anonymous wackos but in the speeches of elected politicians from Hungary to Iowa.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn another sense, too, the lone wolf had a pack. Attacks by neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other extreme-right types are growing more common. In America they outnumber those committed by Islamists. Of 263 domestic terrorism incidents in 2010-17, fully 92 were carried out by far-right attackers, compared with 38 by jihadists, according to an analysis of the Global Terrorism Database by the Washington Post. In Europe jihadist killings still predominate, but deaths from extreme-right terrorism have surged since 2010 (see chart).\n\nThe past six months have seen a rash of far-right terrorist incidents. Last autumn a white nationalist killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. France broke up a plot to kill Emmanuel Macron, the president, and Spain arrested a fascist hoping to assassinate Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the prime minister. Germany uncovered an extremist cell in the army, allegedly planning to kill the foreign minister and others. In February America\u2019s FBI arrested a Coast Guard officer who had an arsenal and a target-list of Democratic politicians.\n\nGlobally, white-nationalist terrorism is far less deadly than the jihadist variety. But it is more prevalent than authorities acknowledge, says Jacob Aasland Ravndal of Norway\u2019s Centre for Research on Extremism. Legal definitions of terrorism often require that an attack be planned in advance. Much extreme-right violence is spontaneous. Even burning down a refugee centre may count as a hate crime, not terrorism. Europol, the EU \u2019s law-enforcement agency, ascribed just 3% of terrorist attacks in 2017 to the far right. But Mr Ravndal\u2019s database of ideologically motivated violent incidents shows that in western Europe, though jihadists kill more people, the far right carry out more attacks.\n\nMore right than they know\n\nIf the threat from white nationalists is underestimated, that is partly because they are more publicity-shy. Mr Tarrant and his hero, Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011, were exceptions. They left manifestos and tried to maximise media exposure. Indeed, the Christchurch killer also resembled sophisticated jihadist outfits, both in the ostentatious cruelty of his crime and in his hope that it would polarise society, fuelling yet more extremism.\n\nThe Breivik tradition\n\nIslamic State tries to provoke the West into persecuting Muslims and thus driving sympathisers from the \u201cgrey zone\u201d towards radical participation. Right-wing extremists may also hope to provoke an Islamist backlash. Police are investigating a possible terrorist motive behind the murder of three people on a tram in Utrecht in the Netherlands, three days after the massacre in Christchurch. A Turkish-born suspect has been arrested.\n\nIn Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has seized on the attack in Christchurch as evidence of a broad conspiracy against Turkey and Islam. He has quoted from the killer\u2019s manifesto, which includes calls to expel Turks from Europe and to kill Mr Erdogan. The president\u2019s not-so-subtle message is that only he can protect Turks from rampant white nationalism.\n\nThe Christchurch killer also hoped to provoke stricter gun laws, so that gun-owners would rise up in revolt. There is not much chance of more gun control in America, Mr Tarrant\u2019s primary target. However, Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, is moving to tighten her country\u2019s lax gun laws. This will not start a civil war. New Zealand prides itself on multiculturalism (see article). Its politics are more moderate than Australia\u2019s.\n\nThat, along with its easy gun laws, may have been why Mr Tarrant picked New Zealand. He wrote that he wanted to prove that nowhere was safe. Muslims in Christchurch have lost all sense of security. Tofazzal Alam, who survived the attack, says he is now afraid \u201cto go to mosque, afraid of any crowd, afraid even to open the door\u201d.\n\nYet the killer\u2019s manifesto was inspired by events far away in Europe. He claimed he was converted to radical-right ideology on a trip to France in 2017, when he saw how much of the population was Muslim. He decorated his flak jacket with a \u201cblack sun\u201d, a symbol traced to a floor motif used in his castle by Heinrich Himmler, a Nazi leader. He decorated his weapons with the names of victims of jihadist attacks in Stockholm and Paris. Before the shootings, he listened in his car to \u201cGod is a Serb\u201d, a song written in 1993 in support of Radovan Karadzic\u2014a Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide for his role in the massacre of 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995.\n\nThe idea that Muslims and non-whites are \u201cinvaders\u201d imported by a cosmopolitan elite to replace ethnic Europeans has its roots in thinkers of the French \u201cnew right\u201d of the 1970s, such as Alain de Benoist and Renaud Camus. It is often linked to the belief that multicultural societies, far from promoting diversity, extinguish it by mixing distinct cultures and races together. The nuttiest apostles of such notions equate immigration with genocide.\n\nThese ideas attracted the anti-Muslim populist politicians who sprung up across Europe around the turn of the millennium, especially after the September 11th attacks in America. They inspired the far-right youth network Generation Identity. But the big impetus came in 2015-16, when some 2m asylum-seekers, mostly from the Middle East, poured into Europe.\n\nFor right-wing populists, this crisis was a godsend. Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, built a fence against the migrants and began calling himself a defender of Christian Europe. A frenzied opposition to Muslim immigration (real or imaginary) is the lodestar of populist-right parties in Germany, Poland, Sweden and Italy. At the European Parliament this month, Javier Ortega Smith of Vox, a new far-right Spanish party, thundered that had Spanish and Venetian fleets not won the battle of Lepanto against the Turks in 1571, every female MEP \u201cwould be wearing a burqa\u201d.\n\nDaniel Koehler of the German Institute on Radicalisation and De-radicalisation Studies says that it is no coincidence that extreme-right violence jumped during the migrant crisis, along with the fortunes of far-right parties: \u201cIf you think you have \u2026to protect against \u2018invaders\u2019\u2014how do you do that without using force?\u201d\n\nIn America, too, the rise in extreme-right violence is linked to mainstream politics. Between 2009 and 2018, white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists. In 2016, the year Donald Trump won the presidency, more anti-Muslim assaults were reported to the FBI (127) than in any year since 2001 (93).\n\nSuch attacks rose steeply after Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008. Daryl Johnson, who spent 15 years studying right-wing terrorist groups, including at the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ), wrote a paper in 2009 warning that the arrival that year of a black person in the White House could spark far-right violence. Demonised by conservatives for this, he left the DHS in 2010. Today, he says, it has no experts in right-wing terrorism. A spokesman did not deny this, but, in an email, said that the DHS is \u201ccommitted to combating all forms of violent extremism, especially those that espouse racial supremacy or bigotry\u201d.\n\nIn denial\n\nMr Trump has played down the threat of right-wing extremists, calling them \u201ca small group of people that have very, very serious problems\u201d. In 2017 his administration cancelled grants to groups combating white-supremacism. Peter Singer, a cyber-security expert at the New America Foundation who was invited to speak to Mr Trump\u2019s national-security staff that year, said that they dismissed white-supremacist terrorism as \u201ca law-enforcement issue\u201d, and denied that it is transnational.\n\nIn fact, the ties between American and European extreme-right groups are ever closer. Europe\u2019s Generation Identity groups are linked to Identity Evropa, one of the the American far-right organisations that planned a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, where a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd and killed a counter-protester. Marchers at that rally chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d, referring to the same \u201cgreat replacement\u201d thesis shared by European extremists and the Christchurch killer.\n\nMr Trump has played the role for American white nationalists that such leaders as Mr Orban played for Europe\u2019s, says Brian Levin, who heads the Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. These groups, he says, saw their ideas, such as building a wall like Mr Orban\u2019s, and banning or deporting Muslims, \u201cgetting into the mainstream tent\u201d. They took this as a \u201cgreen light\u201d for violence. And he notes that, like the young on Europe\u2019s extremist right, they have softened their image in the past decade. Shaved heads and combat boots have given way to army haircuts, polo shirts and corduroy jackets.\n\nFar-right groups lack the state sponsors and safe havens enjoyed by some jihadists. Many on the extreme right admire Russia but it does not fit the bill. It has cultivated ties with far-right parties in Europe, but has snuffed out extremists at home. In the 2000s hate-motivated attacks, often directed at immigrants and internal migrants from the north Caucasus, reached nearly 700 a year, as the state flirted with nationalist movements. Clashes in Moscow in 2011 between police and far-right groups mixed with football hooligans showed the dangers of tolerating the ultranationalists. After they joined anti-government protests in 2011-12, the state began shutting them down, detaining the most violent. In 2014 war with Ukraine split the movement into pro-government and pro-Ukrainian factions. The SOVA Centre, an independent monitor, recorded just 57 hate-motivated attacks in 2018.\n\nThe Ukrainian model\n\nOther Western white nationalists look to Ukraine itself, a hotbed of far-right activity since the Maidan uprising in 2014. Quasi-fascist militias, such as the Azov Battalion, have fought Russia in the east and taken a role in policing. So Kiev is \u201ca place of attraction for the global far-right\u201d, says Anton Shekhovtsov, of the University of Vienna. Some European radicals have joined Ukrainians on the front lines. American white supremacists have been spotted in Kiev. But as Mr Shekhovtsov puts it, \u201cmigration is a first-world problem\u201d, and, whereas earlier far-right groups would beat up foreigners from Africa and Asia, Azov is keener on disrupting gay-pride marches. In any case, Ukrainian men seeking romantic violence have plenty to do in the east.\n\nA more pressing concern for Western governments is far-right radicalism within their armed forces. Soldiers, obviously, are trained and have access to weapons. In America the DHS warned a decade ago that right-wing extremists will attempt to \u201crecruit and radicalise\u201d veterans, recalling the terrorist attacks of the 1990s by bitter ex-soldiers, such as the Oklahoma City bombing. A study of 119 lone-actor terrorists across America and Europe since 1990 found that 26% had done military service.\n\nRacial tension is rising in the armed services. A recent poll by Military Times, a newspaper, found that over half of non-white American service members had suffered racism in 2018, up from 42% in the previous year. In 2017 two marines were arrested for hanging a white-supremacist banner on a building in North Carolina. On March 18th the Huffington Post, a news website, identified seven serving American soldiers as active in Identity Evropa.\n\nThe German authorities are investigating some 450 cases of suspected right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr. Last year the security services identified dozens of police and soldiers as members of Reichsb\u00fcrger, a far-right movement. In Britain in September 2017 four soldiers were arrested for membership of National Action, a banned neo-Nazi group. \u201cIf we get enough of us into the Army,\u201d suggested one, \u201cwe\u2019ll be in the right place when things start to collapse.\u201d\n\nArmies are tightening their vetting procedures and becoming more vigilant. They insist that adherence to law is drilled into recruits. But, for good reason, most armed forces are prohibited from conducting political education.\n\nTracking sources of danger is hard because, as Mr Koehler, the German scholar, points out, far-right violence typically involves loose groups of individuals radicalised on social media. He calls this \u201chive terrorism\u201d. It is practically impossible to predict when someone will go from wishing others dead to actually killing them.\n\nThe Christchurch killer is a perfect example. He spent time on 8chan, a messageboard that prides itself on allowing users to post anything not illegal under American law. (After the attack, its administrators said they would co-operate with police.) It concerns itself with everything from Japanese cartoons to role-playing games. Anonymous posting is the norm.\n\nThe board\u2019s \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d subsections are far-right haunts. Their culture is a self-consciously puerile mishmash of memes, absurdism and irony, making it hard to know how seriously to take anything posted there. When Mr Tarrant declared on 8chan that he was about to commit murder, and proceeded to live-stream it on Facebook, many replies expressed surprise (often pleased) that the promised shooting spree was actually happening.\n\nThe killer\u2019s manifesto, too, is steeped in 8chan-like irony, a style sometimes termed \u201cshitposting\u201d. Serious rants about low European birth-rates alternate with claims to have been radicalised by \u201cSpyro the Dragon 3\u201d, a children\u2019s video game. If the media took such claims seriously, they would prove their own cluelessness.\n\nSince the attacks, there have been calls for internet platforms to do a better job of restricting violent right-wing content. Facebook has been blamed for letting the live-stream of the attack go on for 17 minutes. The platform says it began vigorously blocking the video as soon as it discovered it, removing 1.5m attempts to repost it. But internet users could still find copies hours after the attack. (It did not help that some \u201cmainstream\u201d media sites\u2014and even Mr Erdogan\u2014used some of it.)\n\nBig internet platforms could do more, but they face a gargantuan task. The underlying problem, says Ben Nimmo of the Oxford Internet Institute, is that \u201cradicalising content is not constant\u201d\u2014one viewer\u2019s trigger to violence is another\u2019s harmless satire. Hopes that artificial intelligence might do much of the filtering have not worked out; armies of human reviewers are still needed, and even they often err.\n\nHowever hard it is to stop terrorists exploiting the internet, other citizens can, at least, refuse to help them. The Christchurch killer\u2019s fixation on the former Yugoslavia is apt: as in that war, white nationalists seek to use spectacular violence and propaganda to turn citizens against each other. In New Zealand Ms Ardern has turned this on its head. She has tried to use horrific slaughter to unite a country in opposition to a creed whose most famous new exponent she refuses to name."

    "text": "A FANATIC WALKED into a house of worship and opened fire. Men, women, children; he made no distinction. Brenton Tarrant showed no mercy because he did not see his victims as fully human. When he murdered 50 people, he did not see mothers, husbands, engineers or goalkeepers. He saw only the enemy.\n\nThe massacre in New Zealand on March 15th was a reminder of how similar white-nationalist and jihadist killers really are. Though the two groups detest each other, they share methods, morals and mindsets. They see their own group as under threat, and think this justifies extreme violence in \u201cself-defence\u201d. They are often radicalised on social media, where they tap into a multinational subculture of resentment. Islamists share footage of atrocities against Muslims in Myanmar, Syria, Xinjiang and Abu Ghraib. White nationalists share tales of crimes against white people in New York, Rotherham and Bali. The alleged shooter in New Zealand, who is Australian, scrawled on a gun the name of an 11-year-old Swedish girl killed by a jihadist in 2017.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIt takes a vast leap of illogic to conclude that the murder of a young girl in Stockholm justifies the murder of Muslim children 17,500km away. But when extremists meet in the dark corners of the web, they inspire each other to greater heights of paranoia and self-righteousness. Their enemies want to destroy their people and their faith. It is a fight for survival. Apparently unconnected outrages are part of a global plot which, after great contortion, both jihadists and neo-Nazis often blame on the Jews.\n\nWorldwide, jihadists kill many more people than white supremacists do. However, in the West, white-nationalist violence is catching up with the jihadist variety and has in some places overtaken it (see article). The numbers are hard to pin down, but there is cause for alarm. By one estimate, between 2009 and 2018 white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists in America. Far-right networks with violent ambitions have been uncovered in the German army. The West has no white-nationalist equivalent of Islamic State, but plenty of angry racists there have access to guns. And recent events have fired them up. The Syrian refugee crisis, for example, created vivid images of Muslims surging into Europe, fuelling the fears of those who fret that non-whites are outbreeding whites and will one day \u201creplace\u201d them in their ancestral homelands.\n\nYet there is hope. Another reason the white racist threat looms relatively larger is that the West has grown better at thwarting the jihadist one. Since the attacks of September 11th 2001, security services have put huge efforts into infiltrating jihadist groups both in person and online, eavesdropping on their conversations and taking down their propaganda. Since jihadism crosses borders, intelligence services have also shared information and worked hand in hand to disrupt plots. Governments have strengthened the defences of obvious targets, starting with airline cockpits. They have foiled dozens of plots and jailed hundreds of jihadists. They have also worked to deradicalise extremists, or to prevent them from taking up arms.\n\nAll these methods should be used against violent white nationalists, too. More cash will be needed. It is absurd, for example, that America\u2019s Department of Homeland Security has no experts in far-right terrorism. But even with ample funds, the task will not be easy. People who post racist diatribes online often pretend that they are joking. Spotting potential killers among the much larger number of poison-pontificators is hard. So is finding the right people to deradicalise the far right. Would-be jihadists can sometimes be talked out of it by moderate imams, who ground their arguments in texts that both parties revere. This is trickier with neo-Nazis, but a mix of public ostracism and patient counselling can work.\n\nSensitivity is essential. Lots of non-violent people share at least some of the extremists\u2019 concerns, albeit in milder form. And just as the struggle against jihadism must be calibrated so as not to pick on peaceful Muslims\u2014or create that sense\u2014so the struggle against white extremism should avoid alienating peaceful whites who happen to oppose immigration or who occasionally say obnoxious things online.\n\nIt is an explosive problem, and one that would be easier to deal with if prominent politicians stopped throwing lighted matches at it. When President Donald Trump calls the flow of immigrants an \u201cinvasion\u201d, he lends cover to those who would repel them violently. Likewise Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, when he claims that a Jewish billionaire is plotting to flood Europe with Muslim migrants in order to swamp its Christian culture. And so too Turkey\u2019s strongman, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, when he says that the shooter in New Zealand is part of a grand plot against Turks. By contrast, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has struck the right note. She donned a headscarf, to show that an attack on Muslims is an attack on all New Zealanders. She is tightening the country\u2019s gun controls. She has shown how an assault on New Zealand\u2019s values of tolerance and openness is in fact a reason to strengthen them."

    "text": "B ABY-BOOMERS may recall, perhaps wistfully, how the golden-arched sign outside every McDonald\u2019s restaurant would proclaim how many customers had been served by the chain. As they became adults, the number kept on climbing: 5bn in 1969; 30bn in 1979; 80bn in 1990. Jerry Seinfeld, a wry chronicler of the trivial, was moved to ask: \u201cWhy is McDonald\u2019s still counting?\u201d Do we really need to know about every last burger? Just put up a sign that says, \u201cWe\u2019re doing very well.\u201d\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe counting stopped. The signs said simply: \u201cBillions and billions served\u201d. If this seems unhelpfully vague, that is how the counting business sometimes is. Many of America\u2019s biggest companies, including McDonald\u2019s, report a negative book value, a gauge of a firm\u2019s net assets. Many more have a book value that is small relative to their market value: their shares look dear on a price-to-book basis. Much of this is down to the complexity of valuing a firm\u2019s assets in the digital age. But the result is that price-to-book is a bad guide to a stock\u2019s true value.\n\nStockpickers make a distinction between the price of a share and what it is truly worth. Price is a creature of fickle sentiment, of greed and fear. Value, in contrast, depends on a firm\u2019s capabilities. There are various shorthand measures for this, but true \u201cvalue\u201d investors put the greatest store by the price-to-book ratio. It is the basis for inclusion in benchmarks such as the Russell value index. Countless studies have shown that buying stocks with a low price-to-book is a winning strategy.\n\nBut not recently. For much of the past decade, value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, their antithesis. Perhaps this is because, as the industrial age gives way to the digital age, the intangible assets that increasingly matter are not easy to put a value on. The tangible world is easier. Factories, machines, land and office buildings count as capital assets on a firm\u2019s books, because they will generate profits for many years. It is a fairly straightforward business to come up with a value for them: it is what the firm paid. This value is gradually written off (depreciated) over time to reflect wear and tear and obsolescence.\n\nSuch fixed capital assets, along with current assets (cash, stocks of unsold goods, and so on) typically make up the bulk of book value. The problem is what it leaves out. These days, the value of a firm lies as much in its reputation, its processes, the know-how of staff and relationships with customers and suppliers as in tangible assets. Putting an accounting value on these intangibles is notoriously tricky. By their nature, they have unclear boundaries. Not every dollar of R&D or advertising spending can be ascribed to a well-defined asset, such as a brand or patent. That is in large part why, with a few exceptions, such spending is treated as a running cost, like rent or electricity.\n\nIncreasingly price is detached from book value. The median price-to-book of S&P 500 stocks is 3.0. But plenty of well-known companies, whose competitive edge rests on brands or patents, have much higher ratios or even negative book values (see chart). McDonald\u2019s has considerable brand value, which is not on its balance-sheet. It also has property assets that have been fully depreciated.\n\nThe effect of mergers is to make things murkier. If, say, one firm pays $100m for another that has $30m of tangible assets, the residual $70m is counted as an intangible asset\u2014either as brand value, if that can be gauged, or as \u201cgoodwill\u201d. That distorts comparisons. A firm that has acquired brands by merger will have those reflected in its book value, says Simon Harris, of GMO , a fund-management firm; a firm that has developed its own brands will not. Share buy-backs make things murkier still. For any firm with a price-to-book greater than one, a buy-back will diminish book by proportionately more than it lowers the value of outstanding stock. So price-to-book rises further."

    "title": "Scooter wars in Los Angeles",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "A new turf war is raging on the streets of Los Angeles. Outside Gjusta, an artisanal bakery in a trendy part of Venice, four electric scooters lie on their side, beeping plaintively. They belong to Spin, one of a handful of \u201cmicromobility\u201d companies \u2013 among them Bird, Lime and Scoot \u2013 currently duking it out for control of LA \u2019s sidewalks and bike lanes. Don\u2019t be fooled by their cheerful names: on either side of the stricken vehicles stand suspiciously neat rows of rivals awaiting their next rider. Could it be sabotage? In the scooter wars, anything is possible.\n\nSuch companies \u2013 most of which are based in San Francisco \u2013 have put wheels on the ground in many cities, but LA is the glittering prize. LA has the worst congestion in America, a problem that needs urgently addressing if California is to achieve its ambitious emissions reduction goals by 2030. Its public transport system is widely viewed as unsafe (I was reluctant to believe this until I took the metro and a woman in my carriage had her phone stolen by a man in a studded leather face-mask). Four in ten car journeys in LA are under two miles, often taken by solo drivers. In a flat, reliably sunny city, bike and scooter sharing offers an environmentally friendly, convenient alternative for these \u201clast mile\u201d trips (walk in LA ? You must be mad). But is this notoriously car-addicted place prepared for two-wheeled travel?\n\nShe\u2019s got wings A Bird scooter in action\n\nTo find out, I headed to Santa Monica. This progressive beachside city (really a well-heeled suburb) has acted as a testing ground for micromobility schemes since Travis VanderZanden, a former Uber executive, set up Bird there in 2017. While Angelenos may not exactly approve of cyclists, they are at least familiar with the concept of the bicycle: LA \u2019s transport authority has run a bike-share scheme for years. The new bikes operated by the likes of Jump are essentially a dockless, power-assisted upgrade of London\u2019s Boris Bike. Electric scooters, however, are an unknown quantity. While some areas like Beverley Hills have banned them (at least for now), Santa Monica City Hall has granted four scooter companies licence to operate for an 18-month trial period.\n\nHiring one was absurdly easy. I chose Lime, simply because other companies required an American driving licence. I downloaded the app and registered my details in a few minutes, then used the in-app map to locate my nearest vehicle, parked on the pavement a couple of hundred metres away. Scooters don\u2019t vary much between companies, several of which use the same Chinese model. They\u2019re all sturdy, dockless vehicles with an internal locking mechanism that prevents you from wheeling one off down the street without hiring it. I unlocked my new friend by scanning a QR code behind the handlebars. A merry jingle emanated from its digital interface, and I was ready to ride.\n\nI got the hang of it pretty quickly. There\u2019s a button for \u201cgo\u201d and bike-style brakes for \u201cstop\u201d, and that\u2019s pretty much it. I lurched off down the pavement \u2013 no bike lane in sight \u2013 and was soon barrelling along at a top speed of 15mph without a helmet. That\u2019s too fast for a pavement, even one bereft of pedestrians. With my small wheels I could have easily come a cropper on an uneven paving slab. But never mind \u2013 I was enjoying myself! When I reached my destination I simply parked the scooter near the kerb and took a photo of it via the app. Total cost for a seven-minute, 1.6km journey: $2.20.\n\nIt was cheap, convenient and fun. Not to mention illegal: California state law forbids riding scooters on pavements (and most roads). You\u2019re supposed to ride in bike lanes, but there aren\u2019t nearly enough. So everyone breaks the law, zipping around with impunity on what are essentially adult-sized toys. This is part of the problem \u2013 these models may be fast and surprisingly heavy, but to many of us, scooters will always be playthings. Can we really be expected to ride them like adults?\n\nEither way, they\u2019re proving popular: Bird, which is already valued at $2bn, reports 50,000 regular riders in Santa Monica. For a certain type of Angeleno \u2013 the kind that likes to spend entire days in \u201cathleisure\u201d gear without ever breaking sweat \u2013 scooters offer ample opportunity for louchely posing while gliding past pavement cafes. Unsurprisingly, they\u2019ve also been subject to a backlash from cyclists and pedestrians. Scooters have been found suspended in trees or thrown off cliffs. In one respect, however, the cyclists have won: scooters are now banned on the long seaside bike lane known as the boardwalk \u2013 the ideal place to ride them, one might think. The ban is enforced by \u201cgeofencing\u201d, which explains why my vehicle gave up on me one night, leaving me stranded on the boardwalk.\n\nScooters may yet turn out to be a crucial element in a \u201cmulti-modal\u201d future for urban transport. But they require responsible people to ride them. For the moment, anarchy reigns on the wild west coast."

    "title": "The subliminal message of San Pellegrino\u2019s logo",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "At the beginning of the 20th century, Italian companies often deployed a simple visual shorthand to suggest that their products were of high quality: they slapped a red star on the label. One such company was San Pellegrino. Founded in northern Italy in 1899, today it produces more than 1bn bottles of sparkling water a year, each one covered in red stars. \u201cThere\u2019s no real justification for it,\u201d says Clement Vachon, head of international relations at San Pellegrino: the stars are there simply because they always have been. Yet they may offer a subliminal advantage over the competition.\n\nOver the last decade, psychologists at the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford University, led by Professor Charles Spence, have been investigating the relationship between visual stimuli and taste. In a typical study, researchers created a range of fictitious new drinks-brand designs, where elements such as shape and colour were systematically varied. They asked volunteers to classify the designs in terms of the attributes they expected each drink to have \u2013 whether, for instance, they imagined one might be sweet or sour, fizzy or still.\n\nPreliminary research identified what designs the participants associated with particular tastes. Then people were asked to sample an unfamiliar mix of sweet, sour, fizzy and still fruit juices from different types of packaging, to find out whether the expectations set by the bottle influenced how they experienced an unfamiliar product. The researchers concluded that people tend to associate angular shapes with carbonated and bitter-tasting food and drink, and assume that rounder shapes will carry still water or sweet drinks.\n\nThese associations seem like a form of synaesthesia, where the senses are crossed in surprising ways. When Duke Ellington heard Johnny Hodges, a saxophonist, play a G, he experienced the sound as a \u201clight blue satin\u201d. But whereas synaesthetic associations differ from person to person, the links between shapes and tastes seem consistent. That\u2019s where San Pellegrino may be on to a winner. The researchers at Oxford found that incorporating a star into a design helps connote the arousing experience of drinking carbonated water. If, on the other hand, you\u2019re flogging a sweet drink, rounded shapes are better: think of the red circle in the 7Up logo or the flowing typeface of Coca-Cola.\n\nMost consumers don\u2019t realise that packaging can have such an effect on them. But next time you go to the drinks aisle at the supermarket, open your eyes and you\u2019ll see stars.\u2022"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The first time that Salvador Camacho thought he was going to die he was sitting in his father\u2019s Chrysler sedan with a friend listening to music. The 22-year-old engineering student was parked near his home in the central Mexican city of Toluca and in the fading evening light he didn\u2019t notice two tattooed men approach. Tori Amos\u2019s hit, \u201cBliss\u201d, had just started playing when the gang members pointed guns at the young men.\n\nSo began a 24-hour ordeal. Strong willed and solidly built, Camacho was singled out as the more stubborn of the pair. He was blindfolded and beaten. One robber eventually threw him to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head and told him it was time to die. He passed out, waking in a field with his hands tied behind his back, almost naked.\n\nCamacho survived but, traumatised, he sank into depression. Soon he was drinking heavily and binge eating. His weight ballooned from a trim 70kg to 103kg.\n\nThat led to his second near-death experience, eight years later, in 2007. He remembers waking up and blinking at bright lights: he was being wheeled on a stretcher into a hospital emergency ward, with an attack of severe arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat. \u201cA cardiologist told me that if I didn\u2019t lose weight and get my health under control I would be dead in five years,\u201d he says.\n\nThat second crisis forced Camacho belatedly to deal with the trauma of the first. To help with what he now understands was post-traumatic stress disorder, he started having counselling and taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs. To address his physical health, he tried to lose weight. This effort propelled him to the centre of one of the most fraught scientific debates of our age: the calorie wars, a fierce disagreement about diet and weight control.\n\nToday, more than a decade after his cardiologist\u2019s stark warning, Camacho lives in the Swiss city of Basel. He is relaxed and confident, except when two topics come up. When he recounts his kidnapping his gaze drops, his smile vanishes and he becomes noticeably quieter, although he says his panic attacks have virtually disappeared. The other touchy topic is weight control, which causes him to shake his head in anger at what he and millions of other dieters have gone through. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d he says with exasperation and a touch of venom. \u201cPeople are living with real pain and guilt and all they get is advice that is confused or just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nThe guidance that Camacho\u2019s doctors gave him, along with a string of nutritionists and his own online research, was unanimous. It would be familiar to the millions of people who have ever tried to diet. \u201cEverybody tells you that to lose weight you have to eat less and move more,\u201d he says, \u201cand the way to do that is to count your calories.\u201d\n\nAt his heaviest, Camacho\u2019s body-mass index \u2013 the ratio of his height to his weight \u2013 reached 35.6, well above the 30 mark that doctors define as clinically obese. Most government guidelines indicated that, as a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight (the target for women is 2,000). Nutritionists told Camacho that if he ate fewer than 2,000 calories a day, a weekly \u201cdeficit\u201d of 3,500 would mean that he would lose 0.5kg a week.\n\nWith a desk job as a planning engineer in a Mexican hospital, he knew it would take real discipline to trim his pudgy frame. But as his kidnappers had quickly realised, he is an unusually determined character. He began getting up before dawn each day to run 10km. He also started accounting for every morsel of food he consumed.\n\n\u201cI filled in Excel spreadsheets every night, every week and every month listing everything I ate. It became a real obsession for me,\u201d says Camacho. Out went the Burger King Whoppers, fried tacos packed with pork and cheese, and tortas (Mexican sandwiches filled with meat, refried beans, avocado and peppers). Out too went his usual steady flow of beer and wine. In came carefully measured low-fat cheese and turkey sandwiches, salads, canned peach juice, Gatorade and Coke Zero, with three Special-K low-calorie diet bars a day.\n\n\u201cI was always tired and hungry and I would get really moody and distracted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking about food all the time.\u201d He was constantly told that if he got the maths right \u2013 consuming fewer calories than he burned each day \u2013 the results would soon show. \u201cI really did everything you are supposed to do,\u201d he insists with the tone of a schoolboy who completed his homework yet still failed a big test. He bought a battery of exercise monitoring devices to measure how many calories he was expending on his runs. \u201cI was told to exercise for at least 45 minutes at least four or five times a week. I actually ran for more than an hour every day.\u201d He kept to low-fat, low-calorie food for three years. It simply didn\u2019t work. At one point he lost about 10kg but his weight rebounded, though he still restricted his calories.\n\nDieters the world over will be familiar with Camacho\u2019s frustrations. Most studies show that more than 80% of people regain any lost weight in the long term. And like him, when we fail, most of us assume that we are too lazy or greedy \u2013 that we are at fault.\n\nAs a general rule it is true that if you eat vastly fewer calories than you burn, you\u2019ll get slimmer (and if you consume far more, you\u2019ll get fatter). But the myriad faddy diets flogged to us each year belie the simplicity of the formula that Camacho was given. The calorie as a scientific measurement is not in dispute. But calculating the exact calorific content of food is far harder than the confidently precise numbers displayed on food packets suggest. Two items of food with identical calorific values may be digested in very different ways. Each body processes calories differently. Even for a single individual, the time of day that you eat matters. The more we probe, the more we realise that tallying calories will do little to help us control our weight or even maintain a healthy diet: the beguiling simplicity of counting calories in and calories out is dangerously flawed.\n\nThe calorie is ubiquitous in daily life. It takes top billing on the information label of most packaged food and drinks. Ever more restaurants list the number of calories in each dish on their menus. Counting the calories we expend has become just as standard. Gym equipment, fitness devices around our wrists, even our phones tell us how many calories we have supposedly burned in a single exercise session or over the course of a day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always thus. For centuries, scientists assumed that it was the mass of food consumed that was significant. In the late 16th century an Italian physician named Santorio Sanctorius invented a \u201cweighing chair\u201d, dangling from a giant scale, in which he sat at regular intervals to weigh himself, everything he ate and drank, and all the faeces and urine he produced. Despite 30 years of compulsive chair dangling, Sanctorius answered few of his own questions about the impact that his consumption had on his body.\n\nOnly later did the focus shift to the energy different foodstuffs contained. In the 18th century Antoine Lavoisier, a French aristocrat, worked out that burning a candle required a gas from the air \u2013 which he named oxygen \u2013 to fuel the flame and release heat and other gases. He applied the same principle to food, concluding that it fuels the body like a slow-burning fire. He built a calorimeter, a device big enough to hold a guinea pig, and measured the heat the creature generated to estimate how much energy it was producing. Unfortunately the French revolution \u2013 specifically the guillotine \u2013 cut short his thinking on the subject. But he had started something. Other scientists later constructed \u201cbomb calori\u00admeters\u201d in which they burned food to measure the heat \u2013 and thus the potential energy \u2013 released from it.\n\nThe calorie \u2013 which comes from \u201ccalor\u201d, the Latin for \u201cheat\u201d \u2013 was originally used to measure the efficiency of steam engines: one calorie is the energy required to heat 1kg of water by one degree Celsius. Only in the 1860s did German scientists begin using it to calculate the energy in food. It was an American agricultural chemist, Wilbur Atwater, who popularised the idea that it could be used to measure both the energy contained in food and the energy the body expended on things like muscular work, tissue repair and powering the organs. In 1887, after a trip to Germany, he wrote a series of wildly popular articles in Century, an American magazine, suggesting that \u201cfood is to the body what fuel is to the fire.\u201d He introduced the public to the notion of \u201cmacronutrients\u201d \u2013 carbohydrates, protein and fat \u2013 so called because the body needs a lot of them.\n\nToday many of us want to monitor our calorie consumption in order to lose or maintain our weight. Atwater, the son of a Methodist minister, was motivated by the opposite concern: at a time when malnutrition was widespread, he sought to help poor people find the most cost-effective items to fill themselves up.\n\nTo see how much energy different macronutrients provided to the body, he fed samples of an \u201caverage\u201d American diet of that era \u2013 which he believed to be heavy in molasses cookies, barley meal and chicken gizzards \u2013 to a group of male students in a basement at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. For up to 12 days at a time a volunteer would eat, sleep and lift weights while sealed inside a six-foot-high chamber measuring four feet wide by seven feet deep. The energy in each meal was calculated by burning identical foods in a bomb calorimeter.\n\nThe walls were filled with water, and changes in its temperature allowed Atwater to calculate how much energy the students\u2019 bodies were generating. His team collected the students\u2019 faeces and burned that too, to see how much energy had been left in the body in the digestion process.\n\nThis was pioneering stuff for the 1890s. Atwater eventually concluded that a gram of either carbohydrate or protein made an average of four calories of energy available to the body, and a gram of fat offered an average of 8.9 calories, a figure later rounded up to nine calories for convenience. We now know far more about the workings of the human body: Atwater was right that some of a meal\u2019s potential energy was excreted, but had no idea that some was also used to digest the meal itself, and that the body expends different amounts of energy depending on the food. Yet more than a century after igniting the faeces of Wesleyan students, the numbers Atwater calculated for each macro\u00adnutrient remain the standard for measuring the calories in any given food stuff. Those experiments were the basis of Salvador Camacho\u2019s daily calorific arithmetic.\n\nAtwater transformed the way the public thought about food, with his simple belief that \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d. He counselled the poor against eating too many leafy green vegetables because they weren\u2019t sufficiently dense in energy. By his account, it made no difference whether calories came from chocolate or spinach: if the body absorbed more energy than it used, then it would store the excess as body fat, causing you to put on weight.\n\nThat idea captured the public imagination. In 1918 the first book was published in America based on the notion that a healthy diet was no more complicated than the simple addition and subtraction of calories. \u201cYou may eat just what you like \u2013 candy, pie, cake, fat meat, butter, cream but count your calories!\u201d wrote Lulu Hunt Peters in \u201cDiet and Health\u201d. \u201cNow that you know you can have the things you like, proceed to make your menus containing very little of them.\u201d The book sold millions.\n\nBy the 1930s the calorie had become entrenched in both the public mind and government policy. Its exclusive focus on the energy content of food, rather than its vitamin content, say, went virtually unchallenged. Rising incomes and greater female participation in the workforce meant that by the 1960s people were eating out more often or buying prepared food, so they wanted more information about what they were consuming. Nutritional information on foodstuffs was widespread but haphazard; many items carried outlandish claims about their health benefits. Labelling became standardised and mandatory in America only in 1990.\n\nThe emphasis and use of this information shifted too. By the late 1960s, obesity was becoming a pressing health concern as people became more sedentary and started eating highly processed foods and lots of sugar. As the number of people who needed to lose weight grew, changing diets became the focus of attention.\n\nSo began the war on fat, in which Atwater\u2019s calorie calculations were an unwitting ally. Because counting calories was seen as an objective arbiter of the health qualities of a foodstuff, it seemed logical that the most calorie-laden part of any food item \u2013 fat \u2013 must be bad for you. By this measure, dishes low in calories, but rich in sugar and carbohydrates, seemed healthier. People were increasingly willing to blame fat for many of the health ills of modern life, helped along by the sugar lobby: in 2016, a researcher at the University of California uncovered documents from 1967 showing that sugar companies secretly funded studies at Harvard University designed to blame fat for the growing obesity epidemic. That the dietary \u201cfat\u201d found in olive oil, bacon and butter is branded with the same word as the unwanted flesh around our middles made it all the easier to demonise.\n\nA US Senate committee report in 1977 recommended a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet for all, and other governments followed suit. The food industry responded with enthusiasm, removing fat, the most calorie-dense of macronutrients, from food items and replacing it with sugar, starch and salt. As a bonus, the thousands of new cheap and tasty \u201clow-cal\u201d and \u201clow-fat\u201d products which Camacho used to diet tended to have longer shelf lives and higher profit margins.\n\nBut this didn\u2019t lead to the expected improvements in public health. Instead, it coincided almost exactly with the most dramatic rise in obesity in human history. Between 1975 and 2016 obesity almost tripled worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ): nearly 40% of over-18s \u2013 some 1.9bn adults \u2013 are now overweight. That contributed to a rapid rise in cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke) which became the leading cause of death worldwide. Rates of type-2 diabetes, which is often linked to lifestyle and diet, have more than doubled since 1980.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only wealthy countries that saw such trends. In Mexico, middle-class urban families such as Camacho\u2019s got fatter too. As a child Camacho was fit and loved playing football. But at the age of ten, in 1988, he was one of many young Mexicans who started stacking on weight as increasing trade with America saw cheap sweets and fizzy drinks flood the shops, a process known as the \u201cCoca-colonisation\u201d of Mexico. \u201cThere were suddenly all these flavours you had never tasted, with chocolates, candies and Dr Pepper,\u201d Camacho remembers: \u201cOvernight I got fat.\u201d When his uncles teased him about his bulging waistline, he cut back on sweets and stayed in good shape until his kidnapping 12 years later. Other Mexicans just kept bulking up. In 2013 Mexico overtook America as the most obese country in the world.\n\nTo combat this trend, governments worldwide have enshrined calorie-counting in policy. The WHO attributes the \u201cfundamental cause\u201d of obesity worldwide to \u201can energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended\u201d. Governments the world over persist in offering the same advice: count and cut calories. This has infiltrated ever more areas of life. In 2018 the American government ordered food chains and vending machines to provide calorie details on their menus, to help consumers make \u201cinformed and healthful decisions\u201d. Australia and Britain are headed in similar directions. Government bodies advise dieters to record their meals in a calorie journal to lose weight. The experimental efforts of a 19th-century scientist stand barely changed \u2013 and are barely questioned.\n\nMillions of dieters give up when their calorie-counting is unsuccessful. Camacho was more stubborn than most. He took photos of his meals to record his intake more accurately, and would log into his calorie spreadsheets from his phone. He thought about every morsel he ate. And he bought a proliferation of gadgets to track his calorie output. But he still didn\u2019t lose much weight.\n\nOne problem was that his sums were based on the idea that calorie counts are accurate. Food producers give impressively specific readings: a slice of Camacho\u2019s favourite Domino\u2019s double pepperoni pizza is supposedly 248 calories (not 247 nor 249). Yet the number of calories listed on food packets and menus are routinely wrong.\n\nSusan Roberts, a nutritionist at Tufts University in Boston, has found that labels on American packaged foods miss their true calorie counts by an average of 18%. American government regulations allow such labels to understate calories by up to 20% (to ensure that consumers are not short-changed in terms of how much nutrition they receive). The information on some processed frozen foods misstates their calorific content by as much as 70%.\n\nThat isn\u2019t the only problem. Calorie counts are based on how much heat a foodstuff gives off when it burns in an oven. But the human body is far more complex than an oven. When food is burned in a laboratory it surrenders its calories within seconds. By contrast, the real-life journey from dinner plate to toilet bowl takes on average about a day, but can range from eight to 80 hours depending on the person. A calorie of carbohydrate and a calorie of protein both have the same amount of stored energy, so they perform identically in an oven. But put those calories into real bodies and they behave quite differently. And we are still learning new insights: American researchers discovered last year that, for more than a century, we\u2019ve been exaggerating by about 20% the number of calories we absorb from almonds.\n\nThe process of storing fat \u2013 the \u201cweight\u201d many people seek to lose \u2013 is influenced by dozens of other factors. Apart from calories, our genes, the trillions of bacteria that live in our gut, food preparation and sleep affect how we process food. Academic discussions of food and nutrition are littered with references to huge bodies of research that still need to be conducted. \u201cNo other field of science or medicine sees such a lack of rigorous studies,\u201d says Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College in London. \u201cWe can create synthetic DNA and clone animals but we still know incredibly little about the stuff that keeps us alive.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know, however, suggests that counting calories is very crude and often misleading. Think of a burger, the kind of food that Camacho eschewed during his early efforts to lose weight. Take a bite and the saliva in your mouth starts to break it down, a process that continues when you swallow, transporting the morsel towards your stomach and beyond to be churned further. The digestive process transforms the protein, carbohydrates and fat in the burger into their basic compounds so that they are tiny enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream via the small intestine to fuel and repair the trillions of cells in the body. But the basic molecules from each macronutrient play very different roles within the body.\n\nAll carbohydrates break down into sugars, which are the body\u2019s main fuel source. But the speed at which your body gets its fuel from food can be as important as the amount of fuel. Simple carbohydrates are swiftly absorbed into the bloodstream, providing a fast shot of energy: the body absorbs the sugar from a can of fizzy drink at a rate of 30 calories a minute, compared with two calories a minute from complex carbohydrates such as potatoes or rice. That matters, because a sudden hit of sugar prompts the rapid release of insulin, a hormone that carries the sugar out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells. Problems arise when there is too much sugar in the blood. The liver can store some of the excess, but any that remains is stashed as fat. So consuming large quantities of sugar is the fastest way to create body fat. And, once the insulin has done its work, blood-sugar levels slump, which tends to leave you hungry, as well as plumper.\n\nGetting fat is a consequence of civilisation. Our ancestors would have enjoyed a heavy hit of sugar perhaps four times a year, when a new season produced fresh fruit. Many now enjoy that kind of sugar kick every day. The average person in the developed world consumes 20 times as much sugar as people did even during Atwater\u2019s time.\n\nBut it is a different story when you eat complex carbohydrates such as cereals. These are strung together from simple carbohydrates, so they also break down into sugar, but because they do so more slowly, your blood-sugar levels remain steadier. The fruit juices that Camacho was encouraged to drink contained fewer calories than one of his wholegrain buns but the bread delivered less of a sugar hit and left him feeling satiated for longer.\n\nOther macronutrients have different functions. Protein, the dominant component of meat, fish and dairy products, acts as the main building block for bone, skin, hair and other body tissues. In the absence of sufficient quantities of carbohydrates it can also serve as fuel for the body. But since it is broken down more slowly than carbohydrates, protein is less likely to be converted to body fat.\n\nFat is a different matter again. It should leave you feeling fuller for longer, because your body splits it into tiny fatty acids more slowly than it processes carbohydrates or protein. We all need fat to make hormones and to protect our nerves (a bit like plastic coating protects an electric wire). Over millennia, fat has also been a crucial way for humans to store energy, allowing us to survive periods of famine. Nowadays, even without the risk of starvation, our bodies are programmed to store excess fuel in case we run out of food. No wonder a single measure \u2013 the energy content \u2013 can\u2019t capture such complexity.\n\nOur fixation with counting calories assumes both that all calories are equal and that all bodies respond to calories in identical ways: Camacho was told that, since he was a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight. Yet a growing body of research shows that when different people consume the same meal, the impact on each person\u2019s blood sugar and fat formation will vary according to their genes, lifestyles and unique mix of gut bacteria.\n\nResearch published this year showed that a certain set of genes is found more often in overweight people than in skinny ones, suggesting that some people have to work harder than others to stay thin (a fact that many of us already felt intuitively to be true). Differences in gut microbiomes can alter how people process food. A study of 800 Israelis in 2015 found that the rise in their blood-sugar levels varied by a factor of four in response to identical food.\n\nSome people\u2019s intestines are 50% longer than others: those with shorter ones absorb fewer calories, which means that they excrete more of the energy in food, putting on less weight.\n\nThe response of your own body may also change depending on when you eat. Lose weight and your body will try to regain it, slowing down your metabolism and even reducing the energy you spend on fidgeting and twitching your muscles. Even your eating and sleeping schedules can be important. Going without a full night\u2019s sleep may spur your body to create more fatty tissue, which casts a grim light on Camacho\u2019s years of early-morning exertion. You may put on more weight eating small amounts over 12-15 hours than eating the same food in three distinct meals over a shorter period.\n\nThere\u2019s a further weakness in the calorie-counting system: the amount of energy we absorb from food depends on how we prepare it. Chopping and grinding food essentially does part of the work of digestion, making more calories available to your body by ripping apart cell walls before you eat it. That effect is magnified when you add heat: cooking increases the proportion of food digested in the stomach and small intestine, from 50% to 95%. The digestible calories in beef rises by 15% on cooking, and in sweet potato some 40% (the exact change depends on whether it is boiled, roasted or microwaved). So significant is this impact that Richard Wrangham, a primatologist at Harvard University, reckons that cooking was necessary for human evolution. It enabled the neurological expansion that created Homo sapiens: powering the brain consumes about a fifth of a person\u2019s metabolic energy each day (cooking also means we didn\u2019t need to spend all day chewing, unlike chimps).\n\nThe difficulty in counting accurately doesn\u2019t stop there. The calorie load of carbohydrate-heavy items such as rice, pasta, bread and potatoes can be slashed simply by cooking, chilling and reheating them. As starch molecules cool they form new structures that are harder to digest. You absorb fewer calories eating toast that has been left to go cold, or leftover spaghetti, than if they were freshly made. Scientists in Sri Lanka discovered in 2015 that they could more than halve the calories potentially absorbed from rice by adding coconut oil during cooking and then cooling the rice. This made the starch less digestible so the body may take on fewer calories (they have yet to test on human beings the precise effects of rice cooked in this way). That\u2019s a bad thing if you\u2019re malnourished, but a boon if you\u2019re trying to lose weight.\n\nDifferent parts of a vegetable or fruit may be absorbed differently too: older leaves are tougher, for example. The starchy interior of sweetcorn kernels is easily digested but the cellulose husk is impossible to break down and passes through the body untouched. Just think about that moment when you look into the toilet bowl after eating sweetcorn.\n\nAs with so many dieters, Camacho\u2019s efforts to accurately track his calories \u201cin\u201d were doomed. But so too were his attempts to track his calories \u201cout\u201d. The message from many public authorities and food producers, especially fast-food companies that sponsor sports events, is that even the unhealthiest foods will not make you fat if you do your part by taking plenty of exercise. Exercise does, of course, have clear health benefits. But unless you\u2019re a professional athlete, it plays a smaller part in weight control than most people believe. As much as 75% of the average person\u2019s daily energy expenditure comes not through exercise but from ordinary daily activities and from keeping your body functioning by digesting food, powering organs and maintaining a regular body temperature. Even drinking iced water \u2013 which delivers no energy \u2013 forces the body to burn calories to maintain its preferred temperature, making it the only known case of consuming something with \u201cnegative\u201d calories. A popular expression in English tells us not to \u201ccompare apples and oranges\u201d and assume them to be the same: yet calories put pizzas and oranges, or apples and ice cream, on the same scale, and deems them equal.\n\nAfter three years of dedicated calorie-counting Camacho changed tack. While recovering from running the 2010 marathon in San Diego he took up Crossfit training, an exercise regime that includes high-intensity training and weightlifting. There he met people using a very different method to control their weight. Like him, they exercised regularly. But rather than limiting their calories, they ate natural foods, what Camacho calls \u201cstuff from a real plant, not an industrial plant\u201d.\n\nFed up with feeling like a hungry failure, he decided to give it a go. He ditched his heavily processed low-calorie products and focused on the quality of his food rather than quantity. He stopped feeling ravenous all the time. \u201cIt sounds simple but I decided to listen to my body and eat whenever I was hungry but only when I was hungry, and to eat real food, not food \u2018products\u2019,\u201d he says. He went back to items that he\u2019d long banned himself from eating. He had his first rasher of bacon in three years and enjoyed cheese, whole-fat milk and steaks.\n\nHe immediately felt less hungry and happier. More surprising, he quickly began to lose his extra fat. \u201cI was sleeping so much better and within a couple of months I stopped the depression and anxiety medication,\u201d he says. \u201cI went from always feeling guilty and angry and afraid to feeling in control of myself and actually proud of my own body. Suddenly I could enjoy eating and drinking again.\u201d\n\nThe weight stayed off and in 2012 he moved to Heidelberg in Germany, a world away from the hectic streets of Mexico, to study for a masters degree in public health. \u201cThe idea hit me that I could combine my own experience with academic work to try to help other people overcome these various barriers that I had found.\u201d After his masters he embarked on a doctorate on how to tackle obesity in Mexico.\n\nToday he is married to a German scholar, Erica Gunther, who has studied food systems around the world. Their diet includes things he used to shun, such as egg yolks, olive oil and nuts. Two days a week the couple stick to vegetarian meals but otherwise he devours steak, kidneys, liver and some of his favourite Mexican dishes \u2013 barbacoa (lamb), carnitas (pork) and tacos with grilled meat.\n\nHis wife enjoys making a traditional Mexican sweet pastry called pan de muerto (bread of death). \u201cBefore I would have run an extra two hours to compensate for eating that but now I don\u2019t care, I just make sure it is a treat, not an everyday thing.\u201d Having spent years trying to forgo alcohol, he has a glass or two of wine several times a week, and goes for a beer with friends from his gym.\n\nSweating through three or four workouts a week, he is as well-muscled as a professional rugby player. A stable 80kg, he has very little body fat, though he is still considered overweight by the body-mass-index charts, which rate many beefed-up professional athletes as too heavy. The only relapse of anxiety he suffers nowadays happens when he hears Tori Amos singing \u201cBliss\u201d \u2013 the song playing when he was kidnapped \u2013 which he says \u201cis a real pity because it\u2019s a great song\u201d.\n\nToday Camacho could be described as a calorie dissident, one of a small but growing number of academics and scientists who say that the persistence of calorie-counting compounds the obesity epidemic, rather than remedying it. Counting calories has disrupted our ability to eat the right amount of food, he says, and has steered us towards poor choices. In 2017 he wrote an academic paper that was one of the most savage attacks on the calorie system published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI\u2019m actually embarrassed at what I used to believe,\u201d he says. \u201cI was doing everything I could to follow the official advice but it was totally wrong and I feel stupid for never even questioning it.\u201d\n\nGiven the vast evidence that calorie-counting is imprecise at best, and contributes to rising obesity at worst, why has it persisted?\n\nThe simplicity of calorie-counting explains its appeal. Metrics that tell consumers the extent to which foods have been processed, or whether they will suppress hunger, are harder to understand. Faced with the calorie juggernaut, none has gained wide acceptance.\n\nThe scientific and health establishment knows that the current system is flawed. A senior adviser to the UN \u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in 2002 that the Atwater \u201cfactors\u201d of 4-4-9 at the heart of the calorie-counting system were \u201ca gross oversimplification\u201d and so inaccurate that they could mislead consumers into choosing unhealthy products because they understate the calories in some carbohydrates. The organisation said it would give \u201cfurther consideration\u201d to overhauling the system but 17 years later there is little momentum for change. It even rejected the idea of harmonising the many methods that are used in different countries \u2013 a label in Australia can give a different count from one in America for the same product.\n\nOfficials at the WHO also acknowledge the problems of the current system, but say it is so entrenched in consumer behaviour, public policy and industry standards that it would be too expensive and disruptive to make big changes. The experiments that Atwater conducted a century ago, without calculators or computers, have never been repeated even though our understanding of how our bodies work is vastly improved. There is little funding or enthusiasm for such work. As Susan Roberts at Tufts University says, collecting and analysing faeces \u201cis the worst research job in the world\u201d.\n\nThe calorie system, says Camacho, lets food producers off the hook: \u201cThey can say, \u2018We\u2019re not responsible for the unhealthy products we sell, we just have to list the calories and leave it to you to manage your own weight\u2019.\u201d Camacho and other calorie dissidents argue that sugar and highly processed carbohydrates play havoc with people\u2019s hormonal systems. Higher insulin levels mean more energy is converted into fat tissues leaving less available to fuel the rest of the body. That in turn drives hunger and overeating. In other words the constant hunger and fatigue suffered by Camacho and other dieters may be symptoms of being overweight, rather than the cause of the problem. Yet much of the food industry defends the status quo too. To change how we assess the energy and health values of food would undermine the business model of many companies.\n\nThe only major organisation to shift the emphasis beyond calories is one dedicated to helping its customers slim down: Weight Watchers. In 2001 the world\u2019s best-known dieting firm introduced a points system that moved away from focusing exclusively on calories to also classifying foods according to their sugar and saturated fat content, and their impact on appetite. Chris Stirk, the firm\u2019s general manager in Britain, says the organisation made the change because relying on calories to lose weight is \u201coutdated\u201d: \u201cScience evolves daily, monthly, yearly, let alone since the 1800s.\u201d\n\nMany of us know instinctively that not all calories are the same. A lollipop and an apple may contain similar numbers of calories but the apple is clearly better for us. But after a lifetime of hearing about the calorie and its role in supposedly foolproof diet advice we could be forgiven for being confused about how best to eat. It\u2019s time to lay it to rest.\u2022"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The decision to commute Johnson\u2019s sentence sparked fury back in Gadsden. Richardson remained in custody there, though he had never been charged with any crime. A mob of some 25 men massed on the prison, forcing the jailer and his wife out the back door at gunpoint. They had been drinking, according to the county sheriff; they wanted blood, not justice. Richardson was huddled in a corner when they arrived, mute, barefoot and dressed only in his nightshirt. They seized him and dragged him through town, beating him all the way to a railroad bridge that spanned the Coosa River. They shot him several times. Then they hung him from the bridge and left his body dangling over the roaring river.\n\nA photograph taken just afterwards shows Richardson\u2019s body, lifeless and limp, his legs tucked under him, his eyes shut and his mouth hanging open. Two men flank him: one, wearing a broad-brimmed hat and rustic clothes, holds a handkerchief over his nose and mouth; the other, in a natty overcoat and bowler hat \u2013 it was Sunday morning; perhaps he was on his way to church \u2013 is smirking as he looks down at the body. The lynching was a public event. But nobody has ever been convicted for Bunk Richardson\u2019s murder.\n\nThe memory of Richardson\u2019s lynching \u2013 and the hate that drove it \u2013 still haunts the black community of Gadsden. Vanessa Croft, a former television-news anchor who grew up in the town, believes that her grandfather was among those who witnessed the killing. A bloodthirsty mob of dozens dragging someone through town would have made a lot of noise (this was 1906 \u2013 before the cacophony of cars, television and radio). Croft\u2019s grandfather lived on the other side of the bridge from which Richardson was hanged.\n\nEven had he not seen the murder, he would have understood the omnipresent threat of racist violence. When his son (Croft\u2019s uncle) Fred, was 15, sometime in the late 1920s or early 1930s \u2013 Croft isn\u2019t exactly sure \u2013 a group of white men came to her grandfather\u2019s house. A young, white girl said that someone had pushed her off a porch. The men thought Fred had done it though there was no evidence to suggest that he had. Her grandfather told them that Fred wasn\u2019t at home. They left, warning him they would be back.\n\nHaving grown up in Alabama and heard about the lynching of Buck Richardson, Croft\u2019s grandfather knew what it meant when white men hungry for revenge warned that they would return. Fred was immediately sent off to Chattanooga, around 90 miles away in Tennessee, at the farthest end of the train line that ran out of Gadsden. He moved from there to Harlem, New York. He did not see his brother again for more than a decade \u2013 and only then because each of their ships docked at Pearl Harbour at the same time during the second world war.\n\nIn 1877 President Rutherford Hayes withdrew the last federal troops from the South, where they had been stationed since the conclusion of the American civil war 11 years earlier. While they were there, emancipated black Americans voted, went to school and served as judges, senators and congressmen. After they left, the southern states that had seceded from the Union to preserve slavery systematically restored de facto and de jure white supremacy.\n\nBetween 1877 and 1950, more than 4,000 African-American men, women and children were lynched: summarily murdered, often in broad daylight. Some were killed on remote rural byways. Many were strung up on courthouse lawns in front of hundreds of white spectators. Sometimes the lynchers overwhelmed local law enforcement. Yet often police acquiesced; sometimes even helping the murderers. The perpetrators were not outlaws. They were often pillars of their communities: wealthy planters and business owners, employers, neighbours.\n\nThe murders they committed were not centrally planned, as were more recent atrocities in Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia. But they were certainly state-sanctioned. Judges rarely convicted lynchers; Southern segregationists in the senate repeatedly blocked anti-lynching legislation.\n\nLynchings \u2013 and the threat of them \u2013 were designed both to terrify African-Americans and display collective white-American power. I mentioned to an older, conservative white man from a western state that I was writing about lynching. \u201cStringin\u2019 \u2018em up\u201d was part of frontier justice, he replied, and it was. In places with little or no formal law enforcement, sometimes criminals were hanged. But lynching black men, women and children was not a method of delivering rough justice. It was a means to perpetuate injustice.\n\nAmong the excuses for murdering African-American men were false accusations of rape, \u201calleged well poisoning\u201d, \u201cinsulting whites\u201d, \u201cstealing hogs\u201d, or being \u201csaucy to white people\u201d, wrote Ida Wells-Barnett, an African-American journalist who led a campaign against lynching in the late 19th century. In Blakely, Georgia in 1919, a veteran returning from the first world war was beaten to death for refusing to remove his uniform. Two years later near Memphis, Tennessee a black man accused of murder was burned to death in front of his family. It took 40 minutes; twice the lynch mob stopped him from hastening his own death by swallowing hot coals. In many cases African-Americans were lynched for no recorded offence at all. \u201cLynch Law has become so common in the United States,\u201d wrote Wells-Barnett, \u201cthat the finding of a dead body of a Negro, suspended between heaven and earth to the limb of a tree, is of so slight importance that neither the civil authorities nor press agencies consider the matter worth investigating.\u201d\n\nLynching took a long time to die out. In Alabama in 1981 Michael Donald, a 19-year-old who had the misfortune to cross paths with two Klansmen upset that a black defendant had been acquitted, was hanged from a tree. Croft says that she grew up in Alabama in the 1960s and 1970s, surrounded by a warm and protective family: \u201cI had everything I needed\u201d. Yet the shadow of racial hatred was never distant. After the father of one of her friends moved into a white neighbourhood, Ku Klux Klan members walked up to his front door one night, rang the bell and shot him.\n\nShe recalls parading with her school\u2019s band and seeing a grown man spit on her friend \u2013 an 11-year-old girl. When she and other students marched for civil rights, the Klan marched right behind them. As late as the 1990s, when her mother conducted voter-registration drives, Croft says that the registrar insisted she pronounce every name on her list of voters in a manner he deemed correct before he would process the forms. Just recently, Croft says, she was followed home by two men flying a huge Confederate flag off the back of their truck.\n\nThe legacy of fear has had profound consequences that persist today. Jhacova Williams, an economist at Louisiana State University, has shown that Southern counties with high lynching rates between 1882 and 1930 still have lower black-voter registration rates today, and individual African-Americans who live in counties with high historic lynching rates are less likely to vote than their white counterparts. She argues that voting is a social norm, and in areas where violence kept black people from voting, that norm never took hold.\n\nAcross Germany, more than 70,000 stolpersteine \u2013 raised concrete cubes embedded in the ground \u2013 mark the last known residences of people whom the Nazis murdered. The Apartheid Museum sits in the heart of Johannesburg. Those countries have faced up to their past atrocities sins in part because the political regimes that directed them are no longer in place. But America had no transfer of power. The South\u2019s secessionist government, the Confederacy, founded to protect southern white people\u2019s right to enslave African-Americans lost the civil war in 1865. But its remnants were absorbed into the American body politic. And the tension at the heart of the American experiment \u2013 between a promise of \u201cliberty and justice for all\u201d and the reality of wealth drawn from slave labour \u2013 remained unresolved.\n\nFormer Confederate soldiers went on to serve in Congress \u2013 the legislature of the county they rebelled against. Southern cities and states erected statues honouring them, and segregationists served as senators, congressmen and governors well into the late 20th century. Strom Thurmond ran for president on a segregationist platform in 1948, and served in the senate from 1954 until 2003. Robert Byrd founded a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1940s and served in the Senate from 1958 until 2010.\n\nPeople seeking national office pandered to bigotry: Ronald Reagan kicked off his presidential campaign in 1980 by telling an audience in Philadelphia, Mississippi \u2013 where just 16 years earlier Klansmen murdered three civil-rights workers \u2013 that he believed in \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d (which is how segregationists often framed their resistance to federally ordered integration: they believed that states had the right to abrogate their own citizens\u2019 constitutional rights) And just four years after Americans re-elected a black president, they elected a nativist who exploited antipathy among white Americans to Mexicans and Muslims."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The first time that Salvador Camacho thought he was going to die he was sitting in his father\u2019s Chrysler sedan with a friend listening to music. The 22-year-old engineering student was parked near his home in the central Mexican city of Toluca and in the fading evening light he didn\u2019t notice two tattooed men approach. Tori Amos\u2019s hit, \u201cBliss\u201d, had just started playing when the gang members pointed guns at the young men.\n\nSo began a 24-hour ordeal. Strong willed and solidly built, Camacho was singled out as the more stubborn of the pair. He was blindfolded and beaten. One robber eventually threw him to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head and told him it was time to die. He passed out, waking in a field with his hands tied behind his back, almost naked.\n\nCamacho survived but, traumatised, he sank into depression. Soon he was drinking heavily and binge eating. His weight ballooned from a trim 70kg to 103kg.\n\nThat led to his second near-death experience, eight years later, in 2007. He remembers waking up and blinking at bright lights: he was being wheeled on a stretcher into a hospital emergency ward, with an attack of severe arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat. \u201cA cardiologist told me that if I didn\u2019t lose weight and get my health under control I would be dead in five years,\u201d he says.\n\nThat second crisis forced Camacho belatedly to deal with the trauma of the first. To help with what he now understands was post-traumatic stress disorder, he started having counselling and taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs. To address his physical health, he tried to lose weight. This effort propelled him to the centre of one of the most fraught scientific debates of our age: the calorie wars, a fierce disagreement about diet and weight control.\n\nToday, more than a decade after his cardiologist\u2019s stark warning, Camacho lives in the Swiss city of Basel. He is relaxed and confident, except when two topics come up. When he recounts his kidnapping his gaze drops, his smile vanishes and he becomes noticeably quieter, although he says his panic attacks have virtually disappeared. The other touchy topic is weight control, which causes him to shake his head in anger at what he and millions of other dieters have gone through. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d he says with exasperation and a touch of venom. \u201cPeople are living with real pain and guilt and all they get is advice that is confused or just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nThe guidance that Camacho\u2019s doctors gave him, along with a string of nutritionists and his own online research, was unanimous. It would be familiar to the millions of people who have ever tried to diet. \u201cEverybody tells you that to lose weight you have to eat less and move more,\u201d he says, \u201cand the way to do that is to count your calories.\u201d\n\nAt his heaviest, Camacho\u2019s body-mass index \u2013 the ratio of his height to his weight \u2013 reached 35.6, well above the 30 mark that doctors define as clinically obese. Most government guidelines indicated that, as a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight (the target for women is 2,000). Nutritionists told Camacho that if he ate fewer than 2,000 calories a day, a weekly \u201cdeficit\u201d of 3,500 would mean that he would lose 0.5kg a week.\n\nWith a desk job as a planning engineer in a Mexican hospital, he knew it would take real discipline to trim his pudgy frame. But as his kidnappers had quickly realised, he is an unusually determined character. He began getting up before dawn each day to run 10km. He also started accounting for every morsel of food he consumed.\n\n\u201cI filled in Excel spreadsheets every night, every week and every month listing everything I ate. It became a real obsession for me,\u201d says Camacho. Out went the Burger King Whoppers, fried tacos packed with pork and cheese, and tortas (Mexican sandwiches filled with meat, refried beans, avocado and peppers). Out too went his usual steady flow of beer and wine. In came carefully measured low-fat cheese and turkey sandwiches, salads, canned peach juice, Gatorade and Coke Zero, with three Special-K low-calorie diet bars a day.\n\n\u201cI was always tired and hungry and I would get really moody and distracted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking about food all the time.\u201d He was constantly told that if he got the maths right \u2013 consuming fewer calories than he burned each day \u2013 the results would soon show. \u201cI really did everything you are supposed to do,\u201d he insists with the tone of a schoolboy who completed his homework yet still failed a big test. He bought a battery of exercise monitoring devices to measure how many calories he was expending on his runs. \u201cI was told to exercise for at least 45 minutes at least four or five times a week. I actually ran for more than an hour every day.\u201d He kept to low-fat, low-calorie food for three years. It simply didn\u2019t work. At one point he lost about 10kg but his weight rebounded, though he still restricted his calories.\n\nDieters the world over will be familiar with Camacho\u2019s frustrations. Most studies show that more than 80% of people regain any lost weight in the long term. And like him, when we fail, most of us assume that we are too lazy or greedy \u2013 that we are at fault.\n\nAs a general rule it is true that if you eat vastly fewer calories than you burn, you\u2019ll get slimmer (and if you consume far more, you\u2019ll get fatter). But the myriad faddy diets flogged to us each year belie the simplicity of the formula that Camacho was given. The calorie as a scientific measurement is not in dispute. But calculating the exact calorific content of food is far harder than the confidently precise numbers displayed on food packets suggest. Two items of food with identical calorific values may be digested in very different ways. Each body processes calories differently. Even for a single individual, the time of day that you eat matters. The more we probe, the more we realise that tallying calories will do little to help us control our weight or even maintain a healthy diet: the beguiling simplicity of counting calories in and calories out is dangerously flawed.\n\nThe calorie is ubiquitous in daily life. It takes top billing on the information label of most packaged food and drinks. Ever more restaurants list the number of calories in each dish on their menus. Counting the calories we expend has become just as standard. Gym equipment, fitness devices around our wrists, even our phones tell us how many calories we have supposedly burned in a single exercise session or over the course of a day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always thus. For centuries, scientists assumed that it was the mass of food consumed that was significant. In the late 16th century an Italian physician named Santorio Sanctorius invented a \u201cweighing chair\u201d, dangling from a giant scale, in which he sat at regular intervals to weigh himself, everything he ate and drank, and all the faeces and urine he produced. Despite 30 years of compulsive chair dangling, Sanctorius answered few of his own questions about the impact that his consumption had on his body.\n\nOnly later did the focus shift to the energy different foodstuffs contained. In the 18th century Antoine Lavoisier, a French aristocrat, worked out that burning a candle required a gas from the air \u2013 which he named oxygen \u2013 to fuel the flame and release heat and other gases. He applied the same principle to food, concluding that it fuels the body like a slow-burning fire. He built a calorimeter, a device big enough to hold a guinea pig, and measured the heat the creature generated to estimate how much energy it was producing. Unfortunately the French revolution \u2013 specifically the guillotine \u2013 cut short his thinking on the subject. But he had started something. Other scientists later constructed \u201cbomb calori\u00admeters\u201d in which they burned food to measure the heat \u2013 and thus the potential energy \u2013 released from it.\n\nThe calorie \u2013 which comes from \u201ccalor\u201d, the Latin for \u201cheat\u201d \u2013 was originally used to measure the efficiency of steam engines: one calorie is the energy required to heat 1kg of water by one degree Celsius. Only in the 1860s did German scientists begin using it to calculate the energy in food. It was an American agricultural chemist, Wilbur Atwater, who popularised the idea that it could be used to measure both the energy contained in food and the energy the body expended on things like muscular work, tissue repair and powering the organs. In 1887, after a trip to Germany, he wrote a series of wildly popular articles in Century, an American magazine, suggesting that \u201cfood is to the body what fuel is to the fire.\u201d He introduced the public to the notion of \u201cmacronutrients\u201d \u2013 carbohydrates, protein and fat \u2013 so called because the body needs a lot of them.\n\nToday many of us want to monitor our calorie consumption in order to lose or maintain our weight. Atwater, the son of a Methodist minister, was motivated by the opposite concern: at a time when malnutrition was widespread, he sought to help poor people find the most cost-effective items to fill themselves up.\n\nTo see how much energy different macronutrients provided to the body, he fed samples of an \u201caverage\u201d American diet of that era \u2013 which he believed to be heavy in molasses cookies, barley meal and chicken gizzards \u2013 to a group of male students in a basement at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. For up to 12 days at a time a volunteer would eat, sleep and lift weights while sealed inside a six-foot-high chamber measuring four feet wide by seven feet deep. The energy in each meal was calculated by burning identical foods in a bomb calorimeter.\n\nThe walls were filled with water, and changes in its temperature allowed Atwater to calculate how much energy the students\u2019 bodies were generating. His team collected the students\u2019 faeces and burned that too, to see how much energy had been left in the body in the digestion process.\n\nThis was pioneering stuff for the 1890s. Atwater eventually concluded that a gram of either carbohydrate or protein made an average of four calories of energy available to the body, and a gram of fat offered an average of 8.9 calories, a figure later rounded up to nine calories for convenience. We now know far more about the workings of the human body: Atwater was right that some of a meal\u2019s potential energy was excreted, but had no idea that some was also used to digest the meal itself, and that the body expends different amounts of energy depending on the food. Yet more than a century after igniting the faeces of Wesleyan students, the numbers Atwater calculated for each macro\u00adnutrient remain the standard for measuring the calories in any given food stuff. Those experiments were the basis of Salvador Camacho\u2019s daily calorific arithmetic.\n\nAtwater transformed the way the public thought about food, with his simple belief that \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d. He counselled the poor against eating too many leafy green vegetables because they weren\u2019t sufficiently dense in energy. By his account, it made no difference whether calories came from chocolate or spinach: if the body absorbed more energy than it used, then it would store the excess as body fat, causing you to put on weight.\n\nThat idea captured the public imagination. In 1918 the first book was published in America based on the notion that a healthy diet was no more complicated than the simple addition and subtraction of calories. \u201cYou may eat just what you like \u2013 candy, pie, cake, fat meat, butter, cream but count your calories!\u201d wrote Lulu Hunt Peters in \u201cDiet and Health\u201d. \u201cNow that you know you can have the things you like, proceed to make your menus containing very little of them.\u201d The book sold millions.\n\nBy the 1930s the calorie had become entrenched in both the public mind and government policy. Its exclusive focus on the energy content of food, rather than its vitamin content, say, went virtually unchallenged. Rising incomes and greater female participation in the workforce meant that by the 1960s people were eating out more often or buying prepared food, so they wanted more information about what they were consuming. Nutritional information on foodstuffs was widespread but haphazard; many items carried outlandish claims about their health benefits. Labelling became standardised and mandatory in America only in 1990.\n\nThe emphasis and use of this information shifted too. By the late 1960s, obesity was becoming a pressing health concern as people became more sedentary and started eating highly processed foods and lots of sugar. As the number of people who needed to lose weight grew, changing diets became the focus of attention.\n\nSo began the war on fat, in which Atwater\u2019s calorie calculations were an unwitting ally. Because counting calories was seen as an objective arbiter of the health qualities of a foodstuff, it seemed logical that the most calorie-laden part of any food item \u2013 fat \u2013 must be bad for you. By this measure, dishes low in calories, but rich in sugar and carbohydrates, seemed healthier. People were increasingly willing to blame fat for many of the health ills of modern life, helped along by the sugar lobby: in 2016, a researcher at the University of California uncovered documents from 1967 showing that sugar companies secretly funded studies at Harvard University designed to blame fat for the growing obesity epidemic. That the dietary \u201cfat\u201d found in olive oil, bacon and butter is branded with the same word as the unwanted flesh around our middles made it all the easier to demonise.\n\nA US Senate committee report in 1977 recommended a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet for all, and other governments followed suit. The food industry responded with enthusiasm, removing fat, the most calorie-dense of macronutrients, from food items and replacing it with sugar, starch and salt. As a bonus, the thousands of new cheap and tasty \u201clow-cal\u201d and \u201clow-fat\u201d products which Camacho used to diet tended to have longer shelf lives and higher profit margins.\n\nBut this didn\u2019t lead to the expected improvements in public health. Instead, it coincided almost exactly with the most dramatic rise in obesity in human history. Between 1975 and 2016 obesity almost tripled worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ): nearly 40% of over-18s \u2013 some 1.9bn adults \u2013 are now overweight. That contributed to a rapid rise in cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke) which became the leading cause of death worldwide. Rates of type-2 diabetes, which is often linked to lifestyle and diet, have more than doubled since 1980.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only wealthy countries that saw such trends. In Mexico, middle-class urban families such as Camacho\u2019s got fatter too. As a child Camacho was fit and loved playing football. But at the age of ten, in 1988, he was one of many young Mexicans who started stacking on weight as increasing trade with America saw cheap sweets and fizzy drinks flood the shops, a process known as the \u201cCoca-colonisation\u201d of Mexico. \u201cThere were suddenly all these flavours you had never tasted, with chocolates, candies and Dr Pepper,\u201d Camacho remembers: \u201cOvernight I got fat.\u201d When his uncles teased him about his bulging waistline, he cut back on sweets and stayed in good shape until his kidnapping 12 years later. Other Mexicans just kept bulking up. In 2013 Mexico overtook America as the most obese country in the world.\n\nTo combat this trend, governments worldwide have enshrined calorie-counting in policy. The WHO attributes the \u201cfundamental cause\u201d of obesity worldwide to \u201can energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended\u201d. Governments the world over persist in offering the same advice: count and cut calories. This has infiltrated ever more areas of life. In 2018 the American government ordered food chains and vending machines to provide calorie details on their menus, to help consumers make \u201cinformed and healthful decisions\u201d. Australia and Britain are headed in similar directions. Government bodies advise dieters to record their meals in a calorie journal to lose weight. The experimental efforts of a 19th-century scientist stand barely changed \u2013 and are barely questioned.\n\nMillions of dieters give up when their calorie-counting is unsuccessful. Camacho was more stubborn than most. He took photos of his meals to record his intake more accurately, and would log into his calorie spreadsheets from his phone. He thought about every morsel he ate. And he bought a proliferation of gadgets to track his calorie output. But he still didn\u2019t lose much weight.\n\nOne problem was that his sums were based on the idea that calorie counts are accurate. Food producers give impressively specific readings: a slice of Camacho\u2019s favourite Domino\u2019s double pepperoni pizza is supposedly 248 calories (not 247 nor 249). Yet the number of calories listed on food packets and menus are routinely wrong.\n\nSusan Roberts, a nutritionist at Tufts University in Boston, has found that labels on American packaged foods miss their true calorie counts by an average of 18%. American government regulations allow such labels to understate calories by up to 20% (to ensure that consumers are not short-changed in terms of how much nutrition they receive). The information on some processed frozen foods misstates their calorific content by as much as 70%.\n\nThat isn\u2019t the only problem. Calorie counts are based on how much heat a foodstuff gives off when it burns in an oven. But the human body is far more complex than an oven. When food is burned in a laboratory it surrenders its calories within seconds. By contrast, the real-life journey from dinner plate to toilet bowl takes on average about a day, but can range from eight to 80 hours depending on the person. A calorie of carbohydrate and a calorie of protein both have the same amount of stored energy, so they perform identically in an oven. But put those calories into real bodies and they behave quite differently. And we are still learning new insights: American researchers discovered last year that, for more than a century, we\u2019ve been exaggerating by about 20% the number of calories we absorb from almonds.\n\nThe process of storing fat \u2013 the \u201cweight\u201d many people seek to lose \u2013 is influenced by dozens of other factors. Apart from calories, our genes, the trillions of bacteria that live in our gut, food preparation and sleep affect how we process food. Academic discussions of food and nutrition are littered with references to huge bodies of research that still need to be conducted. \u201cNo other field of science or medicine sees such a lack of rigorous studies,\u201d says Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College in London. \u201cWe can create synthetic DNA and clone animals but we still know incredibly little about the stuff that keeps us alive.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know, however, suggests that counting calories is very crude and often misleading. Think of a burger, the kind of food that Camacho eschewed during his early efforts to lose weight. Take a bite and the saliva in your mouth starts to break it down, a process that continues when you swallow, transporting the morsel towards your stomach and beyond to be churned further. The digestive process transforms the protein, carbohydrates and fat in the burger into their basic compounds so that they are tiny enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream via the small intestine to fuel and repair the trillions of cells in the body. But the basic molecules from each macronutrient play very different roles within the body.\n\nAll carbohydrates break down into sugars, which are the body\u2019s main fuel source. But the speed at which your body gets its fuel from food can be as important as the amount of fuel. Simple carbohydrates are swiftly absorbed into the bloodstream, providing a fast shot of energy: the body absorbs the sugar from a can of fizzy drink at a rate of 30 calories a minute, compared with two calories a minute from complex carbohydrates such as potatoes or rice. That matters, because a sudden hit of sugar prompts the rapid release of insulin, a hormone that carries the sugar out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells. Problems arise when there is too much sugar in the blood. The liver can store some of the excess, but any that remains is stashed as fat. So consuming large quantities of sugar is the fastest way to create body fat. And, once the insulin has done its work, blood-sugar levels slump, which tends to leave you hungry, as well as plumper.\n\nGetting fat is a consequence of civilisation. Our ancestors would have enjoyed a heavy hit of sugar perhaps four times a year, when a new season produced fresh fruit. Many now enjoy that kind of sugar kick every day. The average person in the developed world consumes 20 times as much sugar as people did even during Atwater\u2019s time.\n\nBut it is a different story when you eat complex carbohydrates such as cereals. These are strung together from simple carbohydrates, so they also break down into sugar, but because they do so more slowly, your blood-sugar levels remain steadier. The fruit juices that Camacho was encouraged to drink contained fewer calories than one of his wholegrain buns but the bread delivered less of a sugar hit and left him feeling satiated for longer.\n\nOther macronutrients have different functions. Protein, the dominant component of meat, fish and dairy products, acts as the main building block for bone, skin, hair and other body tissues. In the absence of sufficient quantities of carbohydrates it can also serve as fuel for the body. But since it is broken down more slowly than carbohydrates, protein is less likely to be converted to body fat.\n\nFat is a different matter again. It should leave you feeling fuller for longer, because your body splits it into tiny fatty acids more slowly than it processes carbohydrates or protein. We all need fat to make hormones and to protect our nerves (a bit like plastic coating protects an electric wire). Over millennia, fat has also been a crucial way for humans to store energy, allowing us to survive periods of famine. Nowadays, even without the risk of starvation, our bodies are programmed to store excess fuel in case we run out of food. No wonder a single measure \u2013 the energy content \u2013 can\u2019t capture such complexity.\n\nOur fixation with counting calories assumes both that all calories are equal and that all bodies respond to calories in identical ways: Camacho was told that, since he was a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight. Yet a growing body of research shows that when different people consume the same meal, the impact on each person\u2019s blood sugar and fat formation will vary according to their genes, lifestyles and unique mix of gut bacteria.\n\nResearch published this year showed that a certain set of genes is found more often in overweight people than in skinny ones, suggesting that some people have to work harder than others to stay thin (a fact that many of us already felt intuitively to be true). Differences in gut microbiomes can alter how people process food. A study of 800 Israelis in 2015 found that the rise in their blood-sugar levels varied by a factor of four in response to identical food.\n\nSome people\u2019s intestines are 50% longer than others: those with shorter ones absorb fewer calories, which means that they excrete more of the energy in food, putting on less weight.\n\nThe response of your own body may also change depending on when you eat. Lose weight and your body will try to regain it, slowing down your metabolism and even reducing the energy you spend on fidgeting and twitching your muscles. Even your eating and sleeping schedules can be important. Going without a full night\u2019s sleep may spur your body to create more fatty tissue, which casts a grim light on Camacho\u2019s years of early-morning exertion. You may put on more weight eating small amounts over 12-15 hours than eating the same food in three distinct meals over a shorter period.\n\nThere\u2019s a further weakness in the calorie-counting system: the amount of energy we absorb from food depends on how we prepare it. Chopping and grinding food essentially does part of the work of digestion, making more calories available to your body by ripping apart cell walls before you eat it. That effect is magnified when you add heat: cooking increases the proportion of food digested in the stomach and small intestine, from 50% to 95%. The digestible calories in beef rises by 15% on cooking, and in sweet potato some 40% (the exact change depends on whether it is boiled, roasted or microwaved). So significant is this impact that Richard Wrangham, a primatologist at Harvard University, reckons that cooking was necessary for human evolution. It enabled the neurological expansion that created Homo sapiens: powering the brain consumes about a fifth of a person\u2019s metabolic energy each day (cooking also means we didn\u2019t need to spend all day chewing, unlike chimps).\n\nThe difficulty in counting accurately doesn\u2019t stop there. The calorie load of carbohydrate-heavy items such as rice, pasta, bread and potatoes can be slashed simply by cooking, chilling and reheating them. As starch molecules cool they form new structures that are harder to digest. You absorb fewer calories eating toast that has been left to go cold, or leftover spaghetti, than if they were freshly made. Scientists in Sri Lanka discovered in 2015 that they could more than halve the calories potentially absorbed from rice by adding coconut oil during cooking and then cooling the rice. This made the starch less digestible so the body may take on fewer calories (they have yet to test on human beings the precise effects of rice cooked in this way). That\u2019s a bad thing if you\u2019re malnourished, but a boon if you\u2019re trying to lose weight.\n\nDifferent parts of a vegetable or fruit may be absorbed differently too: older leaves are tougher, for example. The starchy interior of sweetcorn kernels is easily digested but the cellulose husk is impossible to break down and passes through the body untouched. Just think about that moment when you look into the toilet bowl after eating sweetcorn.\n\nAs with so many dieters, Camacho\u2019s efforts to accurately track his calories \u201cin\u201d were doomed. But so too were his attempts to track his calories \u201cout\u201d. The message from many public authorities and food producers, especially fast-food companies that sponsor sports events, is that even the unhealthiest foods will not make you fat if you do your part by taking plenty of exercise. Exercise does, of course, have clear health benefits. But unless you\u2019re a professional athlete, it plays a smaller part in weight control than most people believe. As much as 75% of the average person\u2019s daily energy expenditure comes not through exercise but from ordinary daily activities and from keeping your body functioning by digesting food, powering organs and maintaining a regular body temperature. Even drinking iced water \u2013 which delivers no energy \u2013 forces the body to burn calories to maintain its preferred temperature, making it the only known case of consuming something with \u201cnegative\u201d calories. A popular expression in English tells us not to \u201ccompare apples and oranges\u201d and assume them to be the same: yet calories put pizzas and oranges, or apples and ice cream, on the same scale, and deems them equal.\n\nAfter three years of dedicated calorie-counting Camacho changed tack. While recovering from running the 2010 marathon in San Diego he took up Crossfit training, an exercise regime that includes high-intensity training and weightlifting. There he met people using a very different method to control their weight. Like him, they exercised regularly. But rather than limiting their calories, they ate natural foods, what Camacho calls \u201cstuff from a real plant, not an industrial plant\u201d.\n\nFed up with feeling like a hungry failure, he decided to give it a go. He ditched his heavily processed low-calorie products and focused on the quality of his food rather than quantity. He stopped feeling ravenous all the time. \u201cIt sounds simple but I decided to listen to my body and eat whenever I was hungry but only when I was hungry, and to eat real food, not food \u2018products\u2019,\u201d he says. He went back to items that he\u2019d long banned himself from eating. He had his first rasher of bacon in three years and enjoyed cheese, whole-fat milk and steaks.\n\nHe immediately felt less hungry and happier. More surprising, he quickly began to lose his extra fat. \u201cI was sleeping so much better and within a couple of months I stopped the depression and anxiety medication,\u201d he says. \u201cI went from always feeling guilty and angry and afraid to feeling in control of myself and actually proud of my own body. Suddenly I could enjoy eating and drinking again.\u201d\n\nThe weight stayed off and in 2012 he moved to Heidelberg in Germany, a world away from the hectic streets of Mexico, to study for a masters degree in public health. \u201cThe idea hit me that I could combine my own experience with academic work to try to help other people overcome these various barriers that I had found.\u201d After his masters he embarked on a doctorate on how to tackle obesity in Mexico.\n\nToday he is married to a German scholar, Erica Gunther, who has studied food systems around the world. Their diet includes things he used to shun, such as egg yolks, olive oil and nuts. Two days a week the couple stick to vegetarian meals but otherwise he devours steak, kidneys, liver and some of his favourite Mexican dishes \u2013 barbacoa (lamb), carnitas (pork) and tacos with grilled meat.\n\nHis wife enjoys making a traditional Mexican sweet pastry called pan de muerto (bread of death). \u201cBefore I would have run an extra two hours to compensate for eating that but now I don\u2019t care, I just make sure it is a treat, not an everyday thing.\u201d Having spent years trying to forgo alcohol, he has a glass or two of wine several times a week, and goes for a beer with friends from his gym.\n\nSweating through three or four workouts a week, he is as well-muscled as a professional rugby player. A stable 80kg, he has very little body fat, though he is still considered overweight by the body-mass-index charts, which rate many beefed-up professional athletes as too heavy. The only relapse of anxiety he suffers nowadays happens when he hears Tori Amos singing \u201cBliss\u201d \u2013 the song playing when he was kidnapped \u2013 which he says \u201cis a real pity because it\u2019s a great song\u201d.\n\nToday Camacho could be described as a calorie dissident, one of a small but growing number of academics and scientists who say that the persistence of calorie-counting compounds the obesity epidemic, rather than remedying it. Counting calories has disrupted our ability to eat the right amount of food, he says, and has steered us towards poor choices. In 2017 he wrote an academic paper that was one of the most savage attacks on the calorie system published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI\u2019m actually embarrassed at what I used to believe,\u201d he says. \u201cI was doing everything I could to follow the official advice but it was totally wrong and I feel stupid for never even questioning it.\u201d\n\nGiven the vast evidence that calorie-counting is imprecise at best, and contributes to rising obesity at worst, why has it persisted?\n\nThe simplicity of calorie-counting explains its appeal. Metrics that tell consumers the extent to which foods have been processed, or whether they will suppress hunger, are harder to understand. Faced with the calorie juggernaut, none has gained wide acceptance.\n\nThe scientific and health establishment knows that the current system is flawed. A senior adviser to the UN \u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in 2002 that the Atwater \u201cfactors\u201d of 4-4-9 at the heart of the calorie-counting system were \u201ca gross oversimplification\u201d and so inaccurate that they could mislead consumers into choosing unhealthy products because they understate the calories in some carbohydrates. The organisation said it would give \u201cfurther consideration\u201d to overhauling the system but 17 years later there is little momentum for change. It even rejected the idea of harmonising the many methods that are used in different countries \u2013 a label in Australia can give a different count from one in America for the same product.\n\nOfficials at the WHO also acknowledge the problems of the current system, but say it is so entrenched in consumer behaviour, public policy and industry standards that it would be too expensive and disruptive to make big changes. The experiments that Atwater conducted a century ago, without calculators or computers, have never been repeated even though our understanding of how our bodies work is vastly improved. There is little funding or enthusiasm for such work. As Susan Roberts at Tufts University says, collecting and analysing faeces \u201cis the worst research job in the world\u201d.\n\nThe calorie system, says Camacho, lets food producers off the hook: \u201cThey can say, \u2018We\u2019re not responsible for the unhealthy products we sell, we just have to list the calories and leave it to you to manage your own weight\u2019.\u201d Camacho and other calorie dissidents argue that sugar and highly processed carbohydrates play havoc with people\u2019s hormonal systems. Higher insulin levels mean more energy is converted into fat tissues leaving less available to fuel the rest of the body. That in turn drives hunger and overeating. In other words the constant hunger and fatigue suffered by Camacho and other dieters may be symptoms of being overweight, rather than the cause of the problem. Yet much of the food industry defends the status quo too. To change how we assess the energy and health values of food would undermine the business model of many companies.\n\nThe only major organisation to shift the emphasis beyond calories is one dedicated to helping its customers slim down: Weight Watchers. In 2001 the world\u2019s best-known dieting firm introduced a points system that moved away from focusing exclusively on calories to also classifying foods according to their sugar and saturated fat content, and their impact on appetite. Chris Stirk, the firm\u2019s general manager in Britain, says the organisation made the change because relying on calories to lose weight is \u201coutdated\u201d: \u201cScience evolves daily, monthly, yearly, let alone since the 1800s.\u201d\n\nMany of us know instinctively that not all calories are the same. A lollipop and an apple may contain similar numbers of calories but the apple is clearly better for us. But after a lifetime of hearing about the calorie and its role in supposedly foolproof diet advice we could be forgiven for being confused about how best to eat. It\u2019s time to lay it to rest.\u2022"

    "title": "How Turkish coffee destroyed an empire",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "It\u2019s known as Greek coffee to Greeks and Cypriots, Bosnian coffee to Bosnians, Armenian coffee to Armenians, Arabic coffee to Arabs, and Turkish coffee to Turks, Croatians, Albanians and Serbs. But in the mid-16th century, it was just kahve \u2013 coffee. At the time, these people were ruled over by the Ottoman Empire, which swept kahve-lovers from south-eastern Europe to Persia into its wide embrace. But by the early years of the 19th century, the empire was beginning to fracture. Kahve played a little-known role in its eventual demise.\n\nCoffee came to Turkey during the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. When the man he despatched to govern Yemen came across an energising drink known there as qahwah, he brought it back to the Ottoman court in Constantinople, where it was an instant hit. A palace kahveci usta, or coffee-master, might have tens of assistants helping him grind Arabica beans into an extra-fine powder similar in texture to today\u2019s instant espresso. This was then boiled in copper pots called cezves. The resulting drink \u2013 bitter, black and topped with a thin layer of froth created by pouring it quickly \u2013 was served in small porcelain cups. To balance its bitterness, legend has it, Suleiman\u2019s wife, H\u00fcrrem Sultan, took her kahve with a glass of water and a square of Turkish Delight \u2013 which is how it is served in Turkey today.\n\nNot everyone, however, believed that the Koran permitted Muslims to drink this stimulating new beverage. Although Islamic scripture doesn\u2019t specifically mention coffee, one hardline cleric in Suleiman\u2019s court issued a fatwa against the drink on the grounds that consuming anything burnt was forbidden. But that didn\u2019t dampen its appeal. The first public coffee house, or kahvehane, was founded in Istanbul in 1555 by two Syrian merchants. Soon, nearly one in six shops in the city \u2013 ranging in size from small neighbourhood caf\u00e9s to large community centres \u2013 served coffee. Gradually, kahve percolated through to the far reaches of the empire.\n\nTurkish delight The owner of an antique shop in the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul sips a cup of Turkish coffee\n\nCoffee houses gave men somewhere to congregate other than in homes, mosques or markets, providing a place for them to socialise, exchange information, entertain \u2013 and be educated. Literate members of society read aloud the news of the day; janissaries, members of an elite cadre of Ottoman troops, planned acts of protest against the Sultan; officials discussed court intrigue; merchants exchanged rumours of war. And the illiterate majority listened in. In the coffee houses they were introduced to ideas that spelled trouble for the Ottoman state: rebellion, self-determination and the fallibility of the powerful.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the authorities began to regard the kahvehane as a threat. Some sultans installed spies in coffee houses to gauge public opinion; others, like Murad IV, an early-18th-century sultan, tried shutting them down altogether. But they were too profitable. When simmering nationalist movements came to a boil throughout Ottoman lands in the 19th century, the popularity of coffee houses burgeoned. Ethnic groups in European regions of the empire with an Eastern Orthodox Christian majority started agitating for independence. Nationalist leaders planned their tactics and cemented alliances in the coffee houses of Thessaloniki, Sofia and Belgrade. Their caffeine-fuelled efforts succeeded with the establishment of an independent Greece in 1821, Serbia in 1835, and Bulgaria in 1878. The reign of kahve was over.\n\nThe different nations added signature twists to the drink: Greeks make it with mastic, a plant resin; Croatians caraway seeds; Arabs infuse it with cardamom and serve it in small cups without handles called finjans. Even when taken sade, or plain, the flavour profile depends on the roast; the medium-to-darker beans of the Turkish variety produce coffee with an earthy taste, smoky notes and thick texture. When you drain your cup, you will see fine grains coating the bottom. The effects soon hit. Emperors of the world, beware."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The island of Murano is not what it used to be. For centuries this dot of land 2km from Venice was the centre of the global glass industry. Its densely packed furnaces churned out chandeliers, vases, goblets and gewgaws, from colourful clowns and twirling dancers to prancing horses and pouting fish. As recently as the 1970s, there were more than 800 furnaces doing a brisk trade on the island.\n\nBut times have changed. An influx of cheaper glass from China put many Venetian companies out of business. And many consumers no longer wanted the elaborately shaped, lurid pieces that many Murano blowers specialised in. Today there are fewer than 80 furnaces left, and many of the island\u2019s old industrial buildings wear for-sale signs.\n\nFrom left to right \u201cHollow\u201d by Dan Yeffet, from \u00a34,800. \u201cSleeve\u201d by John Pawson, from \u00a3800. \u201cNASSE\u201d by Marco Zito and BTM, from \u00a33,000. \u201cCalliope\u201d by Marcel Wanders, from \u00a3800. All available from WonderGlass\n\nNecessity, though, is the mother of invention. \u201cMurano seemed to be in terminal decline,\u201d says David Landau, a Swiss collector who lives in Venice, where he founded Le Stanze del Vetro, a museum dedicated to Venetian glass on San Giorgio Maggiore, another of Venice\u2019s islands. \u201cBut Murano people have realised that if they close themselves off, it\u2019s not going to work. There has been a slow but inexorable reopening of Murano to the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cTower\u201d (2017) by Tony Cragg\n\nPhoto: Francesco Allegretto, Courtesy the artist and Berengo Studio\n\nOne morning in December I took a water taxi to the island with Maurizio Mussati and his son Christian. Italians who are based in London, they founded a company called WonderGlass in 2013, which commissions international designers to create pieces in collaboration with Murano\u2019s glassblowers. The first person they turned to was Nao Tamura, a young Japanese designer who they hired as WonderGlass\u2019s first art director. Tamura was an unlikely candidate for the job: she had never worked with glass and had never been to Venice. But her inexperience proved valuable. \u201cI had a fresh eye for it,\u201d she says.\n\nHer eye was drawn to the city itself. \u201cI was in Venice for the first time, you know, and there\u2019s the water and the reflection. It was like there was another city under the water, and I was like a child, it was so beautiful.\u201d She set about synthesising that atmosphere. \u201cI made colour charts of Venice, and I asked a blower to make that kind of subtle colour. Venice has a beautiful palette of colours and I wanted to use the colour of the lagoon, that beautiful blue-green, and also the gradation, which to me was very beguiling.\u201d The result was Flow[T], a range of glass pendants resembling water droplets at different stages of their fall, with a horizon line running through their centre.\n\nThe restraint and subtlety of Tamura\u2019s work set the tone. It has been followed by pieces such as Zaha Hadid\u2019s \u201cLuma\u201d, an elegantly fluted pendant in pale grey which hangs from the ceiling like a giant upturned wine glass, and Cristina Celestino\u2019s \u201cPhysalis\u201d, a beautifully organic bud made from sunset-pink Pulegoso glass, with a distinctive rough surface created by thousands of tiny bubbles. More recently WonderGlass has moved into objects and furniture, cast in a factory near Venice, like the series of candy-coloured vessels and ornaments by the French designers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, launched in 2018, and \u201cMelt\u201d, a range of transparent glass furniture by the Japanese firm Nendo, unveiled at this year\u2019s Cologne furniture fair. WonderGlass has put the ancient skills of Venice\u2019s glassmakers to new uses.\n\nMost of Murano\u2019s remaining glassblowers now make tat for tourists. The importance of outside influence is not lost on those who want to do something different. Dario Stellon spent two decades as a blower at Salviati, one of Murano\u2019s oldest glass companies, before being laid off. In 2016 he started a new venture called BTM , which stands for Break the Mould. The firm\u2019s mission is twofold: to make its own products, and to collaborate with companies such as WonderGlass. Without the input of foreign designers, Stellon fears that local skills will atrophy. People from the world of design \u201cpush you to your limits\u201d, he says: \u201cIf you close yourself off and do fish all day, that\u2019s all you can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cGartenzwerge\u201d (2017) by Thomas Sch\u00fctte\n\nPhoto: Trevor Good, Courtesy the artist and carlier | gebauer\n\nArguably, the person pushing these limits furthest is Adriano Berengo. He arrived on Murano almost 30 years ago, bringing local artists to the island to work in glass. More recently he has been working with \u201cblue-chip artists\u201d, as he calls them, such as Jake and Dinos Chapman, Ai Weiwei, Tony Cragg and Thomas Sch\u00fctte. Like Tamura, many of them have never worked in glass before. Instead of transferring their ideas from one medium to another, Berengo says, they have to \u201cbegin to think in glass\u201d. Some have failed. Tracey Emin\u2019s \u201cDocket\u201d, a feline sculpture made in 2013, could have been crafted from anything. Others have adapted beautifully. Cragg\u2019s \u201cUntitled\u201d (2015), a series of quirky abstract sculptures in transparent glass, captures the liquid quality of the material. He has followed it with a collection of totems formed from glass blocks, like tottering towers of ice cubes.\n\nHaving imported designers and artists, Murano is now beginning to export their creations. Berengo has exhibited their work in London, New York and Stockholm as part of an exhibition of glass art called \u201cGlasstress\u201d. In 2020, it will travel to St Petersburg, Istanbul and Beijing. This year Venice will host its third Glass Week, a jamboree of exhibitions and events organised by David Landau, among others. \u201cWhat is unique to Murano is the richness of its tradition, and the ability of its glassblowers to command almost any technique,\u201d Landau says. \u201cThe spirit of experimentation that had gone astray ten years ago seems to have come back.\u201d"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The decision to commute Johnson\u2019s sentence sparked fury back in Gadsden. Richardson remained in custody there, though he had never been charged with any crime. A mob of some 25 men massed on the prison, forcing the jailer and his wife out the back door at gunpoint. They had been drinking, according to the county sheriff; they wanted blood, not justice. Richardson was huddled in a corner when they arrived, mute, barefoot and dressed only in his nightshirt. They seized him and dragged him through town, beating him all the way to a railroad bridge that spanned the Coosa River. They shot him several times. Then they hung him from the bridge and left his body dangling over the roaring river.\n\nA photograph taken just afterwards shows Richardson\u2019s body, lifeless and limp, his legs tucked under him, his eyes shut and his mouth hanging open. Two men flank him: one, wearing a broad-brimmed hat and rustic clothes, holds a handkerchief over his nose and mouth; the other, in a natty overcoat and bowler hat \u2013 it was Sunday morning; perhaps he was on his way to church \u2013 is smirking as he looks down at the body. The lynching was a public event. But nobody has ever been convicted for Bunk Richardson\u2019s murder.\n\nThe memory of Richardson\u2019s lynching \u2013 and the hate that drove it \u2013 still haunts the black community of Gadsden. Vanessa Croft, a former television-news anchor who grew up in the town, believes that her grandfather was among those who witnessed the killing. A bloodthirsty mob of dozens dragging someone through town would have made a lot of noise (this was 1906 \u2013 before the cacophony of cars, television and radio). Croft\u2019s grandfather lived on the other side of the bridge from which Richardson was hanged.\n\nEven had he not seen the murder, he would have understood the omnipresent threat of racist violence. When his son (Croft\u2019s uncle) Fred, was 15, sometime in the late 1920s or early 1930s \u2013 Croft isn\u2019t exactly sure \u2013 a group of white men came to her grandfather\u2019s house. A young, white girl said that someone had pushed her off a porch. The men thought Fred had done it though there was no evidence to suggest that he had. Her grandfather told them that Fred wasn\u2019t at home. They left, warning him they would be back.\n\nHaving grown up in Alabama and heard about the lynching of Buck Richardson, Croft\u2019s grandfather knew what it meant when white men hungry for revenge warned that they would return. Fred was immediately sent off to Chattanooga, around 90 miles away in Tennessee, at the farthest end of the train line that ran out of Gadsden. He moved from there to Harlem, New York. He did not see his brother again for more than a decade \u2013 and only then because each of their ships docked at Pearl Harbour at the same time during the second world war.\n\nIn 1877 President Rutherford Hayes withdrew the last federal troops from the South, where they had been stationed since the conclusion of the American civil war 11 years earlier. While they were there, emancipated black Americans voted, went to school and served as judges, senators and congressmen. After they left, the southern states that had seceded from the Union to preserve slavery systematically restored de facto and de jure white supremacy.\n\nBetween 1877 and 1950, more than 4,000 African-American men, women and children were lynched: summarily murdered, often in broad daylight. Some were killed on remote rural byways. Many were strung up on courthouse lawns in front of hundreds of white spectators. Sometimes the lynchers overwhelmed local law enforcement. Yet often police acquiesced; sometimes even helping the murderers. The perpetrators were not outlaws. They were often pillars of their communities: wealthy planters and business owners, employers, neighbours.\n\nThe murders they committed were not centrally planned, as were more recent atrocities in Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia. But they were certainly state-sanctioned. Judges rarely convicted lynchers; Southern segregationists in the senate repeatedly blocked anti-lynching legislation.\n\nLynchings \u2013 and the threat of them \u2013 were designed both to terrify African-Americans and display collective white-American power. I mentioned to an older, conservative white man from a western state that I was writing about lynching. \u201cStringin\u2019 \u2018em up\u201d was part of frontier justice, he replied, and it was. In places with little or no formal law enforcement, sometimes criminals were hanged. But lynching black men, women and children was not a method of delivering rough justice. It was a means to perpetuate injustice.\n\nAmong the excuses for murdering African-American men were false accusations of rape, \u201calleged well poisoning\u201d, \u201cinsulting whites\u201d, \u201cstealing hogs\u201d, or being \u201csaucy to white people\u201d, wrote Ida Wells-Barnett, an African-American journalist who led a campaign against lynching in the late 19th century. In Blakely, Georgia in 1919, a veteran returning from the first world war was beaten to death for refusing to remove his uniform. Two years later near Memphis, Tennessee a black man accused of murder was burned to death in front of his family. It took 40 minutes; twice the lynch mob stopped him from hastening his own death by swallowing hot coals. In many cases African-Americans were lynched for no recorded offence at all. \u201cLynch Law has become so common in the United States,\u201d wrote Wells-Barnett, \u201cthat the finding of a dead body of a Negro, suspended between heaven and earth to the limb of a tree, is of so slight importance that neither the civil authorities nor press agencies consider the matter worth investigating.\u201d\n\nLynching took a long time to die out. In Alabama in 1981 Michael Donald, a 19-year-old who had the misfortune to cross paths with two Klansmen upset that a black defendant had been acquitted, was hanged from a tree. Croft says that she grew up in Alabama in the 1960s and 1970s, surrounded by a warm and protective family: \u201cI had everything I needed\u201d. Yet the shadow of racial hatred was never distant. After the father of one of her friends moved into a white neighbourhood, Ku Klux Klan members walked up to his front door one night, rang the bell and shot him.\n\nShe recalls parading with her school\u2019s band and seeing a grown man spit on her friend \u2013 an 11-year-old girl. When she and other students marched for civil rights, the Klan marched right behind them. As late as the 1990s, when her mother conducted voter-registration drives, Croft says that the registrar insisted she pronounce every name on her list of voters in a manner he deemed correct before he would process the forms. Just recently, Croft says, she was followed home by two men flying a huge Confederate flag off the back of their truck.\n\nThe legacy of fear has had profound consequences that persist today. Jhacova Williams, an economist at Louisiana State University, has shown that Southern counties with high lynching rates between 1882 and 1930 still have lower black-voter registration rates today, and individual African-Americans who live in counties with high historic lynching rates are less likely to vote than their white counterparts. She argues that voting is a social norm, and in areas where violence kept black people from voting, that norm never took hold.\n\nAcross Germany, more than 70,000 stolpersteine \u2013 raised concrete cubes embedded in the ground \u2013 mark the last known residences of people whom the Nazis murdered. The Apartheid Museum sits in the heart of Johannesburg. Those countries have faced up to their past atrocities sins in part because the political regimes that directed them are no longer in place. But America had no transfer of power. The South\u2019s secessionist government, the Confederacy, founded to protect southern white people\u2019s right to enslave African-Americans lost the civil war in 1865. But its remnants were absorbed into the American body politic. And the tension at the heart of the American experiment \u2013 between a promise of \u201cliberty and justice for all\u201d and the reality of wealth drawn from slave labour \u2013 remained unresolved.\n\nFormer Confederate soldiers went on to serve in Congress \u2013 the legislature of the county they rebelled against. Southern cities and states erected statues honouring them, and segregationists served as senators, congressmen and governors well into the late 20th century. Strom Thurmond ran for president on a segregationist platform in 1948, and served in the senate from 1954 until 2003. Robert Byrd founded a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1940s and served in the Senate from 1958 until 2010.\n\nPeople seeking national office pandered to bigotry: Ronald Reagan kicked off his presidential campaign in 1980 by telling an audience in Philadelphia, Mississippi \u2013 where just 16 years earlier Klansmen murdered three civil-rights workers \u2013 that he believed in \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d (which is how segregationists often framed their resistance to federally ordered integration: they believed that states had the right to abrogate their own citizens\u2019 constitutional rights) And just four years after Americans re-elected a black president, they elected a nativist who exploited antipathy among white Americans to Mexicans and Muslims."

To do this, the successful candidate will collaborate with section editors and news editors around the world, and colleagues who produce our films, podcasts, Snapchat editions and Instagram Stories.\n\nAre you a diligent writer who can absorb an article and turn out tweets that will shine while linking to it? Are you looking for a role where you can learn, experiment and work with some of the world\u2019s smartest journalists and editors? Are you eager to help shape and improve The Economist\u2019s presence on social and digital platforms?\n\nIf you answer yes to these questions, we\u2019d like to hear from you.

    "title": "Death of the calorie",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The first time that Salvador Camacho thought he was going to die he was sitting in his father\u2019s Chrysler sedan with a friend listening to music. The 22-year-old engineering student was parked near his home in the central Mexican city of Toluca and in the fading evening light he didn\u2019t notice two tattooed men approach. Tori Amos\u2019s hit, \u201cBliss\u201d, had just started playing when the gang members pointed guns at the young men.\n\nSo began a 24-hour ordeal. Strong willed and solidly built, Camacho was singled out as the more stubborn of the pair. He was blindfolded and beaten. One robber eventually threw him to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head and told him it was time to die. He passed out, waking in a field with his hands tied behind his back, almost naked.\n\nCamacho survived but, traumatised, he sank into depression. Soon he was drinking heavily and binge eating. His weight ballooned from a trim 70kg to 103kg.\n\nThat led to his second near-death experience, eight years later, in 2007. He remembers waking up and blinking at bright lights: he was being wheeled on a stretcher into a hospital emergency ward, with an attack of severe arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat. \u201cA cardiologist told me that if I didn\u2019t lose weight and get my health under control I would be dead in five years,\u201d he says.\n\nThat second crisis forced Camacho belatedly to deal with the trauma of the first. To help with what he now understands was post-traumatic stress disorder, he started having counselling and taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs. To address his physical health, he tried to lose weight. This effort propelled him to the centre of one of the most fraught scientific debates of our age: the calorie wars, a fierce disagreement about diet and weight control.\n\nToday, more than a decade after his cardiologist\u2019s stark warning, Camacho lives in the Swiss city of Basel. He is relaxed and confident, except when two topics come up. When he recounts his kidnapping his gaze drops, his smile vanishes and he becomes noticeably quieter, although he says his panic attacks have virtually disappeared. The other touchy topic is weight control, which causes him to shake his head in anger at what he and millions of other dieters have gone through. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d he says with exasperation and a touch of venom. \u201cPeople are living with real pain and guilt and all they get is advice that is confused or just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nThe guidance that Camacho\u2019s doctors gave him, along with a string of nutritionists and his own online research, was unanimous. It would be familiar to the millions of people who have ever tried to diet. \u201cEverybody tells you that to lose weight you have to eat less and move more,\u201d he says, \u201cand the way to do that is to count your calories.\u201d\n\nAt his heaviest, Camacho\u2019s body-mass index \u2013 the ratio of his height to his weight \u2013 reached 35.6, well above the 30 mark that doctors define as clinically obese. Most government guidelines indicated that, as a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight (the target for women is 2,000). Nutritionists told Camacho that if he ate fewer than 2,000 calories a day, a weekly \u201cdeficit\u201d of 3,500 would mean that he would lose 0.5kg a week.\n\nWith a desk job as a planning engineer in a Mexican hospital, he knew it would take real discipline to trim his pudgy frame. But as his kidnappers had quickly realised, he is an unusually determined character. He began getting up before dawn each day to run 10km. He also started accounting for every morsel of food he consumed.\n\n\u201cI filled in Excel spreadsheets every night, every week and every month listing everything I ate. It became a real obsession for me,\u201d says Camacho. Out went the Burger King Whoppers, fried tacos packed with pork and cheese, and tortas (Mexican sandwiches filled with meat, refried beans, avocado and peppers). Out too went his usual steady flow of beer and wine. In came carefully measured low-fat cheese and turkey sandwiches, salads, canned peach juice, Gatorade and Coke Zero, with three Special-K low-calorie diet bars a day.\n\n\u201cI was always tired and hungry and I would get really moody and distracted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking about food all the time.\u201d He was constantly told that if he got the maths right \u2013 consuming fewer calories than he burned each day \u2013 the results would soon show. \u201cI really did everything you are supposed to do,\u201d he insists with the tone of a schoolboy who completed his homework yet still failed a big test. He bought a battery of exercise monitoring devices to measure how many calories he was expending on his runs. \u201cI was told to exercise for at least 45 minutes at least four or five times a week. I actually ran for more than an hour every day.\u201d He kept to low-fat, low-calorie food for three years. It simply didn\u2019t work. At one point he lost about 10kg but his weight rebounded, though he still restricted his calories.\n\nDieters the world over will be familiar with Camacho\u2019s frustrations. Most studies show that more than 80% of people regain any lost weight in the long term. And like him, when we fail, most of us assume that we are too lazy or greedy \u2013 that we are at fault.\n\nAs a general rule it is true that if you eat vastly fewer calories than you burn, you\u2019ll get slimmer (and if you consume far more, you\u2019ll get fatter). But the myriad faddy diets flogged to us each year belie the simplicity of the formula that Camacho was given. The calorie as a scientific measurement is not in dispute. But calculating the exact calorific content of food is far harder than the confidently precise numbers displayed on food packets suggest. Two items of food with identical calorific values may be digested in very different ways. Each body processes calories differently. Even for a single individual, the time of day that you eat matters. The more we probe, the more we realise that tallying calories will do little to help us control our weight or even maintain a healthy diet: the beguiling simplicity of counting calories in and calories out is dangerously flawed.\n\nThe calorie is ubiquitous in daily life. It takes top billing on the information label of most packaged food and drinks. Ever more restaurants list the number of calories in each dish on their menus. Counting the calories we expend has become just as standard. Gym equipment, fitness devices around our wrists, even our phones tell us how many calories we have supposedly burned in a single exercise session or over the course of a day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always thus. For centuries, scientists assumed that it was the mass of food consumed that was significant. In the late 16th century an Italian physician named Santorio Sanctorius invented a \u201cweighing chair\u201d, dangling from a giant scale, in which he sat at regular intervals to weigh himself, everything he ate and drank, and all the faeces and urine he produced. Despite 30 years of compulsive chair dangling, Sanctorius answered few of his own questions about the impact that his consumption had on his body.\n\nOnly later did the focus shift to the energy different foodstuffs contained. In the 18th century Antoine Lavoisier, a French aristocrat, worked out that burning a candle required a gas from the air \u2013 which he named oxygen \u2013 to fuel the flame and release heat and other gases. He applied the same principle to food, concluding that it fuels the body like a slow-burning fire. He built a calorimeter, a device big enough to hold a guinea pig, and measured the heat the creature generated to estimate how much energy it was producing. Unfortunately the French revolution \u2013 specifically the guillotine \u2013 cut short his thinking on the subject. But he had started something. Other scientists later constructed \u201cbomb calori\u00admeters\u201d in which they burned food to measure the heat \u2013 and thus the potential energy \u2013 released from it.\n\nThe calorie \u2013 which comes from \u201ccalor\u201d, the Latin for \u201cheat\u201d \u2013 was originally used to measure the efficiency of steam engines: one calorie is the energy required to heat 1kg of water by one degree Celsius. Only in the 1860s did German scientists begin using it to calculate the energy in food. It was an American agricultural chemist, Wilbur Atwater, who popularised the idea that it could be used to measure both the energy contained in food and the energy the body expended on things like muscular work, tissue repair and powering the organs. In 1887, after a trip to Germany, he wrote a series of wildly popular articles in Century, an American magazine, suggesting that \u201cfood is to the body what fuel is to the fire.\u201d He introduced the public to the notion of \u201cmacronutrients\u201d \u2013 carbohydrates, protein and fat \u2013 so called because the body needs a lot of them.\n\nToday many of us want to monitor our calorie consumption in order to lose or maintain our weight. Atwater, the son of a Methodist minister, was motivated by the opposite concern: at a time when malnutrition was widespread, he sought to help poor people find the most cost-effective items to fill themselves up.\n\nTo see how much energy different macronutrients provided to the body, he fed samples of an \u201caverage\u201d American diet of that era \u2013 which he believed to be heavy in molasses cookies, barley meal and chicken gizzards \u2013 to a group of male students in a basement at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. For up to 12 days at a time a volunteer would eat, sleep and lift weights while sealed inside a six-foot-high chamber measuring four feet wide by seven feet deep. The energy in each meal was calculated by burning identical foods in a bomb calorimeter.\n\nThe walls were filled with water, and changes in its temperature allowed Atwater to calculate how much energy the students\u2019 bodies were generating. His team collected the students\u2019 faeces and burned that too, to see how much energy had been left in the body in the digestion process.\n\nThis was pioneering stuff for the 1890s. Atwater eventually concluded that a gram of either carbohydrate or protein made an average of four calories of energy available to the body, and a gram of fat offered an average of 8.9 calories, a figure later rounded up to nine calories for convenience. We now know far more about the workings of the human body: Atwater was right that some of a meal\u2019s potential energy was excreted, but had no idea that some was also used to digest the meal itself, and that the body expends different amounts of energy depending on the food. Yet more than a century after igniting the faeces of Wesleyan students, the numbers Atwater calculated for each macro\u00adnutrient remain the standard for measuring the calories in any given food stuff. Those experiments were the basis of Salvador Camacho\u2019s daily calorific arithmetic.\n\nAtwater transformed the way the public thought about food, with his simple belief that \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d. He counselled the poor against eating too many leafy green vegetables because they weren\u2019t sufficiently dense in energy. By his account, it made no difference whether calories came from chocolate or spinach: if the body absorbed more energy than it used, then it would store the excess as body fat, causing you to put on weight.\n\nThat idea captured the public imagination. In 1918 the first book was published in America based on the notion that a healthy diet was no more complicated than the simple addition and subtraction of calories. \u201cYou may eat just what you like \u2013 candy, pie, cake, fat meat, butter, cream but count your calories!\u201d wrote Lulu Hunt Peters in \u201cDiet and Health\u201d. \u201cNow that you know you can have the things you like, proceed to make your menus containing very little of them.\u201d The book sold millions.\n\nBy the 1930s the calorie had become entrenched in both the public mind and government policy. Its exclusive focus on the energy content of food, rather than its vitamin content, say, went virtually unchallenged. Rising incomes and greater female participation in the workforce meant that by the 1960s people were eating out more often or buying prepared food, so they wanted more information about what they were consuming. Nutritional information on foodstuffs was widespread but haphazard; many items carried outlandish claims about their health benefits. Labelling became standardised and mandatory in America only in 1990.\n\nThe emphasis and use of this information shifted too. By the late 1960s, obesity was becoming a pressing health concern as people became more sedentary and started eating highly processed foods and lots of sugar. As the number of people who needed to lose weight grew, changing diets became the focus of attention.\n\nSo began the war on fat, in which Atwater\u2019s calorie calculations were an unwitting ally. Because counting calories was seen as an objective arbiter of the health qualities of a foodstuff, it seemed logical that the most calorie-laden part of any food item \u2013 fat \u2013 must be bad for you. By this measure, dishes low in calories, but rich in sugar and carbohydrates, seemed healthier. People were increasingly willing to blame fat for many of the health ills of modern life, helped along by the sugar lobby: in 2016, a researcher at the University of California uncovered documents from 1967 showing that sugar companies secretly funded studies at Harvard University designed to blame fat for the growing obesity epidemic. That the dietary \u201cfat\u201d found in olive oil, bacon and butter is branded with the same word as the unwanted flesh around our middles made it all the easier to demonise.\n\nA US Senate committee report in 1977 recommended a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet for all, and other governments followed suit. The food industry responded with enthusiasm, removing fat, the most calorie-dense of macronutrients, from food items and replacing it with sugar, starch and salt. As a bonus, the thousands of new cheap and tasty \u201clow-cal\u201d and \u201clow-fat\u201d products which Camacho used to diet tended to have longer shelf lives and higher profit margins.\n\nBut this didn\u2019t lead to the expected improvements in public health. Instead, it coincided almost exactly with the most dramatic rise in obesity in human history. Between 1975 and 2016 obesity almost tripled worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ): nearly 40% of over-18s \u2013 some 1.9bn adults \u2013 are now overweight. That contributed to a rapid rise in cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke) which became the leading cause of death worldwide. Rates of type-2 diabetes, which is often linked to lifestyle and diet, have more than doubled since 1980.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only wealthy countries that saw such trends. In Mexico, middle-class urban families such as Camacho\u2019s got fatter too. As a child Camacho was fit and loved playing football. But at the age of ten, in 1988, he was one of many young Mexicans who started stacking on weight as increasing trade with America saw cheap sweets and fizzy drinks flood the shops, a process known as the \u201cCoca-colonisation\u201d of Mexico. \u201cThere were suddenly all these flavours you had never tasted, with chocolates, candies and Dr Pepper,\u201d Camacho remembers: \u201cOvernight I got fat.\u201d When his uncles teased him about his bulging waistline, he cut back on sweets and stayed in good shape until his kidnapping 12 years later. Other Mexicans just kept bulking up. In 2013 Mexico overtook America as the most obese country in the world.\n\nTo combat this trend, governments worldwide have enshrined calorie-counting in policy. The WHO attributes the \u201cfundamental cause\u201d of obesity worldwide to \u201can energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended\u201d. Governments the world over persist in offering the same advice: count and cut calories. This has infiltrated ever more areas of life. In 2018 the American government ordered food chains and vending machines to provide calorie details on their menus, to help consumers make \u201cinformed and healthful decisions\u201d. Australia and Britain are headed in similar directions. Government bodies advise dieters to record their meals in a calorie journal to lose weight. The experimental efforts of a 19th-century scientist stand barely changed \u2013 and are barely questioned.\n\nMillions of dieters give up when their calorie-counting is unsuccessful. Camacho was more stubborn than most. He took photos of his meals to record his intake more accurately, and would log into his calorie spreadsheets from his phone. He thought about every morsel he ate. And he bought a proliferation of gadgets to track his calorie output. But he still didn\u2019t lose much weight.\n\nOne problem was that his sums were based on the idea that calorie counts are accurate. Food producers give impressively specific readings: a slice of Camacho\u2019s favourite Domino\u2019s double pepperoni pizza is supposedly 248 calories (not 247 nor 249). Yet the number of calories listed on food packets and menus are routinely wrong.\n\nSusan Roberts, a nutritionist at Tufts University in Boston, has found that labels on American packaged foods miss their true calorie counts by an average of 18%. American government regulations allow such labels to understate calories by up to 20% (to ensure that consumers are not short-changed in terms of how much nutrition they receive). The information on some processed frozen foods misstates their calorific content by as much as 70%.\n\nThat isn\u2019t the only problem. Calorie counts are based on how much heat a foodstuff gives off when it burns in an oven. But the human body is far more complex than an oven. When food is burned in a laboratory it surrenders its calories within seconds. By contrast, the real-life journey from dinner plate to toilet bowl takes on average about a day, but can range from eight to 80 hours depending on the person. A calorie of carbohydrate and a calorie of protein both have the same amount of stored energy, so they perform identically in an oven. But put those calories into real bodies and they behave quite differently. And we are still learning new insights: American researchers discovered last year that, for more than a century, we\u2019ve been exaggerating by about 20% the number of calories we absorb from almonds.\n\nThe process of storing fat \u2013 the \u201cweight\u201d many people seek to lose \u2013 is influenced by dozens of other factors. Apart from calories, our genes, the trillions of bacteria that live in our gut, food preparation and sleep affect how we process food. Academic discussions of food and nutrition are littered with references to huge bodies of research that still need to be conducted. \u201cNo other field of science or medicine sees such a lack of rigorous studies,\u201d says Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College in London. \u201cWe can create synthetic DNA and clone animals but we still know incredibly little about the stuff that keeps us alive.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know, however, suggests that counting calories is very crude and often misleading. Think of a burger, the kind of food that Camacho eschewed during his early efforts to lose weight. Take a bite and the saliva in your mouth starts to break it down, a process that continues when you swallow, transporting the morsel towards your stomach and beyond to be churned further. The digestive process transforms the protein, carbohydrates and fat in the burger into their basic compounds so that they are tiny enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream via the small intestine to fuel and repair the trillions of cells in the body. But the basic molecules from each macronutrient play very different roles within the body.\n\nAll carbohydrates break down into sugars, which are the body\u2019s main fuel source. But the speed at which your body gets its fuel from food can be as important as the amount of fuel. Simple carbohydrates are swiftly absorbed into the bloodstream, providing a fast shot of energy: the body absorbs the sugar from a can of fizzy drink at a rate of 30 calories a minute, compared with two calories a minute from complex carbohydrates such as potatoes or rice. That matters, because a sudden hit of sugar prompts the rapid release of insulin, a hormone that carries the sugar out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells. Problems arise when there is too much sugar in the blood. The liver can store some of the excess, but any that remains is stashed as fat. So consuming large quantities of sugar is the fastest way to create body fat. And, once the insulin has done its work, blood-sugar levels slump, which tends to leave you hungry, as well as plumper.\n\nGetting fat is a consequence of civilisation. Our ancestors would have enjoyed a heavy hit of sugar perhaps four times a year, when a new season produced fresh fruit. Many now enjoy that kind of sugar kick every day. The average person in the developed world consumes 20 times as much sugar as people did even during Atwater\u2019s time.\n\nBut it is a different story when you eat complex carbohydrates such as cereals. These are strung together from simple carbohydrates, so they also break down into sugar, but because they do so more slowly, your blood-sugar levels remain steadier. The fruit juices that Camacho was encouraged to drink contained fewer calories than one of his wholegrain buns but the bread delivered less of a sugar hit and left him feeling satiated for longer.\n\nOther macronutrients have different functions. Protein, the dominant component of meat, fish and dairy products, acts as the main building block for bone, skin, hair and other body tissues. In the absence of sufficient quantities of carbohydrates it can also serve as fuel for the body. But since it is broken down more slowly than carbohydrates, protein is less likely to be converted to body fat.\n\nFat is a different matter again. It should leave you feeling fuller for longer, because your body splits it into tiny fatty acids more slowly than it processes carbohydrates or protein. We all need fat to make hormones and to protect our nerves (a bit like plastic coating protects an electric wire). Over millennia, fat has also been a crucial way for humans to store energy, allowing us to survive periods of famine. Nowadays, even without the risk of starvation, our bodies are programmed to store excess fuel in case we run out of food. No wonder a single measure \u2013 the energy content \u2013 can\u2019t capture such complexity.\n\nOur fixation with counting calories assumes both that all calories are equal and that all bodies respond to calories in identical ways: Camacho was told that, since he was a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight. Yet a growing body of research shows that when different people consume the same meal, the impact on each person\u2019s blood sugar and fat formation will vary according to their genes, lifestyles and unique mix of gut bacteria.\n\nResearch published this year showed that a certain set of genes is found more often in overweight people than in skinny ones, suggesting that some people have to work harder than others to stay thin (a fact that many of us already felt intuitively to be true). Differences in gut microbiomes can alter how people process food. A study of 800 Israelis in 2015 found that the rise in their blood-sugar levels varied by a factor of four in response to identical food.\n\nSome people\u2019s intestines are 50% longer than others: those with shorter ones absorb fewer calories, which means that they excrete more of the energy in food, putting on less weight.\n\nThe response of your own body may also change depending on when you eat. Lose weight and your body will try to regain it, slowing down your metabolism and even reducing the energy you spend on fidgeting and twitching your muscles. Even your eating and sleeping schedules can be important. Going without a full night\u2019s sleep may spur your body to create more fatty tissue, which casts a grim light on Camacho\u2019s years of early-morning exertion. You may put on more weight eating small amounts over 12-15 hours than eating the same food in three distinct meals over a shorter period.\n\nThere\u2019s a further weakness in the calorie-counting system: the amount of energy we absorb from food depends on how we prepare it. Chopping and grinding food essentially does part of the work of digestion, making more calories available to your body by ripping apart cell walls before you eat it. That effect is magnified when you add heat: cooking increases the proportion of food digested in the stomach and small intestine, from 50% to 95%. The digestible calories in beef rises by 15% on cooking, and in sweet potato some 40% (the exact change depends on whether it is boiled, roasted or microwaved). So significant is this impact that Richard Wrangham, a primatologist at Harvard University, reckons that cooking was necessary for human evolution. It enabled the neurological expansion that created Homo sapiens: powering the brain consumes about a fifth of a person\u2019s metabolic energy each day (cooking also means we didn\u2019t need to spend all day chewing, unlike chimps).\n\nThe difficulty in counting accurately doesn\u2019t stop there. The calorie load of carbohydrate-heavy items such as rice, pasta, bread and potatoes can be slashed simply by cooking, chilling and reheating them. As starch molecules cool they form new structures that are harder to digest. You absorb fewer calories eating toast that has been left to go cold, or leftover spaghetti, than if they were freshly made. Scientists in Sri Lanka discovered in 2015 that they could more than halve the calories potentially absorbed from rice by adding coconut oil during cooking and then cooling the rice. This made the starch less digestible so the body may take on fewer calories (they have yet to test on human beings the precise effects of rice cooked in this way). That\u2019s a bad thing if you\u2019re malnourished, but a boon if you\u2019re trying to lose weight.\n\nDifferent parts of a vegetable or fruit may be absorbed differently too: older leaves are tougher, for example. The starchy interior of sweetcorn kernels is easily digested but the cellulose husk is impossible to break down and passes through the body untouched. Just think about that moment when you look into the toilet bowl after eating sweetcorn.\n\nAs with so many dieters, Camacho\u2019s efforts to accurately track his calories \u201cin\u201d were doomed. But so too were his attempts to track his calories \u201cout\u201d. The message from many public authorities and food producers, especially fast-food companies that sponsor sports events, is that even the unhealthiest foods will not make you fat if you do your part by taking plenty of exercise. Exercise does, of course, have clear health benefits. But unless you\u2019re a professional athlete, it plays a smaller part in weight control than most people believe. As much as 75% of the average person\u2019s daily energy expenditure comes not through exercise but from ordinary daily activities and from keeping your body functioning by digesting food, powering organs and maintaining a regular body temperature. Even drinking iced water \u2013 which delivers no energy \u2013 forces the body to burn calories to maintain its preferred temperature, making it the only known case of consuming something with \u201cnegative\u201d calories. A popular expression in English tells us not to \u201ccompare apples and oranges\u201d and assume them to be the same: yet calories put pizzas and oranges, or apples and ice cream, on the same scale, and deems them equal.\n\nAfter three years of dedicated calorie-counting Camacho changed tack. While recovering from running the 2010 marathon in San Diego he took up Crossfit training, an exercise regime that includes high-intensity training and weightlifting. There he met people using a very different method to control their weight. Like him, they exercised regularly. But rather than limiting their calories, they ate natural foods, what Camacho calls \u201cstuff from a real plant, not an industrial plant\u201d.\n\nFed up with feeling like a hungry failure, he decided to give it a go. He ditched his heavily processed low-calorie products and focused on the quality of his food rather than quantity. He stopped feeling ravenous all the time. \u201cIt sounds simple but I decided to listen to my body and eat whenever I was hungry but only when I was hungry, and to eat real food, not food \u2018products\u2019,\u201d he says. He went back to items that he\u2019d long banned himself from eating. He had his first rasher of bacon in three years and enjoyed cheese, whole-fat milk and steaks.\n\nHe immediately felt less hungry and happier. More surprising, he quickly began to lose his extra fat. \u201cI was sleeping so much better and within a couple of months I stopped the depression and anxiety medication,\u201d he says. \u201cI went from always feeling guilty and angry and afraid to feeling in control of myself and actually proud of my own body. Suddenly I could enjoy eating and drinking again.\u201d\n\nThe weight stayed off and in 2012 he moved to Heidelberg in Germany, a world away from the hectic streets of Mexico, to study for a masters degree in public health. \u201cThe idea hit me that I could combine my own experience with academic work to try to help other people overcome these various barriers that I had found.\u201d After his masters he embarked on a doctorate on how to tackle obesity in Mexico.\n\nToday he is married to a German scholar, Erica Gunther, who has studied food systems around the world. Their diet includes things he used to shun, such as egg yolks, olive oil and nuts. Two days a week the couple stick to vegetarian meals but otherwise he devours steak, kidneys, liver and some of his favourite Mexican dishes \u2013 barbacoa (lamb), carnitas (pork) and tacos with grilled meat.\n\nHis wife enjoys making a traditional Mexican sweet pastry called pan de muerto (bread of death). \u201cBefore I would have run an extra two hours to compensate for eating that but now I don\u2019t care, I just make sure it is a treat, not an everyday thing.\u201d Having spent years trying to forgo alcohol, he has a glass or two of wine several times a week, and goes for a beer with friends from his gym.\n\nSweating through three or four workouts a week, he is as well-muscled as a professional rugby player. A stable 80kg, he has very little body fat, though he is still considered overweight by the body-mass-index charts, which rate many beefed-up professional athletes as too heavy. The only relapse of anxiety he suffers nowadays happens when he hears Tori Amos singing \u201cBliss\u201d \u2013 the song playing when he was kidnapped \u2013 which he says \u201cis a real pity because it\u2019s a great song\u201d.\n\nToday Camacho could be described as a calorie dissident, one of a small but growing number of academics and scientists who say that the persistence of calorie-counting compounds the obesity epidemic, rather than remedying it. Counting calories has disrupted our ability to eat the right amount of food, he says, and has steered us towards poor choices. In 2017 he wrote an academic paper that was one of the most savage attacks on the calorie system published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI\u2019m actually embarrassed at what I used to believe,\u201d he says. \u201cI was doing everything I could to follow the official advice but it was totally wrong and I feel stupid for never even questioning it.\u201d\n\nGiven the vast evidence that calorie-counting is imprecise at best, and contributes to rising obesity at worst, why has it persisted?\n\nThe simplicity of calorie-counting explains its appeal. Metrics that tell consumers the extent to which foods have been processed, or whether they will suppress hunger, are harder to understand. Faced with the calorie juggernaut, none has gained wide acceptance.\n\nThe scientific and health establishment knows that the current system is flawed. A senior adviser to the UN \u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in 2002 that the Atwater \u201cfactors\u201d of 4-4-9 at the heart of the calorie-counting system were \u201ca gross oversimplification\u201d and so inaccurate that they could mislead consumers into choosing unhealthy products because they understate the calories in some carbohydrates. The organisation said it would give \u201cfurther consideration\u201d to overhauling the system but 17 years later there is little momentum for change. It even rejected the idea of harmonising the many methods that are used in different countries \u2013 a label in Australia can give a different count from one in America for the same product.\n\nOfficials at the WHO also acknowledge the problems of the current system, but say it is so entrenched in consumer behaviour, public policy and industry standards that it would be too expensive and disruptive to make big changes. The experiments that Atwater conducted a century ago, without calculators or computers, have never been repeated even though our understanding of how our bodies work is vastly improved. There is little funding or enthusiasm for such work. As Susan Roberts at Tufts University says, collecting and analysing faeces \u201cis the worst research job in the world\u201d.\n\nThe calorie system, says Camacho, lets food producers off the hook: \u201cThey can say, \u2018We\u2019re not responsible for the unhealthy products we sell, we just have to list the calories and leave it to you to manage your own weight\u2019.\u201d Camacho and other calorie dissidents argue that sugar and highly processed carbohydrates play havoc with people\u2019s hormonal systems. Higher insulin levels mean more energy is converted into fat tissues leaving less available to fuel the rest of the body. That in turn drives hunger and overeating. In other words the constant hunger and fatigue suffered by Camacho and other dieters may be symptoms of being overweight, rather than the cause of the problem. Yet much of the food industry defends the status quo too. To change how we assess the energy and health values of food would undermine the business model of many companies.\n\nThe only major organisation to shift the emphasis beyond calories is one dedicated to helping its customers slim down: Weight Watchers. In 2001 the world\u2019s best-known dieting firm introduced a points system that moved away from focusing exclusively on calories to also classifying foods according to their sugar and saturated fat content, and their impact on appetite. Chris Stirk, the firm\u2019s general manager in Britain, says the organisation made the change because relying on calories to lose weight is \u201coutdated\u201d: \u201cScience evolves daily, monthly, yearly, let alone since the 1800s.\u201d\n\nMany of us know instinctively that not all calories are the same. A lollipop and an apple may contain similar numbers of calories but the apple is clearly better for us. But after a lifetime of hearing about the calorie and its role in supposedly foolproof diet advice we could be forgiven for being confused about how best to eat. It\u2019s time to lay it to rest.\u2022"

    "text": "Social media fellowship\n\nThe Economist was founded as a print newspaper in 1843, but today our analysis reaches over 40m people through social media. More people than ever discover us for the first time on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, perhaps through a video or an eye-opening infographic.\n\nThe social media team comprises creative and enthusiastic journalists who join us on one-year fellowships to help shape The Economist\u2019s digital future. We are now recruiting again to that programme.\n\nThe role of fellow is the most junior on our team. It suits a recent graduate of a journalism course or someone who has some limited experience in editorial roles and is ready to take on a full-time role for a year. Applicants should be seeking to establish themselves firmly in an editorial department while learning through doing. The bulk of the work will be to produce posts for a variety of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn for our print and online articles, videos and podcasts. To do this, the successful candidate will collaborate with section editors and news editors around the world, and colleagues who produce our films, podcasts, Snapchat editions and Instagram Stories.\n\nAre you a diligent writer who can absorb an article and turn out tweets that will shine while linking to it? Are you looking for a role where you can learn, experiment and work with some of the world\u2019s smartest journalists and editors? Are you eager to help shape and improve The Economist\u2019s presence on social and digital platforms?\n\nIf you answer yes to these questions, we\u2019d like to hear from you. Send the following items to edsocialjob@economist.com:\n\nCV and cover letter\n\nA single \u2018portfolio\u2019 document including a 400-word post for The Economist Explains blog on a topic of your choice; two tweets and one Facebook post for your blog post; and a 200-word pitch explaining or illustrating how you\u2019d promote or host a conversation about your explainer blog online\n\nSuccessful candidates will be hired on one-year contracts and paid \u00a32,000 per month. The deadline for applications is midnight GMT Sunday, April 7th. Applicants must be eligible to work in the UK. Our preferred start date is June.\n\nRequirements\n\nA junior journalist with proven experience in producing content for social media and digital platforms\n\nSharp attention to detail\n\nEvidence of successful collaboration with colleagues\n\nAn understanding of The Economist\u2019s values, tone and audience\n\nExperience with Adobe Creative Suite, especially Photoshop\n\nAwareness of what different publishers are doing on social media\n\nThe Economist Group values diversity. We are committed to equal opportunities and creating an inclusive environment for all our employees. We welcome applicants regardless of ethnic origin, national origin, gender, race, colour, religious beliefs, disability, sexual orientation or age."

    "text": "GO Right now. The warm, dry season is from December through to April. Summer is cheaper, but it\u2019s the Caribbean hurricane season, right? Barbados gets off lightly, as a rule. Some say that\u2019s because it\u2019s the most easterly island, but Bajuns reckon the native coral stone doesn\u2019t attract the twisters like volcanic islands do.\n\nLOOKS LIKE With your eyes half-closed it could be Kent. Anglican churches by the green, rolling hills and Jacobean planters\u2019 houses. You only know you\u2019re in the Caribbean because the churches have tin roofs (oh, and no one walks alone at night). Plus all those Canadians.\n\nSTAY You like the western, Caribbean side, for azure seas, snorkelling and sunsets. Sandy Lane, in St James\u2019s Parish, is still the best hotel in the Caribbean, beloved by the racing \u2013 and racy \u2013 set. The nearby Coral Reef Club isn\u2019t shabby. But you like it wild, too, on the Atlantic coast."

    "title": "How Turkish coffee destroyed an empire",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "It\u2019s known as Greek coffee to Greeks and Cypriots, Bosnian coffee to Bosnians, Armenian coffee to Armenians, Arabic coffee to Arabs, and Turkish coffee to Turks, Croatians, Albanians and Serbs. But in the mid-16th century, it was just kahve \u2013 coffee. At the time, these people were ruled over by the Ottoman Empire, which swept kahve-lovers from south-eastern Europe to Persia into its wide embrace. But by the early years of the 19th century, the empire was beginning to fracture. Kahve played a little-known role in its eventual demise.\n\nCoffee came to Turkey during the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. When the man he despatched to govern Yemen came across an energising drink known there as qahwah, he brought it back to the Ottoman court in Constantinople, where it was an instant hit. A palace kahveci usta, or coffee-master, might have tens of assistants helping him grind Arabica beans into an extra-fine powder similar in texture to today\u2019s instant espresso. This was then boiled in copper pots called cezves. The resulting drink \u2013 bitter, black and topped with a thin layer of froth created by pouring it quickly \u2013 was served in small porcelain cups. To balance its bitterness, legend has it, Suleiman\u2019s wife, H\u00fcrrem Sultan, took her kahve with a glass of water and a square of Turkish Delight \u2013 which is how it is served in Turkey today.\n\nNot everyone, however, believed that the Koran permitted Muslims to drink this stimulating new beverage. Although Islamic scripture doesn\u2019t specifically mention coffee, one hardline cleric in Suleiman\u2019s court issued a fatwa against the drink on the grounds that consuming anything burnt was forbidden. But that didn\u2019t dampen its appeal. The first public coffee house, or kahvehane, was founded in Istanbul in 1555 by two Syrian merchants. Soon, nearly one in six shops in the city \u2013 ranging in size from small neighbourhood caf\u00e9s to large community centres \u2013 served coffee. Gradually, kahve percolated through to the far reaches of the empire.\n\nTurkish delight The owner of an antique shop in the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul sips a cup of Turkish coffee\n\nCoffee houses gave men somewhere to congregate other than in homes, mosques or markets, providing a place for them to socialise, exchange information, entertain \u2013 and be educated. Literate members of society read aloud the news of the day; janissaries, members of an elite cadre of Ottoman troops, planned acts of protest against the Sultan; officials discussed court intrigue; merchants exchanged rumours of war. And the illiterate majority listened in. In the coffee houses they were introduced to ideas that spelled trouble for the Ottoman state: rebellion, self-determination and the fallibility of the powerful.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the authorities began to regard the kahvehane as a threat. Some sultans installed spies in coffee houses to gauge public opinion; others, like Murad IV, an early-18th-century sultan, tried shutting them down altogether. But they were too profitable. When simmering nationalist movements came to a boil throughout Ottoman lands in the 19th century, the popularity of coffee houses burgeoned. Ethnic groups in European regions of the empire with an Eastern Orthodox Christian majority started agitating for independence. Nationalist leaders planned their tactics and cemented alliances in the coffee houses of Thessaloniki, Sofia and Belgrade. Their caffeine-fuelled efforts succeeded with the establishment of an independent Greece in 1821, Serbia in 1835, and Bulgaria in 1878. The reign of kahve was over.\n\nThe different nations added signature twists to the drink: Greeks make it with mastic, a plant resin; Croatians caraway seeds; Arabs infuse it with cardamom and serve it in small cups without handles called finjans. Even when taken sade, or plain, the flavour profile depends on the roast; the medium-to-darker beans of the Turkish variety produce coffee with an earthy taste, smoky notes and thick texture. When you drain your cup, you will see fine grains coating the bottom. The effects soon hit. Emperors of the world, beware."

    "title": "From Bauhaus to Frauhaus",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "When Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus, his pioneering school of design, in Weimar in 1919, it seemed as though it would be a model of equality and progress. The school, created in the bitter aftermath of the first world war, would be open to \u201cany talented person irrespective of age or sex\u201d. It would be a synthesis of arts and crafts, modernism and tradition, men and women, who together would build a new utopia. This promise proved especially popular with the post-war \u201cNew Woman\u201d. Young, unmarried and with her hair cut short in Bubikopf style, she was no longer governed by Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche: children, kitchen and church. The Bauhaus seemed to be the ideal place to exercise her freedom. In the school\u2019s first year, 84 women enrolled to just 79 men.\n\nAs it turned out, these New Women faced old prejudices. Gropius was worried that the female majority would weaken the school\u2019s reputation. He solved his \u201cFrauenproblem\u201d by falling back on clich\u00e9, sending most of them to the weaving workshop, one of the specialist departments that students were required to join. \u201cWhere there is wool\u201d, said Oskar Schlemmer, a German artist and choreographer who taught at the Bauhaus, \u201cthere is a woman who weaves, if only to kill time.\u201d\n\nThis sexism set the tone. During the Bauhaus\u2019s 14-year existence, women were prevented from choosing their artistic disciplines as men could. Nor were they given decision-making jobs, and very few were offered permanent teaching positions. After the school was raided by the Nazis and closed down in 1933, it was the exiled men who settled in America \u2013 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer \u2013 who told the story and defined the style of the Bauhaus as it has come to be known: the kind of hyper-rational minimalism seen in Mies\u2019s Seagram Building in New York or Breuer\u2019s tubular-steel chairs. The women and their work were sidelined.\n\nJackpot The MT49 teapot by Marianne Brandt\n\nYet female Bauh\u00e4uslers had a lasting influence. They not only designed some of the school\u2019s most beautiful \u2013 and now most collectible \u2013 objects, they also helped to shape its philosophy. The women of the Bauhaus take us closer to the true nature of the enterprise.\n\nIn 1919, a 49-year-old singing teacher from Berlin called Gertrud Grunow arrived at the Bauhaus. She had been invited by Johannes Itten, a Swiss expressionist and mystic who was one of the school\u2019s founding members. Together they taught the Vorkurs, the foundation course that all Bauhaus students were required to take. The classes were strange and esoteric. Grunow focused on the artist\u2019s unconscious experience of the world. She asked students to express themselves through dance and music, and to \u201ctune in\u201d to the \u201charmony\u201d of their sensory organs. Some of her exercises sound silly \u2013 she was known to instruct her classes to \u201cdance the colour blue!\u201d \u2013 but Grunow believed she was perfecting her students\u2019 senses and making them fully alive to their materials, whether that meant the tactility of corrugated cardboard or the effect of light on glass.\n\nDespite being from a more rational school of thought, Gropius made Grunow\u2019s classes compulsory. Her experimental teaching inspired the notion of \u201cMaterielgerecht\u201d: doing justice to a material by exploring it with every sense. This idea became one of the school\u2019s core philosophies, taken up by teachers such as Josef Albers. At the start of one class, Albers gave his charges a sheet of newspaper, telling them, \u201cI want you to respect the material, make it into something meaningful, taking account of its particular properties. If you can do this without using any aids, such as knives, scissors or glue, so much the better.\u201d When he returned, he came back to boats, castles and airplanes, which Albers dismissed as junk: none of these students had respected the inherent qualities of the material. It was a Hungarian architect who had won the game. \u201cAll he had done\u201d, said Albers, \u201cwas fold the newspaper lengthwise, so that it stood upright like two wings.\u201d Experimenting with a material\u2019s properties was the key to good design.\n\nOne of the most successful exponents of this idea was Marianne Brandt. Brandt was a rarity among women in the Bauhaus: through a mixture of tenacity and good fortune she managed to avoid the weaving workshop in favour of metalwork. At first, her progress was slow. \u201cThere was no place for a woman in a metal workshop,\u201d she reflected. \u201cThey expressed their displeasure by giving me all sorts of dull, dreary work. How many little hemispheres did I most patiently hammer out of brittle new silver, thinking that was the way it had to be and all beginnings are hard.\u201d\n\nBut these little hemispheres proved revelatory. When she began working on her own designs, she wanted to return to the \u201csimplest of forms\u201d, creating a geometrical vocabulary of squares, circles and triangles from undecorated, riveted metal. From it she constructed lamps, ashtrays and teapots whose beautiful functionality soon made Brandt the most commissioned of all the metal artists, licensing her products to renowned German factories like Ruppelwerke and K\u00f6rtig & Matthiesen. Her Kandem lamp remains a bestseller today, and her MT 49 teapot, a concoction of circles supporting a spout and a handle made from a semi-circle of ebony, is one of the purest expressions of Bauhaus design. In 2007, an MT 49 sold for $361,000 \u2013 making it one of the most expensive Bauhaus objects ever sold.\n\nFruit of the loom\n\n\u201cBlack White Yellow\u201d (1926) by Anni Albers\n\n\n\nOther women were so thwarted by the school that they were forced elsewhere. Margarete Heymann-Loebenstein was a ceramicist. Under the tutelage of Grunow and Itten, who often asked their students to paint to music, she developed a style of loose, swirling brushwork which is a long way from the rigid geometry the Bauhaus became known for. Though the masters thought she was talented, Heymann-Loebenstein was offered access to the ceramics workshop only on a trial basis. Shunned, she left after a year to set up the Ha\u00ebl ceramics factory with her husband. Her pieces proved popular: at its peak in the early 1930s the factory employed 120 people, and her designs helped to take German pottery into the modern vernacular.\n\nThese women were outliers: most female students were weavers. When Anni Albers arrived at the Bauhaus in 1922 she wanted to study painting, but ended up at the loom. But in her hands, textiles took a painterly quality they had never had before. This was partly down to the master of the weaving workshop, the painter Paul Klee. Albers thought Klee was baffling as a teacher, but learnt about form and composition by looking at his paintings, and took her weaving in bold directions. As well as gridded weaves she created patterns from tangled knots of colour and maze-like networks of lines. The influence travelled in the other direction, too. Klee was affected by the colour achieved by the warp and weft of yarn in woven cloth, which he mimicked in pictures like \u201cNew Harmony\u201d (1936). Looking back on her time at the Bauhaus, Albers once said that \u201cGalleries and museums didn\u2019t show textiles, that was always considered craft and not art.\u201d In 2018 she had her first British retrospective at Tate Modern in London.\n\nThe weaving workshop was not only a centre of artistic innovation but of industrial innovation too. The weavers visited factories and worked out how to incorporate industrial materials into their work. Among their products were experimental synthetic fabrics, like one made from reflective, waxed-cotton thread which went on to be used in aircraft seating and car interiors. Albers created a material from chenille and cellophane, thereby inventing a new type of soundproofing. \u201cFormally as well as technically we invented incessantly,\u201d said Gunta St\u00f6lzl, who joined the weavers in 1920. The irony of Gropius\u2019s treatment of women is that weaving, used as a way to keep women out of the way, became one of the Bauhaus\u2019s most financially successful departments. The money helped sustain the school. But it didn\u2019t buy respect."

Fifty-six C\u00e9zannes are being shown there!\u201d She was eight months pregnant and housebound, yet her mind was teeming with plans. She had already secured her place in art history the year before by becoming the first woman to paint naked self-portraits. One particularly transgressive work, \u201cSelf-Portrait on Her Sixth Wedding Anniversary\u201d (1906, right), depicts her pregnant \u2013 though she was not at the time. Her protruding belly symbolised the germination of her artistic talent. Sadly, Modersohn-Becker\u2019s talent would never be fully realised, and she would never get to see those C\u00e9zannes. She died of a post-partum haeommorage at the end of November 1907, shortly after giving birth to a daughter.\n\nModersohn-Becker is one of the 30 artists whose work is on display in \u201cThe Self-Portrait from Schiele to Beckmann\u201d at the Neue Galerie, a museum in New York City dedicated to German and Austrian art and design from the 20th century. The exhibition includes 70 self-portraits made between 1900 and 1945, a period described by the curators as \u201ca pinnacle of European self-portraiture, second only to the Renaissance.\u201d It\u2019s bookended by two modernist masters, Egon Schiele and Max Beckmann, who sprang from the two dominant artistic movements in Germany and Austria during the first half of the 20th century. Schiele was a proponent of Expressionism, a movement known for its bold use of colour, exaggerated shapes and emphasis on emotion. Beckmann, who had been traumatised by his experiences of life on the front line during the first world war, was a follower of New Objectivity, a style known for its crisply detailed naturalism and its satirical take on Weimar society. It is not surprising that German and Austrian artists gravitated towards the self-portrait during this particularly unstable half-century. Many channelled their anxiety and existential dread onto the canvas, depicting themselves with ambiguous expressions or in visible distress.\n\nAfter what at times can feel like a sombre parade through history, some visitors may crave an aesthetic antidote. The museum offers lighter, more glamorous fare one floor down, where its crown jewel, Gustav Klimt\u2019s \u201cPortrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I\u201d (also known as \u201cThe Woman in Gold\u201d), hangs alongside some of his other sparkling and pastel-coloured paintings. But after spending time with the exhibition\u2019s cast of troubled, introspective, fascinating characters, Klimt\u2019s languid society beauties may seem relatively lacking in substance."

    "text": "The first time that Salvador Camacho thought he was going to die he was sitting in his father\u2019s Chrysler sedan with a friend listening to music. The 22-year-old engineering student was parked near his home in the central Mexican city of Toluca and in the fading evening light he didn\u2019t notice two tattooed men approach. Tori Amos\u2019s hit, \u201cBliss\u201d, had just started playing when the gang members pointed guns at the young men.\n\nSo began a 24-hour ordeal. Strong willed and solidly built, Camacho was singled out as the more stubborn of the pair. He was blindfolded and beaten. One robber eventually threw him to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head and told him it was time to die. He passed out, waking in a field with his hands tied behind his back, almost naked.\n\nCamacho survived but, traumatised, he sank into depression. Soon he was drinking heavily and binge eating. His weight ballooned from a trim 70kg to 103kg.\n\nThat led to his second near-death experience, eight years later, in 2007. He remembers waking up and blinking at bright lights: he was being wheeled on a stretcher into a hospital emergency ward, with an attack of severe arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat. \u201cA cardiologist told me that if I didn\u2019t lose weight and get my health under control I would be dead in five years,\u201d he says.\n\nThat second crisis forced Camacho belatedly to deal with the trauma of the first. To help with what he now understands was post-traumatic stress disorder, he started having counselling and taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs. To address his physical health, he tried to lose weight. This effort propelled him to the centre of one of the most fraught scientific debates of our age: the calorie wars, a fierce disagreement about diet and weight control.\n\nToday, more than a decade after his cardiologist\u2019s stark warning, Camacho lives in the Swiss city of Basel. He is relaxed and confident, except when two topics come up. When he recounts his kidnapping his gaze drops, his smile vanishes and he becomes noticeably quieter, although he says his panic attacks have virtually disappeared. The other touchy topic is weight control, which causes him to shake his head in anger at what he and millions of other dieters have gone through. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d he says with exasperation and a touch of venom. \u201cPeople are living with real pain and guilt and all they get is advice that is confused or just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nThe guidance that Camacho\u2019s doctors gave him, along with a string of nutritionists and his own online research, was unanimous. It would be familiar to the millions of people who have ever tried to diet. \u201cEverybody tells you that to lose weight you have to eat less and move more,\u201d he says, \u201cand the way to do that is to count your calories.\u201d\n\nAt his heaviest, Camacho\u2019s body-mass index \u2013 the ratio of his height to his weight \u2013 reached 35.6, well above the 30 mark that doctors define as clinically obese. Most government guidelines indicated that, as a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight (the target for women is 2,000). Nutritionists told Camacho that if he ate fewer than 2,000 calories a day, a weekly \u201cdeficit\u201d of 3,500 would mean that he would lose 0.5kg a week.\n\nWith a desk job as a planning engineer in a Mexican hospital, he knew it would take real discipline to trim his pudgy frame. But as his kidnappers had quickly realised, he is an unusually determined character. He began getting up before dawn each day to run 10km. He also started accounting for every morsel of food he consumed.\n\n\u201cI filled in Excel spreadsheets every night, every week and every month listing everything I ate. It became a real obsession for me,\u201d says Camacho. Out went the Burger King Whoppers, fried tacos packed with pork and cheese, and tortas (Mexican sandwiches filled with meat, refried beans, avocado and peppers). Out too went his usual steady flow of beer and wine. In came carefully measured low-fat cheese and turkey sandwiches, salads, canned peach juice, Gatorade and Coke Zero, with three Special-K low-calorie diet bars a day.\n\n\u201cI was always tired and hungry and I would get really moody and distracted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking about food all the time.\u201d He was constantly told that if he got the maths right \u2013 consuming fewer calories than he burned each day \u2013 the results would soon show. \u201cI really did everything you are supposed to do,\u201d he insists with the tone of a schoolboy who completed his homework yet still failed a big test. He bought a battery of exercise monitoring devices to measure how many calories he was expending on his runs. \u201cI was told to exercise for at least 45 minutes at least four or five times a week. I actually ran for more than an hour every day.\u201d He kept to low-fat, low-calorie food for three years. It simply didn\u2019t work. At one point he lost about 10kg but his weight rebounded, though he still restricted his calories.\n\nDieters the world over will be familiar with Camacho\u2019s frustrations. Most studies show that more than 80% of people regain any lost weight in the long term. And like him, when we fail, most of us assume that we are too lazy or greedy \u2013 that we are at fault.\n\nAs a general rule it is true that if you eat vastly fewer calories than you burn, you\u2019ll get slimmer (and if you consume far more, you\u2019ll get fatter). But the myriad faddy diets flogged to us each year belie the simplicity of the formula that Camacho was given. The calorie as a scientific measurement is not in dispute. But calculating the exact calorific content of food is far harder than the confidently precise numbers displayed on food packets suggest. Two items of food with identical calorific values may be digested in very different ways. Each body processes calories differently. Even for a single individual, the time of day that you eat matters. The more we probe, the more we realise that tallying calories will do little to help us control our weight or even maintain a healthy diet: the beguiling simplicity of counting calories in and calories out is dangerously flawed.\n\nThe calorie is ubiquitous in daily life. It takes top billing on the information label of most packaged food and drinks. Ever more restaurants list the number of calories in each dish on their menus. Counting the calories we expend has become just as standard. Gym equipment, fitness devices around our wrists, even our phones tell us how many calories we have supposedly burned in a single exercise session or over the course of a day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always thus. For centuries, scientists assumed that it was the mass of food consumed that was significant. In the late 16th century an Italian physician named Santorio Sanctorius invented a \u201cweighing chair\u201d, dangling from a giant scale, in which he sat at regular intervals to weigh himself, everything he ate and drank, and all the faeces and urine he produced. Despite 30 years of compulsive chair dangling, Sanctorius answered few of his own questions about the impact that his consumption had on his body.\n\nOnly later did the focus shift to the energy different foodstuffs contained. In the 18th century Antoine Lavoisier, a French aristocrat, worked out that burning a candle required a gas from the air \u2013 which he named oxygen \u2013 to fuel the flame and release heat and other gases. He applied the same principle to food, concluding that it fuels the body like a slow-burning fire. He built a calorimeter, a device big enough to hold a guinea pig, and measured the heat the creature generated to estimate how much energy it was producing. Unfortunately the French revolution \u2013 specifically the guillotine \u2013 cut short his thinking on the subject. But he had started something. Other scientists later constructed \u201cbomb calori\u00admeters\u201d in which they burned food to measure the heat \u2013 and thus the potential energy \u2013 released from it.\n\nThe calorie \u2013 which comes from \u201ccalor\u201d, the Latin for \u201cheat\u201d \u2013 was originally used to measure the efficiency of steam engines: one calorie is the energy required to heat 1kg of water by one degree Celsius. Only in the 1860s did German scientists begin using it to calculate the energy in food. It was an American agricultural chemist, Wilbur Atwater, who popularised the idea that it could be used to measure both the energy contained in food and the energy the body expended on things like muscular work, tissue repair and powering the organs. In 1887, after a trip to Germany, he wrote a series of wildly popular articles in Century, an American magazine, suggesting that \u201cfood is to the body what fuel is to the fire.\u201d He introduced the public to the notion of \u201cmacronutrients\u201d \u2013 carbohydrates, protein and fat \u2013 so called because the body needs a lot of them.\n\nToday many of us want to monitor our calorie consumption in order to lose or maintain our weight. Atwater, the son of a Methodist minister, was motivated by the opposite concern: at a time when malnutrition was widespread, he sought to help poor people find the most cost-effective items to fill themselves up.\n\nTo see how much energy different macronutrients provided to the body, he fed samples of an \u201caverage\u201d American diet of that era \u2013 which he believed to be heavy in molasses cookies, barley meal and chicken gizzards \u2013 to a group of male students in a basement at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. For up to 12 days at a time a volunteer would eat, sleep and lift weights while sealed inside a six-foot-high chamber measuring four feet wide by seven feet deep. The energy in each meal was calculated by burning identical foods in a bomb calorimeter.\n\nThe walls were filled with water, and changes in its temperature allowed Atwater to calculate how much energy the students\u2019 bodies were generating. His team collected the students\u2019 faeces and burned that too, to see how much energy had been left in the body in the digestion process.\n\nThis was pioneering stuff for the 1890s. Atwater eventually concluded that a gram of either carbohydrate or protein made an average of four calories of energy available to the body, and a gram of fat offered an average of 8.9 calories, a figure later rounded up to nine calories for convenience. We now know far more about the workings of the human body: Atwater was right that some of a meal\u2019s potential energy was excreted, but had no idea that some was also used to digest the meal itself, and that the body expends different amounts of energy depending on the food. Yet more than a century after igniting the faeces of Wesleyan students, the numbers Atwater calculated for each macro\u00adnutrient remain the standard for measuring the calories in any given food stuff. Those experiments were the basis of Salvador Camacho\u2019s daily calorific arithmetic.\n\nAtwater transformed the way the public thought about food, with his simple belief that \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d. He counselled the poor against eating too many leafy green vegetables because they weren\u2019t sufficiently dense in energy. By his account, it made no difference whether calories came from chocolate or spinach: if the body absorbed more energy than it used, then it would store the excess as body fat, causing you to put on weight.\n\nThat idea captured the public imagination. In 1918 the first book was published in America based on the notion that a healthy diet was no more complicated than the simple addition and subtraction of calories. \u201cYou may eat just what you like \u2013 candy, pie, cake, fat meat, butter, cream but count your calories!\u201d wrote Lulu Hunt Peters in \u201cDiet and Health\u201d. \u201cNow that you know you can have the things you like, proceed to make your menus containing very little of them.\u201d The book sold millions.\n\nBy the 1930s the calorie had become entrenched in both the public mind and government policy. Its exclusive focus on the energy content of food, rather than its vitamin content, say, went virtually unchallenged. Rising incomes and greater female participation in the workforce meant that by the 1960s people were eating out more often or buying prepared food, so they wanted more information about what they were consuming. Nutritional information on foodstuffs was widespread but haphazard; many items carried outlandish claims about their health benefits. Labelling became standardised and mandatory in America only in 1990.\n\nThe emphasis and use of this information shifted too. By the late 1960s, obesity was becoming a pressing health concern as people became more sedentary and started eating highly processed foods and lots of sugar. As the number of people who needed to lose weight grew, changing diets became the focus of attention.\n\nSo began the war on fat, in which Atwater\u2019s calorie calculations were an unwitting ally. Because counting calories was seen as an objective arbiter of the health qualities of a foodstuff, it seemed logical that the most calorie-laden part of any food item \u2013 fat \u2013 must be bad for you. By this measure, dishes low in calories, but rich in sugar and carbohydrates, seemed healthier. People were increasingly willing to blame fat for many of the health ills of modern life, helped along by the sugar lobby: in 2016, a researcher at the University of California uncovered documents from 1967 showing that sugar companies secretly funded studies at Harvard University designed to blame fat for the growing obesity epidemic. That the dietary \u201cfat\u201d found in olive oil, bacon and butter is branded with the same word as the unwanted flesh around our middles made it all the easier to demonise.\n\nA US Senate committee report in 1977 recommended a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet for all, and other governments followed suit. The food industry responded with enthusiasm, removing fat, the most calorie-dense of macronutrients, from food items and replacing it with sugar, starch and salt. As a bonus, the thousands of new cheap and tasty \u201clow-cal\u201d and \u201clow-fat\u201d products which Camacho used to diet tended to have longer shelf lives and higher profit margins.\n\nBut this didn\u2019t lead to the expected improvements in public health. Instead, it coincided almost exactly with the most dramatic rise in obesity in human history. Between 1975 and 2016 obesity almost tripled worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ): nearly 40% of over-18s \u2013 some 1.9bn adults \u2013 are now overweight. That contributed to a rapid rise in cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke) which became the leading cause of death worldwide. Rates of type-2 diabetes, which is often linked to lifestyle and diet, have more than doubled since 1980.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only wealthy countries that saw such trends. In Mexico, middle-class urban families such as Camacho\u2019s got fatter too. As a child Camacho was fit and loved playing football. But at the age of ten, in 1988, he was one of many young Mexicans who started stacking on weight as increasing trade with America saw cheap sweets and fizzy drinks flood the shops, a process known as the \u201cCoca-colonisation\u201d of Mexico. \u201cThere were suddenly all these flavours you had never tasted, with chocolates, candies and Dr Pepper,\u201d Camacho remembers: \u201cOvernight I got fat.\u201d When his uncles teased him about his bulging waistline, he cut back on sweets and stayed in good shape until his kidnapping 12 years later. Other Mexicans just kept bulking up. In 2013 Mexico overtook America as the most obese country in the world.\n\nTo combat this trend, governments worldwide have enshrined calorie-counting in policy. The WHO attributes the \u201cfundamental cause\u201d of obesity worldwide to \u201can energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended\u201d. Governments the world over persist in offering the same advice: count and cut calories. This has infiltrated ever more areas of life. In 2018 the American government ordered food chains and vending machines to provide calorie details on their menus, to help consumers make \u201cinformed and healthful decisions\u201d. Australia and Britain are headed in similar directions. Government bodies advise dieters to record their meals in a calorie journal to lose weight. The experimental efforts of a 19th-century scientist stand barely changed \u2013 and are barely questioned.\n\nMillions of dieters give up when their calorie-counting is unsuccessful. Camacho was more stubborn than most. He took photos of his meals to record his intake more accurately, and would log into his calorie spreadsheets from his phone. He thought about every morsel he ate. And he bought a proliferation of gadgets to track his calorie output. But he still didn\u2019t lose much weight.\n\nOne problem was that his sums were based on the idea that calorie counts are accurate. Food producers give impressively specific readings: a slice of Camacho\u2019s favourite Domino\u2019s double pepperoni pizza is supposedly 248 calories (not 247 nor 249). Yet the number of calories listed on food packets and menus are routinely wrong.\n\nSusan Roberts, a nutritionist at Tufts University in Boston, has found that labels on American packaged foods miss their true calorie counts by an average of 18%. American government regulations allow such labels to understate calories by up to 20% (to ensure that consumers are not short-changed in terms of how much nutrition they receive). The information on some processed frozen foods misstates their calorific content by as much as 70%.\n\nThat isn\u2019t the only problem. Calorie counts are based on how much heat a foodstuff gives off when it burns in an oven. But the human body is far more complex than an oven. When food is burned in a laboratory it surrenders its calories within seconds. By contrast, the real-life journey from dinner plate to toilet bowl takes on average about a day, but can range from eight to 80 hours depending on the person. A calorie of carbohydrate and a calorie of protein both have the same amount of stored energy, so they perform identically in an oven. But put those calories into real bodies and they behave quite differently. And we are still learning new insights: American researchers discovered last year that, for more than a century, we\u2019ve been exaggerating by about 20% the number of calories we absorb from almonds.\n\nThe process of storing fat \u2013 the \u201cweight\u201d many people seek to lose \u2013 is influenced by dozens of other factors. Apart from calories, our genes, the trillions of bacteria that live in our gut, food preparation and sleep affect how we process food. Academic discussions of food and nutrition are littered with references to huge bodies of research that still need to be conducted. \u201cNo other field of science or medicine sees such a lack of rigorous studies,\u201d says Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College in London. \u201cWe can create synthetic DNA and clone animals but we still know incredibly little about the stuff that keeps us alive.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know, however, suggests that counting calories is very crude and often misleading. Think of a burger, the kind of food that Camacho eschewed during his early efforts to lose weight. Take a bite and the saliva in your mouth starts to break it down, a process that continues when you swallow, transporting the morsel towards your stomach and beyond to be churned further. The digestive process transforms the protein, carbohydrates and fat in the burger into their basic compounds so that they are tiny enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream via the small intestine to fuel and repair the trillions of cells in the body. But the basic molecules from each macronutrient play very different roles within the body.\n\nAll carbohydrates break down into sugars, which are the body\u2019s main fuel source. But the speed at which your body gets its fuel from food can be as important as the amount of fuel. Simple carbohydrates are swiftly absorbed into the bloodstream, providing a fast shot of energy: the body absorbs the sugar from a can of fizzy drink at a rate of 30 calories a minute, compared with two calories a minute from complex carbohydrates such as potatoes or rice. That matters, because a sudden hit of sugar prompts the rapid release of insulin, a hormone that carries the sugar out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells. Problems arise when there is too much sugar in the blood. The liver can store some of the excess, but any that remains is stashed as fat. So consuming large quantities of sugar is the fastest way to create body fat. And, once the insulin has done its work, blood-sugar levels slump, which tends to leave you hungry, as well as plumper.\n\nGetting fat is a consequence of civilisation. Our ancestors would have enjoyed a heavy hit of sugar perhaps four times a year, when a new season produced fresh fruit. Many now enjoy that kind of sugar kick every day. The average person in the developed world consumes 20 times as much sugar as people did even during Atwater\u2019s time.\n\nBut it is a different story when you eat complex carbohydrates such as cereals. These are strung together from simple carbohydrates, so they also break down into sugar, but because they do so more slowly, your blood-sugar levels remain steadier. The fruit juices that Camacho was encouraged to drink contained fewer calories than one of his wholegrain buns but the bread delivered less of a sugar hit and left him feeling satiated for longer.\n\nOther macronutrients have different functions. Protein, the dominant component of meat, fish and dairy products, acts as the main building block for bone, skin, hair and other body tissues. In the absence of sufficient quantities of carbohydrates it can also serve as fuel for the body. But since it is broken down more slowly than carbohydrates, protein is less likely to be converted to body fat.\n\nFat is a different matter again. It should leave you feeling fuller for longer, because your body splits it into tiny fatty acids more slowly than it processes carbohydrates or protein. We all need fat to make hormones and to protect our nerves (a bit like plastic coating protects an electric wire). Over millennia, fat has also been a crucial way for humans to store energy, allowing us to survive periods of famine. Nowadays, even without the risk of starvation, our bodies are programmed to store excess fuel in case we run out of food. No wonder a single measure \u2013 the energy content \u2013 can\u2019t capture such complexity.\n\nOur fixation with counting calories assumes both that all calories are equal and that all bodies respond to calories in identical ways: Camacho was told that, since he was a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight. Yet a growing body of research shows that when different people consume the same meal, the impact on each person\u2019s blood sugar and fat formation will vary according to their genes, lifestyles and unique mix of gut bacteria.\n\nResearch published this year showed that a certain set of genes is found more often in overweight people than in skinny ones, suggesting that some people have to work harder than others to stay thin (a fact that many of us already felt intuitively to be true). Differences in gut microbiomes can alter how people process food. A study of 800 Israelis in 2015 found that the rise in their blood-sugar levels varied by a factor of four in response to identical food.\n\nSome people\u2019s intestines are 50% longer than others: those with shorter ones absorb fewer calories, which means that they excrete more of the energy in food, putting on less weight.\n\nThe response of your own body may also change depending on when you eat. Lose weight and your body will try to regain it, slowing down your metabolism and even reducing the energy you spend on fidgeting and twitching your muscles. Even your eating and sleeping schedules can be important. Going without a full night\u2019s sleep may spur your body to create more fatty tissue, which casts a grim light on Camacho\u2019s years of early-morning exertion. You may put on more weight eating small amounts over 12-15 hours than eating the same food in three distinct meals over a shorter period.\n\nThere\u2019s a further weakness in the calorie-counting system: the amount of energy we absorb from food depends on how we prepare it. Chopping and grinding food essentially does part of the work of digestion, making more calories available to your body by ripping apart cell walls before you eat it. That effect is magnified when you add heat: cooking increases the proportion of food digested in the stomach and small intestine, from 50% to 95%. The digestible calories in beef rises by 15% on cooking, and in sweet potato some 40% (the exact change depends on whether it is boiled, roasted or microwaved). So significant is this impact that Richard Wrangham, a primatologist at Harvard University, reckons that cooking was necessary for human evolution. It enabled the neurological expansion that created Homo sapiens: powering the brain consumes about a fifth of a person\u2019s metabolic energy each day (cooking also means we didn\u2019t need to spend all day chewing, unlike chimps).\n\nThe difficulty in counting accurately doesn\u2019t stop there. The calorie load of carbohydrate-heavy items such as rice, pasta, bread and potatoes can be slashed simply by cooking, chilling and reheating them. As starch molecules cool they form new structures that are harder to digest. You absorb fewer calories eating toast that has been left to go cold, or leftover spaghetti, than if they were freshly made. Scientists in Sri Lanka discovered in 2015 that they could more than halve the calories potentially absorbed from rice by adding coconut oil during cooking and then cooling the rice. This made the starch less digestible so the body may take on fewer calories (they have yet to test on human beings the precise effects of rice cooked in this way). That\u2019s a bad thing if you\u2019re malnourished, but a boon if you\u2019re trying to lose weight.\n\nDifferent parts of a vegetable or fruit may be absorbed differently too: older leaves are tougher, for example. The starchy interior of sweetcorn kernels is easily digested but the cellulose husk is impossible to break down and passes through the body untouched. Just think about that moment when you look into the toilet bowl after eating sweetcorn.\n\nAs with so many dieters, Camacho\u2019s efforts to accurately track his calories \u201cin\u201d were doomed. But so too were his attempts to track his calories \u201cout\u201d. The message from many public authorities and food producers, especially fast-food companies that sponsor sports events, is that even the unhealthiest foods will not make you fat if you do your part by taking plenty of exercise. Exercise does, of course, have clear health benefits. But unless you\u2019re a professional athlete, it plays a smaller part in weight control than most people believe. As much as 75% of the average person\u2019s daily energy expenditure comes not through exercise but from ordinary daily activities and from keeping your body functioning by digesting food, powering organs and maintaining a regular body temperature. Even drinking iced water \u2013 which delivers no energy \u2013 forces the body to burn calories to maintain its preferred temperature, making it the only known case of consuming something with \u201cnegative\u201d calories. A popular expression in English tells us not to \u201ccompare apples and oranges\u201d and assume them to be the same: yet calories put pizzas and oranges, or apples and ice cream, on the same scale, and deems them equal.\n\nAfter three years of dedicated calorie-counting Camacho changed tack. While recovering from running the 2010 marathon in San Diego he took up Crossfit training, an exercise regime that includes high-intensity training and weightlifting. There he met people using a very different method to control their weight. Like him, they exercised regularly. But rather than limiting their calories, they ate natural foods, what Camacho calls \u201cstuff from a real plant, not an industrial plant\u201d.\n\nFed up with feeling like a hungry failure, he decided to give it a go. He ditched his heavily processed low-calorie products and focused on the quality of his food rather than quantity. He stopped feeling ravenous all the time. \u201cIt sounds simple but I decided to listen to my body and eat whenever I was hungry but only when I was hungry, and to eat real food, not food \u2018products\u2019,\u201d he says. He went back to items that he\u2019d long banned himself from eating. He had his first rasher of bacon in three years and enjoyed cheese, whole-fat milk and steaks.\n\nHe immediately felt less hungry and happier. More surprising, he quickly began to lose his extra fat. \u201cI was sleeping so much better and within a couple of months I stopped the depression and anxiety medication,\u201d he says. \u201cI went from always feeling guilty and angry and afraid to feeling in control of myself and actually proud of my own body. Suddenly I could enjoy eating and drinking again.\u201d\n\nThe weight stayed off and in 2012 he moved to Heidelberg in Germany, a world away from the hectic streets of Mexico, to study for a masters degree in public health. \u201cThe idea hit me that I could combine my own experience with academic work to try to help other people overcome these various barriers that I had found.\u201d After his masters he embarked on a doctorate on how to tackle obesity in Mexico.\n\nToday he is married to a German scholar, Erica Gunther, who has studied food systems around the world. Their diet includes things he used to shun, such as egg yolks, olive oil and nuts. Two days a week the couple stick to vegetarian meals but otherwise he devours steak, kidneys, liver and some of his favourite Mexican dishes \u2013 barbacoa (lamb), carnitas (pork) and tacos with grilled meat.\n\nHis wife enjoys making a traditional Mexican sweet pastry called pan de muerto (bread of death). \u201cBefore I would have run an extra two hours to compensate for eating that but now I don\u2019t care, I just make sure it is a treat, not an everyday thing.\u201d Having spent years trying to forgo alcohol, he has a glass or two of wine several times a week, and goes for a beer with friends from his gym.\n\nSweating through three or four workouts a week, he is as well-muscled as a professional rugby player. A stable 80kg, he has very little body fat, though he is still considered overweight by the body-mass-index charts, which rate many beefed-up professional athletes as too heavy. The only relapse of anxiety he suffers nowadays happens when he hears Tori Amos singing \u201cBliss\u201d \u2013 the song playing when he was kidnapped \u2013 which he says \u201cis a real pity because it\u2019s a great song\u201d.\n\nToday Camacho could be described as a calorie dissident, one of a small but growing number of academics and scientists who say that the persistence of calorie-counting compounds the obesity epidemic, rather than remedying it. Counting calories has disrupted our ability to eat the right amount of food, he says, and has steered us towards poor choices. In 2017 he wrote an academic paper that was one of the most savage attacks on the calorie system published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI\u2019m actually embarrassed at what I used to believe,\u201d he says. \u201cI was doing everything I could to follow the official advice but it was totally wrong and I feel stupid for never even questioning it.\u201d\n\nGiven the vast evidence that calorie-counting is imprecise at best, and contributes to rising obesity at worst, why has it persisted?\n\nThe simplicity of calorie-counting explains its appeal. Metrics that tell consumers the extent to which foods have been processed, or whether they will suppress hunger, are harder to understand. Faced with the calorie juggernaut, none has gained wide acceptance.\n\nThe scientific and health establishment knows that the current system is flawed. A senior adviser to the UN \u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in 2002 that the Atwater \u201cfactors\u201d of 4-4-9 at the heart of the calorie-counting system were \u201ca gross oversimplification\u201d and so inaccurate that they could mislead consumers into choosing unhealthy products because they understate the calories in some carbohydrates. The organisation said it would give \u201cfurther consideration\u201d to overhauling the system but 17 years later there is little momentum for change. It even rejected the idea of harmonising the many methods that are used in different countries \u2013 a label in Australia can give a different count from one in America for the same product.\n\nOfficials at the WHO also acknowledge the problems of the current system, but say it is so entrenched in consumer behaviour, public policy and industry standards that it would be too expensive and disruptive to make big changes. The experiments that Atwater conducted a century ago, without calculators or computers, have never been repeated even though our understanding of how our bodies work is vastly improved. There is little funding or enthusiasm for such work. As Susan Roberts at Tufts University says, collecting and analysing faeces \u201cis the worst research job in the world\u201d.\n\nThe calorie system, says Camacho, lets food producers off the hook: \u201cThey can say, \u2018We\u2019re not responsible for the unhealthy products we sell, we just have to list the calories and leave it to you to manage your own weight\u2019.\u201d Camacho and other calorie dissidents argue that sugar and highly processed carbohydrates play havoc with people\u2019s hormonal systems. Higher insulin levels mean more energy is converted into fat tissues leaving less available to fuel the rest of the body. That in turn drives hunger and overeating. In other words the constant hunger and fatigue suffered by Camacho and other dieters may be symptoms of being overweight, rather than the cause of the problem. Yet much of the food industry defends the status quo too. To change how we assess the energy and health values of food would undermine the business model of many companies.\n\nThe only major organisation to shift the emphasis beyond calories is one dedicated to helping its customers slim down: Weight Watchers. In 2001 the world\u2019s best-known dieting firm introduced a points system that moved away from focusing exclusively on calories to also classifying foods according to their sugar and saturated fat content, and their impact on appetite. Chris Stirk, the firm\u2019s general manager in Britain, says the organisation made the change because relying on calories to lose weight is \u201coutdated\u201d: \u201cScience evolves daily, monthly, yearly, let alone since the 1800s.\u201d\n\nMany of us know instinctively that not all calories are the same. A lollipop and an apple may contain similar numbers of calories but the apple is clearly better for us. But after a lifetime of hearing about the calorie and its role in supposedly foolproof diet advice we could be forgiven for being confused about how best to eat. It\u2019s time to lay it to rest.\u2022"

    "text": "This analysis shouldn\u2019t distract from the fact that this painting is about the fun of mess and childishness. Look on the left and you will see element no.28: that little brown-black coil. It is a turd. Its appearance is unexpected \u2013 we tend to assume art will be serious. But it is an in-joke from Mir\u00f3, a Catalan painter working mostly for snooty French buyers. Educated art-lovers don\u2019t expect to pay good money to see literal crap, so most will miss it, but it would catch the eye of any Catalan peasant. In Catalonia, nothing is so serious or sacred that it can avoid contact with the human bowel. Nativity scenes traditionally include a figure called \u201cEl Caganer\u201d, or \u201cThe Crapper\u201d, squatting and straining while the Son of God lies fresh in his manger.\n\nMost importantly, though, there is loveliness in all this playful doodling. Look again, and you see how carefully the \u201cmess\u201d of it all is done, how neatly and beautifully the colours and shapes fit and float together. This is what you get when you take silliness seriously.\u2022\n\n\n\nMore Mir\u00f3: highlights from \u201cJOAN MIR\u00d3: BIRTH OF THE WORLD\u201d at MoMA"

    "text": "\u201cSelf-portrait on her sixth wedding anniversary\u201d (1906) \u00a9 Museen Bo\u0308ttcherstra\u00dfe, Bremen\n\nIn October 1907 Paula Modersohn-Becker, a painter, excitedly wrote to her mother: \u201cI would like to go to Paris for a week. Fifty-six C\u00e9zannes are being shown there!\u201d She was eight months pregnant and housebound, yet her mind was teeming with plans. She had already secured her place in art history the year before by becoming the first woman to paint naked self-portraits. One particularly transgressive work, \u201cSelf-Portrait on Her Sixth Wedding Anniversary\u201d (1906, right), depicts her pregnant \u2013 though she was not at the time. Her protruding belly symbolised the germination of her artistic talent. Sadly, Modersohn-Becker\u2019s talent would never be fully realised, and she would never get to see those C\u00e9zannes. She died of a post-partum haeommorage at the end of November 1907, shortly after giving birth to a daughter.\n\nModersohn-Becker is one of the 30 artists whose work is on display in \u201cThe Self-Portrait from Schiele to Beckmann\u201d at the Neue Galerie, a museum in New York City dedicated to German and Austrian art and design from the 20th century. The exhibition includes 70 self-portraits made between 1900 and 1945, a period described by the curators as \u201ca pinnacle of European self-portraiture, second only to the Renaissance.\u201d It\u2019s bookended by two modernist masters, Egon Schiele and Max Beckmann, who sprang from the two dominant artistic movements in Germany and Austria during the first half of the 20th century. Schiele was a proponent of Expressionism, a movement known for its bold use of colour, exaggerated shapes and emphasis on emotion. Beckmann, who had been traumatised by his experiences of life on the front line during the first world war, was a follower of New Objectivity, a style known for its crisply detailed naturalism and its satirical take on Weimar society. It is not surprising that German and Austrian artists gravitated towards the self-portrait during this particularly unstable half-century. Many channelled their anxiety and existential dread onto the canvas, depicting themselves with ambiguous expressions or in visible distress.\n\nAfter what at times can feel like a sombre parade through history, some visitors may crave an aesthetic antidote. The museum offers lighter, more glamorous fare one floor down, where its crown jewel, Gustav Klimt\u2019s \u201cPortrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I\u201d (also known as \u201cThe Woman in Gold\u201d), hangs alongside some of his other sparkling and pastel-coloured paintings. But after spending time with the exhibition\u2019s cast of troubled, introspective, fascinating characters, Klimt\u2019s languid society beauties may seem relatively lacking in substance."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The first time that Salvador Camacho thought he was going to die he was sitting in his father\u2019s Chrysler sedan with a friend listening to music. The 22-year-old engineering student was parked near his home in the central Mexican city of Toluca and in the fading evening light he didn\u2019t notice two tattooed men approach. Tori Amos\u2019s hit, \u201cBliss\u201d, had just started playing when the gang members pointed guns at the young men.\n\nSo began a 24-hour ordeal. Strong willed and solidly built, Camacho was singled out as the more stubborn of the pair. He was blindfolded and beaten. One robber eventually threw him to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head and told him it was time to die. He passed out, waking in a field with his hands tied behind his back, almost naked.\n\nCamacho survived but, traumatised, he sank into depression. Soon he was drinking heavily and binge eating. His weight ballooned from a trim 70kg to 103kg.\n\nThat led to his second near-death experience, eight years later, in 2007. He remembers waking up and blinking at bright lights: he was being wheeled on a stretcher into a hospital emergency ward, with an attack of severe arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat. \u201cA cardiologist told me that if I didn\u2019t lose weight and get my health under control I would be dead in five years,\u201d he says.\n\nThat second crisis forced Camacho belatedly to deal with the trauma of the first. To help with what he now understands was post-traumatic stress disorder, he started having counselling and taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs. To address his physical health, he tried to lose weight. This effort propelled him to the centre of one of the most fraught scientific debates of our age: the calorie wars, a fierce disagreement about diet and weight control.\n\nToday, more than a decade after his cardiologist\u2019s stark warning, Camacho lives in the Swiss city of Basel. He is relaxed and confident, except when two topics come up. When he recounts his kidnapping his gaze drops, his smile vanishes and he becomes noticeably quieter, although he says his panic attacks have virtually disappeared. The other touchy topic is weight control, which causes him to shake his head in anger at what he and millions of other dieters have gone through. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d he says with exasperation and a touch of venom. \u201cPeople are living with real pain and guilt and all they get is advice that is confused or just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nThe guidance that Camacho\u2019s doctors gave him, along with a string of nutritionists and his own online research, was unanimous. It would be familiar to the millions of people who have ever tried to diet. \u201cEverybody tells you that to lose weight you have to eat less and move more,\u201d he says, \u201cand the way to do that is to count your calories.\u201d\n\nAt his heaviest, Camacho\u2019s body-mass index \u2013 the ratio of his height to his weight \u2013 reached 35.6, well above the 30 mark that doctors define as clinically obese. Most government guidelines indicated that, as a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight (the target for women is 2,000). Nutritionists told Camacho that if he ate fewer than 2,000 calories a day, a weekly \u201cdeficit\u201d of 3,500 would mean that he would lose 0.5kg a week.\n\nWith a desk job as a planning engineer in a Mexican hospital, he knew it would take real discipline to trim his pudgy frame. But as his kidnappers had quickly realised, he is an unusually determined character. He began getting up before dawn each day to run 10km. He also started accounting for every morsel of food he consumed.\n\n\u201cI filled in Excel spreadsheets every night, every week and every month listing everything I ate. It became a real obsession for me,\u201d says Camacho. Out went the Burger King Whoppers, fried tacos packed with pork and cheese, and tortas (Mexican sandwiches filled with meat, refried beans, avocado and peppers). Out too went his usual steady flow of beer and wine. In came carefully measured low-fat cheese and turkey sandwiches, salads, canned peach juice, Gatorade and Coke Zero, with three Special-K low-calorie diet bars a day.\n\n\u201cI was always tired and hungry and I would get really moody and distracted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking about food all the time.\u201d He was constantly told that if he got the maths right \u2013 consuming fewer calories than he burned each day \u2013 the results would soon show. \u201cI really did everything you are supposed to do,\u201d he insists with the tone of a schoolboy who completed his homework yet still failed a big test. He bought a battery of exercise monitoring devices to measure how many calories he was expending on his runs. \u201cI was told to exercise for at least 45 minutes at least four or five times a week. I actually ran for more than an hour every day.\u201d He kept to low-fat, low-calorie food for three years. It simply didn\u2019t work. At one point he lost about 10kg but his weight rebounded, though he still restricted his calories.\n\nDieters the world over will be familiar with Camacho\u2019s frustrations. Most studies show that more than 80% of people regain any lost weight in the long term. And like him, when we fail, most of us assume that we are too lazy or greedy \u2013 that we are at fault.\n\nAs a general rule it is true that if you eat vastly fewer calories than you burn, you\u2019ll get slimmer (and if you consume far more, you\u2019ll get fatter). But the myriad faddy diets flogged to us each year belie the simplicity of the formula that Camacho was given. The calorie as a scientific measurement is not in dispute. But calculating the exact calorific content of food is far harder than the confidently precise numbers displayed on food packets suggest. Two items of food with identical calorific values may be digested in very different ways. Each body processes calories differently. Even for a single individual, the time of day that you eat matters. The more we probe, the more we realise that tallying calories will do little to help us control our weight or even maintain a healthy diet: the beguiling simplicity of counting calories in and calories out is dangerously flawed.\n\nThe calorie is ubiquitous in daily life. It takes top billing on the information label of most packaged food and drinks. Ever more restaurants list the number of calories in each dish on their menus. Counting the calories we expend has become just as standard. Gym equipment, fitness devices around our wrists, even our phones tell us how many calories we have supposedly burned in a single exercise session or over the course of a day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always thus. For centuries, scientists assumed that it was the mass of food consumed that was significant. In the late 16th century an Italian physician named Santorio Sanctorius invented a \u201cweighing chair\u201d, dangling from a giant scale, in which he sat at regular intervals to weigh himself, everything he ate and drank, and all the faeces and urine he produced. Despite 30 years of compulsive chair dangling, Sanctorius answered few of his own questions about the impact that his consumption had on his body.\n\nOnly later did the focus shift to the energy different foodstuffs contained. In the 18th century Antoine Lavoisier, a French aristocrat, worked out that burning a candle required a gas from the air \u2013 which he named oxygen \u2013 to fuel the flame and release heat and other gases. He applied the same principle to food, concluding that it fuels the body like a slow-burning fire. He built a calorimeter, a device big enough to hold a guinea pig, and measured the heat the creature generated to estimate how much energy it was producing. Unfortunately the French revolution \u2013 specifically the guillotine \u2013 cut short his thinking on the subject. But he had started something. Other scientists later constructed \u201cbomb calori\u00admeters\u201d in which they burned food to measure the heat \u2013 and thus the potential energy \u2013 released from it.\n\nThe calorie \u2013 which comes from \u201ccalor\u201d, the Latin for \u201cheat\u201d \u2013 was originally used to measure the efficiency of steam engines: one calorie is the energy required to heat 1kg of water by one degree Celsius. Only in the 1860s did German scientists begin using it to calculate the energy in food. It was an American agricultural chemist, Wilbur Atwater, who popularised the idea that it could be used to measure both the energy contained in food and the energy the body expended on things like muscular work, tissue repair and powering the organs. In 1887, after a trip to Germany, he wrote a series of wildly popular articles in Century, an American magazine, suggesting that \u201cfood is to the body what fuel is to the fire.\u201d He introduced the public to the notion of \u201cmacronutrients\u201d \u2013 carbohydrates, protein and fat \u2013 so called because the body needs a lot of them.\n\nToday many of us want to monitor our calorie consumption in order to lose or maintain our weight. Atwater, the son of a Methodist minister, was motivated by the opposite concern: at a time when malnutrition was widespread, he sought to help poor people find the most cost-effective items to fill themselves up.\n\nTo see how much energy different macronutrients provided to the body, he fed samples of an \u201caverage\u201d American diet of that era \u2013 which he believed to be heavy in molasses cookies, barley meal and chicken gizzards \u2013 to a group of male students in a basement at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. For up to 12 days at a time a volunteer would eat, sleep and lift weights while sealed inside a six-foot-high chamber measuring four feet wide by seven feet deep. The energy in each meal was calculated by burning identical foods in a bomb calorimeter.\n\nThe walls were filled with water, and changes in its temperature allowed Atwater to calculate how much energy the students\u2019 bodies were generating. His team collected the students\u2019 faeces and burned that too, to see how much energy had been left in the body in the digestion process.\n\nThis was pioneering stuff for the 1890s. Atwater eventually concluded that a gram of either carbohydrate or protein made an average of four calories of energy available to the body, and a gram of fat offered an average of 8.9 calories, a figure later rounded up to nine calories for convenience. We now know far more about the workings of the human body: Atwater was right that some of a meal\u2019s potential energy was excreted, but had no idea that some was also used to digest the meal itself, and that the body expends different amounts of energy depending on the food. Yet more than a century after igniting the faeces of Wesleyan students, the numbers Atwater calculated for each macro\u00adnutrient remain the standard for measuring the calories in any given food stuff. Those experiments were the basis of Salvador Camacho\u2019s daily calorific arithmetic.\n\nAtwater transformed the way the public thought about food, with his simple belief that \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d. He counselled the poor against eating too many leafy green vegetables because they weren\u2019t sufficiently dense in energy. By his account, it made no difference whether calories came from chocolate or spinach: if the body absorbed more energy than it used, then it would store the excess as body fat, causing you to put on weight.\n\nThat idea captured the public imagination. In 1918 the first book was published in America based on the notion that a healthy diet was no more complicated than the simple addition and subtraction of calories. \u201cYou may eat just what you like \u2013 candy, pie, cake, fat meat, butter, cream but count your calories!\u201d wrote Lulu Hunt Peters in \u201cDiet and Health\u201d. \u201cNow that you know you can have the things you like, proceed to make your menus containing very little of them.\u201d The book sold millions.\n\nBy the 1930s the calorie had become entrenched in both the public mind and government policy. Its exclusive focus on the energy content of food, rather than its vitamin content, say, went virtually unchallenged. Rising incomes and greater female participation in the workforce meant that by the 1960s people were eating out more often or buying prepared food, so they wanted more information about what they were consuming. Nutritional information on foodstuffs was widespread but haphazard; many items carried outlandish claims about their health benefits. Labelling became standardised and mandatory in America only in 1990.\n\nThe emphasis and use of this information shifted too. By the late 1960s, obesity was becoming a pressing health concern as people became more sedentary and started eating highly processed foods and lots of sugar. As the number of people who needed to lose weight grew, changing diets became the focus of attention.\n\nSo began the war on fat, in which Atwater\u2019s calorie calculations were an unwitting ally. Because counting calories was seen as an objective arbiter of the health qualities of a foodstuff, it seemed logical that the most calorie-laden part of any food item \u2013 fat \u2013 must be bad for you. By this measure, dishes low in calories, but rich in sugar and carbohydrates, seemed healthier. People were increasingly willing to blame fat for many of the health ills of modern life, helped along by the sugar lobby: in 2016, a researcher at the University of California uncovered documents from 1967 showing that sugar companies secretly funded studies at Harvard University designed to blame fat for the growing obesity epidemic. That the dietary \u201cfat\u201d found in olive oil, bacon and butter is branded with the same word as the unwanted flesh around our middles made it all the easier to demonise.\n\nA US Senate committee report in 1977 recommended a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet for all, and other governments followed suit. The food industry responded with enthusiasm, removing fat, the most calorie-dense of macronutrients, from food items and replacing it with sugar, starch and salt. As a bonus, the thousands of new cheap and tasty \u201clow-cal\u201d and \u201clow-fat\u201d products which Camacho used to diet tended to have longer shelf lives and higher profit margins.\n\nBut this didn\u2019t lead to the expected improvements in public health. Instead, it coincided almost exactly with the most dramatic rise in obesity in human history. Between 1975 and 2016 obesity almost tripled worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ): nearly 40% of over-18s \u2013 some 1.9bn adults \u2013 are now overweight. That contributed to a rapid rise in cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke) which became the leading cause of death worldwide. Rates of type-2 diabetes, which is often linked to lifestyle and diet, have more than doubled since 1980.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only wealthy countries that saw such trends. In Mexico, middle-class urban families such as Camacho\u2019s got fatter too. As a child Camacho was fit and loved playing football. But at the age of ten, in 1988, he was one of many young Mexicans who started stacking on weight as increasing trade with America saw cheap sweets and fizzy drinks flood the shops, a process known as the \u201cCoca-colonisation\u201d of Mexico. \u201cThere were suddenly all these flavours you had never tasted, with chocolates, candies and Dr Pepper,\u201d Camacho remembers: \u201cOvernight I got fat.\u201d When his uncles teased him about his bulging waistline, he cut back on sweets and stayed in good shape until his kidnapping 12 years later. Other Mexicans just kept bulking up. In 2013 Mexico overtook America as the most obese country in the world.\n\nTo combat this trend, governments worldwide have enshrined calorie-counting in policy. The WHO attributes the \u201cfundamental cause\u201d of obesity worldwide to \u201can energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended\u201d. Governments the world over persist in offering the same advice: count and cut calories. This has infiltrated ever more areas of life. In 2018 the American government ordered food chains and vending machines to provide calorie details on their menus, to help consumers make \u201cinformed and healthful decisions\u201d. Australia and Britain are headed in similar directions. Government bodies advise dieters to record their meals in a calorie journal to lose weight. The experimental efforts of a 19th-century scientist stand barely changed \u2013 and are barely questioned.\n\nMillions of dieters give up when their calorie-counting is unsuccessful. Camacho was more stubborn than most. He took photos of his meals to record his intake more accurately, and would log into his calorie spreadsheets from his phone. He thought about every morsel he ate. And he bought a proliferation of gadgets to track his calorie output. But he still didn\u2019t lose much weight.\n\nOne problem was that his sums were based on the idea that calorie counts are accurate. Food producers give impressively specific readings: a slice of Camacho\u2019s favourite Domino\u2019s double pepperoni pizza is supposedly 248 calories (not 247 nor 249). Yet the number of calories listed on food packets and menus are routinely wrong.\n\nSusan Roberts, a nutritionist at Tufts University in Boston, has found that labels on American packaged foods miss their true calorie counts by an average of 18%. American government regulations allow such labels to understate calories by up to 20% (to ensure that consumers are not short-changed in terms of how much nutrition they receive). The information on some processed frozen foods misstates their calorific content by as much as 70%.\n\nThat isn\u2019t the only problem. Calorie counts are based on how much heat a foodstuff gives off when it burns in an oven. But the human body is far more complex than an oven. When food is burned in a laboratory it surrenders its calories within seconds. By contrast, the real-life journey from dinner plate to toilet bowl takes on average about a day, but can range from eight to 80 hours depending on the person. A calorie of carbohydrate and a calorie of protein both have the same amount of stored energy, so they perform identically in an oven. But put those calories into real bodies and they behave quite differently. And we are still learning new insights: American researchers discovered last year that, for more than a century, we\u2019ve been exaggerating by about 20% the number of calories we absorb from almonds.\n\nThe process of storing fat \u2013 the \u201cweight\u201d many people seek to lose \u2013 is influenced by dozens of other factors. Apart from calories, our genes, the trillions of bacteria that live in our gut, food preparation and sleep affect how we process food. Academic discussions of food and nutrition are littered with references to huge bodies of research that still need to be conducted. \u201cNo other field of science or medicine sees such a lack of rigorous studies,\u201d says Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College in London. \u201cWe can create synthetic DNA and clone animals but we still know incredibly little about the stuff that keeps us alive.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know, however, suggests that counting calories is very crude and often misleading. Think of a burger, the kind of food that Camacho eschewed during his early efforts to lose weight. Take a bite and the saliva in your mouth starts to break it down, a process that continues when you swallow, transporting the morsel towards your stomach and beyond to be churned further. The digestive process transforms the protein, carbohydrates and fat in the burger into their basic compounds so that they are tiny enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream via the small intestine to fuel and repair the trillions of cells in the body. But the basic molecules from each macronutrient play very different roles within the body.\n\nAll carbohydrates break down into sugars, which are the body\u2019s main fuel source. But the speed at which your body gets its fuel from food can be as important as the amount of fuel. Simple carbohydrates are swiftly absorbed into the bloodstream, providing a fast shot of energy: the body absorbs the sugar from a can of fizzy drink at a rate of 30 calories a minute, compared with two calories a minute from complex carbohydrates such as potatoes or rice. That matters, because a sudden hit of sugar prompts the rapid release of insulin, a hormone that carries the sugar out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells. Problems arise when there is too much sugar in the blood. The liver can store some of the excess, but any that remains is stashed as fat. So consuming large quantities of sugar is the fastest way to create body fat. And, once the insulin has done its work, blood-sugar levels slump, which tends to leave you hungry, as well as plumper.\n\nGetting fat is a consequence of civilisation. Our ancestors would have enjoyed a heavy hit of sugar perhaps four times a year, when a new season produced fresh fruit. Many now enjoy that kind of sugar kick every day. The average person in the developed world consumes 20 times as much sugar as people did even during Atwater\u2019s time.\n\nBut it is a different story when you eat complex carbohydrates such as cereals. These are strung together from simple carbohydrates, so they also break down into sugar, but because they do so more slowly, your blood-sugar levels remain steadier. The fruit juices that Camacho was encouraged to drink contained fewer calories than one of his wholegrain buns but the bread delivered less of a sugar hit and left him feeling satiated for longer.\n\nOther macronutrients have different functions. Protein, the dominant component of meat, fish and dairy products, acts as the main building block for bone, skin, hair and other body tissues. In the absence of sufficient quantities of carbohydrates it can also serve as fuel for the body. But since it is broken down more slowly than carbohydrates, protein is less likely to be converted to body fat.\n\nFat is a different matter again. It should leave you feeling fuller for longer, because your body splits it into tiny fatty acids more slowly than it processes carbohydrates or protein. We all need fat to make hormones and to protect our nerves (a bit like plastic coating protects an electric wire). Over millennia, fat has also been a crucial way for humans to store energy, allowing us to survive periods of famine. Nowadays, even without the risk of starvation, our bodies are programmed to store excess fuel in case we run out of food. No wonder a single measure \u2013 the energy content \u2013 can\u2019t capture such complexity.\n\nOur fixation with counting calories assumes both that all calories are equal and that all bodies respond to calories in identical ways: Camacho was told that, since he was a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight. Yet a growing body of research shows that when different people consume the same meal, the impact on each person\u2019s blood sugar and fat formation will vary according to their genes, lifestyles and unique mix of gut bacteria.\n\nResearch published this year showed that a certain set of genes is found more often in overweight people than in skinny ones, suggesting that some people have to work harder than others to stay thin (a fact that many of us already felt intuitively to be true). Differences in gut microbiomes can alter how people process food. A study of 800 Israelis in 2015 found that the rise in their blood-sugar levels varied by a factor of four in response to identical food.\n\nSome people\u2019s intestines are 50% longer than others: those with shorter ones absorb fewer calories, which means that they excrete more of the energy in food, putting on less weight.\n\nThe response of your own body may also change depending on when you eat. Lose weight and your body will try to regain it, slowing down your metabolism and even reducing the energy you spend on fidgeting and twitching your muscles. Even your eating and sleeping schedules can be important. Going without a full night\u2019s sleep may spur your body to create more fatty tissue, which casts a grim light on Camacho\u2019s years of early-morning exertion. You may put on more weight eating small amounts over 12-15 hours than eating the same food in three distinct meals over a shorter period.\n\nThere\u2019s a further weakness in the calorie-counting system: the amount of energy we absorb from food depends on how we prepare it. Chopping and grinding food essentially does part of the work of digestion, making more calories available to your body by ripping apart cell walls before you eat it. That effect is magnified when you add heat: cooking increases the proportion of food digested in the stomach and small intestine, from 50% to 95%. The digestible calories in beef rises by 15% on cooking, and in sweet potato some 40% (the exact change depends on whether it is boiled, roasted or microwaved). So significant is this impact that Richard Wrangham, a primatologist at Harvard University, reckons that cooking was necessary for human evolution. It enabled the neurological expansion that created Homo sapiens: powering the brain consumes about a fifth of a person\u2019s metabolic energy each day (cooking also means we didn\u2019t need to spend all day chewing, unlike chimps).\n\nThe difficulty in counting accurately doesn\u2019t stop there. The calorie load of carbohydrate-heavy items such as rice, pasta, bread and potatoes can be slashed simply by cooking, chilling and reheating them. As starch molecules cool they form new structures that are harder to digest. You absorb fewer calories eating toast that has been left to go cold, or leftover spaghetti, than if they were freshly made. Scientists in Sri Lanka discovered in 2015 that they could more than halve the calories potentially absorbed from rice by adding coconut oil during cooking and then cooling the rice. This made the starch less digestible so the body may take on fewer calories (they have yet to test on human beings the precise effects of rice cooked in this way). That\u2019s a bad thing if you\u2019re malnourished, but a boon if you\u2019re trying to lose weight.\n\nDifferent parts of a vegetable or fruit may be absorbed differently too: older leaves are tougher, for example. The starchy interior of sweetcorn kernels is easily digested but the cellulose husk is impossible to break down and passes through the body untouched. Just think about that moment when you look into the toilet bowl after eating sweetcorn.\n\nAs with so many dieters, Camacho\u2019s efforts to accurately track his calories \u201cin\u201d were doomed. But so too were his attempts to track his calories \u201cout\u201d. The message from many public authorities and food producers, especially fast-food companies that sponsor sports events, is that even the unhealthiest foods will not make you fat if you do your part by taking plenty of exercise. Exercise does, of course, have clear health benefits. But unless you\u2019re a professional athlete, it plays a smaller part in weight control than most people believe. As much as 75% of the average person\u2019s daily energy expenditure comes not through exercise but from ordinary daily activities and from keeping your body functioning by digesting food, powering organs and maintaining a regular body temperature. Even drinking iced water \u2013 which delivers no energy \u2013 forces the body to burn calories to maintain its preferred temperature, making it the only known case of consuming something with \u201cnegative\u201d calories. A popular expression in English tells us not to \u201ccompare apples and oranges\u201d and assume them to be the same: yet calories put pizzas and oranges, or apples and ice cream, on the same scale, and deems them equal.\n\nAfter three years of dedicated calorie-counting Camacho changed tack. While recovering from running the 2010 marathon in San Diego he took up Crossfit training, an exercise regime that includes high-intensity training and weightlifting. There he met people using a very different method to control their weight. Like him, they exercised regularly. But rather than limiting their calories, they ate natural foods, what Camacho calls \u201cstuff from a real plant, not an industrial plant\u201d.\n\nFed up with feeling like a hungry failure, he decided to give it a go. He ditched his heavily processed low-calorie products and focused on the quality of his food rather than quantity. He stopped feeling ravenous all the time. \u201cIt sounds simple but I decided to listen to my body and eat whenever I was hungry but only when I was hungry, and to eat real food, not food \u2018products\u2019,\u201d he says. He went back to items that he\u2019d long banned himself from eating. He had his first rasher of bacon in three years and enjoyed cheese, whole-fat milk and steaks.\n\nHe immediately felt less hungry and happier. More surprising, he quickly began to lose his extra fat. \u201cI was sleeping so much better and within a couple of months I stopped the depression and anxiety medication,\u201d he says. \u201cI went from always feeling guilty and angry and afraid to feeling in control of myself and actually proud of my own body. Suddenly I could enjoy eating and drinking again.\u201d\n\nThe weight stayed off and in 2012 he moved to Heidelberg in Germany, a world away from the hectic streets of Mexico, to study for a masters degree in public health. \u201cThe idea hit me that I could combine my own experience with academic work to try to help other people overcome these various barriers that I had found.\u201d After his masters he embarked on a doctorate on how to tackle obesity in Mexico.\n\nToday he is married to a German scholar, Erica Gunther, who has studied food systems around the world. Their diet includes things he used to shun, such as egg yolks, olive oil and nuts. Two days a week the couple stick to vegetarian meals but otherwise he devours steak, kidneys, liver and some of his favourite Mexican dishes \u2013 barbacoa (lamb), carnitas (pork) and tacos with grilled meat.\n\nHis wife enjoys making a traditional Mexican sweet pastry called pan de muerto (bread of death). \u201cBefore I would have run an extra two hours to compensate for eating that but now I don\u2019t care, I just make sure it is a treat, not an everyday thing.\u201d Having spent years trying to forgo alcohol, he has a glass or two of wine several times a week, and goes for a beer with friends from his gym.\n\nSweating through three or four workouts a week, he is as well-muscled as a professional rugby player. A stable 80kg, he has very little body fat, though he is still considered overweight by the body-mass-index charts, which rate many beefed-up professional athletes as too heavy. The only relapse of anxiety he suffers nowadays happens when he hears Tori Amos singing \u201cBliss\u201d \u2013 the song playing when he was kidnapped \u2013 which he says \u201cis a real pity because it\u2019s a great song\u201d.\n\nToday Camacho could be described as a calorie dissident, one of a small but growing number of academics and scientists who say that the persistence of calorie-counting compounds the obesity epidemic, rather than remedying it. Counting calories has disrupted our ability to eat the right amount of food, he says, and has steered us towards poor choices. In 2017 he wrote an academic paper that was one of the most savage attacks on the calorie system published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI\u2019m actually embarrassed at what I used to believe,\u201d he says. \u201cI was doing everything I could to follow the official advice but it was totally wrong and I feel stupid for never even questioning it.\u201d\n\nGiven the vast evidence that calorie-counting is imprecise at best, and contributes to rising obesity at worst, why has it persisted?\n\nThe simplicity of calorie-counting explains its appeal. Metrics that tell consumers the extent to which foods have been processed, or whether they will suppress hunger, are harder to understand. Faced with the calorie juggernaut, none has gained wide acceptance.\n\nThe scientific and health establishment knows that the current system is flawed. A senior adviser to the UN \u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in 2002 that the Atwater \u201cfactors\u201d of 4-4-9 at the heart of the calorie-counting system were \u201ca gross oversimplification\u201d and so inaccurate that they could mislead consumers into choosing unhealthy products because they understate the calories in some carbohydrates. The organisation said it would give \u201cfurther consideration\u201d to overhauling the system but 17 years later there is little momentum for change. It even rejected the idea of harmonising the many methods that are used in different countries \u2013 a label in Australia can give a different count from one in America for the same product.\n\nOfficials at the WHO also acknowledge the problems of the current system, but say it is so entrenched in consumer behaviour, public policy and industry standards that it would be too expensive and disruptive to make big changes. The experiments that Atwater conducted a century ago, without calculators or computers, have never been repeated even though our understanding of how our bodies work is vastly improved. There is little funding or enthusiasm for such work. As Susan Roberts at Tufts University says, collecting and analysing faeces \u201cis the worst research job in the world\u201d.\n\nThe calorie system, says Camacho, lets food producers off the hook: \u201cThey can say, \u2018We\u2019re not responsible for the unhealthy products we sell, we just have to list the calories and leave it to you to manage your own weight\u2019.\u201d Camacho and other calorie dissidents argue that sugar and highly processed carbohydrates play havoc with people\u2019s hormonal systems. Higher insulin levels mean more energy is converted into fat tissues leaving less available to fuel the rest of the body. That in turn drives hunger and overeating. In other words the constant hunger and fatigue suffered by Camacho and other dieters may be symptoms of being overweight, rather than the cause of the problem. Yet much of the food industry defends the status quo too. To change how we assess the energy and health values of food would undermine the business model of many companies.\n\nThe only major organisation to shift the emphasis beyond calories is one dedicated to helping its customers slim down: Weight Watchers. In 2001 the world\u2019s best-known dieting firm introduced a points system that moved away from focusing exclusively on calories to also classifying foods according to their sugar and saturated fat content, and their impact on appetite. Chris Stirk, the firm\u2019s general manager in Britain, says the organisation made the change because relying on calories to lose weight is \u201coutdated\u201d: \u201cScience evolves daily, monthly, yearly, let alone since the 1800s.\u201d\n\nMany of us know instinctively that not all calories are the same. A lollipop and an apple may contain similar numbers of calories but the apple is clearly better for us. But after a lifetime of hearing about the calorie and its role in supposedly foolproof diet advice we could be forgiven for being confused about how best to eat. It\u2019s time to lay it to rest.\u2022"

    "title": "Death of the calorie",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The first time that Salvador Camacho thought he was going to die he was sitting in his father\u2019s Chrysler sedan with a friend listening to music. The 22-year-old engineering student was parked near his home in the central Mexican city of Toluca and in the fading evening light he didn\u2019t notice two tattooed men approach. Tori Amos\u2019s hit, \u201cBliss\u201d, had just started playing when the gang members pointed guns at the young men.\n\nSo began a 24-hour ordeal. Strong willed and solidly built, Camacho was singled out as the more stubborn of the pair. He was blindfolded and beaten. One robber eventually threw him to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head and told him it was time to die. He passed out, waking in a field with his hands tied behind his back, almost naked.\n\nCamacho survived but, traumatised, he sank into depression. Soon he was drinking heavily and binge eating. His weight ballooned from a trim 70kg to 103kg.\n\nThat led to his second near-death experience, eight years later, in 2007. He remembers waking up and blinking at bright lights: he was being wheeled on a stretcher into a hospital emergency ward, with an attack of severe arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat. \u201cA cardiologist told me that if I didn\u2019t lose weight and get my health under control I would be dead in five years,\u201d he says.\n\nThat second crisis forced Camacho belatedly to deal with the trauma of the first. To help with what he now understands was post-traumatic stress disorder, he started having counselling and taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs. To address his physical health, he tried to lose weight. This effort propelled him to the centre of one of the most fraught scientific debates of our age: the calorie wars, a fierce disagreement about diet and weight control.\n\nToday, more than a decade after his cardiologist\u2019s stark warning, Camacho lives in the Swiss city of Basel. He is relaxed and confident, except when two topics come up. When he recounts his kidnapping his gaze drops, his smile vanishes and he becomes noticeably quieter, although he says his panic attacks have virtually disappeared. The other touchy topic is weight control, which causes him to shake his head in anger at what he and millions of other dieters have gone through. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d he says with exasperation and a touch of venom. \u201cPeople are living with real pain and guilt and all they get is advice that is confused or just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nThe guidance that Camacho\u2019s doctors gave him, along with a string of nutritionists and his own online research, was unanimous. It would be familiar to the millions of people who have ever tried to diet. \u201cEverybody tells you that to lose weight you have to eat less and move more,\u201d he says, \u201cand the way to do that is to count your calories.\u201d\n\nAt his heaviest, Camacho\u2019s body-mass index \u2013 the ratio of his height to his weight \u2013 reached 35.6, well above the 30 mark that doctors define as clinically obese. Most government guidelines indicated that, as a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight (the target for women is 2,000). Nutritionists told Camacho that if he ate fewer than 2,000 calories a day, a weekly \u201cdeficit\u201d of 3,500 would mean that he would lose 0.5kg a week.\n\nWith a desk job as a planning engineer in a Mexican hospital, he knew it would take real discipline to trim his pudgy frame. But as his kidnappers had quickly realised, he is an unusually determined character. He began getting up before dawn each day to run 10km. He also started accounting for every morsel of food he consumed.\n\n\u201cI filled in Excel spreadsheets every night, every week and every month listing everything I ate. It became a real obsession for me,\u201d says Camacho. Out went the Burger King Whoppers, fried tacos packed with pork and cheese, and tortas (Mexican sandwiches filled with meat, refried beans, avocado and peppers). Out too went his usual steady flow of beer and wine. In came carefully measured low-fat cheese and turkey sandwiches, salads, canned peach juice, Gatorade and Coke Zero, with three Special-K low-calorie diet bars a day.\n\n\u201cI was always tired and hungry and I would get really moody and distracted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking about food all the time.\u201d He was constantly told that if he got the maths right \u2013 consuming fewer calories than he burned each day \u2013 the results would soon show. \u201cI really did everything you are supposed to do,\u201d he insists with the tone of a schoolboy who completed his homework yet still failed a big test. He bought a battery of exercise monitoring devices to measure how many calories he was expending on his runs. \u201cI was told to exercise for at least 45 minutes at least four or five times a week. I actually ran for more than an hour every day.\u201d He kept to low-fat, low-calorie food for three years. It simply didn\u2019t work. At one point he lost about 10kg but his weight rebounded, though he still restricted his calories.\n\nDieters the world over will be familiar with Camacho\u2019s frustrations. Most studies show that more than 80% of people regain any lost weight in the long term. And like him, when we fail, most of us assume that we are too lazy or greedy \u2013 that we are at fault.\n\nAs a general rule it is true that if you eat vastly fewer calories than you burn, you\u2019ll get slimmer (and if you consume far more, you\u2019ll get fatter). But the myriad faddy diets flogged to us each year belie the simplicity of the formula that Camacho was given. The calorie as a scientific measurement is not in dispute. But calculating the exact calorific content of food is far harder than the confidently precise numbers displayed on food packets suggest. Two items of food with identical calorific values may be digested in very different ways. Each body processes calories differently. Even for a single individual, the time of day that you eat matters. The more we probe, the more we realise that tallying calories will do little to help us control our weight or even maintain a healthy diet: the beguiling simplicity of counting calories in and calories out is dangerously flawed.\n\nThe calorie is ubiquitous in daily life. It takes top billing on the information label of most packaged food and drinks. Ever more restaurants list the number of calories in each dish on their menus. Counting the calories we expend has become just as standard. Gym equipment, fitness devices around our wrists, even our phones tell us how many calories we have supposedly burned in a single exercise session or over the course of a day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always thus. For centuries, scientists assumed that it was the mass of food consumed that was significant. In the late 16th century an Italian physician named Santorio Sanctorius invented a \u201cweighing chair\u201d, dangling from a giant scale, in which he sat at regular intervals to weigh himself, everything he ate and drank, and all the faeces and urine he produced. Despite 30 years of compulsive chair dangling, Sanctorius answered few of his own questions about the impact that his consumption had on his body.\n\nOnly later did the focus shift to the energy different foodstuffs contained. In the 18th century Antoine Lavoisier, a French aristocrat, worked out that burning a candle required a gas from the air \u2013 which he named oxygen \u2013 to fuel the flame and release heat and other gases. He applied the same principle to food, concluding that it fuels the body like a slow-burning fire. He built a calorimeter, a device big enough to hold a guinea pig, and measured the heat the creature generated to estimate how much energy it was producing. Unfortunately the French revolution \u2013 specifically the guillotine \u2013 cut short his thinking on the subject. But he had started something. Other scientists later constructed \u201cbomb calori\u00admeters\u201d in which they burned food to measure the heat \u2013 and thus the potential energy \u2013 released from it.\n\nThe calorie \u2013 which comes from \u201ccalor\u201d, the Latin for \u201cheat\u201d \u2013 was originally used to measure the efficiency of steam engines: one calorie is the energy required to heat 1kg of water by one degree Celsius. Only in the 1860s did German scientists begin using it to calculate the energy in food. It was an American agricultural chemist, Wilbur Atwater, who popularised the idea that it could be used to measure both the energy contained in food and the energy the body expended on things like muscular work, tissue repair and powering the organs. In 1887, after a trip to Germany, he wrote a series of wildly popular articles in Century, an American magazine, suggesting that \u201cfood is to the body what fuel is to the fire.\u201d He introduced the public to the notion of \u201cmacronutrients\u201d \u2013 carbohydrates, protein and fat \u2013 so called because the body needs a lot of them.\n\nToday many of us want to monitor our calorie consumption in order to lose or maintain our weight. Atwater, the son of a Methodist minister, was motivated by the opposite concern: at a time when malnutrition was widespread, he sought to help poor people find the most cost-effective items to fill themselves up.\n\nTo see how much energy different macronutrients provided to the body, he fed samples of an \u201caverage\u201d American diet of that era \u2013 which he believed to be heavy in molasses cookies, barley meal and chicken gizzards \u2013 to a group of male students in a basement at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. For up to 12 days at a time a volunteer would eat, sleep and lift weights while sealed inside a six-foot-high chamber measuring four feet wide by seven feet deep. The energy in each meal was calculated by burning identical foods in a bomb calorimeter.\n\nThe walls were filled with water, and changes in its temperature allowed Atwater to calculate how much energy the students\u2019 bodies were generating. His team collected the students\u2019 faeces and burned that too, to see how much energy had been left in the body in the digestion process.\n\nThis was pioneering stuff for the 1890s. Atwater eventually concluded that a gram of either carbohydrate or protein made an average of four calories of energy available to the body, and a gram of fat offered an average of 8.9 calories, a figure later rounded up to nine calories for convenience. We now know far more about the workings of the human body: Atwater was right that some of a meal\u2019s potential energy was excreted, but had no idea that some was also used to digest the meal itself, and that the body expends different amounts of energy depending on the food. Yet more than a century after igniting the faeces of Wesleyan students, the numbers Atwater calculated for each macro\u00adnutrient remain the standard for measuring the calories in any given food stuff. Those experiments were the basis of Salvador Camacho\u2019s daily calorific arithmetic.\n\nAtwater transformed the way the public thought about food, with his simple belief that \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d. He counselled the poor against eating too many leafy green vegetables because they weren\u2019t sufficiently dense in energy. By his account, it made no difference whether calories came from chocolate or spinach: if the body absorbed more energy than it used, then it would store the excess as body fat, causing you to put on weight.\n\nThat idea captured the public imagination. In 1918 the first book was published in America based on the notion that a healthy diet was no more complicated than the simple addition and subtraction of calories. \u201cYou may eat just what you like \u2013 candy, pie, cake, fat meat, butter, cream but count your calories!\u201d wrote Lulu Hunt Peters in \u201cDiet and Health\u201d. \u201cNow that you know you can have the things you like, proceed to make your menus containing very little of them.\u201d The book sold millions.\n\nBy the 1930s the calorie had become entrenched in both the public mind and government policy. Its exclusive focus on the energy content of food, rather than its vitamin content, say, went virtually unchallenged. Rising incomes and greater female participation in the workforce meant that by the 1960s people were eating out more often or buying prepared food, so they wanted more information about what they were consuming. Nutritional information on foodstuffs was widespread but haphazard; many items carried outlandish claims about their health benefits. Labelling became standardised and mandatory in America only in 1990.\n\nThe emphasis and use of this information shifted too. By the late 1960s, obesity was becoming a pressing health concern as people became more sedentary and started eating highly processed foods and lots of sugar. As the number of people who needed to lose weight grew, changing diets became the focus of attention.\n\nSo began the war on fat, in which Atwater\u2019s calorie calculations were an unwitting ally. Because counting calories was seen as an objective arbiter of the health qualities of a foodstuff, it seemed logical that the most calorie-laden part of any food item \u2013 fat \u2013 must be bad for you. By this measure, dishes low in calories, but rich in sugar and carbohydrates, seemed healthier. People were increasingly willing to blame fat for many of the health ills of modern life, helped along by the sugar lobby: in 2016, a researcher at the University of California uncovered documents from 1967 showing that sugar companies secretly funded studies at Harvard University designed to blame fat for the growing obesity epidemic. That the dietary \u201cfat\u201d found in olive oil, bacon and butter is branded with the same word as the unwanted flesh around our middles made it all the easier to demonise.\n\nA US Senate committee report in 1977 recommended a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet for all, and other governments followed suit. The food industry responded with enthusiasm, removing fat, the most calorie-dense of macronutrients, from food items and replacing it with sugar, starch and salt. As a bonus, the thousands of new cheap and tasty \u201clow-cal\u201d and \u201clow-fat\u201d products which Camacho used to diet tended to have longer shelf lives and higher profit margins.\n\nBut this didn\u2019t lead to the expected improvements in public health. Instead, it coincided almost exactly with the most dramatic rise in obesity in human history. Between 1975 and 2016 obesity almost tripled worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ): nearly 40% of over-18s \u2013 some 1.9bn adults \u2013 are now overweight. That contributed to a rapid rise in cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke) which became the leading cause of death worldwide. Rates of type-2 diabetes, which is often linked to lifestyle and diet, have more than doubled since 1980.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only wealthy countries that saw such trends. In Mexico, middle-class urban families such as Camacho\u2019s got fatter too. As a child Camacho was fit and loved playing football. But at the age of ten, in 1988, he was one of many young Mexicans who started stacking on weight as increasing trade with America saw cheap sweets and fizzy drinks flood the shops, a process known as the \u201cCoca-colonisation\u201d of Mexico. \u201cThere were suddenly all these flavours you had never tasted, with chocolates, candies and Dr Pepper,\u201d Camacho remembers: \u201cOvernight I got fat.\u201d When his uncles teased him about his bulging waistline, he cut back on sweets and stayed in good shape until his kidnapping 12 years later. Other Mexicans just kept bulking up. In 2013 Mexico overtook America as the most obese country in the world.\n\nTo combat this trend, governments worldwide have enshrined calorie-counting in policy. The WHO attributes the \u201cfundamental cause\u201d of obesity worldwide to \u201can energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended\u201d. Governments the world over persist in offering the same advice: count and cut calories. This has infiltrated ever more areas of life. In 2018 the American government ordered food chains and vending machines to provide calorie details on their menus, to help consumers make \u201cinformed and healthful decisions\u201d. Australia and Britain are headed in similar directions. Government bodies advise dieters to record their meals in a calorie journal to lose weight. The experimental efforts of a 19th-century scientist stand barely changed \u2013 and are barely questioned.\n\nMillions of dieters give up when their calorie-counting is unsuccessful. Camacho was more stubborn than most. He took photos of his meals to record his intake more accurately, and would log into his calorie spreadsheets from his phone. He thought about every morsel he ate. And he bought a proliferation of gadgets to track his calorie output. But he still didn\u2019t lose much weight.\n\nOne problem was that his sums were based on the idea that calorie counts are accurate. Food producers give impressively specific readings: a slice of Camacho\u2019s favourite Domino\u2019s double pepperoni pizza is supposedly 248 calories (not 247 nor 249). Yet the number of calories listed on food packets and menus are routinely wrong.\n\nSusan Roberts, a nutritionist at Tufts University in Boston, has found that labels on American packaged foods miss their true calorie counts by an average of 18%. American government regulations allow such labels to understate calories by up to 20% (to ensure that consumers are not short-changed in terms of how much nutrition they receive). The information on some processed frozen foods misstates their calorific content by as much as 70%.\n\nThat isn\u2019t the only problem. Calorie counts are based on how much heat a foodstuff gives off when it burns in an oven. But the human body is far more complex than an oven. When food is burned in a laboratory it surrenders its calories within seconds. By contrast, the real-life journey from dinner plate to toilet bowl takes on average about a day, but can range from eight to 80 hours depending on the person. A calorie of carbohydrate and a calorie of protein both have the same amount of stored energy, so they perform identically in an oven. But put those calories into real bodies and they behave quite differently. And we are still learning new insights: American researchers discovered last year that, for more than a century, we\u2019ve been exaggerating by about 20% the number of calories we absorb from almonds.\n\nThe process of storing fat \u2013 the \u201cweight\u201d many people seek to lose \u2013 is influenced by dozens of other factors. Apart from calories, our genes, the trillions of bacteria that live in our gut, food preparation and sleep affect how we process food. Academic discussions of food and nutrition are littered with references to huge bodies of research that still need to be conducted. \u201cNo other field of science or medicine sees such a lack of rigorous studies,\u201d says Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College in London. \u201cWe can create synthetic DNA and clone animals but we still know incredibly little about the stuff that keeps us alive.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know, however, suggests that counting calories is very crude and often misleading. Think of a burger, the kind of food that Camacho eschewed during his early efforts to lose weight. Take a bite and the saliva in your mouth starts to break it down, a process that continues when you swallow, transporting the morsel towards your stomach and beyond to be churned further. The digestive process transforms the protein, carbohydrates and fat in the burger into their basic compounds so that they are tiny enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream via the small intestine to fuel and repair the trillions of cells in the body. But the basic molecules from each macronutrient play very different roles within the body.\n\nAll carbohydrates break down into sugars, which are the body\u2019s main fuel source. But the speed at which your body gets its fuel from food can be as important as the amount of fuel. Simple carbohydrates are swiftly absorbed into the bloodstream, providing a fast shot of energy: the body absorbs the sugar from a can of fizzy drink at a rate of 30 calories a minute, compared with two calories a minute from complex carbohydrates such as potatoes or rice. That matters, because a sudden hit of sugar prompts the rapid release of insulin, a hormone that carries the sugar out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells. Problems arise when there is too much sugar in the blood. The liver can store some of the excess, but any that remains is stashed as fat. So consuming large quantities of sugar is the fastest way to create body fat. And, once the insulin has done its work, blood-sugar levels slump, which tends to leave you hungry, as well as plumper.\n\nGetting fat is a consequence of civilisation. Our ancestors would have enjoyed a heavy hit of sugar perhaps four times a year, when a new season produced fresh fruit. Many now enjoy that kind of sugar kick every day. The average person in the developed world consumes 20 times as much sugar as people did even during Atwater\u2019s time.\n\nBut it is a different story when you eat complex carbohydrates such as cereals. These are strung together from simple carbohydrates, so they also break down into sugar, but because they do so more slowly, your blood-sugar levels remain steadier. The fruit juices that Camacho was encouraged to drink contained fewer calories than one of his wholegrain buns but the bread delivered less of a sugar hit and left him feeling satiated for longer.\n\nOther macronutrients have different functions. Protein, the dominant component of meat, fish and dairy products, acts as the main building block for bone, skin, hair and other body tissues. In the absence of sufficient quantities of carbohydrates it can also serve as fuel for the body. But since it is broken down more slowly than carbohydrates, protein is less likely to be converted to body fat.\n\nFat is a different matter again. It should leave you feeling fuller for longer, because your body splits it into tiny fatty acids more slowly than it processes carbohydrates or protein. We all need fat to make hormones and to protect our nerves (a bit like plastic coating protects an electric wire). Over millennia, fat has also been a crucial way for humans to store energy, allowing us to survive periods of famine. Nowadays, even without the risk of starvation, our bodies are programmed to store excess fuel in case we run out of food. No wonder a single measure \u2013 the energy content \u2013 can\u2019t capture such complexity.\n\nOur fixation with counting calories assumes both that all calories are equal and that all bodies respond to calories in identical ways: Camacho was told that, since he was a man, he needed 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight. Yet a growing body of research shows that when different people consume the same meal, the impact on each person\u2019s blood sugar and fat formation will vary according to their genes, lifestyles and unique mix of gut bacteria.\n\nResearch published this year showed that a certain set of genes is found more often in overweight people than in skinny ones, suggesting that some people have to work harder than others to stay thin (a fact that many of us already felt intuitively to be true). Differences in gut microbiomes can alter how people process food. A study of 800 Israelis in 2015 found that the rise in their blood-sugar levels varied by a factor of four in response to identical food.\n\nSome people\u2019s intestines are 50% longer than others: those with shorter ones absorb fewer calories, which means that they excrete more of the energy in food, putting on less weight.\n\nThe response of your own body may also change depending on when you eat. Lose weight and your body will try to regain it, slowing down your metabolism and even reducing the energy you spend on fidgeting and twitching your muscles. Even your eating and sleeping schedules can be important. Going without a full night\u2019s sleep may spur your body to create more fatty tissue, which casts a grim light on Camacho\u2019s years of early-morning exertion. You may put on more weight eating small amounts over 12-15 hours than eating the same food in three distinct meals over a shorter period.\n\nThere\u2019s a further weakness in the calorie-counting system: the amount of energy we absorb from food depends on how we prepare it. Chopping and grinding food essentially does part of the work of digestion, making more calories available to your body by ripping apart cell walls before you eat it. That effect is magnified when you add heat: cooking increases the proportion of food digested in the stomach and small intestine, from 50% to 95%. The digestible calories in beef rises by 15% on cooking, and in sweet potato some 40% (the exact change depends on whether it is boiled, roasted or microwaved). So significant is this impact that Richard Wrangham, a primatologist at Harvard University, reckons that cooking was necessary for human evolution. It enabled the neurological expansion that created Homo sapiens: powering the brain consumes about a fifth of a person\u2019s metabolic energy each day (cooking also means we didn\u2019t need to spend all day chewing, unlike chimps).\n\nThe difficulty in counting accurately doesn\u2019t stop there. The calorie load of carbohydrate-heavy items such as rice, pasta, bread and potatoes can be slashed simply by cooking, chilling and reheating them. As starch molecules cool they form new structures that are harder to digest. You absorb fewer calories eating toast that has been left to go cold, or leftover spaghetti, than if they were freshly made. Scientists in Sri Lanka discovered in 2015 that they could more than halve the calories potentially absorbed from rice by adding coconut oil during cooking and then cooling the rice. This made the starch less digestible so the body may take on fewer calories (they have yet to test on human beings the precise effects of rice cooked in this way). That\u2019s a bad thing if you\u2019re malnourished, but a boon if you\u2019re trying to lose weight.\n\nDifferent parts of a vegetable or fruit may be absorbed differently too: older leaves are tougher, for example. The starchy interior of sweetcorn kernels is easily digested but the cellulose husk is impossible to break down and passes through the body untouched. Just think about that moment when you look into the toilet bowl after eating sweetcorn.\n\nAs with so many dieters, Camacho\u2019s efforts to accurately track his calories \u201cin\u201d were doomed. But so too were his attempts to track his calories \u201cout\u201d. The message from many public authorities and food producers, especially fast-food companies that sponsor sports events, is that even the unhealthiest foods will not make you fat if you do your part by taking plenty of exercise. Exercise does, of course, have clear health benefits. But unless you\u2019re a professional athlete, it plays a smaller part in weight control than most people believe. As much as 75% of the average person\u2019s daily energy expenditure comes not through exercise but from ordinary daily activities and from keeping your body functioning by digesting food, powering organs and maintaining a regular body temperature. Even drinking iced water \u2013 which delivers no energy \u2013 forces the body to burn calories to maintain its preferred temperature, making it the only known case of consuming something with \u201cnegative\u201d calories. A popular expression in English tells us not to \u201ccompare apples and oranges\u201d and assume them to be the same: yet calories put pizzas and oranges, or apples and ice cream, on the same scale, and deems them equal.\n\nAfter three years of dedicated calorie-counting Camacho changed tack. While recovering from running the 2010 marathon in San Diego he took up Crossfit training, an exercise regime that includes high-intensity training and weightlifting. There he met people using a very different method to control their weight. Like him, they exercised regularly. But rather than limiting their calories, they ate natural foods, what Camacho calls \u201cstuff from a real plant, not an industrial plant\u201d.\n\nFed up with feeling like a hungry failure, he decided to give it a go. He ditched his heavily processed low-calorie products and focused on the quality of his food rather than quantity. He stopped feeling ravenous all the time. \u201cIt sounds simple but I decided to listen to my body and eat whenever I was hungry but only when I was hungry, and to eat real food, not food \u2018products\u2019,\u201d he says. He went back to items that he\u2019d long banned himself from eating. He had his first rasher of bacon in three years and enjoyed cheese, whole-fat milk and steaks.\n\nHe immediately felt less hungry and happier. More surprising, he quickly began to lose his extra fat. \u201cI was sleeping so much better and within a couple of months I stopped the depression and anxiety medication,\u201d he says. \u201cI went from always feeling guilty and angry and afraid to feeling in control of myself and actually proud of my own body. Suddenly I could enjoy eating and drinking again.\u201d\n\nThe weight stayed off and in 2012 he moved to Heidelberg in Germany, a world away from the hectic streets of Mexico, to study for a masters degree in public health. \u201cThe idea hit me that I could combine my own experience with academic work to try to help other people overcome these various barriers that I had found.\u201d After his masters he embarked on a doctorate on how to tackle obesity in Mexico.\n\nToday he is married to a German scholar, Erica Gunther, who has studied food systems around the world. Their diet includes things he used to shun, such as egg yolks, olive oil and nuts. Two days a week the couple stick to vegetarian meals but otherwise he devours steak, kidneys, liver and some of his favourite Mexican dishes \u2013 barbacoa (lamb), carnitas (pork) and tacos with grilled meat.\n\nHis wife enjoys making a traditional Mexican sweet pastry called pan de muerto (bread of death). \u201cBefore I would have run an extra two hours to compensate for eating that but now I don\u2019t care, I just make sure it is a treat, not an everyday thing.\u201d Having spent years trying to forgo alcohol, he has a glass or two of wine several times a week, and goes for a beer with friends from his gym.\n\nSweating through three or four workouts a week, he is as well-muscled as a professional rugby player. A stable 80kg, he has very little body fat, though he is still considered overweight by the body-mass-index charts, which rate many beefed-up professional athletes as too heavy. The only relapse of anxiety he suffers nowadays happens when he hears Tori Amos singing \u201cBliss\u201d \u2013 the song playing when he was kidnapped \u2013 which he says \u201cis a real pity because it\u2019s a great song\u201d.\n\nToday Camacho could be described as a calorie dissident, one of a small but growing number of academics and scientists who say that the persistence of calorie-counting compounds the obesity epidemic, rather than remedying it. Counting calories has disrupted our ability to eat the right amount of food, he says, and has steered us towards poor choices. In 2017 he wrote an academic paper that was one of the most savage attacks on the calorie system published in a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI\u2019m actually embarrassed at what I used to believe,\u201d he says. \u201cI was doing everything I could to follow the official advice but it was totally wrong and I feel stupid for never even questioning it.\u201d\n\nGiven the vast evidence that calorie-counting is imprecise at best, and contributes to rising obesity at worst, why has it persisted?\n\nThe simplicity of calorie-counting explains its appeal. Metrics that tell consumers the extent to which foods have been processed, or whether they will suppress hunger, are harder to understand. Faced with the calorie juggernaut, none has gained wide acceptance.\n\nThe scientific and health establishment knows that the current system is flawed. A senior adviser to the UN \u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in 2002 that the Atwater \u201cfactors\u201d of 4-4-9 at the heart of the calorie-counting system were \u201ca gross oversimplification\u201d and so inaccurate that they could mislead consumers into choosing unhealthy products because they understate the calories in some carbohydrates. The organisation said it would give \u201cfurther consideration\u201d to overhauling the system but 17 years later there is little momentum for change. It even rejected the idea of harmonising the many methods that are used in different countries \u2013 a label in Australia can give a different count from one in America for the same product.\n\nOfficials at the WHO also acknowledge the problems of the current system, but say it is so entrenched in consumer behaviour, public policy and industry standards that it would be too expensive and disruptive to make big changes. The experiments that Atwater conducted a century ago, without calculators or computers, have never been repeated even though our understanding of how our bodies work is vastly improved. There is little funding or enthusiasm for such work. As Susan Roberts at Tufts University says, collecting and analysing faeces \u201cis the worst research job in the world\u201d.\n\nThe calorie system, says Camacho, lets food producers off the hook: \u201cThey can say, \u2018We\u2019re not responsible for the unhealthy products we sell, we just have to list the calories and leave it to you to manage your own weight\u2019.\u201d Camacho and other calorie dissidents argue that sugar and highly processed carbohydrates play havoc with people\u2019s hormonal systems. Higher insulin levels mean more energy is converted into fat tissues leaving less available to fuel the rest of the body. That in turn drives hunger and overeating. In other words the constant hunger and fatigue suffered by Camacho and other dieters may be symptoms of being overweight, rather than the cause of the problem. Yet much of the food industry defends the status quo too. To change how we assess the energy and health values of food would undermine the business model of many companies.\n\nThe only major organisation to shift the emphasis beyond calories is one dedicated to helping its customers slim down: Weight Watchers. In 2001 the world\u2019s best-known dieting firm introduced a points system that moved away from focusing exclusively on calories to also classifying foods according to their sugar and saturated fat content, and their impact on appetite. Chris Stirk, the firm\u2019s general manager in Britain, says the organisation made the change because relying on calories to lose weight is \u201coutdated\u201d: \u201cScience evolves daily, monthly, yearly, let alone since the 1800s.\u201d\n\nMany of us know instinctively that not all calories are the same. A lollipop and an apple may contain similar numbers of calories but the apple is clearly better for us. But after a lifetime of hearing about the calorie and its role in supposedly foolproof diet advice we could be forgiven for being confused about how best to eat. It\u2019s time to lay it to rest.\u2022"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "\u201cHow do you explain Michael Jackson?\u201d This is just one of the many unanswerable questions posed during the nearly four hours of \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d. The documentary, directed by Dan Reed, in which two men recount the abuse they say they received at Jackson\u2019s hands when they were children, might not explain the King of Pop, but it does threaten to destroy his reputation for ever. Despite denials from both the singer\u2019s estate and disbelief among his biggest fans, radio stations across the world have already begun pulling his music from their playlists. Even if you have only ever been a casual listener to Jacko\u2019s songs, the film is a must-watch inquiry into the nature of fame, abuse and the lives of victims.\n\nWho are the accusers?\n\nThe men at the centre of \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d are James Safechuck and Wade Robson. Safechuck was 10 when he first met Jackson, after performing in a Pepsi advert that featured the star. Jackson befriended him, and later sent a film crew round to the Safechucks\u2019 house. It was, said Safechuck, \u201calmost like an audition. Jackson became a family friend and soon showered Safechucks with affection. He seemed so lonely and childlike that Safechuck\u2019s mother Stephane \u201ccame to feel like he was one of [her] sons\u201d. Safechuck toured as a dancer with Jackson.\n\nWade Robson meets Michael Jackson for the first time\n\nWade Robson is a dancer and choreographer who has worked with stars including Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears. He met Jackson when he was just five, after winning a dance competition in which meeting the singer was first prize. Jackson stayed in contact with Robson, his sister Chantal, and their mother, Joy, and it wasn\u2019t long before the family visited Neverland, Jackson\u2019s ranch in California. Joy eventually moved to LA with Robson and Chantal (and without her husband or their elder son), in order to pursue the opportunities Jackson had offered to create for their family. Robson went on to dance in three of the singer\u2019s videos.\n\nWhat do they say happened?\n\nSafechuck states that Jackson initiated a sexual relationship with him shortly after they met, and that it continued until he was 14. Robson states that the abuse started when he was seven and continued until he too was 14. Both recall that they were later sidelined in favour of other boys.\n\nJackson and James Safechuck\n\nJackson used both his superstar status and evident loneliness to inveigle his way into the two families\u2019 lives and gain their trust in order to spend large amounts of time alone with their children. Both Wade and Safechuck recount in detail the physical acts Jackson performed with them, and made them perform on him, including masturbation, oral sex, and, later, attempted anal sex. At the beginning, Safechuck states, Jackson normalised these things as \u201csomething that everybody does\u201d, while simultaneously making clear to both of them that his and their lives would be over if anyone ever found out. He \u201cran drills\u201d in how to dress quickly if they heard anyone about to walk in on them, Safechuck recalls, because if they did, \u201cHe, and I, would go to jail for the rest of our lives\u201d.\n\nWhat is most striking, though, is the way in which both men describe themselves as having been \u201cin love\u201d and \u201cinfatuated with him\u201d at the time. Safechuck describes himself and Jackson as \u201clike this married couple\u201d. The two even had a mock ceremony in which Jackson gave him a ring \u2013 one of several gifts from the singer that Safechuck shows in the film, his hands visibly shaking as he holds it.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they come forward earlier?\n\nAccusations of child abuse dogged Michael Jackson from the moment that the LAPD launched an investigation into claims by 12-year-old Jordy Chandler in 1993. Jackson settled out of court with the family for $22m in 1994, months before the LAPD case collapsed. Wade Robson was one of Jackson\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d who came forward publicly to help sink the Chandler case. He would do so again when further allegations, from Gavin Arvizo, who had been a 13-year-old cancer patient at the time he claims Jackson abused him, came to trial in 2005.\n\nJackson at Safechuck\u2019s house\n\nIn the documentary, Wade and Safechuck both discuss their reluctance to make the allegations earlier. Wade only broke his silence in 2013, four years after Jackson\u2019s death, after experiencing a mental breakdown linked to the birth of his first child. Safechuck, who had a similar experience around the birth of his own child, states that he was prompted to tell his story after seeing Wade interviewed on TV .\n\nIs it true?\n\nThough Safechuck\u2019s and Robsons\u2019s stories haven\u2019t been tested in court, it is hard to watch \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d and not be convinced by the testimony of the two men and their families. Their personal relationships with Jackson are a matter of record, and though the accusations of sexual abuse remain, in the strictest sense, unproven, it is hard to see how anyone watching the film could doubt their veracity.\n\nThat said, this is a one-sided documentary: Wade, Safechuck and their families are the only voices we hear, and both the Jackson estate and Jackson\u2019s fans have denied the accusations outright. Both accusers have said that they have received death threats from fans, while the Jackson estate is currently suing HBO for $100m for violating a 1992 contractual agreement to not \u201cdisparage\u201d the singer. But the film itself is hardly a tabloid hit-job. Slow, patient and unsensationalistic, it sets out to show how child abuse maintains a grip over victims long after it occurs. It is, to say the least, persuasive.\n\nLeaving Neverland: Michael Jackson and Me is available to watch on All 4 (UK) and Hulu and HBO (US)"

    "title": "Smoking with David Hockney",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The Conservatorium Hotel in Amsterdam enforces a strict no-smoking policy. Unless, that is, you are David Hockney. When I meet him in his room one drizzly afternoon in February, he is sitting on the sofa, dressed in a lime-green cardigan, a red-and-white polka-dot neckerchief and a pair of primrose spectacles. On the table in front of him are the half-eaten remains of a smoked-salmon bagel and four packs of Davidoff cigarettes. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very smooth, these,\u201d he says in his slow Yorkshire drawl, his voice grimed by 63 years of tobacco. \u201cThe best Virginia cigarette you can buy.\u201d\n\nHockney, who is 81, is jet-lagged. He flew in the previous day from Los Angeles, where he has lived on and off since the 1960s. He\u2019s in Amsterdam for the opening of an exhibition of his own work at the Van Gogh Museum. \u201cJP calls it the Vince and Dave show,\u201d he says, referring to Jean-Pierre, his studio manager and long-standing friend. The museum\u2019s first show dedicated to a contemporary painter is likely to be a crowd-pleaser. More than 1.5m people went to his retrospective in 2017, shown at Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Last year, \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\u201d, which he painted in 1972, went for $90.3m at Christie\u2019s in New York \u2013 the most expensive work by a living artist ever sold at auction.\n\nHockney receives no proceeds from auction sales in America and bats away talk of money. \u201cYou know what Oscar Wilde said?\u201d he asks with a note of bitter bemusement: \u201cThe only person who likes all kinds of art is an auctioneer. It\u2019s a madness, that.\u201d Right now, with an hour spare before checking the installation, he\u2019s more interested in sharing his greatest passion outside painting. \u201cHere, try one of these,\u201d he says, handing me a Davidoff.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t smoke when he\u2019s actually painting \u2013 \u201cmy hands are occupied\u201d \u2013 but does so whenever he steps back to inspect the work in progress, and pretty much any other time too. He consumes a pack a day and avoids anywhere he cannot smoke. Before arriving in Amsterdam, his assistant called ahead and, in exchange for a hefty fee \u2013 presumably to cover fumigation \u2013 arranged a special dispensation so he could puff away in his room. Hockney takes an idiosyncratic approach to his health: in the 1970s he claimed that eating large quantities of pickled onions helped to keep his arteries clear; he recently said that he owed his longevity to washing his hands and brushing his teeth regularly.\n\nToday he dismisses all concern about his body. \u201cI would point out that among my colleagues, Picasso smoked, lived to be 91; Monet smoked, lived to be 86; Renoir smoked, lived to be 78; Van Gogh smoked a pipe, and he died early, but not from smoking; C\u00e9zanne smoked. Lots of painters smoked and I don\u2019t know one who died young. Monet smoked all day!\u201d (After our meeting he sends a message: \u201cI forgot one thing \u2013 Hitler was the biggest anti-smoker. Doesn\u2019t that say it all?\u201d)\n\nHe berates what he calls the \u201cprofessional non-smokers\u201d who offend his sense of adventure. Perched on the edge of the sofa, he begins to recite W.H. Auden:\n\nGive me a doctor partridge-plump,\n\nShort in the leg and broad in the rump,\n\nAn endomorph with gentle hands\n\nWho\u2019ll never make absurd demands\n\nThat I abandon all my vices\n\nNor pull a long face in a crisis,\n\nBut with a twinkle in his eye\n\nWill tell me that I have to die.\n\nHockney\u2019s cigarette evangelism is an expression of a contrariness that has defined his career as an artist. He took up smoking as an art student in Bradford, the Yorkshire town where he was born in 1937. His father Kenneth, who worked as a clerk, was a militant anti-smoker. In the 1950s Kenneth attended the Aldermaston marches against nuclear weapons \u2013 not to protest about the bomb but the evils of tobacco. Hockney points out that he has now outlived his diabetic father by six years: \u201cIt was chocolate biscuits that killed him.\u201d (Hockney\u2019s tastes are quite different: last year he ate only caviar for Christmas lunch.)\n\nHockney ignored his father when he tried to whip the Woodbines from his mouth, just as he paid no attention to orthodoxies in general. As a young painter in the early 1960s he challenged British laws against gay sex with a series of pictures he calls \u201chomosexual propaganda\u201d, depicting men in the shower, in bed and in each other. One showed a couple 69-ing, their penises replaced by squirting tubes of Colgate toothpaste.\n\nSince then he has zigzagged wildly, investigating an extraordinary variety of styles. As Martin Gayford, a British art critic who has collaborated with Hockney on several books and been painted by him, puts it, \u201che always had the self-confidence to ignore what critics and curators were telling him he ought to be doing.\u201d\n\nHe has made both figurative and abstract work, experimented with photography, painted portraits, landscapes, still lifes and combinations of all three in restrained black-and-white and hot colour. Over the past 20 years he has spent much of his time in Bridlington, on the coast of East Yorkshire, painting the landscape he grew up in. A selection of these pictures is being shown in Amsterdam.\n\nToday, with a cigarette hanging permanently from his fingers as he peers owlishly over his big yellow glasses, Hockney talks about his enthusiasms with the stridency of a bar-room regular. They range from the limitations of photography (\u201cthe idea that a photograph is the ultimate depiction of reality is absolutely bonkers!\u201d) to the constraints of traditional perspective (\u201cI\u2019ve always known there was something wrong with perspective\u201d).\n\nEventually Hockney\u2019s assistant arrives to take us to the installation at the museum. Hockney reaches behind the sofa to pick up his walking stick and dons a tweed flat cap, which, together with his neckerchief and loose collar, makes him look like a fashion-conscious farmer. He also brings with him a portable ashtray \u2013 a little pouch with red-and-white stripes and a blue flap, made in Japan from some kind of heat-resistant plastic.\n\nHockney says he has felt an affinity with Van Gogh ever since he first saw his pictures at the Manchester City Art Gallery in 1954. \u201cWe went on the bus, from the art school, over the moors. I do remember the colour, because Manchester and Bradford weren\u2019t that colourful.\u201d He says that both he and Van Gogh were \u201cfrom a dark place, and we had to go somewhere else to see the colour\u201d.\n\nVan Gogh\u2019s haven was Provence; for Hockney it was California, which he first visited in 1963. \u201cI immediately felt the colour and I got it in the work.\u201d It was in California that he painted many of his most famous pictures, including \u201cA Bigger Splash\u201d (1967), with its bright blue swimming pool, banana-yellow diving board and marshmallow-pink house. Smoking has had a peripheral influence even on Hockney\u2019s visual imagination: in the 1970s he told an interviewer that elements of his sets for a production of \u201cThe Magic Flute\u201d were inspired by an advert for Kool cigarettes; he hoped someone might look up from the stalls and think, \u201cGolly, menthol green.\u201d Today he admits that the splash of his best-known work is \u201crather smoky\u201d.\n\nEven when Hockney paints elsewhere he takes the Californian palette with him. The first room of his exhibition includes \u201cMay Blossom on the Roman Road\u201d (2009), a giant picture of hawthorns in flower, where the road is a hot pinky-orange and the bushes take on a stiff, almost cactus-like form. In many of his Yorkshire pictures he seems to lay the colours of one landscape over those of another.\n\nHockney\u2019s period of painting Yorkshire ended in tragedy. We come to a series of charcoal drawings that depict the arrival of spring in 2013. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t finish them,\u201d he says. \u201cDominic died and we were very down.\u201d This is Dominic Elliott, his 23-year-old assistant who died in March 2013 after drinking drain cleaner at Hockney\u2019s house in Bridlington. Afterwards Hockney fled back to LA, where he has been living ever since. This year he will return to painting the spring, in a house he bought recently near Pont l\u2019\u00c9v\u00eaque \u2013 \u201cwhere the cheese comes from\u201d \u2013 in Normandy. \u201cThey have cherry blossom, apple blossom, pear blossom, blackthorn blossom, hawthorn blossom.\u201d He will unfold its arrival on a long panorama, like the Bayeux tapestry, so that viewers will walk through it.\n\nAfter looking at the rest of the show, Hockney pronounces himself satisfied. \u201cI\u2019m no Van Gogh, really, but it\u2019s okay isn\u2019t it?\u201d One curator asks if he\u2019d be interested in looking at the museum\u2019s collection of Pissarros, but Hockney is feeling his jet lag. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is going back to bed,\u201d he replies. But in the hotel lobby, conversation drifts once again to the Davidoffs. Hockney turns to me: \u201cFancy another?\u201d\n\nHockney - Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, March 1st - May 26th"

    "title": "All you need to know about \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "\u201cHow do you explain Michael Jackson?\u201d This is just one of the many unanswerable questions posed during the nearly four hours of \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d. The documentary, directed by Dan Reed, in which two men recount the abuse they say they received at Jackson\u2019s hands when they were children, might not explain the King of Pop, but it does threaten to destroy his reputation for ever. Despite denials from both the singer\u2019s estate and disbelief among his biggest fans, radio stations across the world have already begun pulling his music from their playlists. Even if you have only ever been a casual listener to Jacko\u2019s songs, the film is a must-watch inquiry into the nature of fame, abuse and the lives of victims.\n\nWho are the accusers?\n\nThe men at the centre of \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d are James Safechuck and Wade Robson. Safechuck was 10 when he first met Jackson, after performing in a Pepsi advert that featured the star. Jackson befriended him, and later sent a film crew round to the Safechucks\u2019 house. It was, said Safechuck, \u201calmost like an audition. Jackson became a family friend and soon showered Safechucks with affection. He seemed so lonely and childlike that Safechuck\u2019s mother Stephane \u201ccame to feel like he was one of [her] sons\u201d. Safechuck toured as a dancer with Jackson.\n\nWade Robson meets Michael Jackson for the first time\n\nWade Robson is a dancer and choreographer who has worked with stars including Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears. He met Jackson when he was just five, after winning a dance competition in which meeting the singer was first prize. Jackson stayed in contact with Robson, his sister Chantal, and their mother, Joy, and it wasn\u2019t long before the family visited Neverland, Jackson\u2019s ranch in California. Joy eventually moved to LA with Robson and Chantal (and without her husband or their elder son), in order to pursue the opportunities Jackson had offered to create for their family. Robson went on to dance in three of the singer\u2019s videos.\n\nWhat do they say happened?\n\nSafechuck states that Jackson initiated a sexual relationship with him shortly after they met, and that it continued until he was 14. Robson states that the abuse started when he was seven and continued until he too was 14. Both recall that they were later sidelined in favour of other boys.\n\nJackson and James Safechuck\n\nJackson used both his superstar status and evident loneliness to inveigle his way into the two families\u2019 lives and gain their trust in order to spend large amounts of time alone with their children. Both Wade and Safechuck recount in detail the physical acts Jackson performed with them, and made them perform on him, including masturbation, oral sex, and, later, attempted anal sex. At the beginning, Safechuck states, Jackson normalised these things as \u201csomething that everybody does\u201d, while simultaneously making clear to both of them that his and their lives would be over if anyone ever found out. He \u201cran drills\u201d in how to dress quickly if they heard anyone about to walk in on them, Safechuck recalls, because if they did, \u201cHe, and I, would go to jail for the rest of our lives\u201d.\n\nWhat is most striking, though, is the way in which both men describe themselves as having been \u201cin love\u201d and \u201cinfatuated with him\u201d at the time. Safechuck describes himself and Jackson as \u201clike this married couple\u201d. The two even had a mock ceremony in which Jackson gave him a ring \u2013 one of several gifts from the singer that Safechuck shows in the film, his hands visibly shaking as he holds it.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they come forward earlier?\n\nAccusations of child abuse dogged Michael Jackson from the moment that the LAPD launched an investigation into claims by 12-year-old Jordy Chandler in 1993. Jackson settled out of court with the family for $22m in 1994, months before the LAPD case collapsed. Wade Robson was one of Jackson\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d who came forward publicly to help sink the Chandler case. He would do so again when further allegations, from Gavin Arvizo, who had been a 13-year-old cancer patient at the time he claims Jackson abused him, came to trial in 2005.\n\nJackson at Safechuck\u2019s house\n\nIn the documentary, Wade and Safechuck both discuss their reluctance to make the allegations earlier. Wade only broke his silence in 2013, four years after Jackson\u2019s death, after experiencing a mental breakdown linked to the birth of his first child. Safechuck, who had a similar experience around the birth of his own child, states that he was prompted to tell his story after seeing Wade interviewed on TV .\n\nIs it true?\n\nThough Safechuck\u2019s and Robsons\u2019s stories haven\u2019t been tested in court, it is hard to watch \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d and not be convinced by the testimony of the two men and their families. Their personal relationships with Jackson are a matter of record, and though the accusations of sexual abuse remain, in the strictest sense, unproven, it is hard to see how anyone watching the film could doubt their veracity.\n\nThat said, this is a one-sided documentary: Wade, Safechuck and their families are the only voices we hear, and both the Jackson estate and Jackson\u2019s fans have denied the accusations outright. Both accusers have said that they have received death threats from fans, while the Jackson estate is currently suing HBO for $100m for violating a 1992 contractual agreement to not \u201cdisparage\u201d the singer. But the film itself is hardly a tabloid hit-job. Slow, patient and unsensationalistic, it sets out to show how child abuse maintains a grip over victims long after it occurs. It is, to say the least, persuasive.\n\nLeaving Neverland: Michael Jackson and Me is available to watch on All 4 (UK) and Hulu and HBO (US)"

    "title": "How Don McCullin captured history in the making",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The horrors of the battlefield are never far away in Tate Britain\u2019s retrospective of Don McCullin\u2019s work: the dead Khmer Rouge soldiers in a crater in Cambodia, Congolese soldiers tormenting freedom fighters in Stanleyville, young Christians on a bombed-out Beirut street, posing like a boy band over the body of a dead Palestinian girl. But McCullin has said again and again that he doesn\u2019t like to be called a war photographer; preferring, simply, \u201cphotographer\u201d. He is as interested in the people fighting wars as the people caught in their rip tide. \u201cStarving Twenty Four Year Old Mother With Child\u201d taken in Biafra in 1968, shows a woman, so gaunt she appears elderly, trying to feed her baby, who is sucking on empty, wrinkled breasts. Another picture, taken in a psychiatric hospital in Beirut in 1982, shows a child curled up on a mattress, flies settled on his body. He is tied to the metal bedstead with string, to stop him wandering off amid the broken glass. There is no need to see or hear the bombs to understand their effect on the helpless, and the desperation of those who care for them.\n\nI\u2019ve known Don McCullin for many years. He\u2019s soft-spoken, occasionally gruff, but funny, too. He was born into poverty in north London, 83 years ago. His first published photograph, \u201cThe Guvnors in their Sunday Suits\u201d (1958), shows some young men he\u2019d been at school with standing in a bombed-out building. When the men were caught up in a fight, during which a policeman was stabbed to death, McCullin sensed an opportunity to sell the photograph to the press. The Observer newspaper bought it and a few years later, after seeing the pictures he had taken of a freshly divided Berlin, would offer him a job. It was clear that he had a special eye \u2013 and more than that, an empathy that travelled down the lens to his subjects, and was reflected back to his audience.\n\nOver the decades he has wandered the world, from one atrocity to the next, documenting humanity and inhumanity. In between he has turned his lens on Britain: on the poverty of Bradford and London\u2019s East End; the humour of the country at play; the naked beauty of the landscape around his home in Somerset. This exhibition has them all. It\u2019s enthralling, beautiful, emotionally exhausting. McCullin invites us into a world that, to most of us who see his work in newspapers, magazines and exhibitions, is totally alien. And then, in the stillness of his photographs, he gives us time to imagine what it is to be there."

    "title": "Care for a wee dram of Japanese whisky?",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Suntory, a Japanese drinks company, began making whisky in the 1920s at the foot of a mountain in Kyoto. Decades later, its chief blender scoured the countryside in search of a site for a second distillery before settling on a corner of Yamanashi Prefecture in the centre of Japan\u2019s main island.\n\nIt is a picturesque spot: the Hakushu distillery is perched in the forested foothills of the Yatsugatake mountains, a range of mostly dormant volcanic peaks dotted with hot-spring resorts. But the location wasn\u2019t chosen for beauty alone. The local water, which softens and purifies as it passes through alpine granite rocks, is the mother-lode ingredient in Suntory\u2019s award-winning whiskies. Blended and stored in casks, the whisky absorbs changes in temperature and humidity, \u201cslowly taking on the distinct aroma and flavour\u201d of the local environment, according to my guide (the distillery tour begins with an invitation to take a deep breath of the forest).\n\nThe Japanese love of whisky began in the 1920s, when Masataka Taketsuru, a chemist from a sake-making family, returned from an apprenticeship in a whisky distillery in Scotland with a Scottish wife and the desire to introduce the Japanese palette to a new spirit. He helped to establish a whisky distillery for Suntory and Japanese drinkers soon developed a taste for it. When there was a lull in demand for local whiskies in the 1970s and 1980s, Suntory embarked on a strategy to give Japanese whiskies renewed cachet.\n\nIt is paying off. In the past decade, Japanese whiskies have begun thumping Scottish thoroughbreds in whisky-tasting competitions. Some brands are now as difficult to find as a seat on the bullet train during Obon holidays: shipments of Suntory\u2019s Hakushu 12 and Hibiki 17 were suspended in 2018 because they couldn\u2019t be made fast enough to meet demand. The value of scarce whiskies has shot up, too: just 50 bottles of Yamazaki, a 50-year-old spirit, were made, and last year a bottle sold for $299,000 at Sotheby\u2019s in Hong Kong.\n\nFor some devotees the trek to Hakushu is akin to a pilgrimage, so it is fitting that the tour begins in a cathedral-like visitor centre lined with old casks. The basic technology of brewing has changed little from a century ago. Barley is soaked in water to germinate, then dried, mashed, fermented and distilled. The slogan of the past still applies: wakon-yosai (Japanese spirit, Western knowhow). It isn\u2019t enough to mimic Scotch; Japanese whisky must be better, says our guide. Suntory has tinkered with every part of the process, from fermentation and storage to the size and shape of stills.\n\nThe most important part takes place later, in a cavernous room where the spirit ages, drawing on the casks for its oaky flavour and golden colour. This can\u2019t be sped up. As the whisky matures, up to 3% evaporates each year: \u201cthe angels\u2019 share\u201d. Were it not for Yamanashi\u2019s cool forest air, the loss would be greater.\n\nThe tour climaxes with a tasting. A cask whisky, a lightly peated malt and the famed Hakushu single malt are placed before us. We\u2019re invited to make a highball, a salaryman staple where the whisky is mixed with sparkling water. Our guide transforms this into a 40-proof version of the Japanese tea ceremony: just the right amount of water and ice are stirred into a glass, topped off with a single leaf of mint, before we are allowed to drink. The malt tastes smoky and sweet, rising up from the back of the throat to fill the nostrils, leaving behind whispers of yuzu and thyme \u2013 and a warm, mid-afternoon buzz.\n\n\n\nThree tipples to try\n\nHibiki 17\n\nSuntory\u2019s iconic brand was made famous by Bill Murray\u2019s turn in the 2003 film \u201cLost in Translation\u201d, which is about an ageing film star who goes to Japan to make a whisky advert. Sweet and smoky, with a fruity residue of strawberries and pear.\n\nNikka Taketsuru Pure Malt\n\nNamed after the so-called father of Japanese whisky, this amber blend from the Nikka distiller, is aged in a combination of woods, including sherry casks and new American oak. It is a good starter for many novice whisky drinkers. Chocolatey with a hint of coffee in the aftertaste.\n\nYamazaki 18\n\nSuntory\u2019s smooth and soft single malt is one of the most revered of all Japanese whiskies. Fans say it tastes rich and milky and leaves behind hints of figs and walnuts."

    "title": "From Bauhaus to Frauhaus",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "When Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus, his pioneering school of design, in Weimar in 1919, it seemed as though it would be a model of equality and progress. The school, created in the bitter aftermath of the first world war, would be open to \u201cany talented person irrespective of age or sex\u201d. It would be a synthesis of arts and crafts, modernism and tradition, men and women, who together would build a new utopia. This promise proved especially popular with the post-war \u201cNew Woman\u201d. Young, unmarried and with her hair cut short in Bubikopf style, she was no longer governed by Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche: children, kitchen and church. The Bauhaus seemed to be the ideal place to exercise her freedom. In the school\u2019s first year, 84 women enrolled to just 79 men.\n\nAs it turned out, these New Women faced old prejudices. Gropius was worried that the female majority would weaken the school\u2019s reputation. He solved his \u201cFrauenproblem\u201d by falling back on clich\u00e9, sending most of them to the weaving workshop, one of the specialist departments that students were required to join. \u201cWhere there is wool\u201d, said Oskar Schlemmer, a German artist and choreographer who taught at the Bauhaus, \u201cthere is a woman who weaves, if only to kill time.\u201d\n\nThis sexism set the tone. During the Bauhaus\u2019s 14-year existence, women were prevented from choosing their artistic disciplines as men could. Nor were they given decision-making jobs, and very few were offered permanent teaching positions. After the school was raided by the Nazis and closed down in 1933, it was the exiled men who settled in America \u2013 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer \u2013 who told the story and defined the style of the Bauhaus as it has come to be known: the kind of hyper-rational minimalism seen in Mies\u2019s Seagram Building in New York or Breuer\u2019s tubular-steel chairs. The women and their work were sidelined.\n\nJackpot The MT49 teapot by Marianne Brandt\n\nYet female Bauh\u00e4uslers had a lasting influence. They not only designed some of the school\u2019s most beautiful \u2013 and now most collectible \u2013 objects, they also helped to shape its philosophy. The women of the Bauhaus take us closer to the true nature of the enterprise.\n\nIn 1919, a 49-year-old singing teacher from Berlin called Gertrud Grunow arrived at the Bauhaus. She had been invited by Johannes Itten, a Swiss expressionist and mystic who was one of the school\u2019s founding members. Together they taught the Vorkurs, the foundation course that all Bauhaus students were required to take. The classes were strange and esoteric. Grunow focused on the artist\u2019s unconscious experience of the world. She asked students to express themselves through dance and music, and to \u201ctune in\u201d to the \u201charmony\u201d of their sensory organs. Some of her exercises sound silly \u2013 she was known to instruct her classes to \u201cdance the colour blue!\u201d \u2013 but Grunow believed she was perfecting her students\u2019 senses and making them fully alive to their materials, whether that meant the tactility of corrugated cardboard or the effect of light on glass.\n\nDespite being from a more rational school of thought, Gropius made Grunow\u2019s classes compulsory. Her experimental teaching inspired the notion of \u201cMaterielgerecht\u201d: doing justice to a material by exploring it with every sense. This idea became one of the school\u2019s core philosophies, taken up by teachers such as Josef Albers. At the start of one class, Albers gave his charges a sheet of newspaper, telling them, \u201cI want you to respect the material, make it into something meaningful, taking account of its particular properties. If you can do this without using any aids, such as knives, scissors or glue, so much the better.\u201d When he returned, he came back to boats, castles and airplanes, which Albers dismissed as junk: none of these students had respected the inherent qualities of the material. It was a Hungarian architect who had won the game. \u201cAll he had done\u201d, said Albers, \u201cwas fold the newspaper lengthwise, so that it stood upright like two wings.\u201d Experimenting with a material\u2019s properties was the key to good design.\n\nOne of the most successful exponents of this idea was Marianne Brandt. Brandt was a rarity among women in the Bauhaus: through a mixture of tenacity and good fortune she managed to avoid the weaving workshop in favour of metalwork. At first, her progress was slow. \u201cThere was no place for a woman in a metal workshop,\u201d she reflected. \u201cThey expressed their displeasure by giving me all sorts of dull, dreary work. How many little hemispheres did I most patiently hammer out of brittle new silver, thinking that was the way it had to be and all beginnings are hard.\u201d\n\nBut these little hemispheres proved revelatory. When she began working on her own designs, she wanted to return to the \u201csimplest of forms\u201d, creating a geometrical vocabulary of squares, circles and triangles from undecorated, riveted metal. From it she constructed lamps, ashtrays and teapots whose beautiful functionality soon made Brandt the most commissioned of all the metal artists, licensing her products to renowned German factories like Ruppelwerke and K\u00f6rtig & Matthiesen. Her Kandem lamp remains a bestseller today, and her MT 49 teapot, a concoction of circles supporting a spout and a handle made from a semi-circle of ebony, is one of the purest expressions of Bauhaus design. In 2007, an MT 49 sold for $361,000 \u2013 making it one of the most expensive Bauhaus objects ever sold.\n\nFruit of the loom\n\n\u201cBlack White Yellow\u201d (1926) by Anni Albers\n\n\n\nOther women were so thwarted by the school that they were forced elsewhere. Margarete Heymann-Loebenstein was a ceramicist. Under the tutelage of Grunow and Itten, who often asked their students to paint to music, she developed a style of loose, swirling brushwork which is a long way from the rigid geometry the Bauhaus became known for. Though the masters thought she was talented, Heymann-Loebenstein was offered access to the ceramics workshop only on a trial basis. Shunned, she left after a year to set up the Ha\u00ebl ceramics factory with her husband. Her pieces proved popular: at its peak in the early 1930s the factory employed 120 people, and her designs helped to take German pottery into the modern vernacular.\n\nThese women were outliers: most female students were weavers. When Anni Albers arrived at the Bauhaus in 1922 she wanted to study painting, but ended up at the loom. But in her hands, textiles took a painterly quality they had never had before. This was partly down to the master of the weaving workshop, the painter Paul Klee. Albers thought Klee was baffling as a teacher, but learnt about form and composition by looking at his paintings, and took her weaving in bold directions. As well as gridded weaves she created patterns from tangled knots of colour and maze-like networks of lines. The influence travelled in the other direction, too. Klee was affected by the colour achieved by the warp and weft of yarn in woven cloth, which he mimicked in pictures like \u201cNew Harmony\u201d (1936). Looking back on her time at the Bauhaus, Albers once said that \u201cGalleries and museums didn\u2019t show textiles, that was always considered craft and not art.\u201d In 2018 she had her first British retrospective at Tate Modern in London.\n\nThe weaving workshop was not only a centre of artistic innovation but of industrial innovation too. The weavers visited factories and worked out how to incorporate industrial materials into their work. Among their products were experimental synthetic fabrics, like one made from reflective, waxed-cotton thread which went on to be used in aircraft seating and car interiors. Albers created a material from chenille and cellophane, thereby inventing a new type of soundproofing. \u201cFormally as well as technically we invented incessantly,\u201d said Gunta St\u00f6lzl, who joined the weavers in 1920. The irony of Gropius\u2019s treatment of women is that weaving, used as a way to keep women out of the way, became one of the Bauhaus\u2019s most financially successful departments. The money helped sustain the school. But it didn\u2019t buy respect."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "\u201cHow do you explain Michael Jackson?\u201d This is just one of the many unanswerable questions posed during the nearly four hours of \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d. The documentary, directed by Dan Reed, in which two men recount the abuse they say they received at Jackson\u2019s hands when they were children, might not explain the King of Pop, but it does threaten to destroy his reputation for ever. Despite denials from both the singer\u2019s estate and disbelief among his biggest fans, radio stations across the world have already begun pulling his music from their playlists. Even if you have only ever been a casual listener to Jacko\u2019s songs, the film is a must-watch inquiry into the nature of fame, abuse and the lives of victims.\n\nWho are the accusers?\n\nThe men at the centre of \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d are James Safechuck and Wade Robson. Safechuck was 10 when he first met Jackson, after performing in a Pepsi advert that featured the star. Jackson befriended him, and later sent a film crew round to the Safechucks\u2019 house. It was, said Safechuck, \u201calmost like an audition. Jackson became a family friend and soon showered Safechucks with affection. He seemed so lonely and childlike that Safechuck\u2019s mother Stephane \u201ccame to feel like he was one of [her] sons\u201d. Safechuck toured as a dancer with Jackson.\n\nWade Robson meets Michael Jackson for the first time\n\nWade Robson is a dancer and choreographer who has worked with stars including Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears. He met Jackson when he was just five, after winning a dance competition in which meeting the singer was first prize. Jackson stayed in contact with Robson, his sister Chantal, and their mother, Joy, and it wasn\u2019t long before the family visited Neverland, Jackson\u2019s ranch in California. Joy eventually moved to LA with Robson and Chantal (and without her husband or their elder son), in order to pursue the opportunities Jackson had offered to create for their family. Robson went on to dance in three of the singer\u2019s videos.\n\nWhat do they say happened?\n\nSafechuck states that Jackson initiated a sexual relationship with him shortly after they met, and that it continued until he was 14. Robson states that the abuse started when he was seven and continued until he too was 14. Both recall that they were later sidelined in favour of other boys.\n\nJackson and James Safechuck\n\nJackson used both his superstar status and evident loneliness to inveigle his way into the two families\u2019 lives and gain their trust in order to spend large amounts of time alone with their children. Both Wade and Safechuck recount in detail the physical acts Jackson performed with them, and made them perform on him, including masturbation, oral sex, and, later, attempted anal sex. At the beginning, Safechuck states, Jackson normalised these things as \u201csomething that everybody does\u201d, while simultaneously making clear to both of them that his and their lives would be over if anyone ever found out. He \u201cran drills\u201d in how to dress quickly if they heard anyone about to walk in on them, Safechuck recalls, because if they did, \u201cHe, and I, would go to jail for the rest of our lives\u201d.\n\nWhat is most striking, though, is the way in which both men describe themselves as having been \u201cin love\u201d and \u201cinfatuated with him\u201d at the time. Safechuck describes himself and Jackson as \u201clike this married couple\u201d. The two even had a mock ceremony in which Jackson gave him a ring \u2013 one of several gifts from the singer that Safechuck shows in the film, his hands visibly shaking as he holds it.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they come forward earlier?\n\nAccusations of child abuse dogged Michael Jackson from the moment that the LAPD launched an investigation into claims by 12-year-old Jordy Chandler in 1993. Jackson settled out of court with the family for $22m in 1994, months before the LAPD case collapsed. Wade Robson was one of Jackson\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d who came forward publicly to help sink the Chandler case. He would do so again when further allegations, from Gavin Arvizo, who had been a 13-year-old cancer patient at the time he claims Jackson abused him, came to trial in 2005.\n\nJackson at Safechuck\u2019s house\n\nIn the documentary, Wade and Safechuck both discuss their reluctance to make the allegations earlier. Wade only broke his silence in 2013, four years after Jackson\u2019s death, after experiencing a mental breakdown linked to the birth of his first child. Safechuck, who had a similar experience around the birth of his own child, states that he was prompted to tell his story after seeing Wade interviewed on TV .\n\nIs it true?\n\nThough Safechuck\u2019s and Robsons\u2019s stories haven\u2019t been tested in court, it is hard to watch \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d and not be convinced by the testimony of the two men and their families. Their personal relationships with Jackson are a matter of record, and though the accusations of sexual abuse remain, in the strictest sense, unproven, it is hard to see how anyone watching the film could doubt their veracity.\n\nThat said, this is a one-sided documentary: Wade, Safechuck and their families are the only voices we hear, and both the Jackson estate and Jackson\u2019s fans have denied the accusations outright. Both accusers have said that they have received death threats from fans, while the Jackson estate is currently suing HBO for $100m for violating a 1992 contractual agreement to not \u201cdisparage\u201d the singer. But the film itself is hardly a tabloid hit-job. Slow, patient and unsensationalistic, it sets out to show how child abuse maintains a grip over victims long after it occurs. It is, to say the least, persuasive.\n\nLeaving Neverland: Michael Jackson and Me is available to watch on All 4 (UK) and Hulu and HBO (US)"

    "title": "Care for a wee dram of Japanese whisky?",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Suntory, a Japanese drinks company, began making whisky in the 1920s at the foot of a mountain in Kyoto. Decades later, its chief blender scoured the countryside in search of a site for a second distillery before settling on a corner of Yamanashi Prefecture in the centre of Japan\u2019s main island.\n\nIt is a picturesque spot: the Hakushu distillery is perched in the forested foothills of the Yatsugatake mountains, a range of mostly dormant volcanic peaks dotted with hot-spring resorts. But the location wasn\u2019t chosen for beauty alone. The local water, which softens and purifies as it passes through alpine granite rocks, is the mother-lode ingredient in Suntory\u2019s award-winning whiskies. Blended and stored in casks, the whisky absorbs changes in temperature and humidity, \u201cslowly taking on the distinct aroma and flavour\u201d of the local environment, according to my guide (the distillery tour begins with an invitation to take a deep breath of the forest).\n\nThe Japanese love of whisky began in the 1920s, when Masataka Taketsuru, a chemist from a sake-making family, returned from an apprenticeship in a whisky distillery in Scotland with a Scottish wife and the desire to introduce the Japanese palette to a new spirit. He helped to establish a whisky distillery for Suntory and Japanese drinkers soon developed a taste for it. When there was a lull in demand for local whiskies in the 1970s and 1980s, Suntory embarked on a strategy to give Japanese whiskies renewed cachet.\n\nIt is paying off. In the past decade, Japanese whiskies have begun thumping Scottish thoroughbreds in whisky-tasting competitions. Some brands are now as difficult to find as a seat on the bullet train during Obon holidays: shipments of Suntory\u2019s Hakushu 12 and Hibiki 17 were suspended in 2018 because they couldn\u2019t be made fast enough to meet demand. The value of scarce whiskies has shot up, too: just 50 bottles of Yamazaki, a 50-year-old spirit, were made, and last year a bottle sold for $299,000 at Sotheby\u2019s in Hong Kong.\n\nFor some devotees the trek to Hakushu is akin to a pilgrimage, so it is fitting that the tour begins in a cathedral-like visitor centre lined with old casks. The basic technology of brewing has changed little from a century ago. Barley is soaked in water to germinate, then dried, mashed, fermented and distilled. The slogan of the past still applies: wakon-yosai (Japanese spirit, Western knowhow). It isn\u2019t enough to mimic Scotch; Japanese whisky must be better, says our guide. Suntory has tinkered with every part of the process, from fermentation and storage to the size and shape of stills.\n\nThe most important part takes place later, in a cavernous room where the spirit ages, drawing on the casks for its oaky flavour and golden colour. This can\u2019t be sped up. As the whisky matures, up to 3% evaporates each year: \u201cthe angels\u2019 share\u201d. Were it not for Yamanashi\u2019s cool forest air, the loss would be greater.\n\nThe tour climaxes with a tasting. A cask whisky, a lightly peated malt and the famed Hakushu single malt are placed before us. We\u2019re invited to make a highball, a salaryman staple where the whisky is mixed with sparkling water. Our guide transforms this into a 40-proof version of the Japanese tea ceremony: just the right amount of water and ice are stirred into a glass, topped off with a single leaf of mint, before we are allowed to drink. The malt tastes smoky and sweet, rising up from the back of the throat to fill the nostrils, leaving behind whispers of yuzu and thyme \u2013 and a warm, mid-afternoon buzz.\n\n\n\nThree tipples to try\n\nHibiki 17\n\nSuntory\u2019s iconic brand was made famous by Bill Murray\u2019s turn in the 2003 film \u201cLost in Translation\u201d, which is about an ageing film star who goes to Japan to make a whisky advert. Sweet and smoky, with a fruity residue of strawberries and pear.\n\nNikka Taketsuru Pure Malt\n\nNamed after the so-called father of Japanese whisky, this amber blend from the Nikka distiller, is aged in a combination of woods, including sherry casks and new American oak. It is a good starter for many novice whisky drinkers. Chocolatey with a hint of coffee in the aftertaste.\n\nYamazaki 18\n\nSuntory\u2019s smooth and soft single malt is one of the most revered of all Japanese whiskies. Fans say it tastes rich and milky and leaves behind hints of figs and walnuts."

    "title": "From Bauhaus to Frauhaus",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "When Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus, his pioneering school of design, in Weimar in 1919, it seemed as though it would be a model of equality and progress. The school, created in the bitter aftermath of the first world war, would be open to \u201cany talented person irrespective of age or sex\u201d. It would be a synthesis of arts and crafts, modernism and tradition, men and women, who together would build a new utopia. This promise proved especially popular with the post-war \u201cNew Woman\u201d. Young, unmarried and with her hair cut short in Bubikopf style, she was no longer governed by Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche: children, kitchen and church. The Bauhaus seemed to be the ideal place to exercise her freedom. In the school\u2019s first year, 84 women enrolled to just 79 men.\n\nAs it turned out, these New Women faced old prejudices. Gropius was worried that the female majority would weaken the school\u2019s reputation. He solved his \u201cFrauenproblem\u201d by falling back on clich\u00e9, sending most of them to the weaving workshop, one of the specialist departments that students were required to join. \u201cWhere there is wool\u201d, said Oskar Schlemmer, a German artist and choreographer who taught at the Bauhaus, \u201cthere is a woman who weaves, if only to kill time.\u201d\n\nThis sexism set the tone. During the Bauhaus\u2019s 14-year existence, women were prevented from choosing their artistic disciplines as men could. Nor were they given decision-making jobs, and very few were offered permanent teaching positions. After the school was raided by the Nazis and closed down in 1933, it was the exiled men who settled in America \u2013 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer \u2013 who told the story and defined the style of the Bauhaus as it has come to be known: the kind of hyper-rational minimalism seen in Mies\u2019s Seagram Building in New York or Breuer\u2019s tubular-steel chairs. The women and their work were sidelined.\n\nJackpot The MT49 teapot by Marianne Brandt\n\nYet female Bauh\u00e4uslers had a lasting influence. They not only designed some of the school\u2019s most beautiful \u2013 and now most collectible \u2013 objects, they also helped to shape its philosophy. The women of the Bauhaus take us closer to the true nature of the enterprise.\n\nIn 1919, a 49-year-old singing teacher from Berlin called Gertrud Grunow arrived at the Bauhaus. She had been invited by Johannes Itten, a Swiss expressionist and mystic who was one of the school\u2019s founding members. Together they taught the Vorkurs, the foundation course that all Bauhaus students were required to take. The classes were strange and esoteric. Grunow focused on the artist\u2019s unconscious experience of the world. She asked students to express themselves through dance and music, and to \u201ctune in\u201d to the \u201charmony\u201d of their sensory organs. Some of her exercises sound silly \u2013 she was known to instruct her classes to \u201cdance the colour blue!\u201d \u2013 but Grunow believed she was perfecting her students\u2019 senses and making them fully alive to their materials, whether that meant the tactility of corrugated cardboard or the effect of light on glass.\n\nDespite being from a more rational school of thought, Gropius made Grunow\u2019s classes compulsory. Her experimental teaching inspired the notion of \u201cMaterielgerecht\u201d: doing justice to a material by exploring it with every sense. This idea became one of the school\u2019s core philosophies, taken up by teachers such as Josef Albers. At the start of one class, Albers gave his charges a sheet of newspaper, telling them, \u201cI want you to respect the material, make it into something meaningful, taking account of its particular properties. If you can do this without using any aids, such as knives, scissors or glue, so much the better.\u201d When he returned, he came back to boats, castles and airplanes, which Albers dismissed as junk: none of these students had respected the inherent qualities of the material. It was a Hungarian architect who had won the game. \u201cAll he had done\u201d, said Albers, \u201cwas fold the newspaper lengthwise, so that it stood upright like two wings.\u201d Experimenting with a material\u2019s properties was the key to good design.\n\nOne of the most successful exponents of this idea was Marianne Brandt. Brandt was a rarity among women in the Bauhaus: through a mixture of tenacity and good fortune she managed to avoid the weaving workshop in favour of metalwork. At first, her progress was slow. \u201cThere was no place for a woman in a metal workshop,\u201d she reflected. \u201cThey expressed their displeasure by giving me all sorts of dull, dreary work. How many little hemispheres did I most patiently hammer out of brittle new silver, thinking that was the way it had to be and all beginnings are hard.\u201d\n\nBut these little hemispheres proved revelatory. When she began working on her own designs, she wanted to return to the \u201csimplest of forms\u201d, creating a geometrical vocabulary of squares, circles and triangles from undecorated, riveted metal. From it she constructed lamps, ashtrays and teapots whose beautiful functionality soon made Brandt the most commissioned of all the metal artists, licensing her products to renowned German factories like Ruppelwerke and K\u00f6rtig & Matthiesen. Her Kandem lamp remains a bestseller today, and her MT 49 teapot, a concoction of circles supporting a spout and a handle made from a semi-circle of ebony, is one of the purest expressions of Bauhaus design. In 2007, an MT 49 sold for $361,000 \u2013 making it one of the most expensive Bauhaus objects ever sold.\n\nFruit of the loom\n\n\u201cBlack White Yellow\u201d (1926) by Anni Albers\n\n\n\nOther women were so thwarted by the school that they were forced elsewhere. Margarete Heymann-Loebenstein was a ceramicist. Under the tutelage of Grunow and Itten, who often asked their students to paint to music, she developed a style of loose, swirling brushwork which is a long way from the rigid geometry the Bauhaus became known for. Though the masters thought she was talented, Heymann-Loebenstein was offered access to the ceramics workshop only on a trial basis. Shunned, she left after a year to set up the Ha\u00ebl ceramics factory with her husband. Her pieces proved popular: at its peak in the early 1930s the factory employed 120 people, and her designs helped to take German pottery into the modern vernacular.\n\nThese women were outliers: most female students were weavers. When Anni Albers arrived at the Bauhaus in 1922 she wanted to study painting, but ended up at the loom. But in her hands, textiles took a painterly quality they had never had before. This was partly down to the master of the weaving workshop, the painter Paul Klee. Albers thought Klee was baffling as a teacher, but learnt about form and composition by looking at his paintings, and took her weaving in bold directions. As well as gridded weaves she created patterns from tangled knots of colour and maze-like networks of lines. The influence travelled in the other direction, too. Klee was affected by the colour achieved by the warp and weft of yarn in woven cloth, which he mimicked in pictures like \u201cNew Harmony\u201d (1936). Looking back on her time at the Bauhaus, Albers once said that \u201cGalleries and museums didn\u2019t show textiles, that was always considered craft and not art.\u201d In 2018 she had her first British retrospective at Tate Modern in London.\n\nThe weaving workshop was not only a centre of artistic innovation but of industrial innovation too. The weavers visited factories and worked out how to incorporate industrial materials into their work. Among their products were experimental synthetic fabrics, like one made from reflective, waxed-cotton thread which went on to be used in aircraft seating and car interiors. Albers created a material from chenille and cellophane, thereby inventing a new type of soundproofing. \u201cFormally as well as technically we invented incessantly,\u201d said Gunta St\u00f6lzl, who joined the weavers in 1920. The irony of Gropius\u2019s treatment of women is that weaving, used as a way to keep women out of the way, became one of the Bauhaus\u2019s most financially successful departments. The money helped sustain the school. But it didn\u2019t buy respect."

    "title": "How Turkish coffee destroyed an empire",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "It\u2019s known as Greek coffee to Greeks and Cypriots, Bosnian coffee to Bosnians, Armenian coffee to Armenians, Arabic coffee to Arabs, and Turkish coffee to Turks, Croatians, Albanians and Serbs. But in the mid-16th century, it was just kahve \u2013 coffee. At the time, these people were ruled over by the Ottoman Empire, which swept kahve-lovers from south-eastern Europe to Persia into its wide embrace. But by the early years of the 19th century, the empire was beginning to fracture. Kahve played a little-known role in its eventual demise.\n\nCoffee came to Turkey during the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. When the man he despatched to govern Yemen came across an energising drink known there as qahwah, he brought it back to the Ottoman court in Constantinople, where it was an instant hit. A palace kahveci usta, or coffee-master, might have tens of assistants helping him grind Arabica beans into an extra-fine powder similar in texture to today\u2019s instant espresso. This was then boiled in copper pots called cezves. The resulting drink \u2013 bitter, black and topped with a thin layer of froth created by pouring it quickly \u2013 was served in small porcelain cups. To balance its bitterness, legend has it, Suleiman\u2019s wife, H\u00fcrrem Sultan, took her kahve with a glass of water and a square of Turkish Delight \u2013 which is how it is served in Turkey today.\n\nNot everyone, however, believed that the Koran permitted Muslims to drink this stimulating new beverage. Although Islamic scripture doesn\u2019t specifically mention coffee, one hardline cleric in Suleiman\u2019s court issued a fatwa against the drink on the grounds that consuming anything burnt was forbidden. But that didn\u2019t dampen its appeal. The first public coffee house, or kahvehane, was founded in Istanbul in 1555 by two Syrian merchants. Soon, nearly one in six shops in the city \u2013 ranging in size from small neighbourhood caf\u00e9s to large community centres \u2013 served coffee. Gradually, kahve percolated through to the far reaches of the empire.\n\nTurkish delight The owner of an antique shop in the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul sips a cup of Turkish coffee\n\nCoffee houses gave men somewhere to congregate other than in homes, mosques or markets, providing a place for them to socialise, exchange information, entertain \u2013 and be educated. Literate members of society read aloud the news of the day; janissaries, members of an elite cadre of Ottoman troops, planned acts of protest against the Sultan; officials discussed court intrigue; merchants exchanged rumours of war. And the illiterate majority listened in. In the coffee houses they were introduced to ideas that spelled trouble for the Ottoman state: rebellion, self-determination and the fallibility of the powerful.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the authorities began to regard the kahvehane as a threat. Some sultans installed spies in coffee houses to gauge public opinion; others, like Murad IV, an early-18th-century sultan, tried shutting them down altogether. But they were too profitable. When simmering nationalist movements came to a boil throughout Ottoman lands in the 19th century, the popularity of coffee houses burgeoned. Ethnic groups in European regions of the empire with an Eastern Orthodox Christian majority started agitating for independence. Nationalist leaders planned their tactics and cemented alliances in the coffee houses of Thessaloniki, Sofia and Belgrade. Their caffeine-fuelled efforts succeeded with the establishment of an independent Greece in 1821, Serbia in 1835, and Bulgaria in 1878. The reign of kahve was over.\n\nThe different nations added signature twists to the drink: Greeks make it with mastic, a plant resin; Croatians caraway seeds; Arabs infuse it with cardamom and serve it in small cups without handles called finjans. Even when taken sade, or plain, the flavour profile depends on the roast; the medium-to-darker beans of the Turkish variety produce coffee with an earthy taste, smoky notes and thick texture. When you drain your cup, you will see fine grains coating the bottom. The effects soon hit. Emperors of the world, beware."

But McCullin has said again and again that he doesn\u2019t like to be called a war photographer; preferring, simply, \u201cphotographer\u201d. He is as interested in the people fighting wars as the people caught in their rip tide. \u201cStarving Twenty Four Year Old Mother With Child\u201d taken in Biafra in 1968, shows a woman, so gaunt she appears elderly, trying to feed her baby, who is sucking on empty, wrinkled breasts. Another picture, taken in a psychiatric hospital in Beirut in 1982, shows a child curled up on a mattress, flies settled on his body. He is tied to the metal bedstead with string, to stop him wandering off amid the broken glass. There is no need to see or hear the bombs to understand their effect on the helpless, and the desperation of those who care for them.\n\nI\u2019ve known Don McCullin for many years. He\u2019s soft-spoken, occasionally gruff, but funny, too. He was born into poverty in north London, 83 years ago. His first published photograph, \u201cThe Guvnors in their Sunday Suits\u201d (1958), shows some young men he\u2019d been at school with standing in a bombed-out building. When the men were caught up in a fight, during which a policeman was stabbed to death, McCullin sensed an opportunity to sell the photograph to the press. The Observer newspaper bought it and a few years later, after seeing the pictures he had taken of a freshly divided Berlin, would offer him a job. It was clear that he had a special eye \u2013 and more than that, an empathy that travelled down the lens to his subjects, and was reflected back to his audience.\n\nOver the decades he has wandered the world, from one atrocity to the next, documenting humanity and inhumanity. In between he has turned his lens on Britain: on the poverty of Bradford and London\u2019s East End; the humour of the country at play; the naked beauty of the landscape around his home in Somerset. This exhibition has them all. It\u2019s enthralling, beautiful, emotionally exhausting. McCullin invites us into a world that, to most of us who see his work in newspapers, magazines and exhibitions, is totally alien. And then, in the stillness of his photographs, he gives us time to imagine what it is to be there."

    "title": "Smoking with David Hockney",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The Conservatorium Hotel in Amsterdam enforces a strict no-smoking policy. Unless, that is, you are David Hockney. When I meet him in his room one drizzly afternoon in February, he is sitting on the sofa, dressed in a lime-green cardigan, a red-and-white polka-dot neckerchief and a pair of primrose spectacles. On the table in front of him are the half-eaten remains of a smoked-salmon bagel and four packs of Davidoff cigarettes. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very smooth, these,\u201d he says in his slow Yorkshire drawl, his voice grimed by 63 years of tobacco. \u201cThe best Virginia cigarette you can buy.\u201d\n\nHockney, who is 81, is jet-lagged. He flew in the previous day from Los Angeles, where he has lived on and off since the 1960s. He\u2019s in Amsterdam for the opening of an exhibition of his own work at the Van Gogh Museum. \u201cJP calls it the Vince and Dave show,\u201d he says, referring to Jean-Pierre, his studio manager and long-standing friend. The museum\u2019s first show dedicated to a contemporary painter is likely to be a crowd-pleaser. More than 1.5m people went to his retrospective in 2017, shown at Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Last year, \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\u201d, which he painted in 1972, went for $90.3m at Christie\u2019s in New York \u2013 the most expensive work by a living artist ever sold at auction.\n\nHockney receives no proceeds from auction sales in America and bats away talk of money. \u201cYou know what Oscar Wilde said?\u201d he asks with a note of bitter bemusement: \u201cThe only person who likes all kinds of art is an auctioneer. It\u2019s a madness, that.\u201d Right now, with an hour spare before checking the installation, he\u2019s more interested in sharing his greatest passion outside painting. \u201cHere, try one of these,\u201d he says, handing me a Davidoff.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t smoke when he\u2019s actually painting \u2013 \u201cmy hands are occupied\u201d \u2013 but does so whenever he steps back to inspect the work in progress, and pretty much any other time too. He consumes a pack a day and avoids anywhere he cannot smoke. Before arriving in Amsterdam, his assistant called ahead and, in exchange for a hefty fee \u2013 presumably to cover fumigation \u2013 arranged a special dispensation so he could puff away in his room. Hockney takes an idiosyncratic approach to his health: in the 1970s he claimed that eating large quantities of pickled onions helped to keep his arteries clear; he recently said that he owed his longevity to washing his hands and brushing his teeth regularly.\n\nToday he dismisses all concern about his body. \u201cI would point out that among my colleagues, Picasso smoked, lived to be 91; Monet smoked, lived to be 86; Renoir smoked, lived to be 78; Van Gogh smoked a pipe, and he died early, but not from smoking; C\u00e9zanne smoked. Lots of painters smoked and I don\u2019t know one who died young. Monet smoked all day!\u201d (After our meeting he sends a message: \u201cI forgot one thing \u2013 Hitler was the biggest anti-smoker. Doesn\u2019t that say it all?\u201d)\n\nHe berates what he calls the \u201cprofessional non-smokers\u201d who offend his sense of adventure. Perched on the edge of the sofa, he begins to recite W.H. Auden:\n\nGive me a doctor partridge-plump,\n\nShort in the leg and broad in the rump,\n\nAn endomorph with gentle hands\n\nWho\u2019ll never make absurd demands\n\nThat I abandon all my vices\n\nNor pull a long face in a crisis,\n\nBut with a twinkle in his eye\n\nWill tell me that I have to die.\n\nHockney\u2019s cigarette evangelism is an expression of a contrariness that has defined his career as an artist. He took up smoking as an art student in Bradford, the Yorkshire town where he was born in 1937. His father Kenneth, who worked as a clerk, was a militant anti-smoker. In the 1950s Kenneth attended the Aldermaston marches against nuclear weapons \u2013 not to protest about the bomb but the evils of tobacco. Hockney points out that he has now outlived his diabetic father by six years: \u201cIt was chocolate biscuits that killed him.\u201d (Hockney\u2019s tastes are quite different: last year he ate only caviar for Christmas lunch.)\n\nHockney ignored his father when he tried to whip the Woodbines from his mouth, just as he paid no attention to orthodoxies in general. As a young painter in the early 1960s he challenged British laws against gay sex with a series of pictures he calls \u201chomosexual propaganda\u201d, depicting men in the shower, in bed and in each other. One showed a couple 69-ing, their penises replaced by squirting tubes of Colgate toothpaste.\n\nSince then he has zigzagged wildly, investigating an extraordinary variety of styles. As Martin Gayford, a British art critic who has collaborated with Hockney on several books and been painted by him, puts it, \u201che always had the self-confidence to ignore what critics and curators were telling him he ought to be doing.\u201d\n\nHe has made both figurative and abstract work, experimented with photography, painted portraits, landscapes, still lifes and combinations of all three in restrained black-and-white and hot colour. Over the past 20 years he has spent much of his time in Bridlington, on the coast of East Yorkshire, painting the landscape he grew up in. A selection of these pictures is being shown in Amsterdam.\n\nToday, with a cigarette hanging permanently from his fingers as he peers owlishly over his big yellow glasses, Hockney talks about his enthusiasms with the stridency of a bar-room regular. They range from the limitations of photography (\u201cthe idea that a photograph is the ultimate depiction of reality is absolutely bonkers!\u201d) to the constraints of traditional perspective (\u201cI\u2019ve always known there was something wrong with perspective\u201d).\n\nEventually Hockney\u2019s assistant arrives to take us to the installation at the museum. Hockney reaches behind the sofa to pick up his walking stick and dons a tweed flat cap, which, together with his neckerchief and loose collar, makes him look like a fashion-conscious farmer. He also brings with him a portable ashtray \u2013 a little pouch with red-and-white stripes and a blue flap, made in Japan from some kind of heat-resistant plastic.\n\nHockney says he has felt an affinity with Van Gogh ever since he first saw his pictures at the Manchester City Art Gallery in 1954. \u201cWe went on the bus, from the art school, over the moors. I do remember the colour, because Manchester and Bradford weren\u2019t that colourful.\u201d He says that both he and Van Gogh were \u201cfrom a dark place, and we had to go somewhere else to see the colour\u201d.\n\nVan Gogh\u2019s haven was Provence; for Hockney it was California, which he first visited in 1963. \u201cI immediately felt the colour and I got it in the work.\u201d It was in California that he painted many of his most famous pictures, including \u201cA Bigger Splash\u201d (1967), with its bright blue swimming pool, banana-yellow diving board and marshmallow-pink house. Smoking has had a peripheral influence even on Hockney\u2019s visual imagination: in the 1970s he told an interviewer that elements of his sets for a production of \u201cThe Magic Flute\u201d were inspired by an advert for Kool cigarettes; he hoped someone might look up from the stalls and think, \u201cGolly, menthol green.\u201d Today he admits that the splash of his best-known work is \u201crather smoky\u201d.\n\nEven when Hockney paints elsewhere he takes the Californian palette with him. The first room of his exhibition includes \u201cMay Blossom on the Roman Road\u201d (2009), a giant picture of hawthorns in flower, where the road is a hot pinky-orange and the bushes take on a stiff, almost cactus-like form. In many of his Yorkshire pictures he seems to lay the colours of one landscape over those of another.\n\nHockney\u2019s period of painting Yorkshire ended in tragedy. We come to a series of charcoal drawings that depict the arrival of spring in 2013. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t finish them,\u201d he says. \u201cDominic died and we were very down.\u201d This is Dominic Elliott, his 23-year-old assistant who died in March 2013 after drinking drain cleaner at Hockney\u2019s house in Bridlington. Afterwards Hockney fled back to LA, where he has been living ever since. This year he will return to painting the spring, in a house he bought recently near Pont l\u2019\u00c9v\u00eaque \u2013 \u201cwhere the cheese comes from\u201d \u2013 in Normandy. \u201cThey have cherry blossom, apple blossom, pear blossom, blackthorn blossom, hawthorn blossom.\u201d He will unfold its arrival on a long panorama, like the Bayeux tapestry, so that viewers will walk through it.\n\nAfter looking at the rest of the show, Hockney pronounces himself satisfied. \u201cI\u2019m no Van Gogh, really, but it\u2019s okay isn\u2019t it?\u201d One curator asks if he\u2019d be interested in looking at the museum\u2019s collection of Pissarros, but Hockney is feeling his jet lag. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is going back to bed,\u201d he replies. But in the hotel lobby, conversation drifts once again to the Davidoffs. Hockney turns to me: \u201cFancy another?\u201d\n\nHockney - Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, March 1st - May 26th"

    "title": "The Elizabethan age in miniature",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Visitors attending a new exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London will have to resist the urge to press their noses to the glass vitrines. Nicholas Hilliard, the 16th-century English artist who painted the minuscule portraits contained within these display cabinets, wrote that they should be viewed \u201cof necessity in hand near unto the eye\u201d. That is impossible here, but the gallery has wisely supplied magnifying glasses so that viewers can get a proper look at the tiny locks, ruffs of lace and wisps of beard of Hilliard\u2019s subjects. Born in Devon in 1547, Hilliard was a master miniaturist whose career coincided with the height of the English Renaissance, which he both mirrored and shaped in his depictions of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s courtiers. \u201cElizabethan Treasures\u201d displays his work alongside that of his student, Isaac Oliver, a Huguenot refugee. Oliver\u2019s miniatures imported a hazy, chiaroscuro style from the continent but they are just as intricate as Hilliard\u2019s, and for the most part equally tiny \u2013 little bigger than coins or postage stamps.\n\nLike coins and stamps, miniature portraits were tokens imbued with cultural value. Wearing one in a locket could signal political allegiance; giving one as a gift could be a declaration of love. As with all Renaissance portraiture, eye-popping jewellery and expensive clothes take centre-stage in this ornate, symbolic pageant of an exhibition. The careful management of one\u2019s public image wasn\u2019t just vain preening (or, at least, not only that). During this period England was in thrall to the idea of \u201cself-fashioning\u201d, which held that one\u2019s appearance and personality ought to be carefully presented, like an artwork. To have your portrait painted by Oliver and Hilliard was not just a matter of having your likeness taken, it was also a way of forging your identity.\n\nThe self-fashioning cut both ways. By making miniatures, or \u201climning\u201d as it was then called, Hilliard and Oliver claimed a status that was several notches above the average painter who was, at the time, viewed as a mere craftsman. Much of what we know about Hilliard\u2019s trade comes from his \u201cTreatise on the Arte of Limning\u201d (1600), a manuscript copy of which is on display in the exhibition. In it, Hilliard is relentlessly keen to emphasise that limning is \u201ca kind of gentle painting\u201d \u2013 gentle as in genteel and reserved for a select few artists.\n\nThat Hilliard could get away with such posturing is partly due to the illustrious heritage of his craft. Limners were the artistic descendants of medieval manuscript illuminators (both \u201climning\u201d and \u201cilluminate\u201d derive from \u201cluminare\u201d, a Latin word meaning \u201cto emit light\u201d). By Hilliard\u2019s day, when the printing press had squeezed the market for hand-made books, those skilled in illumination turned their skills to stand-alone portraits, which were painted on to the same calf-skin vellum bookmakers used for parchment. Limners\u2019 other claim to special status was their mind-boggling technical skill. Armed with a rag-tag miscellany of tools including squirrel-hair brushes and dog-tooth burnishers, they produced artworks so precisely wrought that, according to Hilliard, a stray speck of dandruff or fleck of spittle could ruin them."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Visitors attending a new exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London will have to resist the urge to press their noses to the glass vitrines. Nicholas Hilliard, the 16th-century English artist who painted the minuscule portraits contained within these display cabinets, wrote that they should be viewed \u201cof necessity in hand near unto the eye\u201d. That is impossible here, but the gallery has wisely supplied magnifying glasses so that viewers can get a proper look at the tiny locks, ruffs of lace and wisps of beard of Hilliard\u2019s subjects. Born in Devon in 1547, Hilliard was a master miniaturist whose career coincided with the height of the English Renaissance, which he both mirrored and shaped in his depictions of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s courtiers. \u201cElizabethan Treasures\u201d displays his work alongside that of his student, Isaac Oliver, a Huguenot refugee. Oliver\u2019s miniatures imported a hazy, chiaroscuro style from the continent but they are just as intricate as Hilliard\u2019s, and for the most part equally tiny \u2013 little bigger than coins or postage stamps.\n\nLike coins and stamps, miniature portraits were tokens imbued with cultural value. Wearing one in a locket could signal political allegiance; giving one as a gift could be a declaration of love. As with all Renaissance portraiture, eye-popping jewellery and expensive clothes take centre-stage in this ornate, symbolic pageant of an exhibition. The careful management of one\u2019s public image wasn\u2019t just vain preening (or, at least, not only that). During this period England was in thrall to the idea of \u201cself-fashioning\u201d, which held that one\u2019s appearance and personality ought to be carefully presented, like an artwork. To have your portrait painted by Oliver and Hilliard was not just a matter of having your likeness taken, it was also a way of forging your identity.\n\nThe self-fashioning cut both ways. By making miniatures, or \u201climning\u201d as it was then called, Hilliard and Oliver claimed a status that was several notches above the average painter who was, at the time, viewed as a mere craftsman. Much of what we know about Hilliard\u2019s trade comes from his \u201cTreatise on the Arte of Limning\u201d (1600), a manuscript copy of which is on display in the exhibition. In it, Hilliard is relentlessly keen to emphasise that limning is \u201ca kind of gentle painting\u201d \u2013 gentle as in genteel and reserved for a select few artists.\n\nThat Hilliard could get away with such posturing is partly due to the illustrious heritage of his craft. Limners were the artistic descendants of medieval manuscript illuminators (both \u201climning\u201d and \u201cilluminate\u201d derive from \u201cluminare\u201d, a Latin word meaning \u201cto emit light\u201d). By Hilliard\u2019s day, when the printing press had squeezed the market for hand-made books, those skilled in illumination turned their skills to stand-alone portraits, which were painted on to the same calf-skin vellum bookmakers used for parchment. Limners\u2019 other claim to special status was their mind-boggling technical skill. Armed with a rag-tag miscellany of tools including squirrel-hair brushes and dog-tooth burnishers, they produced artworks so precisely wrought that, according to Hilliard, a stray speck of dandruff or fleck of spittle could ruin them."

    "title": "These old, anatomical drawings are worth dissecting",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "During his long journey through Europe and the Levant in 1867, Mark Twain stopped off in Milan. Like many, he was struck by the grandeur of the city\u2019s great cathedral, but it was something else that truly became etched in his memory. Standing inside the cathedral was a statue of St Bartholomew, the apostle who had been skinned alive, and who was depicted with his skin draped around his shoulders as if it were a towel. In \u201cThe Innocents Abroad\u201d, Twain\u2019s account of that year of travel, he recounts: \u201cThe figure was that of a man without a skin; with every vein, artery, muscle, every fibre and tendon and tissue of the human frame represented in minute detail... It was a hideous thing, and yet there was a fascination about it somehow.\u201d\n\nSkinhead The flayed body in \u201cA Description of the Body of Man\u201d (1616)\n\nAnimated by this same fascination, physicians and artists have, over the centuries, opened up the human body and recorded what they discovered inside, as visitors to a new exhibition at the Royal College of Physicians in London will find. \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d brings together a small yet impressive selection of anatomical illustrations, produced primarily by Western physicians and artists (though there are some striking exceptions) from the late Middle Ages through to the 20th century. These scrolls, prints and woodcuts show how these scientists grappled with the challenges of representing human anatomy, and in so doing made illustrations that are as gruesome as they are compelling.\n\nVarious obstacles stood in the way of those who wished to produce accurate representations of our insides. Dissections are the best way to learn about human anatomy: nothing can replace the experience of excavating layers of tissue yourself. But for centuries, the Christian and Islamic worlds imposed legal and religious restrictions on the practice. In 18th and 19th-century Britain, for instance, the only bodies legally available for dissection were those of executed criminals; with demand far outstripping supply, \u201cbody snatchers\u201d began digging up cadavers and selling them to medical schools. Once the corpse was on the dissection table, the anatomist had to acclimate to the smells of rotting flesh \u2013 Leonardo da Vinci warned the anatomy student that you \u201cwill perhaps be impeded by your stomach\u201d. He then (for it was invariably a \u201che\u201d) had to figure out how to represent a three-dimensional object \u2013 one that moves and changes with time \u2013 on a two-dimensional medium: how to capture not only the winding contours of the intestines, but a beating heart or heaving lungs, on a flat piece of canvas.\n\nOn point A guide to acupuncture by Hozumi Koremasa (1820s)\n\nSo anatomists collaborated with artists capable of committing their visions to paper. Even though the artist\u2019s knowledge of physiology often matched that of the anatomist, the former was usually obliged to follow the latter\u2019s instructions. Unsurprisingly, they sometimes clashed. Surgeons complained that artists over-embellished what were supposed to be clear depictions illustrating the function of a particular body part. Samuel Thomas von Sommering, a German physician, protested in 1791 that overly detailed sketches could do \u201charm to the important points\u201d. Arnaud-\u00c9loi Gautier d\u2019Agoty, a late 18th-century French painter whose father had pioneered new colour-printing techniques in his anatomical illustrations, disagreed. \u201cFor men to be instructed,\u201d he insisted, \u201cthey must be seduced by aesthetics.\u201d\n\nTwain was haunted by the statue of St Bartholomew. \u201cI am very sorry I saw it,\u201d he concluded, fearing he was doomed to forever dream of its \u201ccorded arms\u201d, \u201cstringy cold legs\u201d and \u201cdead eyes\u201d. The dead bodies depicted in \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d are sure to embed themselves in the minds of visitors, but not because they inspire revulsion so much as marvel \u2013 not only at the boundless complexities of the human body but also at the ingenuity of the human mind."

    "title": "Mansplainers, meet Sigrid",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "A good pop star connects to her listeners with songs that show she is animated by the same everyday emotions quickening inside the rest of us. When Adele sings about heartbreak we sense that she is expressing her own pain. When Robyn sings about loneliness, we can tell that she speaks from personal experience. Though they seem to live on stage or screen, these singers are also struggling to keep their heads above water in the same choppy sea of emotion we all find ourselves in. They convince us that they know how we feel.\n\nEnter Sigrid Solbakk Raabe, (above) a 22-year-old Norwegian singer-songwriter, who grew up listening to Robyn and Adele, a particular favourite. Sigrid\u2019s debut album, Sucker Punch, makes it clear that she listened closely. Since she was signed to a major label two years ago, life has been a whirlwind of international touring and publicity. Yet from those experiences \u2013 in 2017 she performed at Glastonbury and the following year the BBC anointed her the \u201cSound of 2018\u201d \u2013 Sigrid has managed to distil a charming ordinariness. \u201cDon\u2019t Kill My Vibe\u201d, the album\u2019s lead single, was inspired by a studio session in which she felt belittled by the middle-aged male producers. But the song\u2019s lyrics are shorn of specifics, making \u201cDon\u2019t Kill My Vibe\u201d a relatable ode to resilience in the face of all mansplainers and a perfect anthem for the age of #MeToo.\n\nResounding with Sigrid\u2019s demands to be taken seriously, the record also follows her as she traces love\u2019s peaks and troughs. She has a talent for capturing what it feels like to be a young woman in the 21st century. Robyn and Adele: you\u2019d better watch out. ~ CHARLIE McCANN\n\nSucker Punch March 8th\n\nHole in one\n\nStats are that rare thing, a dance band with a soul. Neither a nostalgia act nor a vehicle for slick overproduction, the London group sounds refreshingly human.\n\nTheir debut LP , Other People\u2019s Lives, emerged from frontman Ed Seed\u2019s realisation that, in contrast to people who can talk about their lives as if they are \u201ccoherent, relatable stories, full of passion and travel and wonder\u201d, his own life story was \u201cfull of holes\u201d. On \u201cThere Is a Story I Tell About My Life\u201d, he sings: \u201cAll these dead ends, and I have to pretend, when really I just don\u2019t understand\u201d. If that sounds a tad navel-gazing for a dance record, listen instead to the band\u2019s taut arrangements, in which nervous, exacting bass lines give way to glittering synthesisers.\n\nOn \u201cRhythm of the Heart\u201d, peals of synth brass fit snugly beside crisp, high-gloss guitar. Comparisons to the Talking Heads, especially their propulsive fourth album, \u201cRemain in Light\u201d, are inevitable. Seed recalls David Byrne\u2019s astringent style and his posture, at once aloof and demonstrative. You can imagine him singing, as Byrne once did, \u201cChanging my shape/I feel like an accident.\u201d ~ DAN PIEPENBRING\n\nOther People\u2019s Lives February 15th\n\nKind of blue\n\nJessica Pratt\u2019s first two albums were readily identifiable as folk records. The American musician\u2019s songs were mainly composed of fingerpicked acoustic guitar \u2013 skipping arpeggios rather than strummed chords \u2013 and her voice. Though she has acoustic guitar on her third album, Quiet Signs is rather different. An album of creeping shadows, it opens with a brief instrumental, \u201cOpening Night\u201d, named for the cult classic John Cassavetes film, with spare, jazzy piano that evokes an emptying bar. Excursions beyond folk wend their way throughout this twilit album: \u201cPoly Blue\u201d, with its subdued bossa-nova rhythm and subtle chord changes, ventures towards the high-class easy listening of Burt Bacharach.\n\nThe experiments on \u201cQuiet Signs\u201d are not pastiche; Pratt is trying to find her own voice. Sometimes that voice climbs so high, it sounds like she\u2019s inhaled helium, making it difficult to decipher her lyrics. But if you can\u2019t quite make out the opening line of \u201cThis Time Around\u201d \u2013 \u201cThis time around has it gone so grey that my faith can\u2019t hold out?\u201d she burbles \u2013 the melancholy picture it paints is unmistakable. Far from a work of draughtsmanship, \u201cQuiet Signs\u201d is a beautiful impressionist piece. ~ MICHAEL HANN\n\nQuiet Signs February 8th"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "If the best things in life are supposed to be free, the best days out rarely are. A trip to the \u201chappiest place on Earth\u201d (or Disneyland\u2019s resort in California, as the grown-ups who have to fork out usually call it) will cost a family of four about $500 (\u00a3390) in tickets. And that\u2019s before you\u2019ve shelled out for hot dogs and sugary delights, snapshots of your loved ones riding a flying Dumbo, and a hotel with fairy-tale turrets. Don\u2019t expect those thrills to get any cheaper, either. The entry fee to Disney\u2019s American theme parks has risen by nearly 40% in the last decade \u2013 even after adjusting for inflation \u2013 and has quadrupled since the 1970s.\n\nThe cost of other fancy spectacles has also soared. In America, which has the best historical data for such events, tickets to Broadway musicals have gone up by more than a third since 2008. (Some of that increase has been caused by the popularity of \u201cHamilton\u201d, a hip-hop history of the Founding Fathers, which at $270 a pop is more than twice as expensive as a typical show.) Real average prices for tickets to the theatre, pop concerts and American football games have surged by 15-30% in the same period. Even cinemas are charging more, despite the vast libraries of movies and TV that we can stream at home.\n\nA comparison of price data across entertainment categories throws up a few surprises. Those who claim that a night at the opera is only for the elite should know that attending a top-of-the-range gig is nearly as pricey: an average opera ticket in London costs \u00a381 ($103), compared with a global average of $96 for the 50 most-lucrative music tours. And the Royal Opera House in London boasts that 30% of its seats go for \u00a335 or under \u2013 but good luck finding that sort of deal for Bruce Springsteen or Jennifer Lopez.\n\nThe priciest pastime is to be a sports fan, given the regularity of the events. The cheapest season ticket to Liverpool Football Club costs \u00a3685 \u2013 for residents of the local area, that\u2019s nearly 10% of their disposable income. Merchandise, away tickets and trips to Europe can easily take that figure to 30%.\n\nThe price of fun is far higher in America than elsewhere. Whether you want to watch a show, visit a tourist attraction or ride a rollercoaster, in America many forms of entertainment cost twice as much as they do in Europe and Asia. Some of that discrepancy reflects a lack of government subsidies in America. Exuberant fandom plays a large part too. Tickets to the Super Bowl go for upwards of $5,000 each \u2013 an eye-watering fee for an evening that could end in tears."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "\u201cOne plays football. One does not play boxing.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Joyce Carol Oates, \u201cOn Boxing\u201d\n\nPlay, or its Hindi equivalent, khel, is the verb Mary Kom uses. She could be referring to a tournament, \u201cwhen I played national\u201d, her stance, \u201cI play southpaw\u201d, or her weight category, \u201cI must play in 51kg in the Olympics.\u201d But there is something deeper when Kom says it. Childbirth and child-rearing, that is life. Lifting yourself out of poverty, fulfilling the duties of a wife, a daughter, an eldest sister, that is life. Boxing is so much; but still it is play.\n\nShe is in the ring right now, and to be ringside when Mary Kom is in action is to feel the kinetic heat of boxing. It is molecular. She is padding against a man whom, a little while ago, in his spectacles, sweater and moustache, I took for a government officer. Now, shorn of the first two, he has transformed himself into a provocateur, a matador. He is baiting Mary, taunting her with words and jabs in the face. When their heads come together, their spit and sweat fall on each other, the blazing whites of their eyes are falling into each other\u2019s. Kom is 5ft 2in officially, an inch more in her own estimate, but looks smaller\u2014even more so in her headgear. Small, but taut: a packet of tensile strength.\n\nHer muscles must be on fire. Counting her rounds against the bag, the mirror and the other women at the camp, national- and international-level boxers, she has completed the equivalent of two full-length competition bouts. Those girls were heavier and taller. This is just as well because when women\u2019s boxing debuts at the 2012 Olympics, Mary must play taller opponents, who will have a longer reach. Most of her championship victories have come as a pinweight boxer, 46kg, whereas in London the lightest class, flyweight, is 51kg.\n\nBut next to Mary, these other girls were ponderous. Their feet were sluggish, their positioning not so clever. She could fight with her guard down, testing her reflexes by offering them her bare chin as a target, and counter-attacking in angles unfamiliar to boxers who take the orthodox stance.\n\nAll around the gym the girls furtively watched her. They covet her low-gravity wound-up springiness, her pure petite explosiveness. They would love to lunge so wide and fast, and never need to wrestle or go to the ropes. Aggression is her hallmark, and it makes her exhilarating to watch.\n\n\u201cYeh leh Mary,\u201d Mr Bhaskar Bhatt goads her, \u201ctake this. And this.\u201d This too is the play of boxing.\n\n\u201cHe tries to make me angry,\u201d she says later, \u201cbut I have to be cool.\u201d Her grimace is hidden by her white gumshield. You can feel her burn; it\u2019s been 80 minutes now.\n\n\u201cAaja Mary, sha-baash, come Mary, come.\u201d This is a \u201cspecific training\u201d session, devoted to feints and combination punches. He\u2019s making her chase him, holding up his pad for her to pull out another series of rifling combination punches, which she does with sharp yelp-like breaths.\n\n\u201cPhoom.\u201d That is the sound she wants from a punch. \u201cWhen it\u2019s tak, tak, like that, it is OK, not powerful,\u201d she will say, throwing me a mock punch. \u201cPhoom! That is powerful.\u201d\n\nAt last the session is finished. \u201c60%,\u201d says Mr Bhatt, bespectacled again, assessing a fortnight\u2019s progress. \u201cShe has not come into her original yet. Once she does that, when she gets back her automatisation, no one can stop her. See, Mary never gets puzzled in the ring. She has killer instinct.\u201d\n\nTo cool off, this 29-year-old mother of two does cartwheels and somersaults in the ring, and looks suddenly adolescent\u2014copper highlights in her hair, fluorescent laces on her shoes. When she lands awkwardly on an ankle that was recently injured, she just giggles. She lies on her stomach to be rubbed down by a physio provided by Olympic Gold Quest, a private non-profit organisation which began funding India\u2019s elite athletes in 2007.\n\nThe gym is on the premises of an erstwhile palace in Patiala, Punjab, now India\u2019s national sports institute. In its grounds the hedges are trim, the trees are labelled with numbers, and the kerb is painted in zebra stripes, but beneath the order it is still India, no country for athletes. Kom will return to shared accommodation in a hostel, where she will boil vegetables with fermented fish on her portable stove, because the mess food can leave her with indigestion. She will hand-wash her clothes, scrubbing the blood off her socks, as there is a single washing machine for an entire hostel of athletes. Two years ago, two female boxers, one a world-championship medallist, were asked to serve tea to visitors and wash up afterwards.\n\nOnly one Indian, the rifle shooter Abhinav Bindra, has ever won an individual Olympic gold medal. A chapter in his memoirs is entitled \u201cMr Indian Official: Thanks for Nothing\u201d.\n\nImphal is a town so removed from the Indian growth story that aspiration is not even visible on its streets. It feels old, not from the presence of history, but from an absence of renewal. A new car is a rarer sight than a jeep of India\u2019s security forces, which keep a deployment in the state of Manipur to combat a decades-long insurgency. In matters of infrastructure, government has excused itself altogether.\n\nThere is a road in Imphal West, over a kilometre long, flanked on either side by uncultivatable wetland. It is a shuddering stretch of stone and dust, with an enormous, open garbage dump at one end. It is officially called Mary Kom Road, but there is no sign to mark the fact, and Mary is glad of it.\n\nShe has lived in Manipur all her life. The daughter of landless agricultural labourers, she moved to Imphal in her mid-teens to make something of herself in track and field. Then a Manipuri boxer called Dingko Singh won gold at the Asian Games in Bangkok. Dingko too was poor. When he came back he was received as a hero; on the streets people collected money to give to him. Mary heard that women\u2019s boxing had just been introduced in Manipur. She approached the head coach at the Sports Authority of India centre, Ibomcha Singh. He remembers her being so small and young that he turned her away. At the end of his working day, she was waiting for him at the gate. In the ring, her attitude struck him as \u201cdo or die\u201d.\n\nThe girl would go on to win five world championships. Five in a row, like Borg or Federer at Wimbledon. Two of these five she won after giving birth to twin boys. In a nation bereft of athletic achievement, she ought to be a household name. But most Indians have never heard of her. \u201cMary kaun?\u201d, people say\u2014Mary who? Some can manage a guess at her sport: \u201cArchery, no, wrestling, wait\u2026 weightlifting?\u201d\n\nAt Delhi airport, as she queues for security, the thousands around her who would stampede at the sight of a cricketer are oblivious to the champion in their midst. Before Beijing, Bindra was similarly anonymous. Then he won gold, and received 380,000 telegrams.\n\nThere is a more depressing aspect to this. The Indian consciousness does not extend to a peripheral state out by the Burmese border. The millions unacquainted with Mary would struggle to find Manipur on the map. They might finger India\u2019s right ear, but which state exactly is it? What do the people eat, what language do they speak?\n\nAnd how then are Indians going to appreciate the brilliance of Mary Kom\u2019s achievement, to place it in context? In her defiance is an echo of the women of Manipur who waged two Women\u2019s Wars against the British in 1904 and 1939. To protest at atrocities by Indian security forces, an activist named Irom Sharmila has been on hunger strike for 11 years, force-fed through a tube, and women of the Meira Paibi (\u201ctorch bearers\u201d) group once stripped naked outside a military camp in Imphal waving the startling banner \u201cIndian Army Rape Us\u201d. Irom Sharmila protests; the women of Manipur run the biggest all-women\u2019s market in South Asia; and Mary Kom boxes, fights, plays.\n\n\u201cSomtimes I have to make people stop talking!\u201d Mary laughs and says, though it is a point she often makes without laughter. \u201cWhen I started, they say boxing is not for girls. After I get married, they say I cannot win after marriage. After I have baby, they say I cannot win after baby. So I want to prove, I want to show that I can make history for India.\u201d\n\nWe are in her house off Mary Kom Road. She is in a t-shirt and phanek, the Manipuri wraparound skirt, watching her four-year-olds run amok in the yard with a toy helicopter, a ladybird and Spiderman action figures, sometimes yelling at them, sometimes smothering them with kisses. The house sits on a concrete plinth, has a concrete gabled front, and concrete walls on which the twins have scribbled so high up that their parents refuse to erase the marks, to \u201cshow them how naughty they are\u201d. The house, in a colony built for a national games, was given to Mary by the state. It is one of the few in Imphal with 24-hour electricity: the average is below four hours a day.\n\nThese perks are needed. To make a living she must rely on state awards (which don\u2019t always reach her) and the salary from a sports-quota position with the Manipur police. Offered the designation of constable on winning her first world championship, she declined it. A few years later she accepted the post of sub-inspector, on a monthly salary of 8,500 rupees (\u00a3100). Following two promotions and a landmark government pay-scale revision, she still only draws 31,000 rupees a month (\u00a3360), a trifle in inflationary times. Since 2009, when she signed up with a talent management firm, Infinity Optimal Solutions, a few modest sponsorship deals have come her way.\n\nAgainst this are the multimillion-rupee endorsements for cricketers, and the player auctions for the Indian Premier League, where talent more ordinary than hers is bought for \u00a31m for a six-week tournament. This astonishes Mary, and she pauses for thought, totting up the grants, awards and deals through five world championships. \u201cIn ten years I have not made total of even one crore (\u00a3125,000).\u201d\n\nIn the front yard, below the tamarind tree in which little Rengpa and Nainai have managed to entangle their helicopter, is a small room made of bamboo and asbestos. Five girls live in this room, students at the mc (Mangte Chungneijang) Mary Kom Boxing Academy. Meant for poor Manipuri boys and girls, the academy is free.\n\nThe sanction of state land has been pending for five years, so it remains what in other parts of the world might be considered an anomaly: a boxing academy without a ring. Training in the denuded hills and the field opposite the house, strengthening their bodies on a modest set of donated equipment under a small tin shed in the domestic yard, 21 of the 30-odd students won a medal at the last state championships.\n\nFor the girls, especially, Mary is an inspiration; and because she is home for a few days, there is to be a minor presentation ceremony. They will receive training gear. The sports ministry donates these packs, 25 annually. By the time they reach the academy, pilfering has reduced it to about 18.\n\nIn her address to her students, Mary is animated, maternal, full of gestures and modulations. Freed from the constraints of English and Hindi, she talks for 25 minutes in Meiteilon, the lingua franca of Manipur. \u201cYou are lucky,\u201d she tells them. \u201cI can at least go and ask for support for you. Don\u2019t ever look back in your life, that you are from a poor family\u2014no. Go ahead in your life, ahead ahead ahead.\u201d\n\nMary\u2019s husband Onler manages the academy, along with her career\u2014and, when she is away, their twins, with the help of his mother-in-law. He himself has a bantamweight\u2019s physique. The two met in Delhi when Mary was a young athlete struggling on her visits to the big city. Onler, nine years older and then president of the Kom community club in Delhi, took her under his wing, and over time became a combination of mentor, motivator and manager, the man behind the woman.\n\nLike all of Manipur\u2019s hill tribes, the Koms, a tiny community, were converted by proselytising British missionaries, who first came to the region in the late 19th century. Both Mary and Onler are devout: \u201cJesus 100 percent\u201d were the words they once printed on her boxing gown.\n\nAt Christmas 2006, returning home from Onler\u2019s village in Samulamlan Block, they received a series of phone calls and texts, saying that Onler\u2019s father had been called out of the house by a group of men, taken a short distance away, and shot in the head at point-blank range. He was a parson and the village chief. There was no demand, no warning, no apparent motive. They had left him only hours earlier, and the mood was festive. The closest Onler can come to making sense of the murder is jealousy: of Mary\u2019s success and his marriage to her.\n\nWhen he recounts the incident, in harrowing detail, it is a journey into the heart of the Manipuri situation of UGs and C-in-Cs, underground groups and their commanders-in-chief. There are some 40 ethnic groups in Manipur, and about as many armed UGs which, though often rivals, together form a kind of parallel government. Two of the boys involved in the murder\u2014there were eyewitnesses in the house\u2014were apprehended by a UG two years later, says Onler, and even confessed in front of journalists. But Onler refused to make a \u201cdonation\u201d to the UG; the C-in-C made sure the news was spiked, and the killers roam free.\n\nShortly after the killing, Onler remembers thinking that \u201cit is better I should leave my family and take the gun and go direct to the people who are doing this. There was a complete darkness in the family. We doesn\u2019t want to eat anything, doesn\u2019t want to drink, we are just quiet. Mary wanted to give up her glove. I convince her not to.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m doing well and people are jealous, it is better to give up my glove, no?\u201d Mary asked herself. \u201cIf there is another incident, what shall I do?\u201d She was 23 at the time and had just won her third world championship. Her father-in-law had surprised her by supporting a married woman\u2019s decision to box for a career, and she never forgot that.\n\nA few weeks after the funeral, Mary felt unwell. At the clinic, the doctor told the couple that she had conceived. \u201cMy mind was blowing!\u201d Onler says. \u201cIt was something like a miracle. I give up all the dirty thoughts I had for leaving the house.\u201d His father too had been a twin.\n\nLess than two years after her father-in-law was murdered, after she considered giving up the game, 15 months after she gave birth to twins by Caesarean section, Mary claimed her fourth world title. She remembers the utter weakness when she returned to training, the aches and pains that still persist four years later, in her knees and especially her back. In order to train, she stopped breastfeeding after a year. Sometimes sourcing Lactogen in Imphal would be difficult when insurgents enforced highway blockades that could run for weeks. A blockade in 2011 lasted four months: like many Manipuris, she cooked on a woodfire.\n\n\u201cI have to do it,\u201d she told herself during her comeback. \u201cMy family is a big family. I\u2019m looking after all of them. My father\u2019s family, my sister also, cousin sister also. If we win gold medal, we are getting incentive from the state, the company side, sponsor side. So I tell myself, I can do, I can do, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThe evenings in Manipur, which is far out east but follows Indian Standard Time, arrive absurdly early, and dusk brings a quickening emptiness to the streets of Imphal. The hills facing Mary Kom Road are taller and lovelier in the dark; the pig in her back yard \u2013 no pinweight, at least 60kg by Onler\u2019s reckoning \u2013 is more vocal. If the family ever steps out after dusk it is with \u201ctwo to three boys or cousins\u201d who are boxers or martial artists. Onler has weapons for self-defence, but the private security officer assigned to them by the Manipur police does not: the state discontinued the practice after some officers let out their guns for hire.\n\nFor dinner Mary, the domestic provider, cooks in the Kom style: beef fry, pork with broccoli, fish and roe flavoured with desiccated citrus peels, and boiled mustard leaves. She stands by the table, listening, as a guest, a friend of theirs, says that his new tractor was captured a few hours ago by a ug for \u201ctax collection\u201d. Nainai, slung in a shawl, is strapped to Mary\u2019s back; Rengpa has exhausted himself to sleep. Mary will eat once her guests have finished, and early in the morning she will train her students in the field across the road.\n\nIt is early February, and the season is cold and dry. The fields, the day, are colourless but for the gorgeous phaneks and shawls of girls strolling or bicycling. In the village of Kangethei, in the front yard of the house where Mary grew up, are cacti and fern and croton, and tall bamboo whose lushness betrays the fallow fields. In the rear garden are peas, onion, garlic, mustard, beans, banana. There are two structures in the neatly groomed plot, neither permanent: a front shed of tin, and along one side, living quarters of bamboo and mud.\n\nThe roosters are running around, pecking at the grain that Mangte Akham Kom is spreading out to dry. She is a lady of handsome proportion: when she accompanied her daughter on a trip to Myanmar, it was she, not Mary, who found herself encased in a garland. The shock is meeting her husband, Mangte Ton-pa Kom, in the way it is shocking and moving to encounter a parent of the opposite gender so identical to their child. He has Mary\u2019s small but uncreasable body, tight and tough, with similar definition on the arms, the same erectness of the back, and the body language of a doer. The bones on their face are alike, as is their expression of reserve \u2013 and of great reserves. Ask Akham Kom where Mary gets her fearlessness, and she will point to Tonpa Kom.\n\n\u201cYes, when I observe her,\u201d Tonpa Kom says, \u201cI can see she is very much my blood. After all she is my first daughter.\u201d A village wrestling champion and an ace marksman in his youth, Tonpa Kom has been a farmhand since the age of 15.\n\nHe is a talkative, interesting man, full of long, precise anecdotes, which come to me translated from the Kom language by Jimmy, a young man who helps Onler manage Mary and the academy. On one aspect, however, Tonpa Kom is not keen to elaborate: his struggles to feed a poor family. This would be self-indulgent; he is not that kind of man. Mary\u2019s younger brother and mother disagree, and in the family discussion that follows the English word \u201chistory\u201d is thrown up often. \u201cHistory is history,\u201d that is what his wife and son tell him, \u201cand you should not hide it.\u201d\n\nSo Tonpa Kom tells his life story, as a woodcutter, a fisherman, a butcher and a charcoal burner. At one point he tried a business bringing cows from faraway to sell to villagers locally; when he had saved some money, he bought a cow and a cart, which he would hire out. Akham Kom, washing dishes by the well, adds that she wove shawls to boost their income. Mary helped, and also worked in the fields with her parents.\n\nOne day, after Mary had gone away to Imphal, Tonpa Kom saw an item in the newspaper about a young state boxing champion. The name was a mangled version of Mary\u2019s, but the girl seemed to be of the Kom tribe, about Mary\u2019s age. Could it be her? This was not a happy prospect: she had gone to pursue athletics, not to box. Boxing was not a sport for girls, and any bruising to her face would seriously hinder her chances of finding a good husband. Disturbed, he dispatched Akham Kom to Imphal to look into the matter. On the way she ran into Mary, returning home triumphant with her gold medal.\n\nHer mother\u2019s view, according to Mary, is \u201cany time OK\u201d. But Tonpa Kom was quiet for a few days. Mary cajoled him, explaining that, as an amateur, she wore headgear and would not get injured. After a while he decided that maybe she had chosen what was correct for her. But how would he support her financially? Mary told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will never trouble you. I will work hard. When other girls are spending ten rupees, I will spend one rupee.\u201d From then on, he told himself, \u201cI will do whatever I have to do. I will sacrifice myself if need be.\u201d\n\nTo help fund her training, equipment and travel, he sold the family cow for 14,000 rupees (\u00a3175) and borrowed money. When Mary began winning, and incentives started coming her way, he paid off the loans. Now her career has reached a stage that he no longer needs to live the way he does. People tell him it does not become the father of a world champion. But this is the only way he knows. Besides, his other children \u2013 two girls and a boy, the youngest just nine \u2013 are not yet successful like Mary, and they need to learn their lessons.\n\nMost Indians have never been abroad. Mary has fought in places that would seem extraordinary to them: Astana in Kazakhstan, Pecs in Hungary, Tonsberg in Norway, Hanoi in Vietnam, Antalya in Turkey. Once there, she adjusts the way she did on early trips to other parts of India, with sign language and improvisation. \u201cAsia-side\u201d she likes the food and manages fine; in Europe she finds it too sweet, but enjoys the breakfasts, usually skips dinner and makes do with the excellent variety of fruit. She fights against South-East Asians, Americans, eastern Europeans, athletes from vastly more sophisticated systems \u2013 in China, it\u2019s one coach for every boxer.\n\nIn March she was in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, for the Asian women\u2019s boxing championships. Her opponent in the final was Ren Cancan of China. \u201cShe is very clever,\u201d Kom says, which is the highest praise she bestows upon a boxer, though here it comes with an edge. Cancan is 5ft 6in, and the reigning 51kg world champion. The first time Mary fought in this category, in the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, she met Cancan in the semi-final and lost 7-11. Tempestuous in defeat, she felt Cancan had fouled all through the bout and the referee didn\u2019t catch her. The talk, subsequently, was whether it was possible for Mary to adapt to this weight class, whether, in fact, India\u2019s entry would be better filled by her accomplished state-mate L. Sarita Devi, who has won a world championship at 52kg. Four of Mary\u2019s five championships have come as a 46kg pinweight. At the Olympics there are only three weight categories for women, as opposed to ten for men.\n\nThe weight category is no small matter, especially for Indians, who, a national-level woman boxer tells me, are so insecure that from \u201c15 till retirement\u201d they look to fight in the same class. And so the national championships are full of starving boxers, surviving on glucose biscuits, reluctant even to drink a glass of water before their weigh-in.\n\nWith a champion\u2019s cold fury, Mary worked her way up two weight classes in three years to 51kg. She had to bulk up without slowing down. She had to work on a tight defence against bigger boxers. Before Ulan Bator, she went into training in Pune with the veteran British coach Charles Atkinson\u2014underwritten by Olympic Gold Quest and a ministry grant. She was the first woman Atkinson had coached, and her sparring partners in Pune were men.\n\nIn the final, she used her improved guard to negate Cancan\u2019s reach. She pulled out combinations unusual for her, double jabs and a right, to go with the big left hook that is her signature. She won 14-8.\n\nAs a preparation for the Olympic qualifiers in May, this was excellent\u2014though not quite enough. In her new weight category she had fought the Asians, but never faced the Europeans.\n\nAt the qualifiers in Qinhuangdao, China, seeded seventh, she reached the quarter-finals as expected and came up against the second seed, Nicola Adams from Leeds in England. Minutes after the fight, Mary was on the phone to Onler. \u201cPapa,\u201d she said, addressing him as mothers sometimes do the father of their children, \u201cI have lost.\u201d It was a close bout, 11-13. She was angry with the judging, as competitors often are in a sport where the scoring is subjective.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the women\u2019s world boxing championships, there was no medal for Mary Kom. But she wasn\u2019t thinking about that. Her qualification for London was in danger, and, worse, it was no longer in her hands. For Mary to go through, under the complex qualifying rules, Adams would have to win her semi-final, against a Russian.\n\nFor two days in Manipur, Onler sat tight, nervous. So much was riding on this. In China, Mary shopped recklessly. In the end, her conqueror got her off the hook (before losing the final to Cancan, and also complaining about the scoring).\n\n\u201cI can breathe again,\u201d Onler said.\n\nMary, reverting to a winner\u2019s mentality, said she had not had doubts. \u201cYes, I was sure I would qualify. The Russian, I knew she wasn\u2019t so good, she would lose to Nicola.\u201d\n\nWhat about Nicola herself? \u201cShe is OK, quite good. She is quite defensive, she has a fast jab. Europeans are not so clever as Asians. I think I will beat her.\u201d She points to her head with a playful gleam. \u201cI have her in my mind now.\u201d\n\nFew Indians have ever seen Mary box, because barely any of her tournaments are televised or even streamed online. Her feats end up buried in the back pages, usually in the Sport in Brief. But when she returned from Qinhuangdao as the first and only Indian woman boxer to have qualified for the Olympics, the press was interested at last.\n\nThis is why Mary needs London: it is why every Indian athlete other than the cricketers and a handful of tennis stars needs the Olympics. It will define them. It could transform their fortunes, validate their efforts, their life. But unlike the weightlifters and archers and the growing contingent of male boxers who may confront their destiny two or three or four times over a career, London is Mary\u2019s first and only chance. By Rio de Janeiro in 2016, she will be 33, and too old.\n\nWhen she walks the streets of Delhi with her fellow north-eastern athletes, they are sometimes mistaken for Nepali domestic help. \u201cI tell them we are not Nepali, we are Manipuri, so don\u2019t speak like that, this is very bad manners.\u201d At other times they are taunted with the gibberish dispensed to those with oriental features: \u201cSomething ching ching ching ching they start speaking, I don\u2019t know what. Even they don\u2019t know what! We are feeling bad. We are Indian. Ya, the face is different. But heart is Indian.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment could be attacked by the more extreme Manipuri insurgents. But if Mary retires as an Olympic gold-medallist, she knows her life will be forever changed; and with it, a little bit, her country\u2019s standing in the world.\n\nFootage of her fights is not easy to track down. The national broadcaster Doordarshan, private sports channels, her own agents, Olympic Gold Quest \u2013 nobody can supply it. After a fortnight of hard pursuit, a solitary bout emerges on an unlabelled cd in the boxing federation office from a mass of discs in a paper bag. Another is found on Jimmy\u2019s hard disk in Manipur. They are from Podolsk, Russia, 2005, and Barbados, 2010, both world championships.\n\nThe bouts are shot on single hand-held cameras with no commentary. They have the air of an underground activity, like 19th-century prizefighting.\n\nBut amateur boxing\u2014or Olympic-style boxing, as it is beginning to be called\u2014is a very different beast from prizefighting, then or now. There is no prize money, no pounding music or showboating mcs, no showbiz bright lights blazing around the ancient glamour of blood. Nobody dies in these bouts; knock-outs are rare.\n\nEspecially in the lighter categories, the boxers dance on the dazzling borderline between fisticuffs and fencing. They feint and prance and lunge to find openings off which to score. Scoring is a subjective and contentious affair: at least three of the five judges must instantly concur that a punch is substantial and delivered by the \u201cknuckle part\u201d of a \u201cclosed glove\u201d to the legitimate target zone, between the stomach and the head, on the front or sides of the body. Without an electronic scoreboard, the audience would be lost.\n\nEven by the standards of pinweights, Mary is so quick that judges regard her bouts as about the hardest task in the women\u2019s game. At Podolsk, her opponent is a Korean (the difficulty level of this bout she recalls with the Indianism \u201cfifty-fifty\u201d). To watch Mary, 22 years old and 46kg light, is to watch the physical equivalent of a raconteur of irrepressible wit and repartee. It feels like pugilism.\n\nIn the breaks, the women\u2019s coach Anoop Kumar rubs down her arms and legs. There is something wonderful in this unselfconscious athletic intimacy among countrymen who might be segregated by gender on public transport; in a country, indeed, where women boxers were initially asked, in the interests of modesty, to wear t-shirts under their vests.\n\nAs the clock ticks on in the contest, something raw cracks through the balletic Brownian motion. Grunts can be heard, the odd wild haymaker appears. There is something more existential at stake: boxing, where metaphor is meaningless because here it is what it is. Mary has never felt pain in a ring, or fear; those are areas she forbids her mind to go. What she does sometimes feel is the title of her favourite song, \u201cLonely\u201d, by the Senegalese pop star Akon. Early in the last round, she throws a strong right off-balance to the head of the Korean, which forces her into a standing eight-count. The vulnerability in her opponent flares like a rage in Mary\u2019s movements; she stalks her nervous prey around the ring, showing the killer instinct that figures in every appraisal of her.\n\nWhen she wins, she takes her bows and is carried aloft briefly by Anoop in celebration. \u201cI thank God,\u201d she says pointing upwards, as the camera follows her, \u201cGod.\u201d\n\nIn Barbados, five years later, women\u2019s boxing has come on. The referee is a woman; the number of rounds has increased from three to four, and Mary herself has had to move up to flyweight, 48kg, the new lightest category. For once she is taller than her opponent, a Romanian, whom, she recalls dismissively, she has defeated twice before. By this stage, she says, she is a smart boxer, an all-round boxer, she can dance around her opponent and study her for a whole round if required. She could finish a championship final without feeling spent.\n\nThere is another crucial difference: the women are both wearing skirts. It was the first tournament to feature skirts, and when the boxing association recommended them for the Olympics, it caused a furore. An online petition called it a \u201cludicrous recommendation [that] only serves to enforce gender stereotypes\u201d, and collected 55,000 signatures. The skirt was made optional. Mary finds it comfortable and attractive, and if the Indian boxing federation had issued skirts for London, she would have liked to wear one.\n\n\u201cMen fighting men to determine worth (ie, masculinity) excludes women as completely as the female experience of childbirth excludes men,\u201d wrote Joyce Carol Oates. \u201cRaw aggression is thought to be the peculiar province of men, as nurturing is the peculiar province of women. (The female boxer violates this stereotype and cannot be taken seriously\u2014she is parody, she is cartoon, she is monstrous.)\u201d\n\nMary Kom violates the stereotype of the violating stereotype. This is her extraordinary achievement. Raw aggression, childbirth, nurturing, teaching, are all her province. She enjoys doing her nails and visiting the beauty parlour, loves raising her children, and yes, she will fight with a skirt on. These aren\u2019t contradictions. She is not closing worlds, she is expanding them.\n\nAs she wins, again Anoop holds her aloft, one hand briefly fanning out in the air to signify her fifth world title. Waiting her turn at the podium, she asks her team-mates to pass her the Indian flag, and wraps herself in it. The hand-held camera pans to the ascending flags as the Indian national anthem plays, and you think: the nation which recognises Mary Kom would be a better nation.\n\nThere is a video online, a tribute to Mary by a Manipuri rock band. In the montage of visuals is a shot of her weeping while addressing a gathering of young students. Why, I ask her, what made her emotional?\n\n\u201cI was giving a speech about my story, how I\u2019m doing my boxing. So first when I start boxing, it\u2019s very very hard, I\u2019m doing a lot of struggle. My family cannot give me full financial support. As a player we are supposed to have good shoes, good dress, no? Whatever my family is getting for me, I used to wear and play. I\u2019m fighting five years without any good diet. No supplement, no egg. No breakfast. Just lunch and dinner, vegetable only and rice. Sometimes when the relative I am staying with in Imphal, when he gets salary, then we get meat. Once a month, yes, exactly. So I get emotional.\u201d She laughs at the thought of her tears, as she always laughs.\n\nAnd if you ask the phenomenal Mary Kom what makes a world champion, she will say: \u201cBoxer has to be smart. Boxer has to be strong. But main is will. Main is will.\u201d\n\nOlympic women\u2019s boxing Excel, London, August 5th-9th 2012"

    "text": "If the best things in life are supposed to be free, the best days out rarely are. A trip to the \u201chappiest place on Earth\u201d (or Disneyland\u2019s resort in California, as the grown-ups who have to fork out usually call it) will cost a family of four about $500 (\u00a3390) in tickets. And that\u2019s before you\u2019ve shelled out for hot dogs and sugary delights, snapshots of your loved ones riding a flying Dumbo, and a hotel with fairy-tale turrets. Don\u2019t expect those thrills to get any cheaper, either. The entry fee to Disney\u2019s American theme parks has risen by nearly 40% in the last decade \u2013 even after adjusting for inflation \u2013 and has quadrupled since the 1970s.\n\nThe cost of other fancy spectacles has also soared. In America, which has the best historical data for such events, tickets to Broadway musicals have gone up by more than a third since 2008. (Some of that increase has been caused by the popularity of \u201cHamilton\u201d, a hip-hop history of the Founding Fathers, which at $270 a pop is more than twice as expensive as a typical show.) Real average prices for tickets to the theatre, pop concerts and American football games have surged by 15-30% in the same period. Even cinemas are charging more, despite the vast libraries of movies and TV that we can stream at home.\n\nA comparison of price data across entertainment categories throws up a few surprises. Those who claim that a night at the opera is only for the elite should know that attending a top-of-the-range gig is nearly as pricey: an average opera ticket in London costs \u00a381 ($103), compared with a global average of $96 for the 50 most-lucrative music tours. And the Royal Opera House in London boasts that 30% of its seats go for \u00a335 or under \u2013 but good luck finding that sort of deal for Bruce Springsteen or Jennifer Lopez.\n\nThe priciest pastime is to be a sports fan, given the regularity of the events. The cheapest season ticket to Liverpool Football Club costs \u00a3685 \u2013 for residents of the local area, that\u2019s nearly 10% of their disposable income. Merchandise, away tickets and trips to Europe can easily take that figure to 30%.\n\nThe price of fun is far higher in America than elsewhere. Whether you want to watch a show, visit a tourist attraction or ride a rollercoaster, in America many forms of entertainment cost twice as much as they do in Europe and Asia. Some of that discrepancy reflects a lack of government subsidies in America. Exuberant fandom plays a large part too. Tickets to the Super Bowl go for upwards of $5,000 each \u2013 an eye-watering fee for an evening that could end in tears."

    "title": "Smoking with David Hockney",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The Conservatorium Hotel in Amsterdam enforces a strict no-smoking policy. Unless, that is, you are David Hockney. When I meet him in his room one drizzly afternoon in February, he is sitting on the sofa, dressed in a lime-green cardigan, a red-and-white polka-dot neckerchief and a pair of primrose spectacles. On the table in front of him are the half-eaten remains of a smoked-salmon bagel and four packs of Davidoff cigarettes. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very smooth, these,\u201d he says in his slow Yorkshire drawl, his voice grimed by 63 years of tobacco. \u201cThe best Virginia cigarette you can buy.\u201d\n\nHockney, who is 81, is jet-lagged. He flew in the previous day from Los Angeles, where he has lived on and off since the 1960s. He\u2019s in Amsterdam for the opening of an exhibition of his own work at the Van Gogh Museum. \u201cJP calls it the Vince and Dave show,\u201d he says, referring to Jean-Pierre, his studio manager and long-standing friend. The museum\u2019s first show dedicated to a contemporary painter is likely to be a crowd-pleaser. More than 1.5m people went to his retrospective in 2017, shown at Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Last year, \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\u201d, which he painted in 1972, went for $90.3m at Christie\u2019s in New York \u2013 the most expensive work by a living artist ever sold at auction.\n\nHockney receives no proceeds from auction sales in America and bats away talk of money. \u201cYou know what Oscar Wilde said?\u201d he asks with a note of bitter bemusement: \u201cThe only person who likes all kinds of art is an auctioneer. It\u2019s a madness, that.\u201d Right now, with an hour spare before checking the installation, he\u2019s more interested in sharing his greatest passion outside painting. \u201cHere, try one of these,\u201d he says, handing me a Davidoff.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t smoke when he\u2019s actually painting \u2013 \u201cmy hands are occupied\u201d \u2013 but does so whenever he steps back to inspect the work in progress, and pretty much any other time too. He consumes a pack a day and avoids anywhere he cannot smoke. Before arriving in Amsterdam, his assistant called ahead and, in exchange for a hefty fee \u2013 presumably to cover fumigation \u2013 arranged a special dispensation so he could puff away in his room. Hockney takes an idiosyncratic approach to his health: in the 1970s he claimed that eating large quantities of pickled onions helped to keep his arteries clear; he recently said that he owed his longevity to washing his hands and brushing his teeth regularly.\n\nToday he dismisses all concern about his body. \u201cI would point out that among my colleagues, Picasso smoked, lived to be 91; Monet smoked, lived to be 86; Renoir smoked, lived to be 78; Van Gogh smoked a pipe, and he died early, but not from smoking; C\u00e9zanne smoked. Lots of painters smoked and I don\u2019t know one who died young. Monet smoked all day!\u201d (After our meeting he sends a message: \u201cI forgot one thing \u2013 Hitler was the biggest anti-smoker. Doesn\u2019t that say it all?\u201d)\n\nHe berates what he calls the \u201cprofessional non-smokers\u201d who offend his sense of adventure. Perched on the edge of the sofa, he begins to recite W.H. Auden:\n\nGive me a doctor partridge-plump,\n\nShort in the leg and broad in the rump,\n\nAn endomorph with gentle hands\n\nWho\u2019ll never make absurd demands\n\nThat I abandon all my vices\n\nNor pull a long face in a crisis,\n\nBut with a twinkle in his eye\n\nWill tell me that I have to die.\n\nHockney\u2019s cigarette evangelism is an expression of a contrariness that has defined his career as an artist. He took up smoking as an art student in Bradford, the Yorkshire town where he was born in 1937. His father Kenneth, who worked as a clerk, was a militant anti-smoker. In the 1950s Kenneth attended the Aldermaston marches against nuclear weapons \u2013 not to protest about the bomb but the evils of tobacco. Hockney points out that he has now outlived his diabetic father by six years: \u201cIt was chocolate biscuits that killed him.\u201d (Hockney\u2019s tastes are quite different: last year he ate only caviar for Christmas lunch.)\n\nHockney ignored his father when he tried to whip the Woodbines from his mouth, just as he paid no attention to orthodoxies in general. As a young painter in the early 1960s he challenged British laws against gay sex with a series of pictures he calls \u201chomosexual propaganda\u201d, depicting men in the shower, in bed and in each other. One showed a couple 69-ing, their penises replaced by squirting tubes of Colgate toothpaste.\n\nSince then he has zigzagged wildly, investigating an extraordinary variety of styles. As Martin Gayford, a British art critic who has collaborated with Hockney on several books and been painted by him, puts it, \u201che always had the self-confidence to ignore what critics and curators were telling him he ought to be doing.\u201d\n\nHe has made both figurative and abstract work, experimented with photography, painted portraits, landscapes, still lifes and combinations of all three in restrained black-and-white and hot colour. Over the past 20 years he has spent much of his time in Bridlington, on the coast of East Yorkshire, painting the landscape he grew up in. A selection of these pictures is being shown in Amsterdam.\n\nToday, with a cigarette hanging permanently from his fingers as he peers owlishly over his big yellow glasses, Hockney talks about his enthusiasms with the stridency of a bar-room regular. They range from the limitations of photography (\u201cthe idea that a photograph is the ultimate depiction of reality is absolutely bonkers!\u201d) to the constraints of traditional perspective (\u201cI\u2019ve always known there was something wrong with perspective\u201d).\n\nEventually Hockney\u2019s assistant arrives to take us to the installation at the museum. Hockney reaches behind the sofa to pick up his walking stick and dons a tweed flat cap, which, together with his neckerchief and loose collar, makes him look like a fashion-conscious farmer. He also brings with him a portable ashtray \u2013 a little pouch with red-and-white stripes and a blue flap, made in Japan from some kind of heat-resistant plastic.\n\nHockney says he has felt an affinity with Van Gogh ever since he first saw his pictures at the Manchester City Art Gallery in 1954. \u201cWe went on the bus, from the art school, over the moors. I do remember the colour, because Manchester and Bradford weren\u2019t that colourful.\u201d He says that both he and Van Gogh were \u201cfrom a dark place, and we had to go somewhere else to see the colour\u201d.\n\nVan Gogh\u2019s haven was Provence; for Hockney it was California, which he first visited in 1963. \u201cI immediately felt the colour and I got it in the work.\u201d It was in California that he painted many of his most famous pictures, including \u201cA Bigger Splash\u201d (1967), with its bright blue swimming pool, banana-yellow diving board and marshmallow-pink house. Smoking has had a peripheral influence even on Hockney\u2019s visual imagination: in the 1970s he told an interviewer that elements of his sets for a production of \u201cThe Magic Flute\u201d were inspired by an advert for Kool cigarettes; he hoped someone might look up from the stalls and think, \u201cGolly, menthol green.\u201d Today he admits that the splash of his best-known work is \u201crather smoky\u201d.\n\nEven when Hockney paints elsewhere he takes the Californian palette with him. The first room of his exhibition includes \u201cMay Blossom on the Roman Road\u201d (2009), a giant picture of hawthorns in flower, where the road is a hot pinky-orange and the bushes take on a stiff, almost cactus-like form. In many of his Yorkshire pictures he seems to lay the colours of one landscape over those of another.\n\nHockney\u2019s period of painting Yorkshire ended in tragedy. We come to a series of charcoal drawings that depict the arrival of spring in 2013. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t finish them,\u201d he says. \u201cDominic died and we were very down.\u201d This is Dominic Elliott, his 23-year-old assistant who died in March 2013 after drinking drain cleaner at Hockney\u2019s house in Bridlington. Afterwards Hockney fled back to LA, where he has been living ever since. This year he will return to painting the spring, in a house he bought recently near Pont l\u2019\u00c9v\u00eaque \u2013 \u201cwhere the cheese comes from\u201d \u2013 in Normandy. \u201cThey have cherry blossom, apple blossom, pear blossom, blackthorn blossom, hawthorn blossom.\u201d He will unfold its arrival on a long panorama, like the Bayeux tapestry, so that viewers will walk through it.\n\nAfter looking at the rest of the show, Hockney pronounces himself satisfied. \u201cI\u2019m no Van Gogh, really, but it\u2019s okay isn\u2019t it?\u201d One curator asks if he\u2019d be interested in looking at the museum\u2019s collection of Pissarros, but Hockney is feeling his jet lag. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is going back to bed,\u201d he replies. But in the hotel lobby, conversation drifts once again to the Davidoffs. Hockney turns to me: \u201cFancy another?\u201d\n\nHockney - Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, March 1st - May 26th"

    "title": "These old, anatomical drawings are worth dissecting",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "During his long journey through Europe and the Levant in 1867, Mark Twain stopped off in Milan. Like many, he was struck by the grandeur of the city\u2019s great cathedral, but it was something else that truly became etched in his memory. Standing inside the cathedral was a statue of St Bartholomew, the apostle who had been skinned alive, and who was depicted with his skin draped around his shoulders as if it were a towel. In \u201cThe Innocents Abroad\u201d, Twain\u2019s account of that year of travel, he recounts: \u201cThe figure was that of a man without a skin; with every vein, artery, muscle, every fibre and tendon and tissue of the human frame represented in minute detail... It was a hideous thing, and yet there was a fascination about it somehow.\u201d\n\nSkinhead The flayed body in \u201cA Description of the Body of Man\u201d (1616)\n\nAnimated by this same fascination, physicians and artists have, over the centuries, opened up the human body and recorded what they discovered inside, as visitors to a new exhibition at the Royal College of Physicians in London will find. \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d brings together a small yet impressive selection of anatomical illustrations, produced primarily by Western physicians and artists (though there are some striking exceptions) from the late Middle Ages through to the 20th century. These scrolls, prints and woodcuts show how these scientists grappled with the challenges of representing human anatomy, and in so doing made illustrations that are as gruesome as they are compelling.\n\nVarious obstacles stood in the way of those who wished to produce accurate representations of our insides. Dissections are the best way to learn about human anatomy: nothing can replace the experience of excavating layers of tissue yourself. But for centuries, the Christian and Islamic worlds imposed legal and religious restrictions on the practice. In 18th and 19th-century Britain, for instance, the only bodies legally available for dissection were those of executed criminals; with demand far outstripping supply, \u201cbody snatchers\u201d began digging up cadavers and selling them to medical schools. Once the corpse was on the dissection table, the anatomist had to acclimate to the smells of rotting flesh \u2013 Leonardo da Vinci warned the anatomy student that you \u201cwill perhaps be impeded by your stomach\u201d. He then (for it was invariably a \u201che\u201d) had to figure out how to represent a three-dimensional object \u2013 one that moves and changes with time \u2013 on a two-dimensional medium: how to capture not only the winding contours of the intestines, but a beating heart or heaving lungs, on a flat piece of canvas.\n\nOn point A guide to acupuncture by Hozumi Koremasa (1820s)\n\nSo anatomists collaborated with artists capable of committing their visions to paper. Even though the artist\u2019s knowledge of physiology often matched that of the anatomist, the former was usually obliged to follow the latter\u2019s instructions. Unsurprisingly, they sometimes clashed. Surgeons complained that artists over-embellished what were supposed to be clear depictions illustrating the function of a particular body part. Samuel Thomas von Sommering, a German physician, protested in 1791 that overly detailed sketches could do \u201charm to the important points\u201d. Arnaud-\u00c9loi Gautier d\u2019Agoty, a late 18th-century French painter whose father had pioneered new colour-printing techniques in his anatomical illustrations, disagreed. \u201cFor men to be instructed,\u201d he insisted, \u201cthey must be seduced by aesthetics.\u201d\n\nTwain was haunted by the statue of St Bartholomew. \u201cI am very sorry I saw it,\u201d he concluded, fearing he was doomed to forever dream of its \u201ccorded arms\u201d, \u201cstringy cold legs\u201d and \u201cdead eyes\u201d. The dead bodies depicted in \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d are sure to embed themselves in the minds of visitors, but not because they inspire revulsion so much as marvel \u2013 not only at the boundless complexities of the human body but also at the ingenuity of the human mind."

    "title": "Smoking with David Hockney",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The Conservatorium Hotel in Amsterdam enforces a strict no-smoking policy. Unless, that is, you are David Hockney. When I meet him in his room one drizzly afternoon in February, he is sitting on the sofa, dressed in a lime-green cardigan, a red-and-white polka-dot neckerchief and a pair of primrose spectacles. On the table in front of him are the half-eaten remains of a smoked-salmon bagel and four packs of Davidoff cigarettes. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very smooth, these,\u201d he says in his slow Yorkshire drawl, his voice grimed by 63 years of tobacco. \u201cThe best Virginia cigarette you can buy.\u201d\n\nHockney, who is 81, is jet-lagged. He flew in the previous day from Los Angeles, where he has lived on and off since the 1960s. He\u2019s in Amsterdam for the opening of an exhibition of his own work at the Van Gogh Museum. \u201cJP calls it the Vince and Dave show,\u201d he says, referring to Jean-Pierre, his studio manager and long-standing friend. The museum\u2019s first show dedicated to a contemporary painter is likely to be a crowd-pleaser. More than 1.5m people went to his retrospective in 2017, shown at Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Last year, \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\u201d, which he painted in 1972, went for $90.3m at Christie\u2019s in New York \u2013 the most expensive work by a living artist ever sold at auction.\n\nHockney receives no proceeds from auction sales in America and bats away talk of money. \u201cYou know what Oscar Wilde said?\u201d he asks with a note of bitter bemusement: \u201cThe only person who likes all kinds of art is an auctioneer. It\u2019s a madness, that.\u201d Right now, with an hour spare before checking the installation, he\u2019s more interested in sharing his greatest passion outside painting. \u201cHere, try one of these,\u201d he says, handing me a Davidoff.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t smoke when he\u2019s actually painting \u2013 \u201cmy hands are occupied\u201d \u2013 but does so whenever he steps back to inspect the work in progress, and pretty much any other time too. He consumes a pack a day and avoids anywhere he cannot smoke. Before arriving in Amsterdam, his assistant called ahead and, in exchange for a hefty fee \u2013 presumably to cover fumigation \u2013 arranged a special dispensation so he could puff away in his room. Hockney takes an idiosyncratic approach to his health: in the 1970s he claimed that eating large quantities of pickled onions helped to keep his arteries clear; he recently said that he owed his longevity to washing his hands and brushing his teeth regularly.\n\nToday he dismisses all concern about his body. \u201cI would point out that among my colleagues, Picasso smoked, lived to be 91; Monet smoked, lived to be 86; Renoir smoked, lived to be 78; Van Gogh smoked a pipe, and he died early, but not from smoking; C\u00e9zanne smoked. Lots of painters smoked and I don\u2019t know one who died young. Monet smoked all day!\u201d (After our meeting he sends a message: \u201cI forgot one thing \u2013 Hitler was the biggest anti-smoker. Doesn\u2019t that say it all?\u201d)\n\nHe berates what he calls the \u201cprofessional non-smokers\u201d who offend his sense of adventure. Perched on the edge of the sofa, he begins to recite W.H. Auden:\n\nGive me a doctor partridge-plump,\n\nShort in the leg and broad in the rump,\n\nAn endomorph with gentle hands\n\nWho\u2019ll never make absurd demands\n\nThat I abandon all my vices\n\nNor pull a long face in a crisis,\n\nBut with a twinkle in his eye\n\nWill tell me that I have to die.\n\nHockney\u2019s cigarette evangelism is an expression of a contrariness that has defined his career as an artist. He took up smoking as an art student in Bradford, the Yorkshire town where he was born in 1937. His father Kenneth, who worked as a clerk, was a militant anti-smoker. In the 1950s Kenneth attended the Aldermaston marches against nuclear weapons \u2013 not to protest about the bomb but the evils of tobacco. Hockney points out that he has now outlived his diabetic father by six years: \u201cIt was chocolate biscuits that killed him.\u201d (Hockney\u2019s tastes are quite different: last year he ate only caviar for Christmas lunch.)\n\nHockney ignored his father when he tried to whip the Woodbines from his mouth, just as he paid no attention to orthodoxies in general. As a young painter in the early 1960s he challenged British laws against gay sex with a series of pictures he calls \u201chomosexual propaganda\u201d, depicting men in the shower, in bed and in each other. One showed a couple 69-ing, their penises replaced by squirting tubes of Colgate toothpaste.\n\nSince then he has zigzagged wildly, investigating an extraordinary variety of styles. As Martin Gayford, a British art critic who has collaborated with Hockney on several books and been painted by him, puts it, \u201che always had the self-confidence to ignore what critics and curators were telling him he ought to be doing.\u201d\n\nHe has made both figurative and abstract work, experimented with photography, painted portraits, landscapes, still lifes and combinations of all three in restrained black-and-white and hot colour. Over the past 20 years he has spent much of his time in Bridlington, on the coast of East Yorkshire, painting the landscape he grew up in. A selection of these pictures is being shown in Amsterdam.\n\nToday, with a cigarette hanging permanently from his fingers as he peers owlishly over his big yellow glasses, Hockney talks about his enthusiasms with the stridency of a bar-room regular. They range from the limitations of photography (\u201cthe idea that a photograph is the ultimate depiction of reality is absolutely bonkers!\u201d) to the constraints of traditional perspective (\u201cI\u2019ve always known there was something wrong with perspective\u201d).\n\nEventually Hockney\u2019s assistant arrives to take us to the installation at the museum. Hockney reaches behind the sofa to pick up his walking stick and dons a tweed flat cap, which, together with his neckerchief and loose collar, makes him look like a fashion-conscious farmer. He also brings with him a portable ashtray \u2013 a little pouch with red-and-white stripes and a blue flap, made in Japan from some kind of heat-resistant plastic.\n\nHockney says he has felt an affinity with Van Gogh ever since he first saw his pictures at the Manchester City Art Gallery in 1954. \u201cWe went on the bus, from the art school, over the moors. I do remember the colour, because Manchester and Bradford weren\u2019t that colourful.\u201d He says that both he and Van Gogh were \u201cfrom a dark place, and we had to go somewhere else to see the colour\u201d.\n\nVan Gogh\u2019s haven was Provence; for Hockney it was California, which he first visited in 1963. \u201cI immediately felt the colour and I got it in the work.\u201d It was in California that he painted many of his most famous pictures, including \u201cA Bigger Splash\u201d (1967), with its bright blue swimming pool, banana-yellow diving board and marshmallow-pink house. Smoking has had a peripheral influence even on Hockney\u2019s visual imagination: in the 1970s he told an interviewer that elements of his sets for a production of \u201cThe Magic Flute\u201d were inspired by an advert for Kool cigarettes; he hoped someone might look up from the stalls and think, \u201cGolly, menthol green.\u201d Today he admits that the splash of his best-known work is \u201crather smoky\u201d.\n\nEven when Hockney paints elsewhere he takes the Californian palette with him. The first room of his exhibition includes \u201cMay Blossom on the Roman Road\u201d (2009), a giant picture of hawthorns in flower, where the road is a hot pinky-orange and the bushes take on a stiff, almost cactus-like form. In many of his Yorkshire pictures he seems to lay the colours of one landscape over those of another.\n\nHockney\u2019s period of painting Yorkshire ended in tragedy. We come to a series of charcoal drawings that depict the arrival of spring in 2013. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t finish them,\u201d he says. \u201cDominic died and we were very down.\u201d This is Dominic Elliott, his 23-year-old assistant who died in March 2013 after drinking drain cleaner at Hockney\u2019s house in Bridlington. Afterwards Hockney fled back to LA, where he has been living ever since. This year he will return to painting the spring, in a house he bought recently near Pont l\u2019\u00c9v\u00eaque \u2013 \u201cwhere the cheese comes from\u201d \u2013 in Normandy. \u201cThey have cherry blossom, apple blossom, pear blossom, blackthorn blossom, hawthorn blossom.\u201d He will unfold its arrival on a long panorama, like the Bayeux tapestry, so that viewers will walk through it.\n\nAfter looking at the rest of the show, Hockney pronounces himself satisfied. \u201cI\u2019m no Van Gogh, really, but it\u2019s okay isn\u2019t it?\u201d One curator asks if he\u2019d be interested in looking at the museum\u2019s collection of Pissarros, but Hockney is feeling his jet lag. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is going back to bed,\u201d he replies. But in the hotel lobby, conversation drifts once again to the Davidoffs. Hockney turns to me: \u201cFancy another?\u201d\n\nHockney - Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, March 1st - May 26th"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Writing convincing fantasy fiction is harder than it looks, argued J.R.R. Tolkien in an essay in 1947. Any old writer, he said, could describe a \u201cgreen sun\u201d. Many of them could even imagine it. But building a fantasy world \u201cinside which the green sun will be credible\u2026will certainly demand a special skill, a kind of elvish craft.\u201d Tolkien himself was undoubtedly born with that \u201celvish craft\u201d, as an exhibition at the Morgan Library in New York makes clear. To help him create a believable \u201cMiddle-earth\u201d, the setting for \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d, Tolkien produced hundreds of drawings and maps. They grounded his stories and helped him to keep track of thousands of years of history, sprawling geographies and complex languages.\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien, who was born in South Africa in 1892 and moved to England when he was four, began dreaming up fantasy worlds as a child. His mother Mabel, who died when he was 12, had instilled in him a love of art and language, and taught him Latin and Greek. As a teenager, Tolkien added Old and Middle English, Old Norse, and Gothic to his repertoire. At Oxford University, where he studied English, he began inventing a language (which would later form the basis of \u201cElvish\u201d) and sketching imaginary landscapes, although as far as we know, he didn\u2019t write any stories until after he graduated in 1915. A decade later, by which time he was an academic and father, he would tuck himself away in his study at the end of the day to work on his evolving \u201cLegendarium\u201d, writing stories and poems and drawing ever-more intricate landscapes. His debut novel, \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d, some of which first appeared in his children\u2019s bedtime stories, was published in 1937. Its maps, endpapers and dustjacket were illustrated by Tolkien himself.\n\nMiddle-earthly powers The dustjacket for the first edition of \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d (Image \u00a9 The Tolkien Estate)\n\nThis exhibition is a slightly more compact version of last year\u2019s at the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford, where Tolkien studied and taught, and where the bulk of his archive is stored. It brings together original manuscripts of \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d and \u201cThe Silmarillion\u201d with illustrations and maps that take you right inside his Legendarium. Walking through it, you feel as though you\u2019re peering over his shoulder in his study, watching an elvish conjuror at work. In Tolkien\u2019s hands, fantasy has never seemed more real."

    "title": "The price of fun",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "If the best things in life are supposed to be free, the best days out rarely are. A trip to the \u201chappiest place on Earth\u201d (or Disneyland\u2019s resort in California, as the grown-ups who have to fork out usually call it) will cost a family of four about $500 (\u00a3390) in tickets. And that\u2019s before you\u2019ve shelled out for hot dogs and sugary delights, snapshots of your loved ones riding a flying Dumbo, and a hotel with fairy-tale turrets. Don\u2019t expect those thrills to get any cheaper, either. The entry fee to Disney\u2019s American theme parks has risen by nearly 40% in the last decade \u2013 even after adjusting for inflation \u2013 and has quadrupled since the 1970s.\n\nThe cost of other fancy spectacles has also soared. In America, which has the best historical data for such events, tickets to Broadway musicals have gone up by more than a third since 2008. (Some of that increase has been caused by the popularity of \u201cHamilton\u201d, a hip-hop history of the Founding Fathers, which at $270 a pop is more than twice as expensive as a typical show.) Real average prices for tickets to the theatre, pop concerts and American football games have surged by 15-30% in the same period. Even cinemas are charging more, despite the vast libraries of movies and TV that we can stream at home.\n\nA comparison of price data across entertainment categories throws up a few surprises. Those who claim that a night at the opera is only for the elite should know that attending a top-of-the-range gig is nearly as pricey: an average opera ticket in London costs \u00a381 ($103), compared with a global average of $96 for the 50 most-lucrative music tours. And the Royal Opera House in London boasts that 30% of its seats go for \u00a335 or under \u2013 but good luck finding that sort of deal for Bruce Springsteen or Jennifer Lopez.\n\nThe priciest pastime is to be a sports fan, given the regularity of the events. The cheapest season ticket to Liverpool Football Club costs \u00a3685 \u2013 for residents of the local area, that\u2019s nearly 10% of their disposable income. Merchandise, away tickets and trips to Europe can easily take that figure to 30%.\n\nThe price of fun is far higher in America than elsewhere. Whether you want to watch a show, visit a tourist attraction or ride a rollercoaster, in America many forms of entertainment cost twice as much as they do in Europe and Asia. Some of that discrepancy reflects a lack of government subsidies in America. Exuberant fandom plays a large part too. Tickets to the Super Bowl go for upwards of $5,000 each \u2013 an eye-watering fee for an evening that could end in tears."

    "title": "These old, anatomical drawings are worth dissecting",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "During his long journey through Europe and the Levant in 1867, Mark Twain stopped off in Milan. Like many, he was struck by the grandeur of the city\u2019s great cathedral, but it was something else that truly became etched in his memory. Standing inside the cathedral was a statue of St Bartholomew, the apostle who had been skinned alive, and who was depicted with his skin draped around his shoulders as if it were a towel. In \u201cThe Innocents Abroad\u201d, Twain\u2019s account of that year of travel, he recounts: \u201cThe figure was that of a man without a skin; with every vein, artery, muscle, every fibre and tendon and tissue of the human frame represented in minute detail... It was a hideous thing, and yet there was a fascination about it somehow.\u201d\n\nSkinhead The flayed body in \u201cA Description of the Body of Man\u201d (1616)\n\nAnimated by this same fascination, physicians and artists have, over the centuries, opened up the human body and recorded what they discovered inside, as visitors to a new exhibition at the Royal College of Physicians in London will find. \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d brings together a small yet impressive selection of anatomical illustrations, produced primarily by Western physicians and artists (though there are some striking exceptions) from the late Middle Ages through to the 20th century. These scrolls, prints and woodcuts show how these scientists grappled with the challenges of representing human anatomy, and in so doing made illustrations that are as gruesome as they are compelling.\n\nVarious obstacles stood in the way of those who wished to produce accurate representations of our insides. Dissections are the best way to learn about human anatomy: nothing can replace the experience of excavating layers of tissue yourself. But for centuries, the Christian and Islamic worlds imposed legal and religious restrictions on the practice. In 18th and 19th-century Britain, for instance, the only bodies legally available for dissection were those of executed criminals; with demand far outstripping supply, \u201cbody snatchers\u201d began digging up cadavers and selling them to medical schools. Once the corpse was on the dissection table, the anatomist had to acclimate to the smells of rotting flesh \u2013 Leonardo da Vinci warned the anatomy student that you \u201cwill perhaps be impeded by your stomach\u201d. He then (for it was invariably a \u201che\u201d) had to figure out how to represent a three-dimensional object \u2013 one that moves and changes with time \u2013 on a two-dimensional medium: how to capture not only the winding contours of the intestines, but a beating heart or heaving lungs, on a flat piece of canvas.\n\nOn point A guide to acupuncture by Hozumi Koremasa (1820s)\n\nSo anatomists collaborated with artists capable of committing their visions to paper. Even though the artist\u2019s knowledge of physiology often matched that of the anatomist, the former was usually obliged to follow the latter\u2019s instructions. Unsurprisingly, they sometimes clashed. Surgeons complained that artists over-embellished what were supposed to be clear depictions illustrating the function of a particular body part. Samuel Thomas von Sommering, a German physician, protested in 1791 that overly detailed sketches could do \u201charm to the important points\u201d. Arnaud-\u00c9loi Gautier d\u2019Agoty, a late 18th-century French painter whose father had pioneered new colour-printing techniques in his anatomical illustrations, disagreed. \u201cFor men to be instructed,\u201d he insisted, \u201cthey must be seduced by aesthetics.\u201d\n\nTwain was haunted by the statue of St Bartholomew. \u201cI am very sorry I saw it,\u201d he concluded, fearing he was doomed to forever dream of its \u201ccorded arms\u201d, \u201cstringy cold legs\u201d and \u201cdead eyes\u201d. The dead bodies depicted in \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d are sure to embed themselves in the minds of visitors, but not because they inspire revulsion so much as marvel \u2013 not only at the boundless complexities of the human body but also at the ingenuity of the human mind."

    "title": "How Turkish coffee destroyed an empire",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "It\u2019s known as Greek coffee to Greeks and Cypriots, Bosnian coffee to Bosnians, Armenian coffee to Armenians, Arabic coffee to Arabs, and Turkish coffee to Turks, Croatians, Albanians and Serbs. But in the mid-16th century, it was just kahve \u2013 coffee. At the time, these people were ruled over by the Ottoman Empire, which swept kahve-lovers from south-eastern Europe to Persia into its wide embrace. But by the early years of the 19th century, the empire was beginning to fracture. Kahve played a little-known role in its eventual demise.\n\nCoffee came to Turkey during the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. When the man he despatched to govern Yemen came across an energising drink known there as qahwah, he brought it back to the Ottoman court in Constantinople, where it was an instant hit. A palace kahveci usta, or coffee-master, might have tens of assistants helping him grind Arabica beans into an extra-fine powder similar in texture to today\u2019s instant espresso. This was then boiled in copper pots called cezves. The resulting drink \u2013 bitter, black and topped with a thin layer of froth created by pouring it quickly \u2013 was served in small porcelain cups. To balance its bitterness, legend has it, Suleiman\u2019s wife, H\u00fcrrem Sultan, took her kahve with a glass of water and a square of Turkish Delight \u2013 which is how it is served in Turkey today.\n\nNot everyone, however, believed that the Koran permitted Muslims to drink this stimulating new beverage. Although Islamic scripture doesn\u2019t specifically mention coffee, one hardline cleric in Suleiman\u2019s court issued a fatwa against the drink on the grounds that consuming anything burnt was forbidden. But that didn\u2019t dampen its appeal. The first public coffee house, or kahvehane, was founded in Istanbul in 1555 by two Syrian merchants. Soon, nearly one in six shops in the city \u2013 ranging in size from small neighbourhood caf\u00e9s to large community centres \u2013 served coffee. Gradually, kahve percolated through to the far reaches of the empire.\n\nTurkish delight The owner of an antique shop in the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul sips a cup of Turkish coffee\n\nCoffee houses gave men somewhere to congregate other than in homes, mosques or markets, providing a place for them to socialise, exchange information, entertain \u2013 and be educated. Literate members of society read aloud the news of the day; janissaries, members of an elite cadre of Ottoman troops, planned acts of protest against the Sultan; officials discussed court intrigue; merchants exchanged rumours of war. And the illiterate majority listened in. In the coffee houses they were introduced to ideas that spelled trouble for the Ottoman state: rebellion, self-determination and the fallibility of the powerful.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the authorities began to regard the kahvehane as a threat. Some sultans installed spies in coffee houses to gauge public opinion; others, like Murad IV, an early-18th-century sultan, tried shutting them down altogether. But they were too profitable. When simmering nationalist movements came to a boil throughout Ottoman lands in the 19th century, the popularity of coffee houses burgeoned. Ethnic groups in European regions of the empire with an Eastern Orthodox Christian majority started agitating for independence. Nationalist leaders planned their tactics and cemented alliances in the coffee houses of Thessaloniki, Sofia and Belgrade. Their caffeine-fuelled efforts succeeded with the establishment of an independent Greece in 1821, Serbia in 1835, and Bulgaria in 1878. The reign of kahve was over.\n\nThe different nations added signature twists to the drink: Greeks make it with mastic, a plant resin; Croatians caraway seeds; Arabs infuse it with cardamom and serve it in small cups without handles called finjans. Even when taken sade, or plain, the flavour profile depends on the roast; the medium-to-darker beans of the Turkish variety produce coffee with an earthy taste, smoky notes and thick texture. When you drain your cup, you will see fine grains coating the bottom. The effects soon hit. Emperors of the world, beware."

    "title": "A pilgrimage to Japan\u2019s islands of calm",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "On an autumn day, I climb to a high point on the island of Oshima, a stepping-stone between Honshu, the largest of Japan\u2019s four main islands, and Shikoku, the smallest. I gaze across the shallow waters of the Seto Inland Sea. The wake from passenger ferries shuttling people and goods sends shimmers across the still surface. Far into the distance I can see the outline of island after island.\n\nI have come in search of an antidote to the concrete, bright lights and frenetic pace of Tokyo. I have travelled Japan\u2019s length and breadth since moving here in 2016. Nothing has matched the serenity of the Inland Sea: on this trip I feel as if I am returning to the country\u2019s womb.\n\nMany of Japan\u2019s creation myths are set along the shores of the Inland Sea and its 700-odd islands. The gods are said to have created these isles before the almost-7,000 others that make up the Japanese archipelago.\n\nThe Inland Sea, shaped like a long, knobbly finger, has been one of Japan\u2019s most important routes throughout history, home to sailors, traders and pirates, who charged fees for safe passage. Several of the country\u2019s biggest cities, including Kobe and Osaka, lie nearby. Despite that, the islands and the surrounding area are largely traditional and rural. Three sets of bridges now link Honshu to Shikoku, yet a slower pace of life still prevails on the other, smaller islands. People fish and farm. The streets are quiet by 9pm. In the morning I see children clad in crisp uniforms, carrying identical bulky backpacks, catch the ferry to school.\n\nThe region has long captured the imagination of those who have travelled here. Sakae Tsuboi set her novel, \u201cTwenty Four Eyes\u201d, on Shodoshima, the second-largest island. The book, which was later turned into a famous film about a teacher and her 12 students in the inter-war years, carries significant pacific undertones. Thomas Cook, a Briton who founded the first modern travel company, was wowed by the sea when he visited in the 1870s, writing that \u201cit surpassed all my dreams of beauty\u201d.\n\nThere are many ways to travel around the Inland Sea. On my last visit, I spent time on Naoshima and its smaller neighbour, Teshima. The two islands are now home to world-class museums and old houses that have been turned into interactive art venues, and outdoor sculptures such as Yayoi Kusama\u2019s colourful pumpkins. This time I opt to start my journey in Takamatsu, a laid-back city on the north-eastern tip of Shikoku, on the eastern shore of the Inland Sea. From there I make my way into the Iya Valley (below). The series of mountains and gorges are reminiscent of a verdant Grand Canyon. In the 12th century this secluded area of dramatic natural scenery was a hideout for warring clans and is now regarded as one of the Setouchi region\u2019s highlights for travellers.\n\nThe farther west I go into the valley, the more uninhabited it becomes. There is not a convenience store in sight. Trees, their leaves just starting to turn from green to yellow, hang over the river that flows through the valley. I cross traditional vine bridges which wobble unnervingly, on the way to the village of Ochiai, a village deep in the valley that tumbles down the terraced hillside. The lane that winds up the hill is lined with traditional thatched-roof houses, several of which have been stylishly refurbished for guests. Friendly locals, happy to see a visitor, gather on the road to greet me as I arrive. In the evening, they deliver a huge bento box to my door including fresh local tofu, pickles, miso soup and locally grown mikan, a mandarin-like citrus fruit.\n\nMy plan is to meander across a handful of islands in the middle of the sea. They are linked to Honshu and Shikoku, and one another, by the Shimanami Kaido, a 76km-long route that passes through six pretty islands joined by seven suspension bridges, which are remarkable in their own right. The journey is best enjoyed on bicycle: the bridges have bike lanes and the route is well signposted and predominantly flat, apart from some kindly designed climbs up to each bridge.\n\nOne morning at dawn I set off from Imabari, on Shikoku. It is drizzling and barely light, and the air is fresh. The floor is a carpet of leaves: it is so quiet and still that I can hear the soft patter of new ones falling amid the chorus of insect noise. I climb, panting, up the incline to the first bridge and am rewarded by a view of the islands rising out of the slick grey water. I cross the bridge, passing over a scattering of green and hilly islands, and descend into Oshima, happy to be peddling on flat land again.\n\nThe standard cycle route wanders along the edge of sandy beaches, through beautiful fishing villages and less attractive industrial ports, the islands\u2019 lifelines. It winds past groves of huge lemons and small plots planted with lettuces, and by clusters of houses, barely big enough to call hamlets, with their traditional roofs of cascading grey tiles. By mid-morning people are out and about. They wave as I pass by. When I stop to rest they chat about the weather and wish me luck with my ride.\n\nItsukushima shrine stands off the island of Miyajima near Hiroshima\n\nOn Omishima, I take a detour and head up to Oyamazumi, a spacious wooden shrine. Within the shrine\u2019s grounds camphor trees, said to be up to 3,000 years old, give the air a fresh, minty odour. The shrine is dedicated to gods who protect sailors and soldiers; in ancient times samurai visited to pray for success in battle. A neighbouring museum houses Japan\u2019s largest collection of samurai armoury. Today my only companions are a group of elderly Japanese and another cyclist, as sodden as I am.\n\nThe island of Ikuchijima is proud of its famous former residents, who include Kobo Daishi, a father of Japanese Buddhism, and some Japanese Christians who took refuge there to avoid persecution during the Edo era, the period between 1603 and 1868, when the country was ruled by the Tokugawa shogun\u00adate, Japan\u2019s last feudal government. Tourists, mostly Japanese, often spend time on the sands of Sunset Beach, which stretch for miles; today it is too cold to consider a dip.\n\nOn Mukaishima, I queue at the ferry terminal to catch a boat to Onomichi. This sophisticated waterfront city on the main island is a welcome place for a weary traveller. I enjoy a cup of coffee in one of the caf\u00e9s opened by urbanites who have moved here, before soaking my aching limbs and sinking into a soft bed. The luxury is welcome. But I already miss the simplicity, quiet and beauty of life on the islands.\n\nIsland guide\n\nThe Inland Sea\u2019s mild climate makes it a good destination year-round. Most days are fine, even in June, July and September when rainfall peaks. Stay in family-run lodges on the islands, modern business hotels in the cities and a thatched cottage in the Iya Valley. A majority of the Inland Sea\u2019s islands can be reached from ports in Honshu and Shikoku. Cyclists can start the Shimanami Kaido at either Onomichi or Imabari and end at the other; bikes and helmets are available for hire. The public bike-rental system has stations on every island so you can dump your bike at any point and get a ferry the rest of the way. Tourist information offices have good maps and leaflets."

    "title": "Mansplainers, meet Sigrid",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "A good pop star connects to her listeners with songs that show she is animated by the same everyday emotions quickening inside the rest of us. When Adele sings about heartbreak we sense that she is expressing her own pain. When Robyn sings about loneliness, we can tell that she speaks from personal experience. Though they seem to live on stage or screen, these singers are also struggling to keep their heads above water in the same choppy sea of emotion we all find ourselves in. They convince us that they know how we feel.\n\nEnter Sigrid Solbakk Raabe, (above) a 22-year-old Norwegian singer-songwriter, who grew up listening to Robyn and Adele, a particular favourite. Sigrid\u2019s debut album, Sucker Punch, makes it clear that she listened closely. Since she was signed to a major label two years ago, life has been a whirlwind of international touring and publicity. Yet from those experiences \u2013 in 2017 she performed at Glastonbury and the following year the BBC anointed her the \u201cSound of 2018\u201d \u2013 Sigrid has managed to distil a charming ordinariness. \u201cDon\u2019t Kill My Vibe\u201d, the album\u2019s lead single, was inspired by a studio session in which she felt belittled by the middle-aged male producers. But the song\u2019s lyrics are shorn of specifics, making \u201cDon\u2019t Kill My Vibe\u201d a relatable ode to resilience in the face of all mansplainers and a perfect anthem for the age of #MeToo.\n\nResounding with Sigrid\u2019s demands to be taken seriously, the record also follows her as she traces love\u2019s peaks and troughs. She has a talent for capturing what it feels like to be a young woman in the 21st century. Robyn and Adele: you\u2019d better watch out. ~ CHARLIE McCANN\n\nSucker Punch March 8th\n\nHole in one\n\nStats are that rare thing, a dance band with a soul. Neither a nostalgia act nor a vehicle for slick overproduction, the London group sounds refreshingly human.\n\nTheir debut LP , Other People\u2019s Lives, emerged from frontman Ed Seed\u2019s realisation that, in contrast to people who can talk about their lives as if they are \u201ccoherent, relatable stories, full of passion and travel and wonder\u201d, his own life story was \u201cfull of holes\u201d. On \u201cThere Is a Story I Tell About My Life\u201d, he sings: \u201cAll these dead ends, and I have to pretend, when really I just don\u2019t understand\u201d. If that sounds a tad navel-gazing for a dance record, listen instead to the band\u2019s taut arrangements, in which nervous, exacting bass lines give way to glittering synthesisers.\n\nOn \u201cRhythm of the Heart\u201d, peals of synth brass fit snugly beside crisp, high-gloss guitar. Comparisons to the Talking Heads, especially their propulsive fourth album, \u201cRemain in Light\u201d, are inevitable. Seed recalls David Byrne\u2019s astringent style and his posture, at once aloof and demonstrative. You can imagine him singing, as Byrne once did, \u201cChanging my shape/I feel like an accident.\u201d ~ DAN PIEPENBRING\n\nOther People\u2019s Lives February 15th\n\nKind of blue\n\nJessica Pratt\u2019s first two albums were readily identifiable as folk records. The American musician\u2019s songs were mainly composed of fingerpicked acoustic guitar \u2013 skipping arpeggios rather than strummed chords \u2013 and her voice. Though she has acoustic guitar on her third album, Quiet Signs is rather different. An album of creeping shadows, it opens with a brief instrumental, \u201cOpening Night\u201d, named for the cult classic John Cassavetes film, with spare, jazzy piano that evokes an emptying bar. Excursions beyond folk wend their way throughout this twilit album: \u201cPoly Blue\u201d, with its subdued bossa-nova rhythm and subtle chord changes, ventures towards the high-class easy listening of Burt Bacharach.\n\nThe experiments on \u201cQuiet Signs\u201d are not pastiche; Pratt is trying to find her own voice. Sometimes that voice climbs so high, it sounds like she\u2019s inhaled helium, making it difficult to decipher her lyrics. But if you can\u2019t quite make out the opening line of \u201cThis Time Around\u201d \u2013 \u201cThis time around has it gone so grey that my faith can\u2019t hold out?\u201d she burbles \u2013 the melancholy picture it paints is unmistakable. Far from a work of draughtsmanship, \u201cQuiet Signs\u201d is a beautiful impressionist piece. ~ MICHAEL HANN\n\nQuiet Signs February 8th"

    "title": "My shamanic facial in the city of angels",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "About halfway through my shamanic facial treatment at a pilates studio in Santa Monica, the Archangel Michael enters the room. He\u2019s brought his sword with him to sever vows I\u2019ve made in other lifetimes, explains my shaman, Julie. Michael is one of the Teachers: spirit guides from other realms who come to Earth to bring about great change. I\u2019m worried, though: it turns out Hitler was a Teacher too. \u201cHe came down with a very specific agenda,\u201d says Julie, adding quickly, \u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d I\u2019m relieved. Angels in Los Angeles is one thing, but no one wants a dead dictator showing up while they\u2019re lying on a treatment table having their face smothered in aloe vera.\n\nJulie Civiello Polier is one of a new wave of spiritual healers bringing good vibrations to the beautiful people of Los Angeles. Far from indigenous tribesmen, these urban shamans are blissed-out hipsters ministering to their clients with essential oils, crystals and sound baths \u2013 all for a handsome fee. Many work in the beauty industry, bringing a mystical element to otherwise superficial salon appointments. Shamanic beauty treatments promise a makeover both physical and spiritual \u2013 and as an Englishman newly arrived in LA , that\u2019s exactly what I needed.\n\nJulie begins to massage my face with Q -tips protruding from stainless-steel probes. These are fed by an electric current, which causes tiny flashes of light to shoot across my closed eyelids. Any slight alarm I feel is tempered by the soothing voice of Julie, a former actress, and the pan-pipe music playing in the background. Julie is adjusting the microcurrent to bring my fluids, tissues and cells into a more optimal relationship. In her view, it\u2019s not just what we eat, but also what we read and watch, that registers in our features. Mine, apparently, show signs of grief and disgust, which I ascribe to Southampton\u2019s league position and deadlock in the House of Commons: a severe case of Brexit-face which I\u2019d give anything to have zapped away.\n\nLie back and think of angels Julie gives a client a facial (Photo: Kristine Lo)\n\nAs she administers the facial, Julie is trying to receive messages from the Akashic realm. This is a kind of cosmic cloud-storage system that records every moment in every lifetime \u2013 a source of higher knowledge that could help guide me towards my true path. But she\u2019s having a hard time today. Not much is coming forward. Julie often struggles with English clients because of their tendency to \u201cpresent in a way that\u2019s kind and polite and lacking in emotion\u201d. I leave the studio feeling deeply relaxed, my skin emerging soft and radiant from under its coat of balms and unguents. But I can\u2019t help feeling a little short on inner wisdom. I may simply be too English to get the full benefit of Julie\u2019s treatment.\n\nIn a different part of Santa Monica, Andi Scarbrough offers shamanic hair rituals at her salon on Mondays. Fifteen minutes before my appointment, she experienced such a feeling of heaviness in her lower body that she had to sit down for a moment. Andi mentions this some way into our session: a two-hour \u201cdeep-dive\u201d that combines a haircut with shamanic healing. To alleviate the heaviness, she has mixed a special blend of essential oils and arranged crystals around her salon to expel any negative energy I may have brought in.\n\nWe begin with some crystal tracking. Andi produces an assortment of semi-precious stones and instructs me to move my left hand over them \u2014 left being the feminine, receptive side of the body \u2014 and pay attention to any tingling or changes in temperature I feel. I must be out of touch with my feminine side, as I feel nothing. That said, I\u2019m strangely drawn towards a pale-blue stone, a translucent violet one and a deep-blue one flecked with gold. Each has come forward with a message for me, explains Andi. They are angelite, amethyst and lapis lazuli, which are linked to wisdom, peace and enlightenment. All of which are messages I\u2019m happy to receive.\n\nCrystal palace Andi Scarbrough in her salon\n\nAndi drips essential oils into my hair and works them through with combs made of crystal. This is to get rid of any residual scepticism lurking near my crown chakra, one of the body\u2019s seven energy centres. Then she tackles my upper chakras with reiki, an ancient Japanese practice, channelling the universe\u2019s source energy towards me with the palms of her hands.\n\nIt turns out that my ear chakras are blocked. I\u2019ve put on \u201cenergetic earmuffs\u201d, says Andi, which are preventing me from fully receiving the universe\u2019s wisdom. I am relieved to have got to the heart of the problem. To unblock my ear chakras, Andi twangs two tuning forks and wields them near my head, where they vibrate at the frequency of the Earth and the Moon. I am already beginning to feel lighter, less encumbered. When she finally cuts my hair, Andi does a wonderful job, full of verve and nuance, but the task feels rather mundane compared to the spiritual breakthrough she has just achieved.\n\nI leave the salon with a takeaway crystal and an envelope of hair cuttings, which I burn as instructed on Venice Beach while repeating \u201cI am open to wonder\u201d \u2013 an affirmation to the universe. Centuries of inherited repression seem to evaporate in the setting sun.\n\nAs my plane touches down at Heathrow, I find the crystal in my pocket. Somehow, back in the cold and grey of an English February, its lustre has faded. Perhaps the bad vibes here are too strong? Or perhaps, like ouzo from Greece or minimal techno from Berlin, shamanic healing is one of those things that simply doesn\u2019t travel.\n\nArthur House received treatments from Andi Scarbrough at Crownworks and Julie Civiello Polier. During the course of his research he also had a session with Ursula Vari"

    "title": "These old, anatomical drawings are worth dissecting",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "During his long journey through Europe and the Levant in 1867, Mark Twain stopped off in Milan. Like many, he was struck by the grandeur of the city\u2019s great cathedral, but it was something else that truly became etched in his memory. Standing inside the cathedral was a statue of St Bartholomew, the apostle who had been skinned alive, and who was depicted with his skin draped around his shoulders as if it were a towel. In \u201cThe Innocents Abroad\u201d, Twain\u2019s account of that year of travel, he recounts: \u201cThe figure was that of a man without a skin; with every vein, artery, muscle, every fibre and tendon and tissue of the human frame represented in minute detail... It was a hideous thing, and yet there was a fascination about it somehow.\u201d\n\nSkinhead The flayed body in \u201cA Description of the Body of Man\u201d (1616)\n\nAnimated by this same fascination, physicians and artists have, over the centuries, opened up the human body and recorded what they discovered inside, as visitors to a new exhibition at the Royal College of Physicians in London will find. \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d brings together a small yet impressive selection of anatomical illustrations, produced primarily by Western physicians and artists (though there are some striking exceptions) from the late Middle Ages through to the 20th century. These scrolls, prints and woodcuts show how these scientists grappled with the challenges of representing human anatomy, and in so doing made illustrations that are as gruesome as they are compelling.\n\nVarious obstacles stood in the way of those who wished to produce accurate representations of our insides. Dissections are the best way to learn about human anatomy: nothing can replace the experience of excavating layers of tissue yourself. But for centuries, the Christian and Islamic worlds imposed legal and religious restrictions on the practice. In 18th and 19th-century Britain, for instance, the only bodies legally available for dissection were those of executed criminals; with demand far outstripping supply, \u201cbody snatchers\u201d began digging up cadavers and selling them to medical schools. Once the corpse was on the dissection table, the anatomist had to acclimate to the smells of rotting flesh \u2013 Leonardo da Vinci warned the anatomy student that you \u201cwill perhaps be impeded by your stomach\u201d. He then (for it was invariably a \u201che\u201d) had to figure out how to represent a three-dimensional object \u2013 one that moves and changes with time \u2013 on a two-dimensional medium: how to capture not only the winding contours of the intestines, but a beating heart or heaving lungs, on a flat piece of canvas.\n\nOn point A guide to acupuncture by Hozumi Koremasa (1820s)\n\nSo anatomists collaborated with artists capable of committing their visions to paper. Even though the artist\u2019s knowledge of physiology often matched that of the anatomist, the former was usually obliged to follow the latter\u2019s instructions. Unsurprisingly, they sometimes clashed. Surgeons complained that artists over-embellished what were supposed to be clear depictions illustrating the function of a particular body part. Samuel Thomas von Sommering, a German physician, protested in 1791 that overly detailed sketches could do \u201charm to the important points\u201d. Arnaud-\u00c9loi Gautier d\u2019Agoty, a late 18th-century French painter whose father had pioneered new colour-printing techniques in his anatomical illustrations, disagreed. \u201cFor men to be instructed,\u201d he insisted, \u201cthey must be seduced by aesthetics.\u201d\n\nTwain was haunted by the statue of St Bartholomew. \u201cI am very sorry I saw it,\u201d he concluded, fearing he was doomed to forever dream of its \u201ccorded arms\u201d, \u201cstringy cold legs\u201d and \u201cdead eyes\u201d. The dead bodies depicted in \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d are sure to embed themselves in the minds of visitors, but not because they inspire revulsion so much as marvel \u2013 not only at the boundless complexities of the human body but also at the ingenuity of the human mind."

    "title": "A pilgrimage to Japan\u2019s islands of calm",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "On an autumn day, I climb to a high point on the island of Oshima, a stepping-stone between Honshu, the largest of Japan\u2019s four main islands, and Shikoku, the smallest. I gaze across the shallow waters of the Seto Inland Sea. The wake from passenger ferries shuttling people and goods sends shimmers across the still surface. Far into the distance I can see the outline of island after island.\n\nI have come in search of an antidote to the concrete, bright lights and frenetic pace of Tokyo. I have travelled Japan\u2019s length and breadth since moving here in 2016. Nothing has matched the serenity of the Inland Sea: on this trip I feel as if I am returning to the country\u2019s womb.\n\nMany of Japan\u2019s creation myths are set along the shores of the Inland Sea and its 700-odd islands. The gods are said to have created these isles before the almost-7,000 others that make up the Japanese archipelago.\n\nThe Inland Sea, shaped like a long, knobbly finger, has been one of Japan\u2019s most important routes throughout history, home to sailors, traders and pirates, who charged fees for safe passage. Several of the country\u2019s biggest cities, including Kobe and Osaka, lie nearby. Despite that, the islands and the surrounding area are largely traditional and rural. Three sets of bridges now link Honshu to Shikoku, yet a slower pace of life still prevails on the other, smaller islands. People fish and farm. The streets are quiet by 9pm. In the morning I see children clad in crisp uniforms, carrying identical bulky backpacks, catch the ferry to school.\n\nThe region has long captured the imagination of those who have travelled here. Sakae Tsuboi set her novel, \u201cTwenty Four Eyes\u201d, on Shodoshima, the second-largest island. The book, which was later turned into a famous film about a teacher and her 12 students in the inter-war years, carries significant pacific undertones. Thomas Cook, a Briton who founded the first modern travel company, was wowed by the sea when he visited in the 1870s, writing that \u201cit surpassed all my dreams of beauty\u201d.\n\nThere are many ways to travel around the Inland Sea. On my last visit, I spent time on Naoshima and its smaller neighbour, Teshima. The two islands are now home to world-class museums and old houses that have been turned into interactive art venues, and outdoor sculptures such as Yayoi Kusama\u2019s colourful pumpkins. This time I opt to start my journey in Takamatsu, a laid-back city on the north-eastern tip of Shikoku, on the eastern shore of the Inland Sea. From there I make my way into the Iya Valley (below). The series of mountains and gorges are reminiscent of a verdant Grand Canyon. In the 12th century this secluded area of dramatic natural scenery was a hideout for warring clans and is now regarded as one of the Setouchi region\u2019s highlights for travellers.\n\nThe farther west I go into the valley, the more uninhabited it becomes. There is not a convenience store in sight. Trees, their leaves just starting to turn from green to yellow, hang over the river that flows through the valley. I cross traditional vine bridges which wobble unnervingly, on the way to the village of Ochiai, a village deep in the valley that tumbles down the terraced hillside. The lane that winds up the hill is lined with traditional thatched-roof houses, several of which have been stylishly refurbished for guests. Friendly locals, happy to see a visitor, gather on the road to greet me as I arrive. In the evening, they deliver a huge bento box to my door including fresh local tofu, pickles, miso soup and locally grown mikan, a mandarin-like citrus fruit.\n\nMy plan is to meander across a handful of islands in the middle of the sea. They are linked to Honshu and Shikoku, and one another, by the Shimanami Kaido, a 76km-long route that passes through six pretty islands joined by seven suspension bridges, which are remarkable in their own right. The journey is best enjoyed on bicycle: the bridges have bike lanes and the route is well signposted and predominantly flat, apart from some kindly designed climbs up to each bridge.\n\nOne morning at dawn I set off from Imabari, on Shikoku. It is drizzling and barely light, and the air is fresh. The floor is a carpet of leaves: it is so quiet and still that I can hear the soft patter of new ones falling amid the chorus of insect noise. I climb, panting, up the incline to the first bridge and am rewarded by a view of the islands rising out of the slick grey water. I cross the bridge, passing over a scattering of green and hilly islands, and descend into Oshima, happy to be peddling on flat land again.\n\nThe standard cycle route wanders along the edge of sandy beaches, through beautiful fishing villages and less attractive industrial ports, the islands\u2019 lifelines. It winds past groves of huge lemons and small plots planted with lettuces, and by clusters of houses, barely big enough to call hamlets, with their traditional roofs of cascading grey tiles. By mid-morning people are out and about. They wave as I pass by. When I stop to rest they chat about the weather and wish me luck with my ride.\n\nItsukushima shrine stands off the island of Miyajima near Hiroshima\n\nOn Omishima, I take a detour and head up to Oyamazumi, a spacious wooden shrine. Within the shrine\u2019s grounds camphor trees, said to be up to 3,000 years old, give the air a fresh, minty odour. The shrine is dedicated to gods who protect sailors and soldiers; in ancient times samurai visited to pray for success in battle. A neighbouring museum houses Japan\u2019s largest collection of samurai armoury. Today my only companions are a group of elderly Japanese and another cyclist, as sodden as I am.\n\nThe island of Ikuchijima is proud of its famous former residents, who include Kobo Daishi, a father of Japanese Buddhism, and some Japanese Christians who took refuge there to avoid persecution during the Edo era, the period between 1603 and 1868, when the country was ruled by the Tokugawa shogun\u00adate, Japan\u2019s last feudal government. Tourists, mostly Japanese, often spend time on the sands of Sunset Beach, which stretch for miles; today it is too cold to consider a dip.\n\nOn Mukaishima, I queue at the ferry terminal to catch a boat to Onomichi. This sophisticated waterfront city on the main island is a welcome place for a weary traveller. I enjoy a cup of coffee in one of the caf\u00e9s opened by urbanites who have moved here, before soaking my aching limbs and sinking into a soft bed. The luxury is welcome. But I already miss the simplicity, quiet and beauty of life on the islands.\n\nIsland guide\n\nThe Inland Sea\u2019s mild climate makes it a good destination year-round. Most days are fine, even in June, July and September when rainfall peaks. Stay in family-run lodges on the islands, modern business hotels in the cities and a thatched cottage in the Iya Valley. A majority of the Inland Sea\u2019s islands can be reached from ports in Honshu and Shikoku. Cyclists can start the Shimanami Kaido at either Onomichi or Imabari and end at the other; bikes and helmets are available for hire. The public bike-rental system has stations on every island so you can dump your bike at any point and get a ferry the rest of the way. Tourist information offices have good maps and leaflets."

    "title": "These old, anatomical drawings are worth dissecting",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "During his long journey through Europe and the Levant in 1867, Mark Twain stopped off in Milan. Like many, he was struck by the grandeur of the city\u2019s great cathedral, but it was something else that truly became etched in his memory. Standing inside the cathedral was a statue of St Bartholomew, the apostle who had been skinned alive, and who was depicted with his skin draped around his shoulders as if it were a towel. In \u201cThe Innocents Abroad\u201d, Twain\u2019s account of that year of travel, he recounts: \u201cThe figure was that of a man without a skin; with every vein, artery, muscle, every fibre and tendon and tissue of the human frame represented in minute detail... It was a hideous thing, and yet there was a fascination about it somehow.\u201d\n\nSkinhead The flayed body in \u201cA Description of the Body of Man\u201d (1616)\n\nAnimated by this same fascination, physicians and artists have, over the centuries, opened up the human body and recorded what they discovered inside, as visitors to a new exhibition at the Royal College of Physicians in London will find. \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d brings together a small yet impressive selection of anatomical illustrations, produced primarily by Western physicians and artists (though there are some striking exceptions) from the late Middle Ages through to the 20th century. These scrolls, prints and woodcuts show how these scientists grappled with the challenges of representing human anatomy, and in so doing made illustrations that are as gruesome as they are compelling.\n\nVarious obstacles stood in the way of those who wished to produce accurate representations of our insides. Dissections are the best way to learn about human anatomy: nothing can replace the experience of excavating layers of tissue yourself. But for centuries, the Christian and Islamic worlds imposed legal and religious restrictions on the practice. In 18th and 19th-century Britain, for instance, the only bodies legally available for dissection were those of executed criminals; with demand far outstripping supply, \u201cbody snatchers\u201d began digging up cadavers and selling them to medical schools. Once the corpse was on the dissection table, the anatomist had to acclimate to the smells of rotting flesh \u2013 Leonardo da Vinci warned the anatomy student that you \u201cwill perhaps be impeded by your stomach\u201d. He then (for it was invariably a \u201che\u201d) had to figure out how to represent a three-dimensional object \u2013 one that moves and changes with time \u2013 on a two-dimensional medium: how to capture not only the winding contours of the intestines, but a beating heart or heaving lungs, on a flat piece of canvas.\n\nOn point A guide to acupuncture by Hozumi Koremasa (1820s)\n\nSo anatomists collaborated with artists capable of committing their visions to paper. Even though the artist\u2019s knowledge of physiology often matched that of the anatomist, the former was usually obliged to follow the latter\u2019s instructions. Unsurprisingly, they sometimes clashed. Surgeons complained that artists over-embellished what were supposed to be clear depictions illustrating the function of a particular body part. Samuel Thomas von Sommering, a German physician, protested in 1791 that overly detailed sketches could do \u201charm to the important points\u201d. Arnaud-\u00c9loi Gautier d\u2019Agoty, a late 18th-century French painter whose father had pioneered new colour-printing techniques in his anatomical illustrations, disagreed. \u201cFor men to be instructed,\u201d he insisted, \u201cthey must be seduced by aesthetics.\u201d\n\nTwain was haunted by the statue of St Bartholomew. \u201cI am very sorry I saw it,\u201d he concluded, fearing he was doomed to forever dream of its \u201ccorded arms\u201d, \u201cstringy cold legs\u201d and \u201cdead eyes\u201d. The dead bodies depicted in \u201cUnder the Skin\u201d are sure to embed themselves in the minds of visitors, but not because they inspire revulsion so much as marvel \u2013 not only at the boundless complexities of the human body but also at the ingenuity of the human mind."

    "title": "How to build a multi-billion-dollar film franchise",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "In recent years Hollywood studios have been trying to do far more than merely make movies. Their great ambition is to create a cinematic universe that is shared by characters from an ever-increasing number of interlinked films, which encourages audiences to revisit the last movie and look forward to the next.\n\nThe first studio to realise this dream was Marvel, which specialises in superhero movies and is owned by Disney. Since the release of \u201cIron Man\u201d in 2008, all of Marvel\u2019s blockbusters have been set in the same world, where Captain America guest stars in Spider-Man\u2019s adventures, Thor has a beer with Doctor Strange, and the whole crowd gets together for \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d. It\u2019s a universe which has so far grossed $17.5bn.\n\nWhen other studios have tried to imitate Marvel, the results have been less of a Big Bang than a whimper. The fictional reality in \u201cJustice League\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d, populated by super\u00adheroes from comics company DC , is glum and unwelcoming, and the series revolving around Robin Hood, King Arthur and Universal\u2019s roster of classic movie monsters have collapsed. But one franchise has, in some ways, done even better than Marvel\u2019s: the one built out of Lego.\n\n\u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d, a cartoon directed by Chris Miller and Phil Lord, came out in 2014. Set in a world made entirely of Lego, and starring a blithely stupid construction worker who is told he is the only person who can save the world from the tyrannical Lord Business, \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d was an anti-consumerist satire and an ingenious parody of portentous Hollywood blockbusters, with their ancient prophecies and exalted \u201cchosen ones\u201d. It was also a hit, grossing $469m at the global box office and scoring 96% on \u201cRotten Tomatoes\u201d, a reviews aggregate site.\n\nSince then there have been two spin-offs, \u201cThe Lego Batman Movie\u201d and \u201cThe Lego Ninjago Movie\u201d, both released in 2017, and a direct sequel, \u201cThe Lego Movie 2\u201d, which is out in February. That\u2019s not a bad cinematic universe, by anyone\u2019s standards. But what is unusual about \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d is that it doesn\u2019t just include its own copyrighted characters. It also features Lego versions of Batman and Superman, Dumbledore from \u201cHarry Potter\u201d, Gandalf from \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d, Milhouse from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d, and Michelangelo from \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d, not to mention various \u201cStar Wars\u201d regulars who swoop by in a Lego Millennium Falcon. In other words, the Lego universe has several other universes inside it. It\u2019s a cinematic multiverse.\n\nThere has never been anything quite like it before. Depending on your age, you may remember how astounding it was to watch Donald Duck and Daffy Duck playing adjacent pianos in \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit\u201d or to glimpse E.T., The Extra Terrestrial in the Galactic Senate chamber in \u201cStar Wars: Episode One \u2013 The Phantom Menace\u201d. But nobody had ever seen characters from so many different movies in one place, like the participants in a Comic-Con fancy-dress parade. The Lego movies are a nerd\u2019s dream come true.\n\nThey are also a dream come true for Hollywood, advertising countless other films and franchises from companies who are in competition with each other \u2013 but who all want to play with Lego."

    "title": "My shamanic facial in the city of angels",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "About halfway through my shamanic facial treatment at a pilates studio in Santa Monica, the Archangel Michael enters the room. He\u2019s brought his sword with him to sever vows I\u2019ve made in other lifetimes, explains my shaman, Julie. Michael is one of the Teachers: spirit guides from other realms who come to Earth to bring about great change. I\u2019m worried, though: it turns out Hitler was a Teacher too. \u201cHe came down with a very specific agenda,\u201d says Julie, adding quickly, \u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d I\u2019m relieved. Angels in Los Angeles is one thing, but no one wants a dead dictator showing up while they\u2019re lying on a treatment table having their face smothered in aloe vera.\n\nJulie Civiello Polier is one of a new wave of spiritual healers bringing good vibrations to the beautiful people of Los Angeles. Far from indigenous tribesmen, these urban shamans are blissed-out hipsters ministering to their clients with essential oils, crystals and sound baths \u2013 all for a handsome fee. Many work in the beauty industry, bringing a mystical element to otherwise superficial salon appointments. Shamanic beauty treatments promise a makeover both physical and spiritual \u2013 and as an Englishman newly arrived in LA , that\u2019s exactly what I needed.\n\nJulie begins to massage my face with Q -tips protruding from stainless-steel probes. These are fed by an electric current, which causes tiny flashes of light to shoot across my closed eyelids. Any slight alarm I feel is tempered by the soothing voice of Julie, a former actress, and the pan-pipe music playing in the background. Julie is adjusting the microcurrent to bring my fluids, tissues and cells into a more optimal relationship. In her view, it\u2019s not just what we eat, but also what we read and watch, that registers in our features. Mine, apparently, show signs of grief and disgust, which I ascribe to Southampton\u2019s league position and deadlock in the House of Commons: a severe case of Brexit-face which I\u2019d give anything to have zapped away.\n\nLie back and think of angels Julie gives a client a facial (Photo: Kristine Lo)\n\nAs she administers the facial, Julie is trying to receive messages from the Akashic realm. This is a kind of cosmic cloud-storage system that records every moment in every lifetime \u2013 a source of higher knowledge that could help guide me towards my true path. But she\u2019s having a hard time today. Not much is coming forward. Julie often struggles with English clients because of their tendency to \u201cpresent in a way that\u2019s kind and polite and lacking in emotion\u201d. I leave the studio feeling deeply relaxed, my skin emerging soft and radiant from under its coat of balms and unguents. But I can\u2019t help feeling a little short on inner wisdom. I may simply be too English to get the full benefit of Julie\u2019s treatment.\n\nIn a different part of Santa Monica, Andi Scarbrough offers shamanic hair rituals at her salon on Mondays. Fifteen minutes before my appointment, she experienced such a feeling of heaviness in her lower body that she had to sit down for a moment. Andi mentions this some way into our session: a two-hour \u201cdeep-dive\u201d that combines a haircut with shamanic healing. To alleviate the heaviness, she has mixed a special blend of essential oils and arranged crystals around her salon to expel any negative energy I may have brought in.\n\nWe begin with some crystal tracking. Andi produces an assortment of semi-precious stones and instructs me to move my left hand over them \u2014 left being the feminine, receptive side of the body \u2014 and pay attention to any tingling or changes in temperature I feel. I must be out of touch with my feminine side, as I feel nothing. That said, I\u2019m strangely drawn towards a pale-blue stone, a translucent violet one and a deep-blue one flecked with gold. Each has come forward with a message for me, explains Andi. They are angelite, amethyst and lapis lazuli, which are linked to wisdom, peace and enlightenment. All of which are messages I\u2019m happy to receive.\n\nCrystal palace Andi Scarbrough in her salon\n\nAndi drips essential oils into my hair and works them through with combs made of crystal. This is to get rid of any residual scepticism lurking near my crown chakra, one of the body\u2019s seven energy centres. Then she tackles my upper chakras with reiki, an ancient Japanese practice, channelling the universe\u2019s source energy towards me with the palms of her hands.\n\nIt turns out that my ear chakras are blocked. I\u2019ve put on \u201cenergetic earmuffs\u201d, says Andi, which are preventing me from fully receiving the universe\u2019s wisdom. I am relieved to have got to the heart of the problem. To unblock my ear chakras, Andi twangs two tuning forks and wields them near my head, where they vibrate at the frequency of the Earth and the Moon. I am already beginning to feel lighter, less encumbered. When she finally cuts my hair, Andi does a wonderful job, full of verve and nuance, but the task feels rather mundane compared to the spiritual breakthrough she has just achieved.\n\nI leave the salon with a takeaway crystal and an envelope of hair cuttings, which I burn as instructed on Venice Beach while repeating \u201cI am open to wonder\u201d \u2013 an affirmation to the universe. Centuries of inherited repression seem to evaporate in the setting sun.\n\nAs my plane touches down at Heathrow, I find the crystal in my pocket. Somehow, back in the cold and grey of an English February, its lustre has faded. Perhaps the bad vibes here are too strong? Or perhaps, like ouzo from Greece or minimal techno from Berlin, shamanic healing is one of those things that simply doesn\u2019t travel.\n\nArthur House received treatments from Andi Scarbrough at Crownworks and Julie Civiello Polier.

    "title": "It\u2019s crunch-time for the baguette",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "In the baking room at Poil\u00e2ne in Paris\u2019s smart sixth arrondissement sit rows of round sourdough loaves, fresh out of the oven. Apollonia Poil\u00e2ne is the third generation in her family to run the company: she uses the same starter as her grandfather did when he set up shop nearly a century ago, and the same wood-fired, brick oven. I move close to hear the crackling sounds that the brown loaves make as they cool. Their scent is intoxicating, warm, slightly nutty.\n\nThe young baker who made them is training to work in the Poil\u00e2ne \u201cmanufactory\u201d outside Paris, where this Parisian set-up is replicated a dozen times. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the sound, I\u2019m less happy with the shaping of the loaves,\u201d Poil\u00e2ne says. Becoming a master breadmaker takes a lot of effort, but it is worth it: the company ships its miches, or round loaves, all over the world.\n\nBread is one of the icons of France. The baguette, the country\u2019s most famous loaf \u2013 though not its first \u2013 has an amber-coloured crust dusted with white flour; its interior is off-white, springy and moist at the centre. The elongated loaf crackles as you tear it apart, releasing the malty scent of warm bread, familiar and tempting. Its tubular shape ensures that there\u2019s a nutty crunch and doughy sweetness to every bite. Its length juts out of your shopping bag, the nub inevitably torn off, because you simply couldn\u2019t resist tasting it.\n\nBaguettes \u2013 and bread in general \u2013 are inseparable from France itself. Between 8bn and 10bn baguettes are sold there annually. Across the country there\u2019s a boulangerie \u2013 a bakery that makes and sells its own bread on the premises \u2013 for roughly every 2,000 inhabitants. In central Paris, there\u2019s often one every few blocks. When a small town loses its boulangerie, it\u2019s a municipal crisis.\n\nYou can\u2019t escape bread. School lunches include a tranche of baguette. A child\u2019s first independent act is usually to go out alone to buy bread. Toasters come with a metal \u201cbaguette\u201d extension. Popular expressions reflect its centrality: \u201cIt isn\u2019t a meal unless there\u2019s bread on the table,\u201d people say; something that feels interminable is \u201cas long as a day without bread\u201d.\n\nThere is etiquette bound up in it. On the table bread goes next to the plate, not on it. Unlike practically every other French food \u2013 including wine and cheese \u2013 diners rarely comment on the bread they eat. It\u2019s just there. Whereas restaurants in some other European countries charge extra for it, in France it\u2019s free, a basic furnishing of the meal, like salt or cutlery.\n\nAnd bread isn\u2019t just food in France, it\u2019s connective tissue. A friend is a copain \u2013 literally someone with whom you share bread. Abdu Gnaba, an anthropologist, said that when he interviewed French people about bread for an industry-sponsored study, they often began by telling stories: \u201cIt reminds me of my grandmother, of summer camp, the toast spread with butter...\u201d\n\nAnd yet the role of bread has been waning, both symbolically and nutritionally. The French are eating far less of it than they used to. In the last decade alone, daily bread consumption has dropped by nearly a quarter. Increasingly, French meals don\u2019t include bread at all. So many boulangeries have closed, some towns are now installing bread-vending machines."

    "title": "Where other novelists fail, Marlon James succeeds",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Tracker has a great nose. He used to have a name, but he forgot it long ago. Don\u2019t think you\u2019ve stepped into a Jack Reacher novel. The long-awaited new work by Marlon James (above) \u2013 his first since winning the Man Booker prize in 2015 with \u201cA Brief History of Seven Killings\u201d \u2013 is on an epic, imaginative scale.\n\nBlack Leopard, Red Wolf is the first volume of a grand fantasy trilogy set in west Africa. Its hero, Tracker, is trying to find a child who vanished before the novel opens. Who the child is and why he\u2019s missing, no one will say. Tracker prefers to work alone but now he joins forces with a crew of mercenaries that includes a man who can change at will into a leopard and a woman possessed by a lightning bird that makes her appear blue.\n\nDrawing on legend, history and mythology, \u201cBlack Leopard, Red Wolf\u201d takes Afrofuturism to a new level. James\u2019s inventiveness is wild and crisp. But the biggest surprise is how brilliantly he writes about the two things that fell most other novelists: violence and sex. ~ FIAMMETTA ROCCO\n\nWheels of fortune\n\nThe heroine of Valeria Luiselli\u2019s new novel, Lost Children Archive, met her husband while she was recording a soundscape of New York City. The book opens four years after that encounter, when the couple is on a road trip from New York to Arizona with two children \u2013 her daughter, his son \u2013 along with their backpacks, a blue cooler with water bottles and snacks, and equipment to record a new story.\n\nAs they drive, Luiselli unspools how they became a family and began calling themselves \u201cwe\u201d. At the same time, she traces another journey: a Mexican friend in New York is waiting to hear whether her two small children will be given asylum in America. Their grandmother had packed them off, with a Bible, a toy each and their mother\u2019s telephone number sewn into the collars of their dresses, in the company of a smuggler who left them in the desert. They were discovered by American border patrollers and placed in a detention centre for unaccompanied minors. As the two journeys intersect, the novel becomes suffused with a deep sense of fear and anxiety. Donald Trump\u2019s trumpeting about the border \u201ccrisis\u201d may make this the year\u2019s most timely novel. ~ FR\n\nHeart of darkness\n\nLeila Slimani\u2019s \u201cLullaby\u201d was the best selling book in France in 2016 before becoming an international success. Ad\u00e8le came out in France before \u201cLullaby\u201d, but this is its first outing in English, in a sharp and nuanced translation from Sam Taylor. It is a short, disturbing novel, written in the present tense and set in a bleak and amoral Paris.\n\nLike Emma Bovary, Ad\u00e8le is married to a doctor. She also echoes the nihilism of Flaubert\u2019s heroine. Ad\u00e8le is a successful journalist, but thoroughly bored by her rather proper, borderline-prudish husband Richard. She feels excluded \u2013 almost redundant \u2013 because of her husband\u2019s fierce love for their child. She is also obsessed by transgressive sex \u2013 with her boss, her best friend\u2019s boyfriend, and a pair of male prostitutes. She often asks her partners to brutalise her: she is addicted to breaking the rules.\n\nSlimani\u2019s spare, compulsive prose is once again very much on display here. But the author\u2019s real skill lies in making Ad\u00e8le\u2019s behaviour taboo and her ennui understandable. ~ ALEX PEAKE-TOMKINSON\n\nWhat a Charlie\n\nCharlie, a 60-something Irishman, has some grievances. His memory isn\u2019t what it once was, which isn\u2019t too surprising given that he and the wife have \u201cdecided not to bother with the fish and the crosswords\u201d. He\u2019s had to abandon his buttoned jeans \u2013 too fiddly \u2013 and move on to the zipped kind, which are forever flying low. Brexit is a bore, his daughter is trying to make him into an Internet star and he can\u2019t stop thinking about Eileen, a girl he once inexpertly snogged aged 16. His outlook, his nearest and dearest say, is often not only \u201cbleak\u201d but \u201cwindswept and desolate\u201d.\n\nYet Charlie Savage, Roddy Doyle\u2019s collected newspaper columns, is not just another iteration of the \u201cGrumpy Old Men\u201d clich\u00e9. This portrait of an ordinary man (and one clearly past his best) is by turns hilarious and heartfelt. The protagonist is passionate about Manchester United \u2013 \u201cthe football will cling to the insides of our heads long after everything else has slid out\u201d \u2013and his pints of Guinness with his friend. It is in expressing his love for his family that Doyle\u2019s prose is most moving. \u201cI know I have a heart,\u201d Charlie says, \u201cbecause I can feel it pumping, keeping me alive for them.\u201d ~ RACHEL LLOYD"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Nadia Vulvokov can\u2019t stop dying. In \u201cRussian Doll\u201d, a new series on Netflix with an almost perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes, she dies precisely 22 times. And each time her life ends, she keeps finding herself in front of the same bathroom sink, with the same song (Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u201cGotta Get Up\u201d) playing in the background.\n\n\u201cI would describe the show if I was in a rush as \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 meets \u2018No Exit\u2019,\u201d said Natasha Lyonne, who plays Nadia and co-created the show. Like \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d, the hit Nineties film, and \u201cNo Exit\u201d, Jean Paul Sartre\u2019s existentialist play about three dead characters stuck in a room together for all eternity, \u201cRussian Doll\u201d makes you think about deep things like consciousness and what it is to be a human. It\u2019s also hugely entertaining.\n\nWhat\u2019s the set-up?\n\nWe are introduced to Nadia, a computer-games programmer, in the bathroom of a glamorous loft apartment in New York City, where she is celebrating her 36th birthday party with her hipster friends. \u201cSweet birthday baby!\u201d calls out Maxine, the host with cobalt-lined eyes, as Nadia saunters into the main room. Maxine, who is in the process of massaging a raw chicken, offers Nadia a joint laced with cocaine. Nadia soon gets talking to an obnoxious academic called Mike, who she takes back to her apartment. It looks like they\u2019re about to spend the night together, before Nadia thinks better of it and calls Mike an Uber. She\u2019s worried about her cat, Oatmeal, who\u2019s gone missing, and decides to go out looking for him. As she\u2019s walking the streets, she is involved in a shocking accident.\n\nJust as we\u2019re coming to terms with what happened, we find Nadia back in the same bathroom, the same song playing when she leaves the room, the same birthday party in full swing. She\u2019s understandably confused, but powers through the party for the second time, her conversations and experiences slightly different, until she leaves to look for her cat. At one point it looks like it\u2019s going to have a happy ending, but then the same thing happens again\u2026\n\nA party to die for Nadia and host Maxine\n\nAnd then it happens again and again, I get it. That seems like a thin premise for a whole series. Is there some kind of storyline? And can you tell me without giving away any spoilers?\n\nAfter the groundwork is laid in that first episode, Nadia \u2013 smart, tenacious and queen of the killer one-liner (\u201cit\u2019s my bad attitude that keeps me young\u201d) \u2013 tries to unlock the mystery. Maxine\u2019s apartment is an old Yeshiva school so Nadia\u2019s first stop is a local synagogue (could what\u2019s happening to her be spiritual retribution for the sin of gentrification?). But the rabbi is no help. Her next hunch is that there\u2019s something karmic going on \u2013 is this payback for being such a horrible person?\n\nShe\u2019s still fixated on finding Oatmeal, and is convinced that a local homeless man has a crucial piece of information. We learn about her ex-boyfriend John, an older real-estate agent with a daughter who divorced his ex-wife to be with Nadia, only to get dumped unceremoniously. (She is a commitment-phobe of the highest order.) There are flashbacks to her childhood, and we meet Ruth, a family friend and psychotherapist, who looked after her while her mother struggled with mental health problems. A breakthrough of sorts happens when she meets Alan (Charlie Barnett) who, like Nadia, is stuck in a loop, but has an entirely different and endearingly neurotic way of dealing with it. They make an odd couple \u2013 he\u2019s an uptight jock, she\u2019s a wild rebel \u2013 but together they embark on their metaphysical quest.\n\nTell me more about who made it.\n\nAs mentioned, Natasha Lyonne, who before this was best known for her role in \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d, is also one of the creators, alongside Amy Poehler (star of \u201cParks and Recreation and producer of \u201cBroad City\u201d) and Leslye Headland (who directed \u201cBachelorette\u201d and \u201cSleeping with Other People\u201d). The writing is impeccable and many pundits have been quick to pin this on the show\u2019s all-female writers\u2019 room.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why such a fantastical show manages to be so emotionally acute. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lyonne said she viewed the plot as \u201csomething closer to an autobiographical journey on my many dances with death.\u201d Lyonne spent much of her 20s grappling with a heroin addiction and the supernatural trippiness of \u201cRussian Doll\u201d was based on her own experience of \u201cnearly dying very often as a result of addiction.\u201d\n\nTill death us do part? Alan and Nadia\n\nWhat are people saying about it?\n\nRob Delaney, the comedian and star of \u201cCatastrophe\u201d, exclaimed on Twitter that the show was \u201cMORE than worth the hype\u201d and gave it \u201c11/10\u201d. Nick Kroll, the comedian behind \u201cBig Mouth\u201d, said that the show has \u201ctotally blown up the form perfectly\u201d.\n\nEmily Nussbaum, the New Yorker\u2019s TV critic, called it \u201cpropulsive and joyful\u201d and admired how \u201cthe cliffhangers work as true emotional pauses, playing off the way that television itself is built on repeated formulas.\u201d The Financial Times gave it five stars while Vanity Fair labelled it \u201cthe perfect binge watch\u201d and praised it for being \u201cextraordinarily empathetic about the journey through traumatic memories, and the evisceration required to traverse them\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m scared of dying. Why would I want to watch this in my spare time?\n\nDon\u2019t worry, it isn\u2019t so morbid that it\u2019s unbearable. Firstly, her deaths are never that gory (there are a few grisly ones at the end, but if you can cope with blood you\u2019ll be fine). It\u2019s mostly quite slapstick: an air conditioning unit falls from the sky, she chokes on a chicken bone, falls down the staircases multiple times, and freezes to death one night after she sleeps on the streets with the homeless man. The camera never dwells too much on the moment where it all ends, and before you know it, she\u2019s back in that bathroom.\n\nIf you\u2019re a death-phobe like me, there\u2019s actually something quite soothing about the show. It\u2019s strangely comforting to see Nadia persevering with life even though she knows something dreadful is about to happen to her. \u201cRussian Doll\u201d does delve into heavy things like grief, mental health, trauma, mortality and even quantum physics, but it\u2019s clever, fast-paced and laced with the kind of dark humour fans of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s \u201cFleabag\u201d and \u201cKilling Eve\u201d will lap up. Above all it reminds you that life is short, random and that you\u2019ve got to make the most of it. Less angst. More action. Be more Nadia.\n\nRussian Doll is on Netflix"

    "title": "My shamanic facial in the city of angels",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "About halfway through my shamanic facial treatment at a pilates studio in Santa Monica, the Archangel Michael enters the room. He\u2019s brought his sword with him to sever vows I\u2019ve made in other lifetimes, explains my shaman, Julie. Michael is one of the Teachers: spirit guides from other realms who come to Earth to bring about great change. I\u2019m worried, though: it turns out Hitler was a Teacher too. \u201cHe came down with a very specific agenda,\u201d says Julie, adding quickly, \u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d I\u2019m relieved. Angels in Los Angeles is one thing, but no one wants a dead dictator showing up while they\u2019re lying on a treatment table having their face smothered in aloe vera.\n\nJulie Civiello Polier is one of a new wave of spiritual healers bringing good vibrations to the beautiful people of Los Angeles. Far from indigenous tribesmen, these urban shamans are blissed-out hipsters ministering to their clients with essential oils, crystals and sound baths \u2013 all for a handsome fee. Many work in the beauty industry, bringing a mystical element to otherwise superficial salon appointments. Shamanic beauty treatments promise a makeover both physical and spiritual \u2013 and as an Englishman newly arrived in LA , that\u2019s exactly what I needed.\n\nJulie begins to massage my face with Q -tips protruding from stainless-steel probes. These are fed by an electric current, which causes tiny flashes of light to shoot across my closed eyelids. Any slight alarm I feel is tempered by the soothing voice of Julie, a former actress, and the pan-pipe music playing in the background. Julie is adjusting the microcurrent to bring my fluids, tissues and cells into a more optimal relationship. In her view, it\u2019s not just what we eat, but also what we read and watch, that registers in our features. Mine, apparently, show signs of grief and disgust, which I ascribe to Southampton\u2019s league position and deadlock in the House of Commons: a severe case of Brexit-face which I\u2019d give anything to have zapped away.\n\nLie back and think of angels Julie gives a client a facial (Photo: Kristine Lo)\n\nAs she administers the facial, Julie is trying to receive messages from the Akashic realm. This is a kind of cosmic cloud-storage system that records every moment in every lifetime \u2013 a source of higher knowledge that could help guide me towards my true path. But she\u2019s having a hard time today. Not much is coming forward. Julie often struggles with English clients because of their tendency to \u201cpresent in a way that\u2019s kind and polite and lacking in emotion\u201d. I leave the studio feeling deeply relaxed, my skin emerging soft and radiant from under its coat of balms and unguents. But I can\u2019t help feeling a little short on inner wisdom. I may simply be too English to get the full benefit of Julie\u2019s treatment.\n\nIn a different part of Santa Monica, Andi Scarbrough offers shamanic hair rituals at her salon on Mondays. Fifteen minutes before my appointment, she experienced such a feeling of heaviness in her lower body that she had to sit down for a moment. Andi mentions this some way into our session: a two-hour \u201cdeep-dive\u201d that combines a haircut with shamanic healing. To alleviate the heaviness, she has mixed a special blend of essential oils and arranged crystals around her salon to expel any negative energy I may have brought in.\n\nWe begin with some crystal tracking. Andi produces an assortment of semi-precious stones and instructs me to move my left hand over them \u2014 left being the feminine, receptive side of the body \u2014 and pay attention to any tingling or changes in temperature I feel. I must be out of touch with my feminine side, as I feel nothing. That said, I\u2019m strangely drawn towards a pale-blue stone, a translucent violet one and a deep-blue one flecked with gold. Each has come forward with a message for me, explains Andi. They are angelite, amethyst and lapis lazuli, which are linked to wisdom, peace and enlightenment. All of which are messages I\u2019m happy to receive.\n\nCrystal palace Andi Scarbrough in her salon\n\nAndi drips essential oils into my hair and works them through with combs made of crystal. This is to get rid of any residual scepticism lurking near my crown chakra, one of the body\u2019s seven energy centres. Then she tackles my upper chakras with reiki, an ancient Japanese practice, channelling the universe\u2019s source energy towards me with the palms of her hands.\n\nIt turns out that my ear chakras are blocked. I\u2019ve put on \u201cenergetic earmuffs\u201d, says Andi, which are preventing me from fully receiving the universe\u2019s wisdom. I am relieved to have got to the heart of the problem. To unblock my ear chakras, Andi twangs two tuning forks and wields them near my head, where they vibrate at the frequency of the Earth and the Moon. I am already beginning to feel lighter, less encumbered. When she finally cuts my hair, Andi does a wonderful job, full of verve and nuance, but the task feels rather mundane compared to the spiritual breakthrough she has just achieved.\n\nI leave the salon with a takeaway crystal and an envelope of hair cuttings, which I burn as instructed on Venice Beach while repeating \u201cI am open to wonder\u201d \u2013 an affirmation to the universe. Centuries of inherited repression seem to evaporate in the setting sun.\n\nAs my plane touches down at Heathrow, I find the crystal in my pocket. Somehow, back in the cold and grey of an English February, its lustre has faded. Perhaps the bad vibes here are too strong? Or perhaps, like ouzo from Greece or minimal techno from Berlin, shamanic healing is one of those things that simply doesn\u2019t travel.\n\nArthur House received treatments from Andi Scarbrough at Crownworks and Julie Civiello Polier. During the course of his research he also had a session with Ursula Vari"

    "title": "How to build a multi-billion-dollar film franchise",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "In recent years Hollywood studios have been trying to do far more than merely make movies. Their great ambition is to create a cinematic universe that is shared by characters from an ever-increasing number of interlinked films, which encourages audiences to revisit the last movie and look forward to the next.\n\nThe first studio to realise this dream was Marvel, which specialises in superhero movies and is owned by Disney. Since the release of \u201cIron Man\u201d in 2008, all of Marvel\u2019s blockbusters have been set in the same world, where Captain America guest stars in Spider-Man\u2019s adventures, Thor has a beer with Doctor Strange, and the whole crowd gets together for \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d. It\u2019s a universe which has so far grossed $17.5bn.\n\nWhen other studios have tried to imitate Marvel, the results have been less of a Big Bang than a whimper. The fictional reality in \u201cJustice League\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d, populated by super\u00adheroes from comics company DC , is glum and unwelcoming, and the series revolving around Robin Hood, King Arthur and Universal\u2019s roster of classic movie monsters have collapsed. But one franchise has, in some ways, done even better than Marvel\u2019s: the one built out of Lego.\n\n\u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d, a cartoon directed by Chris Miller and Phil Lord, came out in 2014. Set in a world made entirely of Lego, and starring a blithely stupid construction worker who is told he is the only person who can save the world from the tyrannical Lord Business, \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d was an anti-consumerist satire and an ingenious parody of portentous Hollywood blockbusters, with their ancient prophecies and exalted \u201cchosen ones\u201d. It was also a hit, grossing $469m at the global box office and scoring 96% on \u201cRotten Tomatoes\u201d, a reviews aggregate site.\n\nSince then there have been two spin-offs, \u201cThe Lego Batman Movie\u201d and \u201cThe Lego Ninjago Movie\u201d, both released in 2017, and a direct sequel, \u201cThe Lego Movie 2\u201d, which is out in February. That\u2019s not a bad cinematic universe, by anyone\u2019s standards. But what is unusual about \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d is that it doesn\u2019t just include its own copyrighted characters. It also features Lego versions of Batman and Superman, Dumbledore from \u201cHarry Potter\u201d, Gandalf from \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d, Milhouse from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d, and Michelangelo from \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d, not to mention various \u201cStar Wars\u201d regulars who swoop by in a Lego Millennium Falcon. In other words, the Lego universe has several other universes inside it. It\u2019s a cinematic multiverse.\n\nThere has never been anything quite like it before. Depending on your age, you may remember how astounding it was to watch Donald Duck and Daffy Duck playing adjacent pianos in \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit\u201d or to glimpse E.T., The Extra Terrestrial in the Galactic Senate chamber in \u201cStar Wars: Episode One \u2013 The Phantom Menace\u201d. But nobody had ever seen characters from so many different movies in one place, like the participants in a Comic-Con fancy-dress parade. The Lego movies are a nerd\u2019s dream come true.\n\nThey are also a dream come true for Hollywood, advertising countless other films and franchises from companies who are in competition with each other \u2013 but who all want to play with Lego."

    "text": "These are amusing flourishes, but as I take in the collection, I get the sense that the museum will appeal more to those who know their Schnauzers from their Shih Tzus than to those who have a regular Rex at home. The AKC is serious about dogs. The museum\u2019s focus on breed distinction stems from its desire to educate the public about their pets. \u201cA lot of people see dog shows once a year or twice a year,\u201d says Alan Fausel, the executive director, \u201cbut we\u2019re here all year round.\u201d Yet the stars of those shows will not be welcome at the museum now that it has officially opened its doors to the public. Surely the best way for people to learn about dogs is to be around them? \u201cThey aren\u2019t allowed in the Met or the Guggenheim,\u201d Fausel says with a shrug.\n\nAs the crowd begins to thin, a man tries to get his two Irish setters to sit for a photograph. The dogs, Gibbs and Abby (below), bounce around the gallery, their long, glossy coats swishing as they play, before finally acquiescing. Several minutes into the photoshoot, an unmistakable and pungent aroma fills the air. The owner looks down \u2013 his surprise tinged with amusement \u2013 at the coil of brown deposited on the hem of his suit trousers. Now there\u2019s a solid reason to bar dogs from the museum, I think, as I head for the exit and some fresh air."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "In recent years Hollywood studios have been trying to do far more than merely make movies. Their great ambition is to create a cinematic universe that is shared by characters from an ever-increasing number of interlinked films, which encourages audiences to revisit the last movie and look forward to the next.\n\nThe first studio to realise this dream was Marvel, which specialises in superhero movies and is owned by Disney. Since the release of \u201cIron Man\u201d in 2008, all of Marvel\u2019s blockbusters have been set in the same world, where Captain America guest stars in Spider-Man\u2019s adventures, Thor has a beer with Doctor Strange, and the whole crowd gets together for \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d. It\u2019s a universe which has so far grossed $17.5bn.\n\nWhen other studios have tried to imitate Marvel, the results have been less of a Big Bang than a whimper. The fictional reality in \u201cJustice League\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d, populated by super\u00adheroes from comics company DC , is glum and unwelcoming, and the series revolving around Robin Hood, King Arthur and Universal\u2019s roster of classic movie monsters have collapsed. But one franchise has, in some ways, done even better than Marvel\u2019s: the one built out of Lego.\n\n\u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d, a cartoon directed by Chris Miller and Phil Lord, came out in 2014. Set in a world made entirely of Lego, and starring a blithely stupid construction worker who is told he is the only person who can save the world from the tyrannical Lord Business, \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d was an anti-consumerist satire and an ingenious parody of portentous Hollywood blockbusters, with their ancient prophecies and exalted \u201cchosen ones\u201d. It was also a hit, grossing $469m at the global box office and scoring 96% on \u201cRotten Tomatoes\u201d, a reviews aggregate site.\n\nSince then there have been two spin-offs, \u201cThe Lego Batman Movie\u201d and \u201cThe Lego Ninjago Movie\u201d, both released in 2017, and a direct sequel, \u201cThe Lego Movie 2\u201d, which is out in February. That\u2019s not a bad cinematic universe, by anyone\u2019s standards. But what is unusual about \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d is that it doesn\u2019t just include its own copyrighted characters. It also features Lego versions of Batman and Superman, Dumbledore from \u201cHarry Potter\u201d, Gandalf from \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d, Milhouse from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d, and Michelangelo from \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d, not to mention various \u201cStar Wars\u201d regulars who swoop by in a Lego Millennium Falcon. In other words, the Lego universe has several other universes inside it. It\u2019s a cinematic multiverse.\n\nThere has never been anything quite like it before. Depending on your age, you may remember how astounding it was to watch Donald Duck and Daffy Duck playing adjacent pianos in \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit\u201d or to glimpse E.T., The Extra Terrestrial in the Galactic Senate chamber in \u201cStar Wars: Episode One \u2013 The Phantom Menace\u201d. But nobody had ever seen characters from so many different movies in one place, like the participants in a Comic-Con fancy-dress parade. The Lego movies are a nerd\u2019s dream come true.\n\nThey are also a dream come true for Hollywood, advertising countless other films and franchises from companies who are in competition with each other \u2013 but who all want to play with Lego."

    "text": "The result is a serene structure in concrete, timber and copper. The ground floor, with its open-plan living room, is glazed on two sides and sits under a geometrically complex roof that curves up to form a skylight that looks like a cross between a ship\u2019s funnel and a ski jump, and is positioned at an optimum angle to draw sunshine into the building throughout the day. Sheathed in copper, the roof will oxidise over time, turning garden-green. Lightwells on either side of the copper-crowned ground floor bring daylight down to a bedroom level and then to a ten-metre swimming pool further below. Throughout the house, copper surfaces and marble walls amplify the illumination.\n\nSuch was the intricacy of the process that Botsford has spent the best part of a decade imagining, testing, engineering and building it. The roof, which was designed in eight sections and manufactured in Italy, had to be craned into place over the surrounding buildings. \u201cThe fit had to be perfect,\u201d Botsford says. \u201cWe had to think through every inch of the house as a completed project from early on.\u201d Sequestered away from the street, \u201cHouse in a Garden\u201d is forensically conceived and impeccably crafted.

    "text": "I F YOUR ENEMY\u2019S forces are united, Sun Tzu advised, separate them. Since taking power in January House Democrats have proved surprisingly united: discontent with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s speakership fizzled and the party successfully stared down President Donald Trump over his demand for $5.7bn for his border wall. But Republicans believe they have found an issue to split their opponents: Israel. And two new congresswomen, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, are making their jobs easier.\n\nMs Tlaib and Ms Omar are the first two Muslim women to be elected to Congress. Both support boycotting, sanctioning and divesting from Israel. Both have been attacked and derided for their faith. But both have also trafficked, wittingly or not, in anti-Semitic tropes.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn January Ms Tlaib tweeted that backers of a bill that would allow states to forgo doing business with companies that boycott Israel have \u201cforgot which country they represent\u201d\u2014evoking the pernicious myth of Jewish dual loyalty. On February 10th Ms Omar tweeted that American politicians\u2019 defence of Israel\u2019s government was \u201call about the Benjamins\u201d from AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, implying that they are controlled by Jewish money (\u201cBenjamins\u201d being slang for $100 bills, on which the great Benjamin Franklin appears). Ms Omar apologised, though stood by her criticism of AIPAC , after the House Democratic leadership condemned her remarks. Ms Tlaib said her comments were not aimed at Jews.\n\nMs Omar\u2019s defenders on the left point out that AIPAC is indeed a fairly effective lobbying group. But there is a difference between arguing that AIPAC has a deleterious effect on American foreign policy, and claiming that American support of Israel is \u201call about\u201d money from Jewish lobbyists. Americans from both parties and many faiths reflexively support Israel\u2019s government for a variety of reasons.\n\nKevin McCarthy, the top-ranking House Republican, had already accused both women of anti-Semitism, Ms Omar for a 2012 tweet that evoked stereotypes of Jewish manipulation by saying that \u201cIsrael has hypnotised the world.\u201d Liz Cheney, chairwoman of the House Republican conference, urged Democrats to remove Ms Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as has the Republican Jewish Committee. Mr Trump called on her to resign.\n\nYet Ms Omar did not accuse Michael Bloomberg, Tom Steyer and George Soros (all Jews, or of Jewish extraction) of trying to buy the 2018 mid-term elections, as Mr McCarthy did. Nor did Ms Tlaib accuse a Jewish audience of wanting to \u201ccontrol [their] politicians\u201d, or release a campaign ad featuring three prominent Jews (Mr Soros, Lloyd Blankfein and Janet Yellen) who \u201ccontrol the levers of power in Washington\u2026[and] don\u2019t have your good in mind\u201d, as Mr Trump did in 2016. Neither Mr Trump nor Mr McCarthy offered as thoughtful an apology for their words as Ms Omar did.\n\nIt makes political sense for Republicans to foment dissent among Democrats: they are more divided over policy towards Israel than Republicans are. But if they were really concerned about anti-Semitism in American politics, they would look to the beam before the mote.\n\nCorrection (February 21st 2019): In the original version of this article we described Tom Steyer as Jewish. He is in fact an Episcopalian of Jewish descent."

    "title": "What would a no-deal Brexit mean for the economy and financial markets?",
    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "The Economist is running a series of articles on the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on everything from trade to the island of Ireland, immigration to universities, cars to retailing. This piece looks at the economic fallout.\n\nThe impact of a no-deal Brexit would show up almost immediately in financial markets, more slowly in the wider economy. There would be three big things to watch with regard to markets: government-bond yields, share prices and the value of the currency.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nBritish government bonds are a safe-haven asset for traders and are also in constant demand from pension funds. Their prices should initially rally in the event of no deal, both because of a flight to safety by investors but also because the Bank of England could well be forced to delay increases in interest rates.\n\n\n\nThe stockmarket could also rally. More than 70% of the earnings of the firms which make up the FTSE 100 index come from abroad. A big decline in the exchange rate, which is likely, would push up the sterling value of those foreign earnings. The share prices of British companies whose principal market is domestic (banks, for example) would sell off a bit, but they are already pricing in quite a lot of bad news. So the impact would probably be fairly limited.\n\n\n\nSterling is likely to be a different story. The day after the Brexit referendum in 2016, the pound dropped by nearly 10% against the dollar. Currently it hovers at around $1.30. Traders are banking on it falling to below $1.20 in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Some worry that it would drop further. Britain has a current-account deficit worth more than 3% of GDP, meaning that the country as a whole borrows a lot more than it saves. Since the referendum Britain has largely financed its deficit not with long-term foreign direct investment, but with short-term financial flows. That money can vanish in a trice, pushing down the pound\u2019s value.\n\n\n\nA big decline in the pound would, over time, hit the economy. For one thing it would raise the cost of imported goods. A rule of thumb among economists says that a 10% fall in sterling eventually translates into a 2% rise in the consumer-price index. Were the pound to approach parity with the dollar, as some fear, inflation might rise above 5%. Inflation could rise for another reason, too. The erection of trade barriers between Britain and the EU might force consumers and companies to source more goods and services from domestic suppliers, instead of foreign ones. Suppliers of those goods and services would be unable to ramp up production quickly, so would instead raise prices.\n\n\n\nHigher inflation would cause immediate pain for those in receipt of working-age welfare payments, most of which are frozen in cash terms from 2016 to 2020. It would also trim the purchasing power of salaries. That would be a bitter pill for Britons, whose wages are already worth less in real terms than they were before the financial crisis of 2007-08.\n\n\n\nWith consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of British GDP, shrinking real wages would probably damage overall economic growth. The offsetting hope would be that the fall in the value of the pound spurs exporters. Yet the evidence from the aftermath of the referendum suggests this would be unlikely: exports have grown more slowly than in any other G7 country. And in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the EU would impose tariffs on British exports: cars would face a 10% tariff, for example, rising to 40-45% for lamb. Some industries could be killed off.\n\n\n\nWhether the economy would fall into recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, is unknowable. About a quarter of Britons actively desire no deal, according to polls; these folk might actually boost their spending. As British companies scramble to rewire their supply chains, there might also be a short-term boost to investment spending.\n\n\n\nBut a downturn cannot be ruled out. If that looked likely, both the Bank of England and the government would step in. But neither could do very much. Interest rates are already near an all-time low of 0.75%, and the inflation rate is already near the central bank\u2019s 2% target. The government, meanwhile, could in theory decide not to pay its \u00a339bn \u201cdivorce bill\u201d with the EU, and use the savings to boost public spending.

    "text": "The Economist is running a series of articles on the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on everything from trade to the island of Ireland, immigration to universities, cars to retailing. This piece looks at the economic fallout.\n\nThe impact of a no-deal Brexit would show up almost immediately in financial markets, more slowly in the wider economy. There would be three big things to watch with regard to markets: government-bond yields, share prices and the value of the currency.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nBritish government bonds are a safe-haven asset for traders and are also in constant demand from pension funds. Their prices should initially rally in the event of no deal, both because of a flight to safety by investors but also because the Bank of England could well be forced to delay increases in interest rates.\n\n\n\nThe stockmarket could also rally. More than 70% of the earnings of the firms which make up the FTSE 100 index come from abroad. A big decline in the exchange rate, which is likely, would push up the sterling value of those foreign earnings. The share prices of British companies whose principal market is domestic (banks, for example) would sell off a bit, but they are already pricing in quite a lot of bad news. So the impact would probably be fairly limited.\n\n\n\nSterling is likely to be a different story. The day after the Brexit referendum in 2016, the pound dropped by nearly 10% against the dollar. Currently it hovers at around $1.30. Traders are banking on it falling to below $1.20 in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Some worry that it would drop further. Britain has a current-account deficit worth more than 3% of GDP, meaning that the country as a whole borrows a lot more than it saves. Since the referendum Britain has largely financed its deficit not with long-term foreign direct investment, but with short-term financial flows. That money can vanish in a trice, pushing down the pound\u2019s value.\n\n\n\nA big decline in the pound would, over time, hit the economy. For one thing it would raise the cost of imported goods. A rule of thumb among economists says that a 10% fall in sterling eventually translates into a 2% rise in the consumer-price index. Were the pound to approach parity with the dollar, as some fear, inflation might rise above 5%. Inflation could rise for another reason, too. The erection of trade barriers between Britain and the EU might force consumers and companies to source more goods and services from domestic suppliers, instead of foreign ones. Suppliers of those goods and services would be unable to ramp up production quickly, so would instead raise prices.\n\n\n\nHigher inflation would cause immediate pain for those in receipt of working-age welfare payments, most of which are frozen in cash terms from 2016 to 2020. It would also trim the purchasing power of salaries. That would be a bitter pill for Britons, whose wages are already worth less in real terms than they were before the financial crisis of 2007-08.\n\n\n\nWith consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of British GDP, shrinking real wages would probably damage overall economic growth. The offsetting hope would be that the fall in the value of the pound spurs exporters. Yet the evidence from the aftermath of the referendum suggests this would be unlikely: exports have grown more slowly than in any other G7 country. And in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the EU would impose tariffs on British exports: cars would face a 10% tariff, for example, rising to 40-45% for lamb. Some industries could be killed off.\n\n\n\nWhether the economy would fall into recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, is unknowable. About a quarter of Britons actively desire no deal, according to polls; these folk might actually boost their spending. As British companies scramble to rewire their supply chains, there might also be a short-term boost to investment spending.\n\n\n\nBut a downturn cannot be ruled out. If that looked likely, both the Bank of England and the government would step in. But neither could do very much. Interest rates are already near an all-time low of 0.75%, and the inflation rate is already near the central bank\u2019s 2% target. The government, meanwhile, could in theory decide not to pay its \u00a339bn \u201cdivorce bill\u201d with the EU, and use the savings to boost public spending. But Britain\u2019s ratio of public debt to GDP is already around 85%, a level which might be expected to rise if economic growth slows. It cannot go much higher without investors starting to worry about Britain\u2019s fiscal sustainability.

      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "IN MUCH OF the world, the governments of countries and cities design entire economic-development strategies around attracting tourists. In Europe, however, residents of some of the most popular destinations are deciding they now have too much of a good thing. Between 2012 and 2017 visits to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, soared by 60%. In response to concerns that these additional tourists have increased crowding for locals, and benefit from public services without paying for them, on February 7th Edinburgh\u2019s city council voted to introduce a new tourism tax of \u00a32 ($2.58) per visitor per day. Venice and Amsterdam are also considering restrictions.\n\nSuch a backlash may have been inevitable given the rapid growth of the industry. The internet has made learning about far-flung destinations easier than ever, and the rise of low-cost airlines has made it far cheaper to get to them. In 2018 the number of international tourists grew by 6% to 1.4bn, the second-largest annual rise since the UN\u2019s World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) first compiled long-term forecasts. And since 2000 international arrivals have doubled. The continent with the biggest market for tourism is Europe, which received 713m overseas arrivals in 2018, 6% more than the previous year.\n\nHowever, this trend now shows signs of abating. The UNWTO expects growth in visitor numbers to slow next year in every main region. Last year arrivals to Britain fell by 5%, perhaps because of concerns about Brexit. Increasing fears of an all-out trade war between China and America and a recession in the United States, which would have knock-on effects around the world, may discourage would-be tourists from spending on holidays. Edinburghers may well have got their wish of a reprieve from the onslaught of tourists even without the tax."

    "text": "The Economist is running a series of articles on the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on everything from trade to universities, cars to retailing. This article looks at the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nA NO-DEAL Brexit would damage other European Union countries besides Britain. According to IMF estimates, for example, the GDP of each of the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark would be 1% lower five years after a no-deal Brexit than they would otherwise be. (That may explain why, according to diplomats in Brussels, the first two have prepared better than any other countries for more customs and regulatory checks at their borders.) But by far the biggest loser, after Britain itself, would be Ireland, where GDP lost over five years would amount to almost 4%.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIt is an irony that the most likely cause of a no-deal Brexit is the continuing argument over how to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Brexiteers\u2019 biggest beef with the draft withdrawal agreement agreed by British and EU negotiators is the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d, under which the whole of the United Kingdom would remain in a customs union with the EU until some way could be found to carry out customs and regulatory checks without building new infrastructure at the border. Yet if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal, both EU and WTO rules would require the enforcement of a hard border with associated checks and controls. So says the British government\u2019s Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, echoing claims made by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach.\n\nBrexiteers deny this. They note that the British and Irish governments have made commitments not to enforce a hard border. They suggest seeking a waiver from WTO rules. But this is not convincing other than as a very short-term solution. After a no-deal Brexit, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland would be in different customs, regulatory and food-safety regimes. The WTO would require the imposition of tariffs. If they were not imposed, Britain and Ireland would have to admit all goods from third countries tariff-free, under the organisation\u2019s most-favoured-nation principle (which stops member states from discriminating among trading partners). The European Commission has said that health and food-safety checks would have to be applied to all cross-border farm and agri-food trade. There may be scope for operating some of these controls away from the border itself, but the risk of smuggling and indeed of organised crime in a place with a long history of both would be great.\n\nThe practical implications certainly worry businesses in Northern Ireland. Giving evidence to the House of Commons, the Northern Irish Freight Transport Association noted that 4.6m commercial vehicles cross the border every year. A third of what they carry is agri-food. The Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association pointed out that 30% of the province\u2019s milk and 40% of its sheep go south for processing. It works the other way, too. Both Guinness and Bailey\u2019s Irish Cream cross the border repeatedly for canning, bottling and export. Brussels has made it clear that it could not allow a long-term hole to be created in its external border by a failure to apply physical customs and regulatory controls.\n\nBusinesses in Northern Ireland were not much reassured by the technical notices on preparations for a no-deal Brexit issued by the British government last summer. After setting out how such an outcome might complicate those businesses\u2019 operations, the notices suggested a place to which they might turn if they needed further advice. That was to Dublin, to consult the Irish government.\n\nSee more Brexit briefs:\n\nWhat would a no-deal Brexit mean for the economy?\n\nWhat would a no-deal Brexit mean for trade?\n\nWhat would a no-deal Brexit mean for immigration?\n\nWhat would a no-deal Brexit mean for retailing?\n\nWhat would a no-deal Brexit mean for the automotive industry?\n\n"

On February 7th the Globe and Mail, a newspaper, provided one. It quoted anonymous sources as saying that Ms Wilson-Raybould was being punished for resisting pressure from someone in the prime minister\u2019s office to drop the prosecution for fraud of SNC -Lavalin, a construction and engineering firm. The company, which is accused of paying bribes in Libya during the rule of Muammar Qaddafi, would have been let off with a fine, the report alleged.\n\nMr Trudeau denied that he gave such instructions to Ms Wilson-Raybould. Her presence in cabinet, as minister of veterans\u2019 affairs, was proof there was nothing to the story, he said on February 11th. She resigned the next day. Now Gerald Butts, the prime minister\u2019s principal secretary, has followed her. He quit on February 18th, saying that neither he nor Mr Trudeau\u2019s staff had put pressure on the justice minister.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThis is a grievous loss to Mr Trudeau. Mr Butts was a close friend, who helped him lift the Liberals from third-party status to win the election in 2015. Both men no doubt hope that Mr Butts\u2019s departure will calm the controversy before the next election due in October. The Liberals trail behind the Conservatives in the polls.\n\nThat seems a vain hope. Mr Butts\u2019s resignation \u201cdoes not in any way settle this matter\u201d, said Andrew Scheer, the Conservatives\u2019 leader. The scandal has brought Mr Trudeau\u2019s foes together. Conservatives and the New Democrats, a left-leaning opposition party, had already secured investigations by the parliamentary ethics commissioner and the House of Commons justice committee. Now they are demanding a separate independent inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the SNC -Lavalin case.\n\nThis was never going to be an easy year for Mr Trudeau. Canada\u2019s relations with the United States are tense. Ontario, the most populous province, has taken the federal government to court over its plan to impose a national price for carbon emissions. Energy-rich Alberta accuses Mr Trudeau of moving too slowly to build an oil pipeline. On February 19th a convoy of lorries from Alberta came to Ottawa to make that point."

Adopted by a French couple during the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, the lanky economist went on to be elected in 2017 to the National Assembly, for President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party. Last year, when Mr Berville received a typed death threat by post at his parliamentary office, he threw it in the bin. When another arrived last month regretting the fact that he had \u201cescaped the machetes\u201d, the deputy decided to speak out. \u201cIt was so violent,\u201d he says, and the atmosphere had shifted. \u201cThe border between threats, and acting on those threats, is shrinking.\u201d\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nA climate of hate is emerging in France. The targets are varied, apparently unconnected and shifting: Jews, journalists, the rich, policemen, members of parliament, the president. Sometimes violence is only threatened, as in Mr Berville\u2019s case; two of his (black) parliamentary colleagues received the same threat. At other moments violence has been perpetrated\u2014against symbols (a ministry, luxury cars) as well as people, usually in connection with the gilets jaunes (yellow jackets) protests. That movement, three months old, has radicalised as it has shrunk. Some 1,700 people and 1,000 policemen have been wounded since the protests began.\n\nWhen the gilets jaunes movement emerged last November, it was broadly a social protest and fiscal revolt. But the infiltration of ultra-left and extreme-right agitators, and the determination of a radical core to seek the overthrow of Mr Macron, has hardened the movement\u2019s edge. Weekly scenes of violent clashes with riot police fill French television screens and plumes of tear gas fill the air on the streets of Paris and other cities. This relentless backdrop seems to have legitimised a form of violent hate. What was once confined to the unhinged ramblings of social-media groups has erupted into public.\n\nEarlier this month the Brittany home of Richard Ferrand, speaker of the National Assembly, was torched. Last week the constituency office in Le Mans of Damien Pichereau, another deputy from Mr Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique en Marche ( LREM ), was destroyed. Mr Berville says that 100 deputies from his party have been the victims of warnings or attacks of some sort. Among them are many women. Aurore Berg\u00e9, another LREM deputy, was the recipient of a particularly crude threat. During one protest, an effigy of Mr Macron was decapitated. Christophe Chalen\u00e7on, a gilets jaunes organiser, recently warned that \u201cif they put a bullet in my head, Macron will end up on the guillotine\u201d.\n\nAnti-Semitism is mixed into the brew. After falling for two successive years, the number of anti-Semitic acts in France surged by 74% in 2018. On February 19th, 80 graves in a Jewish cemetery in eastern France were sprayed with swastikas. Christophe Castaner, the interior minister, says that anti-Semitism is \u201cspreading like poison\u201d. In recent days a bagel shop in Paris was defaced with the word \u201cJuden\u201d, swastikas were painted on to street art depicting Simone Veil, a former minister and Auschwitz survivor, and \u201cMacron Jews\u2019 bitch\u201d was found sprayed on a garage door in the capital. Any link to the gilets jaunes is unproven. But last weekend gilets jaunes marchers were caught on video yelling \u201cdirty Zionist shit\u201d and \u201cgo back to Tel Aviv\u201d at Alain Finkielkraut, a French philosopher of Polish origin, who was walking in the street near his left-bank home in Paris.\n\nThreats of death and intimidation are nothing new to politics. And anti-Semitism has deep roots in the country, reaching back beyond Vichy France to the publication of Edouard Drumont\u2019s \u201cLa France Juive\u201d, a popular anti-Semitic text, in 1886. Nor is France a stranger to periodic spasms of violence, such as the May \u201968 uprising or the banlieue riots in 2005. \u201cThe specificity of the current period\u201d, wrote Alain Duhamel in Lib\u00e9ration, a newspaper, \u201cis not the violence but the hatred.\u201d\n\nThere is no precedent under the Fifth Republic for the level of publicly expressed loathing, says Jean Garrigues, a historian at the University of Orl\u00e9ans. He compares today\u2019s toxic mix of anti-parliamentarianism and anti-Semitism to the 1930s. If there is a link between these different strands it seems to be that those who are targeted are all regarded, rightly or wrongly, as part of the elite\u2014or, more accurately, as part of an illegitimate, undeserving elite which is cheating the people. And those doing the most to promote this divide, at a time of eroding ideological attachments, are the country\u2019s populists.\n\nEver since Mr Macron upended the mainstream political parties at elections in 2017, political opposition in France has shifted to the extremes. \u201cYou are hated, massively hated,\u201d declared Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin, a deputy from the far-left Unsubmissive France, to the president in an open letter late last year. Marine Le Pen, on the far right, blames the \u201cagitators, revolutionaries, anarchists\u201d of the far left for the gilets jaunes violence. But she just as often lays into the self-serving political elite herself. Her campaign slogan reads simply: \u201cPower to the people\u201d.\n\nIn protest at the current mood, a march against anti-Semitism on February 19th drew a cross-party collection of politicians and some 20,000 people in Paris. Even Ms Le Pen laid flowers to victims of anti-Semitism; she has consistently sought to distance her party from its anti-Semitic past even as she trades on identity politics.\n\nAhead of a visit to the desecrated Jewish cemetery this week, Mr Macron described anti-Semitism as \u201cthe antithesis of all that is France\u201d. He is hoping that his \u201cgreat national debate\u201d, a countrywide series of consultations and town-hall meetings, will counterbalance the hateful voices. Unfortunately, as the country prepares for elections to the European Parliament in May, in which the parties of Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen are the leading contenders, the harsh tone is unlikely to soften."
