    "authors": [],
    "text": "Job automation has become a key factor in economic anxiety in recent years. As 2020 campaigns begin, Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to live and work in regions with highly automatable jobs, according to a new analysis from Brookings.\n\nDriving the news: Brookings' Mark Muro, Jacob Whiton and Robert Maxim find a correlation between susceptibility to automation and red congressional districts. In the 2018 midterms, they found that 46 of the 50 congressional districts most exposed to automation elected Republicans. Similarly, all 50 of the least-exposed districts are represented by Democrats."

    "title": "Chaotic elections bring little stability to Thailand",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Details: Palang Pracharat apparently captured the second-most constituency seats in the lower house of parliament. (Final, confirmed results have not yet been announced.) Along with allies in the senate, whose members were chosen by the armed forces, Palang Pracharat and coalition parties likely will be able to lead the country, with Prayuth, who led Thailand's 2014 coup, assuming the position of prime minister and running the civilian government.\n\nThe armed forces' dominance of the senate was entrenched in a new constitution that also made it easier for Palang Pracharat to control the lower house.\n\nThe party drew support from older voters and residents of Bangkok \u2014 and received an eleventh-hour implicit endorsement from the supposedly (but not really) apolitical monarch.\n\nWhere it stands: The results do not point toward future stability.\n\nPuea Thai, a populist anti-junta party, appears to have won the most constituency seats in the lower house, and the anti-junta parties collectively won the largest share of the popular vote. In a system with a truly elected senate, fairer election laws or a better climate for political activism, they would have had the first chance to form a government and pick a prime minister.\n\nThere will be a struggle between Palang Pracharat and the opposition. If Palang Pracharat forms a government \u2014 relying largely on its army-installed senate allies \u2014 it could infuriate supporters of the anti-junta coalition and undercut the perceived legitimacy of the new government.\n\nThe standoff could worsen if Palang Pracharat forms a government comprising supporters in both houses, while Puea Thai and its allies control the lower house, all but ensuring political gridlock.\n\nWhat to watch: Prayuth has proven an irascible, thin-skinned leader. If he becomes prime minister, he would have to run the country in a climate unlike that of the past five years of harsh repression and may struggle in the face of real political opposition, a freer press and more public criticism. The kingdom likely will continue to drift, undermining its economy and ensuring that the men in green do not return to the barracks.\n\nJoshua Kurlantzick is senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations."

    "title": "Will the yield curve lead to recession? It really is different this time",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "What's happening: Since Friday's yield curve inversion, the market further positioned for a recession or at least something much worse than the slowdown to 2.1% growth the Fed is predicting.\n\n\"A lot of investors are spooked and really putting on the recession trade, so to speak,\" Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities, tells Axios. \"The extent to which we're pricing in rate cuts suggests we're pricing something more sinister than just rate cuts.\"\n\nThe big picture: While investors have implored anxious Americans to look to the strong U.S. labor market and solid 2018 GDP numbers, what's really changed is the impact of central banks.\n\n\"In the past when yield curves inverted it was entirely the result of the perceptions of investors in the financial markets,\" Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group, tells Axios. \"Now we have seen central banks become heavily involved in the bond market.\"\n\nBackground: After the financial crisis, the Fed's quantitative easing program saw the central bank tack around $4.5 trillion worth of bonds onto its balance sheet \u2014 much of it longer-dated U.S. Treasuries \u2014 in an effort to depress yields and support financial institutions.\n\nFed Chair Jay Powell announced earlier this month that the Fed would stop reducing those holdings once the balance sheet gets to around $3.5 trillion.\n\n\"There\u2019s still that stock effect of all those assets they purchased that is holding down longer-term yields as a result,\" Steve Johnson, senior portfolio manager at Silicon Valley Bank, tells Axios.\n\nAnd it's not just the Fed. The ECB and BOJ both have negative interest rates for some deposits. German and Japanese 10-year government bonds now have negative yields. That's driving a flurry of investors to U.S. Treasuries, which pay significantly more.\n\nDon't forget: There's also the $1 trillion annual U.S. deficit and unprecedented $22 trillion national debt. The deficit is being funded by issuing more short-dated Treasury bills than longer-dated notes, helping invert the curve, Baumohl says.\n\nThe bottom line: The yield curve has inverted before the last 7 U.S. recessions, making it impossible to ignore. But the Fed's quantitative easing programs and subsequent stimulus efforts by governments and central banks around the world have distorted markets. It's hard to rely on historical correlations, positive or negative, because we've never seen this before.\n\nGo deeper: Bond yields are at historic lows around the world"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Moniz says a move like that would remove the transparency that exists between the nuclear powers. He also says arms control has been \u201can enormous part of sustaining \u2014 even in dark periods \u2014 dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviets, and now the U.S. and the Russians.\u201d\n\nHe raised a frightening scenario: A cyberattack on command and control systems (from either a state or non-state actor) that leads to a false warning of an incoming attack. Given the broken state of U.S.-Russia communications, a president would have just minutes to decide whether to respond, and limited information to act on.\n\nBeyond the potential for miscalculation, Moniz said current debates in the U.S. and in Russia are \"reviving the idea of nuclear weapons as battlefield weapons\" rather than tools for deterrence.\n\nOn North Korea, Moniz said that if the Trump administration sticks to its all-or-nothing approach to denuclearization, \"the chances of success are miniscule.\"\n\nHe said North Korea\u2019s testing freeze does enhance U.S. national security while it lasts, because Kim Jong-un hasn\u2019t demonstrated he can strike the U.S. with an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\nBut he added: \"We frequently forget that there are ways of delivering nuclear weapons that don\u2019t involve missiles.\" An example would be \"a ship going into a harbor.\"\n\nNine countries currently have nuclear weapons, including North Korea. NTI\u2019s long-term goal is the elimination of all nuclear weapons, but Moniz conceded that the nuclear club could actually grow in the next decade or so.\n\nHe said the primary short-term risk is an arms race following the collapse of the Iran nuclear deal, which he helped negotiate. \"That has to be a proliferation concern in the region, with a couple countries being the obvious focus of concern,\" he said.\n\nMoniz said the other area of concern is East Asia: \"If some of [North Korea\u2019s] neighbors lose confidence in our military backing for them, then there is a risk there as well.\"\n\nThe bottom line: Moniz cited geopolitical uncertainties, asymmetries in conventional strength between nuclear powers and the introduction of new risks, particularly in the cyber realm, as factors that make a nuclear strike more likely. And he said the behind-the-scenes work to mitigate those risks is falling far short of what is needed."

Thank you to our loyal audience for your unwavering support.\u201d\n\nDetails: Beginning today, Univision says that the following channels are once again available to DISH and DishLATINO customers, depending upon their programming package:\n\nUnivision, UniM\u00e1s, Univision Deportes Network, Galavisi\u00f3n, Tlnovelas and FOROtv\n\nThe companies agreed to settle all pending litigation between the two companies.\n\nBe smart: The agreement is particularly important, given how fragile the talks were for a while. Dish boss Charlie Ergen told analysts last August that the dispute between the two parties is \"probably permanent.\"\n\nBetween the lines: The fight between the two companies has grown ugly over the past year.\n\nLatino advocacy groups mobilized aggressive public support campaigns on behalf of Univision, alleging that Dish was hurting their communities with the blackout fight. Univision filed a suit last summer with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting that Dish still owes the broadcaster millions in retransmission fees and interest. Univision had previously written to the heads of the FCC and FTC alleging that Dish has been deceptively marketing Univision programming as part of Dish's pay-TV services to consumers.\n\nThe big picture: As Axios has previously noted, arguments like these happen all the time between pay-TV providers (cable and satellite companies) and TV networks (broadcast and cable companies). And in a tough economic environment for media, they're happening even more frequently than ever."

That's just not good enough,\" Pence said.\n\nWhile SLS would be the most powerful rocket ever built by the agency and is designed for deep space missions, it's years behind schedule and well over budget.\n\nThe intrigue: Pence took a swipe at Boeing, the primary contractor on SLS, by saying the space agency needs to look for other launch solutions if SLS delays continue. \"To be clear, we're not committed to any one contractor. If our current contractors can't meet this objective, then we'll find ones that will,\" Pence said.\n\nBoeing is already reeling from two fatal crashes of its best-selling Boeing 737 MAX series aircraft.\n\nBetween the lines: Pence, who chairs the U.S. Space Council, spoke at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, the primary center of the SLS program. He also hinted that changes are in store for NASA's structure and goals to better ensure milestones are reached on time.\n\n\"As you will hear in these recommendations, we will call on NASA not just to adopt new policies but to embrace a new mindset that begins with setting bold goals and staying on schedule,\" Pence said.\n\nNASA administrator Jim Bridenstine recently floated the idea of using commercial rockets, such as those from SpaceX, to bring astronauts back to the moon. Pence hinted that may be needed if SLS isn't ready.\n\nNASA has also selected a new lunar destination: the moon's South Pole, where astronauts have not yet visited.\n\nReality check: Returning astronauts to the moon within 5 years is an extremely ambitious goal, and one that may be impossible for NASA to meet given the status of the SLS rocket.\n\nIn addition to overcoming technical hurdles, achieving this 5-year goal would also depend on adequate funding from Congress as well as the re-election of President Trump, since a Democrat in the White House could redirect NASA starting in 2020.\n\nGo deeper: In major shift, NASA may use commercial rockets for next moon mission"

    "title": "How Russia tampers with GPS",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Why it matters: It's easy to see the military, transportation and pizza delivery importance of precise location information. The timing signals are extremely important, too.\n\nThe stock market needs precision timing to handle transactions down to the fractional second.\n\nPrecise timing is a critical component in telecommunications because it allows national and international networks to synchronize.\n\nThe intrigue: Russia has been called out several times before for interfering with global positioning satellite systems. It is known to have pursued the national security and military use of interfering with GPS in a way no other country has. But before the study by the C4ADS think tank, no one had really taken a scientific look across all of Russia's activities to see how constant the disruptions are.\n\nTo do that, C4ADS used University of Texas equipment placed on the International Space Station to monitor more than 9,800 suspected instances since 2016 where fraudulent global navigation signals appear to have been broadcast in the Russian Federation, as well as instances where similar signals were broadcast in Russian conflict zones like Crimea and Syria.\n\nC4ADS is not formally accusing the Russian government of being behind any of the fraudulent, \"spoofed\" signals. It would be impossible to make that kind of determination from the space station.\n\nBut, but, but: It is clear that many of the instances largely serve Russian national interests.\n\nIn Russia, C4ADS found that several spoofed signals came from areas where Russian VIPs (like President Vladimir Putin) were traveling or that contained military or domestic facilities Russia wants to protect (including a \"multimillion-dollar 'palace'\" reportedly built for Putin).\n\n\"multimillion-dollar 'palace'\" reportedly built for Putin). Those areas broadcast the coordinates of airports in places where there are no airports.\n\nThe spoofing was frequent enough that C4ADS reports the Russian internet firm Yandex had to redesign its ride sharing app. Otherwise, it billed passengers for sudden trips to the airport whenever their driver passed through a spoofed area.\n\nAirports that mysteriously seemed to appear in the Black Sea were so disruptive that the United States issued a warning to international cargo firms.\n\nWhy airports? Many manufacturers of drones use GPS chips to prevent their products from flying into airport airspace. C4ADS suspects the spoofing was to prevent drone attacks or surveillance.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia also used spoofing in combat zones, particularly Syria, to try to limit attacks against its installations.\n\nUnlike in Russia, the fake signals were intended to mimic connections to satellites without providing discernible location information. Rather than thinking they were at airports, navigation chips couldn't figure out where they were.\n\nThis is likely because drone attacks in Syria often used equipment modified to ignore the airport blocks, making it more productive to disorient pilots rather than trick the aircraft.\n\nAll of the spoofing Russia has been involved in appears to have been focused on faking a location rather than disrupting timing. But the C4ADS report notes that disrupting locations during NATO and Russian military exercises affected timing anyway, impacting Finnish and Norwegian cell phone networks."

    "text": "Scientists do not expect this slowing trend to continue. A natural climate cycle in the North Atlantic Ocean is likely to switch gears and bring warmer waters back into contact with the ice shelf, melting it from below at the same time that increasing air temperatures weaken it from above.\n\nDetails: The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, found that a plume of relatively cold waters has encroached on the Jakobshavn Glacier from the southwest, starting about 600 miles away.\n\nThe study is based in part on high-resolution data gathered during NASA's Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) mission, as well as other observations.\n\nThe OMG mission is aimed at obtaining temperature and salinity data in the vicinity of rapidly melting Greenland glaciers, since it's been shown that relatively mild ocean waters are eroding glaciers' ice shelves from below in both Greenland and Antarctica.\n\nThese ice shelves act like a door stop, holding back inland ice. Once the ice shelves melt and collapse, the inland ice can flow faster into the sea, raising sea levels.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2016, the Jakobshavn lost about 160 meters, or 525 feet in thickness at the glacial front, which is where the ice meets the ocean.\n\nThe intrigue: A key suspect in causing the glacier's slowdown is a regional climate pattern that causes the North Atlantic Ocean to alternate between warm and cold temperatures. Ocean temperatures in Disko Bay's near-surface waters have cooled to levels last seen during the mid-1980s, the study found.\n\nThe study traces this cooling to unusual loss of heat from the ocean during the winter months as the waters circulate around the southern half of Greenland.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"At first we didn't believe it. We had pretty much assumed that Jakobshavn would just keep going on as it had over the last 20 years,\" says lead author Ala Khazendar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, in a press release. However, the OMG data showed cold water near Jakobshavn for three years in a row.\n\n\"Jakobshavn is getting a temporary break from this climate pattern. But in the long run, the oceans are warming. And seeing the oceans have such a huge impact on the glaciers is bad news for Greenland's ice sheet,\" Josh Willis of JPL, the principal investigator of OMG, explained.\n\nGo deeper:"

But during a more than 6-hour spacewalk to repair batteries on the ISS last week, McClain discovered that a medium-sized spacesuit fit her better than a large.\n\n\"McClain learned during her first spacewalk that a medium-size hard upper torso \u2014 essentially the shirt of the spacesuit \u2014 fits her best. Because only one medium-size torso can be made ready by Friday, March 29, Koch will wear it,\" NASA said in a statement Monday. Astronaut Nick Hague will take McClain\u2019s place."

The company has dwarfed other companies in terms of the number and amount of buybacks last year and for the past decade.\n\nDriving the news: S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Monday that companies bought back $806.4 billion worth of their own shares, including $223 billion in just the fourth quarter in 2018. It was short of the $1 trillion Goldman Sachs predicted in August, but still an all-time record.\n\nOf that record total, Apple bought back $10.1 billion worth of its own stock in Q4 and $74.2 billion for the year, more than a third of the entire S&P 500 total. The closest company to that total was Oracle, which spent $29.3 billion.\n\nOver the past decade, Apple has bought back more than $260.4 billion of its own shares. The No. 2 company on the buybacks list is Microsoft, which has bought back less than half that amount, $118.5 billion.\n\nBetween the lines: Companies have shown a very clear preference for buybacks over dividends so far this decade, with a major uptick in this trend in 2018 after the passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.\n\nDividend spending was $27 billion below buybacks in the fourth quarter of 2017. In Q4 2018, companies spent $103 billion more on buybacks than dividends.\n\nFurther buyback numbers announced by S&P Dow Jones on Monday:"

John McCain was presented with the controversial Steele dossier alleging a Trump-Russia campaign conspiracy in December 2016, Graham urged him to hand it off to the FBI.\n\nWhy it matters: President Trump last week renewed his attacks on McCain, claiming that the senator was responsible for pushing the dossier\u2019s narrative into the public eye. Graham, now a Trump loyalist, said that he was \"very direct\" with the president about McCain's involvement while they were golfing this past week: \"I understand that, clearly people are in the McCain world that did some things inappropriate but it was not John McCain,\" Graham said. \"John McCain did not give it to anybody in the press.\""

Israel\u2019s acting foreign minister told Channel 13 News it was the largest operation undertaken in Gaza since 2014. Hamas fired rockets in response.\n\nThe latest: Just as things looked like they might spiral into war, Hamas announced a ceasefire. It's unclear if it's holding. As the Telegraph\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent Raf Sanchez tweeted: \u201cThe psychological whiplash that people in this region live with is unreal.\u201d\n\nBack in Washington this morning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Trump before cutting his visit short in light of the attack.\n\nBenny Gantz, a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces who is making a strong centrist challenge in the April 9 elections, criticized Netanyahu for the deteriorating security situation. Gantz later addressed the pro-Israel AIPAC conference in Washington, stressing his military bona fides while calling for \u201cunity\u201d and condemning racism and corruption.\n\nThose were thinly veiled swipes at Netanyahu, who boosted a racist fringe party in a pre-election maneuver designed to ensure a right-wing majority in the Knesset and is facing indictments in three bribery and fraud cases.\n\nYet another scandal reared its head this week. This one concerns a submarine deal Netanyahu\u2019s critics claim he profited from (he denies it). But while polls show Gantz\u2019s party narrowly leading Netanyahu\u2019s, they also show most Israelis expect Netanyahu to keep his job.\n\nBefore departing Washington, Netanyahu lavished praise on President Trump during a ceremony in which Trump officially recognized Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights. He told Trump: \u201cIsrael has never had a better friend than you.\u201d\n\nInternationally, Trump has never had a better friend than the Israeli prime minister. He has clashed with the leaders of most of America\u2019s traditional allies. Not with Netanyahu.\n\nThey\u2019re kindred spirits. Both castigate the \u201cfake news\u201d media, claim to be the victims of a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d and paint visions of destruction and destitution should they be removed from office.\n\nTheir relationship is also politically symbiotic. Trump sees political advantage in being the president who moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and steadfastly defended Israel at the UN. Netanyahu, meanwhile, is placing his close ties with Trump at the center of his campaign.\n\nThe bottom line: Netanyahu claims events like today's show he's the only man who can keep Israel safe, while his opponents argue they prove he's not keeping Israel safe enough. But at the heart of Israel's security lies its relationship with the U.S.."

    "title": "Global carbon dioxide emissions reached record high in 2018",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Why it matters: To avert more severe consequences of human-caused global warming, countries need to begin making steep cuts to emissions now. The new data clearly shows that's not happening, as the world hasn't even begun to bend the emissions curve downward, as agreed to in the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nWhat they found: The IEA said energy-related CO2 \u2014 which accounts for the vast majority of all CO2 emissions\u2014 climbed by 1.7% last year following a slightly smaller increase in 2017. China, India and the U.S. jointly accounted for 85% of the net emissions growth.\n\nThreat level: A major United Nations scientific report last October analyzed what's needed to hold the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, or 2.7\u00b0F, above pre-industrial levels \u2014 the aspirational goal of the Paris deal.\n\nThe UN-led report found that to stay within 1.5\u00b0C, net human-caused CO2 emissions must decline by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, and reach \"net zero\" by roughly mid-century.\n\nDetails: Overall energy consumption rose by 2.3% last year, which is almost twice the average growth rate since 2010, the IEA said. They attributed the increase to the \"robust global economy\" and higher heating and cooling needs in some regions.\n\nThe big picture: This is at least the second major analysis to show renewed emissions growth over the last 2 years, following a plateau in 2014-2016. Researchers under the banner of the Global Carbon Project have separately concluded that that emissions rose in 2017 and 2018.\n\nBy the numbers: Global energy intensity \u2014 a measurement of energy use per unit of GDP \u2014 fell again last year. But the 1.3% improvement was smaller than in recent years, showing a slowdown in efficiency gains, the IEA said.\n\nCoal demand moved up slightly, by 0.7%, as higher use in India and China offset declines in Europe and the U.S.\n\nWorldwide, coal-fired power generation \u2014 still the world's largest electricity source \u2014 accounted for 30% of global emissions.\n\nNatural gas demand grew by 4.6% and oil demand grew by 1.3%.\n\nThe intrigue: The report includes what it calls the IEA's first assessment of the effect of fossil fuel use on global temperature rise.\n\nEmissions from coal combustion have accounted for over 0.3\u00b0C of the nearly 1\u00b0C increase in global average surface temperatures so far, the report says, making coal the \"single largest source\" of global warming to date.\n\nThe bottom line: Surging growth in renewables isn't yet enough to begin bending down the global emissions curve as fossil fuel consumption expands as well.\n\n\"[M]ore urgent action is needed on all fronts \u2014 developing all clean energy solutions, curbing emissions, and spurring investments and innovation, including in carbon capture, utilization and storage,\" IEA chief Fatih Birol said in statement.\n\nGo deeper:"

Differing estimates place the number of failed Alzheimer\u2019s drugs somewhere between 150 and 300.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cI admit to you, we are getting pretty desperate,\u201d Samuel Gandy, associate director of the Mount Sinai Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThis is really the final data point that shows we do not really know what is causing this disease and how to make an impact with a pharmaceutical,\u201d biotech investor Brad Loncar said in the Financial Times.\n\nBetween the lines: Most Alzheimer\u2019s research to date has focused on a protein called beta amyloid, which forms large plaques on Alzheimer\u2019s patients\u2019 brains. Broadly speaking, the theory was that those plaques cause Alzheimer\u2019s, and that an effective treatment would break them up.\n\nBut with each new failure, more and more scientists second-guessing that theory. The Biogen failure seems like a tipping point.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong with the way we\u2019re thinking about Alzheimer\u2019s and amyloid,\u201d wrote Derek Lowe, a longtime amyloid skeptic who blogs for Science magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s been wrong for a long time and that\u2019s been clear for a long time. Do something else.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Research into other theories is happening, but most of it still in the earliest stages. And there is no broad agreement about where to go next \u2014 no consensus about what will work, only a growing consensus about what won't.\n\nSome biotech companies are targeting brain inflammation; others, genetic mutations tied to the brain\u2019s immune system, according to a Wall Street Journal roundup. Another theory is focused on a possible role for infectious agents. A different brain protein, called tau, has also gotten a lot of attention.\n\nThe bottom line: The National Institutes of Health will spend $2.3 billion on Alzheimer's research this year, according to the Alzheimer's Association, and biotech companies are spending billions more."

It is also consistent with Washington's commitment to target those who materially support Iran's missile and military capabilities, which rely on the same nexus between the country's scientific research centers and defense-industrial base.\n\nThe State Department posed a stark choice for Iranian scientists: \"Iran's next generation of scientists has two paths: They can use their skills pursuing noble work outside of the WMD realm, or they can work for Iranian proliferation organizations and risk being sanctioned.\"\n\nWhat's next: Holding Iran to account for its past illicit nuclear activities may require exploiting the atomic archive seized from Iran by Israel over one year ago to sanction persons and entities who appear in those documents but have yet to be penalized.\n\nBehnam Ben Taleblu is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies."

Democrats said he had hurt their case against Kavanaugh, while Senate Judiciary chair Chuck Grassley referred him and his client to the Justice Department for criminal investigation.\n\nHe was also scrutinized for telling Time magazine in an interview that the 2020 Democratic nominee \"better be a white male.\" He said only a white man can be taken seriously.\n\nNovember 2018: Avenatti was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of domestic violence, dealing the most significant blow yet to his political ambitions. After news broke of his arrest, the Vermont Democratic Party canceled two events at which he was the featured speaker. Avenatti had denied any wrongdoing, and last month prosecutors concluded that he will not face criminal charges.\n\nLater that month, Avenatti had a public fallout with Daniels, who told The Daily Beast that he went against her wishes by filing a defamation suit against Trump and starting a crowdfunding page to pay for her legal defense without informing her.\n\nDecember 2018: Avenatti announced on Twitter that he would not be running for the president in 2020.\n\nFebruary 2019: Avenatti agreed to give up control of his longtime law firm after a former partner accused him of \"hiding millions of dollars from the court that oversaw its bankruptcy,\" the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nMarch 2019: Earlier this month, Daniels said she has retained another attorney and that she and Avenatti were parting ways, USA Today reports.\n\nToday: Federal prosecutors in New York announced Avenatti is being charged for attempting to extort $20 million from Nike. Prosecutors in California have also charged him with wire and bank fraud.\n\nGo deeper: Read both sets of charges against Avenatti"

The U.S. staked its maneuvers on a bet that the military high command would turn on Maduro and back Guaid\u00f3 as interim president until the country could hold free and fair elections.\n\nThe bottom line: Russian troops are more than a hedge against a U.S. invasion; they are a signal to prevent the defections from the Venezuelan military that the U.S. and others had been banking on. Now, perhaps in part as reprisal for U.S. support of Ukraine's democratic government against Russian intervention, Putin may try to play a role in any solution to the Venezuelan standoff.\n\nChristopher Sabatini is an adjunct professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, executive director of Global Americans and a non-resident fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "What's happening: Lyft's IPO is perfectly timed at the intersection of 3 concurrent market themes that are driving investor FOMO.\n\nPrivate companies are staying private for longer and growing larger than they have before. Despite a recent uptick, fewer companies than ever are going public.\n\nPrivate equity managers are holding more dry powder, or money on the sidelines, than ever before. That's a function of more money flowing into private equity as its returns have beaten public markets' and a lack of new businesses deemed worthy of that capital.\n\nThe stock market is rising again, headlined by big technology names, toward all-time highs with rich valuations that's even got Warren Buffett saying he can't find anything to buy.\n\nThe intrigue: This is a wide-ranging phenomenon that's even demonstrated itself in Tajikistan government bonds.\n\nDespite being a country most investors couldn't find on a map, Tajikistan's $500 million bond offering in 2017 received $4 billion worth of bids, or 8 times more than it offered. That was with a credit rating well below investment grade and absolutely no track record.\n\nAs I wrote not long after the Tajikistan deal, emerging market debt was so in demand from buyers in search of high yields and whatever was hot at the moment that dedicated EM investors literally weren't able to get bonds they wanted.\n\n\"It's frustrating for me as an investor,\" Josephine Shea, portfolio manager at Standish Mellon Asset Management said at the time. \"There seems to be quite a bit of indiscriminate buying without looking into underlying fundamentals.\"\n\nThe theme continued this year as Uzbekistan, another former Soviet country that has never before sold bonds to the international market, produced a $1 billion bond offering at a 4.75% coupon (well below average) that received $5.5 billion of bids.\n\nThe bottom line: Whether it makes money or not, Lyft is a hot name that's part of a successful sector. It has been just the latest beneficiary of investor FOMO. That's driving Lyft's valuation to potentially double what it was just 9 months ago and more than triple what it was 2 years ago.\n\nBarring a recession or some cataclysmic error or scandal, the rest of the LUPAS (Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, Airbnb and Slack) will probably see similar valuation bulge.\n\nGo deeper: Lyft files first for IPO in litmus test for the industry"

    "text": "Driving the news: The Senate is set to hold a procedural vote this week to begin debating the Green New Deal. Democrats are expected to vote \"present\" to show unity and oppose Republicans\u2019 efforts to highlight divisions on the left about the proposal.\n\nWhere it stands: The backers of the Green New Deal, which include youth-led activist groups like the Sunrise Movement, have amassed an impressive amount of support for the proposal from Democratic presidential candidates and congressional progressives, in particular Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), whose attention guarantees limelight.\n\nThe 14-page non-binding resolution\n\nBy its own definition, the plan is meant to be purely symbolic. Yet it features specific, extremely ambitious goals while leaving out the hard stuff, like actual policy designs, how to pay for it and how to keep energy costs in check.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said last week\n\nThe intrigue: New Consensus, a new nonprofit pivotal in shaping the Green New Deal working with Ocasio-Cortez's office, is working on a report to release early next year that will be the policy nuts and bolts of the plan.\n\nOne of its experts, Rhiana Gunn-Wright, said they're getting input now from people affected by climate change, particularly low-income and minority people. She concedes it's leaving a void in the meantime.\n\n\"I think the idea is you never let your message get too far out ahead of the substance, and we have definitely created a vacuum and left space for people to fill with what they think the Green New Deal is based on their assumptions and past experiences. It\u2019s certainly a danger, but it\u2019s a danger worth taking by ensuring we get frontline voices in.\"\n\n\u2014 Rhiana Gunn-Wright, New Consensus\n\nThe other side: Republicans have not put forth substantive alternative ideas, instead lambasting the proposal as a socialist takeover attempt, with one GOP lawmaker going so far to say it\u2019s tantamount to genocide. Conservative pundits and politicians cite a study by right-leaning think tank American Action Forum to say the proposal\u2019s total costs could reach $93 trillion by adding up the assumed costs of individual pillars.\n\nBetween the lines: That number is mostly baseless \u2014 because so little data is available to model. Progressive activists are demanding that lawmakers support the Green New Deal, but at the same time they don\u2019t have details available because it\u2019s not a bill.\n\nThat\u2019s like buying a house without an inspection. You shouldn\u2019t do that, but sometimes you give in to pressure.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: Both backers of the Green New Deal and their conservative detractors say they\u2019re looking out for America\u2019s poor. For now, both have little substance to back up their positions because \u2014 once again \u2014 details are scarce.\n\nGunn-Wright has argued that the policies work together to address climate change and income inequality.\n\nthat the policies work together to address climate change and income inequality. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a damn good job advancing the Green New Deal to the point it\u2019s at today,\" said Corbin Trent, spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez. \"We\u2019re going to work to further advance it and work out the details of implementation.\u201d\n\nLacking their own policy, Republicans argue generally that the proposal would hike energy costs, which hit poorer people more because they direct a bigger percentage of their income to electricity and gasoline.\n\nReality check: Details hurt political messaging and detract from rallying cries, which are important in their own right. But details are unavoidable when talking about real-life impacts. Economists say the specific type of climate policy \u2014 be it a tax or mandate and potential accompanying measures \u2014 make all the difference for how people fare.\n\nGilbert Metcalf, an economics professor at Tufts University and former Obama administration Treasury official, says the Green New Deal could protect lower income households \u2014 or it could hurt them. It depends on, you know, what it actually is.\n\n\u201cAny program could hurt the poor if not designed with their concerns in mind,\u201d Metcalf told me. \u201cIf the Green New Deal relies heavily on regulation and the use of clean-energy tax subsidies, then I worry it could inadvertently hurt lower-income families. But if a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system is the backbone of the proposal, I\u2019m less worried.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next: This week\u2019s Senate debate is designed to maximize political messaging and minimize substance. Non-election years like this used to be rare windows when Congress actually considered policy.\n\nEditor's note: This piece was corrected to show American Action Forum suggests the GND proposal's total costs could reach $93 trillion (not annual cost)."

Were he to be confirmed \u2014 an act that itself would qualify as state capture \u2014 Fed chair Jay Powell could no longer truthfully say that his rate-setting committee is independent, unswayed by partisan political considerations. That independence has been a Fed bedrock for decades.\n\nThe Fed shocked the bond markets this week by announcing that it was planning no more rate hikes for the rest of the year. That's despite the fact that current rates are low and growth seems healthy. By coincidence, the Fed's move follows sustained and public pressure from President Trump, urging the Fed to stop raising rates.\n\nThe markets don't believe that Trump is responsible for the new policy. But if they did suspect political influence, the Fed's credibility \u2014 by far its most important asset \u2014 would be shattered.\n\nFurther reading: John Authers explains the most likely economic rationale for Powell's actions, while Greg Ip worries that if rates need to be this low when the economy is doing well, the Fed will not be able to cope if and when the next big downturn happens. And Binyamin Appelbaum reminds us that the Fed seems to be neglecting its other big job, of regulating the banking system."

They're talking about them all the time, and the ideas are even being weaponized by the right to label the entire Democratic Party as socialists. But none of that is breaking through in this key battleground state."

So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country,\" the architect of North Carolina\u2019s 2016 redistricting process said. His plan is now before the high court.\n\nDriving the news: The justices will hear two hours of oral arguments Tuesday: one hour about North Carolina\u2019s map and one hour about a Democratic-led gerrymander in Maryland. Rulings are expected in June.\n\nWhy it matters: Critics say extreme partisan gerrymandering undermines the basic premise that each person\u2019s vote counts equally.\n\nIn North Carolina, for example, Republicans won 53% of the popular vote in 2016, yet ended up controlling 77% of the seats in the state legislature \u2014 the exact breakdown they were aiming for when they drew their map.\n\nThe other side: The most interesting debate here isn't partisan, but rather a divide between voting-rights advocates and conservatives who argue that redistricting is a quintessentially political process and the courts should stay out.\n\nWhere it stands: The Supreme Court has never struck down a partisan gerrymander. It has never said a state legislature crossed the line in trying to secure a partisan advantage \u2014 in fact, it has never even said whether there\u2019s a line to cross."

These headlines foment mistrust in the fairness of the entire system.\n\nBe smart: Western countries are generally perceived as less corrupt than most countries in Africa. But perceptions don't always mirror reality. \"Our current corruption discourse is a form of geopolitical racial profiling,\" says Olopade. Any given act of corruption tends to get blamed on an individual actor in the West, while being considered symptomatic of a broader malaise in a place like Nigeria.\n\nThe bottom line: The Mueller report has refocused America's attention on malfeasance during the 2016 election campaign. But as Robert Rotberg puts it in his book about corruption, \u201cGreed never stops at the edge of a presidential palace.\" The more frequently everyday Americans are reminded that our system is rigged, the less they're going to be willing participants in that system."

The state's dairy industry accounts for half of the state\u2019s \"critical agricultural sector ... generates $43.4 billion a year in economic activity ... and supports 413,500 jobs or 11.9% of the state\u2019s employment,\" according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum.\n\n\"For a lot of farmers, this has been a gut check.

The worst in recent history was the farm credit crisis in the 1980s, with low commodity prices and sky-high interest rates. At the height of that crisis, in 1987, there were almost 6,000 farmers who filed for bankruptcy. There were 498 in 2018, while farm profitability was $63 billion \u2014 the second lowest in the past ten years.\n\nWhat is different this time is farmers have seen declining commodity prices for years. And the trade war, which caused less demand for commodities from foreign buyers, has made it more painful (despite $7.7 billion so far in aid from the Trump administration). Extreme weather conditions, like the record flooding seen in the Midwest, have added another layer of uncertainty.\n\nThe bottom line, from Steven Deller, a professor of agricultural and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: \"Farmers are structured to ride these waves out, but when the waves are this long they can't ride that out.\""

That's about 5% of the resident population as compared to around 12%\u201313% in the 1970s.\n\nPerhaps most sobering of all, with the high prices of land, labor and raw materials, it now costs $650,000 to $850,000 per unit of \"affordable housing.\"\n\nThat means the only way to actually build affordable housing is with significant subsidies. (Fortunately, a number of federal, state and local programs exist to help do that.)\n\nWhat surprised me was the unanimity among the four panelists, who ranged from an economist to the leader of an affordable housing nonprofit \u2014 everyone agreed that a change in laws and mindset is needed to enable more construction of all types.\n\nThat includes everything from the types of large, subsidized buildings that Sobel builds, to the newfangled co-living projects built by Starcity, a Y Combinator-backed startup.\n\nWhile sometimes derided as \"dorms for millennials,\" Starcity CEO Jon Dishotsky said the buildings make efficient use of space, with residents getting more space than some studio apartments while paying rents that start at $800 per month.\n\nThe furnished units give each resident their own bedroom and bathroom and rely on a shared kitchen/living space that is cleaned daily.\n\nLaura Foote, head of YIMBY Action, argued that the conflict need not be seen as a competition among affordable housing, luxury apartments and new types of living arrangements. All are desired and badly needed.\n\nSo if everyone realizes this, what's the problem? As you might guess from the name of her organization, it is the fact that so many people oppose large housing projects in their own neighborhoods.\n\nA big part of the solution, Foote maintains, would be to allow all projects to be built as long as they conform to established rules. Today, each project must go through a process where any neighbor can object and, in many cases, slow or thwart the plan.\n\nThe bottom line: Every unit of housing that gets built eases a tiny bit of pressure and has the long-term effect of moderating prices.\n\nGo deeper: The great family exodus"

    "text": "Details: Shortly after the Navy's review concluded, U.S. B-52 bombers flew over hotly contested islands in the South China Sea \u2014 an activity that has become routine in recent months. Given the nuclear payload capability of the bombers, Chinese government officials have repeatedly voiced their concerns.\n\nChinese hackers have targeted Flag officers as well as under-sea warfare programs in the past, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said at a conference in Washington, D.C., last week. This increases the need for the security and protection of both systems and personnel. Officials have, however, offered little specificity on the systems under attack and the extent of any breaches.\n\nBetween the lines: This kinetic activity comes amid muddled developments in the U.S.\u2013China trade war. Tariffs against China that were due to be doubled never materialized, nor did the deal President Trump promised to close by mid-March with President Xi Jinping.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. and its allies are still dealing with the potential T-Mobile\u2013Sprint merger that could allow Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications equipment developer, to gain an even greater market share in handheld devices, placing its technology across the world while leveraging the future 5G network.\n\nHuawei, two of its affiliates and its CFO were charged in a 13-count indictment by the Department of Justice for bank and wire fraud as well as violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran and conspiracy to obstruct justice in the course of that investigation. (Iran has previously hacked U.S. Navy systems as well).\n\nThe bottom line: The U.S. must help China become a more honest broker while holding it responsible for its continued transgressions \u2014 keeping in mind that China's economy, global business interests and close ties with North Korea mean its power will only grow.\n\nBishop Garrison is the co-founder and president of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy."

    "text": "How it started: In October, YC asked for program applications from startups and non-profits working to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nThe \"request for startups\" came two weeks after a major UN report concluded that carbon removal will be needed to prevent warming from reaching a tipping point.\n\nStill, the two relevant startups that participated in YC's most recent accelerator program, which concluded earlier this week, are using better known approaches \u2014 providing project verification for carbon offsetting projects and turning carbon dioxide into a fuel \u2014 than the techniques highlighted in October.\n\nWhat investors are saying: \"For too long, the world has ignored the scientists, inventors, organizers, and entrepreneurs who are pursuing solutions that could dramatically reduce emissions, remove carbon from the atmosphere, actively cool the planet, and save human, animal, and plant life as we know it,\" venture capitalist Chris Sacca told Axios via email.\n\nSacca has invested in YC program participant Pachama, which uses drones and other tech to verify carbon offsetting projects like forest restoration. Pachama co-founder and CEO Diego S\u00e1ez Gil wouldn't share details about the startup's current fundraising but hinted that investors have been receptive.\n\nPrometheus co-founder and CEO Rob McGinnis, whose startup turns carbon dioxide into fuel and also participated in YC's program, says that investors he meets fall into two camps: those who are excited and can't wait to invest, and those who say it all sounds too good to be true (Prometheus says it will be able to produce a gallon of fuel for only $3 by next year).\n\nAnd there seems to be broader market appetite: Earlier this week, Canadian company Carbon Engineering, which hopes to commercialize machines that directly capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, announced a record $68 million in funding.\n\nYes, but: There\u2019s still some caution among some investors who don\u2019t want to repeat the missteps of the cleantech investing boom a decade ago, which ended in a series of disappointing results.\n\n\u201cThe challenge often is that, from a venture perspective, you dump $10 million to $40 million into a startup just to figure out if that works,\u201d says Congruent Ventures managing partner Abe Yokell, a veteran cleantech investor. He also points out that carbon offsetting is still a voluntary activity in the U.S., which raises questions about how successive a marketplace like Pachama can be without regulatory changes.\n\nOther investors told Axios that uncertainty about market economics in the future can make them hesitant, especially if a company\u2019s technology is also unproven\u2014it\u2019s a double risk, they say.\n\nThe bottom line: \"Timing is very important for a startup company,\" says Prometheus' McGinnis. \"If I had tried to do this five years ago, I would have had the timing wrong.\"\n\nGo deeper:"

Ilhan Omar and senior Democratic lawmakers over her comments on the motivations of Israel supporters.\n\nTrump has exploited this dynamic, labeling the Democratic party \u201canti-Jewish,\u201d even though 79% of Jews voted Democratic in 2018. Watch for Netanyahu to back him, putting Democrats further on the defensive.\n\nNetanyahu's AIPAC speech is likely to focus on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement \u2014 the group's top priority, after military aid to Israel and constraints on Iran. He may emphasize Israel's greater acceptance in the Arab world, but don\u2019t expect much fanfare about the Palestinian issue.\n\nFlashback: In March 2015, Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress and attacked President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran diplomacy. That speech similarly doubled as a campaign ad for his re-election to the premiership.\n\nBetween the lines: Both leaders stand to gain from the visit, and Trump has given Netanyahu an additional boost by vowing to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Yet there are critical policy issues in play that can't be papered over:\n\nIran continues to expand its reach in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. The Trump administration\u2019s attempt to isolate Iran by withdrawing from the nuclear deal has been ineffective at best; by undermining alliances, it's left the U.S. and Israel more alone in their efforts. Syria is dominated by Russia and Iran, with Assad firmly in power. Trump\u2019s Golan Heights decision will create new tensions as military activity between Israel and Iran continues. Jared Kushner's peace plan has no support from the Palestinians. While that will not advance Israel's long-term security, Netanyahu may benefit in the meantime, as his coalition partners panicked over reports Kushner could address \u201cborders.\u201d Now that Netanyahu has secured his most significant near-term ask \u2014 American recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital \u2014 prospects for two-state peacemaking under his leadership are dim.\n\nThe bottom line: Netanyahu's visit will likely do little to resolve Israel's most pressing security concerns, and could instead prioritize his political survival over policy.\n\nJoel Rubin is president of the Washington Strategy Group and the former deputy assistant secretary of state for the House of Representatives."

If that happens, it would mark only the second time in the country's history that such a weather event has occurred.\n\nWhy it matters: Cyclone Trevor, in the Gulf of Carpenteria, and Cyclone Veronica, off Western Australia, are each intensifying while moving slowly toward land. These storms threaten to bring storm surge flooding to the coast, damaging winds and excessive inland rainfall. Of the two, Cyclone Veronica appears poised to hit a more populated part of the country, potentially coming ashore on March 24 near Port Hedland in Western Australia. That city of about 16,000 could be inundated by a powerful storm surge as the storm barrels slowly inland."

Blockchain could ensure the authenticity of that data.\n\nBlockchain could also enable customers to use multiple transportation systems with a single digital ID, paying for transit tickets, insurance if needed, and streaming services.

But few would argue that the ambition in Rio is translating into policy steps anywhere near commensurate with the problem.\n\nThe treaty called for \"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic human-induced interference with the climate system.\"\n\nBy the numbers: The average concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide in 1994 was 359 parts per million, per National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.\n\nLast year the average was 409 ppm, and now it's even higher.\n\n2018 was the 4th-warmest year in modern temperature records that date back to the late 1800s, per NOAA.\n\nThe last 5 years comprise the 5 warmest on record, according to multiple datasets, and 9 of the top 10 have occurred since 2005.\n\nGlobal CO2 emissions rose in 2017 and 2018, ending a 3-year plateau.\n\nBut, but, but: Diplomacy and negotiations under the UNFCCC have also led to greater global collaboration on confronting climate change and at least agreeing to what the goals should be.\n\nThe Paris deal aims to prevent global temperatures from rising 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspirational target of holding the rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nThat would require extremely steep emissions cuts in the coming years and decades, and right now hitting even the 2\u00b0C target looks unlikely.\n\nHowever, the structure of the non-binding Paris deal aims for countries lay out more ambitious emissions plans.\n\nWhat they're saying: Patricia Espinosa, the top UN climate official, said in a statement marking the birthday that there have been successes and disappointments.\n\n\"We have the Paris Agreement, and we have the guidelines strengthening that agreement. What we need now are results,\" she said, calling for more ambition and action to stabilize temperatures.\n\nThe bottom line: Major studies conclude that global warming is already having harmful effects worldwide that are expected to worsen as temperatures rise.\n\nGo deeper: Key global warming target slipping out of reach, UN scientists warn"

It plans to simulate the equivalent of billions of miles of driving in challenging scenarios.\n\nHow it works: The cloud-based platform contains two servers operating side-by-side \u2014 one simulates sensor output from the car and the other receives that data, makes decisions, and then sends commands back to the simulated vehicle.\n\nDevelopers can create all kinds of scenarios \u2014 for example, an AV reacting to another car cutting into its lane in heavy traffic during a foggy night on wet roads.\n\nThey can run the same test under other conditions simultaneously, completing months or years of testing in a fraction of the time.\n\nDuring a demonstration at this week's Nvidia GTC conference, I joked with a company engineer that he was playing God each time he hit a switch to change the driving conditions.\n\nWaymo has driven more miles than anyone \u2014 10 million on real roads and 7 billion on virtual roads, using its own simulation technology \u2014 but even that's not enough, based on research by the Rand Corporation, a policy think tank.\n\nAVs would have to be driven hundreds of millions of miles and sometimes hundreds of billions of miles to demonstrate their reliability in terms of fatalities and injuries, per Rand.\n\nUnder even aggressive testing assumptions, it would take tens and sometimes hundreds of years to drive these miles with existing fleets.\n\nDevelopers \"cannot simply drive their way to safety,\" the report found.\n\nI heard a lot about simulation this week in Silicon Valley from all the major AV companies.\n\n\"You have to lean into simulation to create these scenarios you never saw in the real world \u2014 but you might have,\" Sterling Anderson, co-founder of Aurora Innovation, told me.\n\nSimulation also gives developers the confidence to tackle edge cases that are too dangerous to test in the real world.\n\nThe catch: The simulation has to be a faithful representation of what would have happened in the actual vehicle. If the timing is off by even a micro-second, it can change the outcome, Anderson said.\n\nThe bottom line: Real-world testing still matters, as I learned riding around San Francisco and Silicon Valley this week in a variety of test AVs. Every on-road encounter unlocks new scenarios for developers to manipulate virtually in search of the perfect driver."

She offered a couple examples:\n\nThe partnership announced last year between Renault and Brazilian homebuilding giant MRV Engenharia e Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. on EV sharing and charging. Late last year Ford bought the electric scooter startup Spin.\n\nBetween the lines: Auto industry partnerships are hardly new, but \"collaborations are accelerating,\" according to Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs.\n\nOne big reason? The high cost of developing EV and AV tech. \u201cIt is so expensive. Nobody knows when there is going to be a return on these investments or when these technologies will really take off,\u201d she said.\n\nJeremy Carlson, an autonomous driving analyst with the consultancy IHS Markit, offered a similar take. He notes that right now AV and EV tech is a mixture of:\n\nComplex tech, including new software needs.\n\nHigh development costs.\n\nRelatively low business volume right now but with high potential.\n\nThe bottom line: Add it all up (and throw in shared mobility) and you have risk, which breeds collaboration.\n\n\"Not only does that create more close relationships and partnerships between automakers and suppliers, but we\u2019re also seeing more automakers getting together for similar reasons,\" Carlson said in an email.\n\nEditor's note: This piece was updated to reflect Valerie Sathe Brugeman's title change to assistant director for transportation systems."

Research has shown that it can be manipulated in a way that's invisible to the human eye, but still changes the result of an AI system's diagnosis from cancerous to non-cancerous.\n\nThe big question: Why would anyone want to do this?\n\nFor Samuel Finlayson, an MD\u2013PhD candidate at Harvard and MIT and the lead author of the new paper, it\u2019s a question of incentives. If someone sending in data for analysis has a different goal than the owner of the system doing the analysis, there's a potential for funny business.\n\nWe're not talking about a malicious doctor manipulating cancer diagnoses \u2014 \"There's way more effective ways to kill a person,\" Finlayson says \u2014 but rather an extension of existing dynamics into a near future where AI is involved in billing, diagnosis, and reading medical scans.\n\nDoctors and hospitals already game the insurance billing system \u2014 these could be considered proto-adversarial attacks, Finlayson tells Axios.\n\nThey often bill for more expensive procedures than they performed, in order to make more money, or avoid billing for procedures that they know will land a huge bill in the patient's lap.\n\nInsurance companies are already hiring tech firms to put a stop to the practice, often with AI tools. Finlayson sees a future where basic adversarial attacks are used to fool the AI systems into continuing to accept fraudulent claims.\n\nDespite this possibility, hospitals and the pharma industry are flying blind, he says. \"Adversarial attacks aren't even on the map for them.\"\n\nBut, but, but: These hypotheticals are a bit far-fetched for Matthew Lungren, associate director of the Stanford Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging.\n\n\"There are a lot of easier ways to defraud the system, frankly,\" he tells Axios.\n\nBut there is an urgent need, Lungren says, to test medical AI systems more rigorously before they're released into the world.

Worth noting: Just below Putin in the rankings are Rwanda\u2019s Paul Kagame (18 years), Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad (18) and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan (16).\n\nBetween the lines: As regular readers may have picked up on, I\u2019m fascinated by what Putin\u2019s next move might be when he runs up against constitutional term limits in 2024.\n\nThere\u2019s speculation he might form a union with Belarus (whose president, Alexander Lukashenko, is also high on this list) and place himself in charge.\n\nNazarbayev offers a different path, and one Putin will surely be watching closely.\n\nSimply ceding power wasn't an attractive option but, as Carnegie Moscow's Alexander Gabuev points out, \"if you want to keep your loved ones free, alive and wealthy, dying in office isn't an option.\"\n\nInstead, Nazarbayev weakened the presidency and empowered the security council, which he still leads, then elevated his daughter to a powerful post second in line to the presidency.\n\nGabuev cites Singapore's former prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, as Nazarbayev's model. He made way for his son, Lee Hsien Loong, who is now 21st on our list after 14 years in power.\n\nIn the Russian case, Alina Polyakova of Brookings argued recently that there is likely no successor who could guarantee the safety of Putin, his family and his assets. She expects some testing of public opinion through state TV ahead of whatever Putin's next move may be.\n\nKeir Giles of Chatham House thinks Putin almost certainly has a succession plan in mind already and predicts that Putinism will long outlast Putin. He warns: \"Change in Russia is not always change, and it's certainly not always positive.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Africa is home to half of the 24 longest-serving leaders and 5 of the top 7. There are two major reasons Africa\u2019s longtime leaders have been able to retain power, according to Council on Foreign Relations analysis:\n\n\u201cMilitary coups were once common as a means to seize power, with both [Equatorial Guinea's] Mbasogo and [Uganda's Yoweri] Museveni entering their presidencies this way. ... [T]here were 27 successful coups from 1970 to 1982, but only 12 from 2000 to 2012, and just the one against [Zimbabwe\u2019s Robert] Mugabe since then.\n\nwere once common as a means to seize power, with both [Equatorial Guinea's] Mbasogo and [Uganda's Yoweri] Museveni entering their presidencies this way. ...

Some of the material has wound up orbiting Bennu as satellites before settling back down on its surface.\n\n\u201cThe discovery of plumes is one of the biggest surprises of my scientific career,\u201d said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona, Tucson. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the mechanism that is causing this right now,\" he said.\n\nFrom distant observations, Bennu appeared to have a mostly flat surface with some large boulders.\n\nHowever, close-up views showed Bennu's surface is rather rough, with at least 200 boulders of at least 33 feet wide.\n\nThis means the team has to re-evaluate its plans for how to safely land on the asteroid and collect samples from its surface.\n\nOne cool thing: Scientists have identified magnetite on Bennu's surface, which is indicative of interactions between rock and liquid water, most likely on the parent body that the asteroid spun off from.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the first discoveries of Japan's Hayabusa2 mission to the asteroid Ryugu were revealed in a series of studies published in Science on Tuesday."

    "text": "Background: While adult males can undergo successful cryopreservation of their sperm before their treatments start, prepubescent males' stem cells haven't yet gained the ability to turn into sperm.\n\nHowever, several centers around the world have started preserving testicular or ovarian tissues for children undergoing chemotherapy or radiation in anticipation that new therapies will be developed. This includes UPMC in Pittsburgh, which is the base of operations for study author Kyle Orwig.\n\n\"... In our research laboratory, we are committed to responsibly [developing] the next generation of reproductive therapies that will allow our patients to use their tissues to produce eggs or sperm and have biological children,\" Orwig tells Axios.\n\nWhat they did: Over a 2-year period, the research team removed and froze testicular tissue from 5 young rhesus macaques, and implanted the tissue back into the monkeys once they reached puberty.\n\nThey also implanted a comparison set of fresh, unfrozen samples, and a few months later tested for sperm.\n\nWhat they found: Both the fresh and frozen tissue had successfully and safely produced sperm.\n\nWhen the sperm from the frozen tissue were used to fertilize 138 eggs, 41% developed into embryos.\n\nThe scientists transferred 11 embryos into female macaques and one became pregnant and had a baby monkey, named Grady.\n\n\"It was important to demonstrate that this would work with frozen and thawed tissues because young cancer patients may need to keep their tissues in cryo-storage for years or even decades before they return to use those tissues to have a child,\" Orwig says.\n\nThese results bring hope to young boys that they could later become fathers using their own sperm, says Susan Taymans, who oversees the funding provided by HHS' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which helped pay for this research.\n\n\"This is an important quality of life issue. Surviving cancer is of course the primary concern, but having survived, patients naturally want a normal healthy life, which includes having the option to father a child,\" Taymans tells Axios.\n\nMonica Laronda, assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University's School of Medicine who was not part of this study, says this work shows \"promising results\" and was an important step \"for moving this research into the clinic.\"\n\nYes, but: More research is needed that more closely replicates the procedures humans undergo to see if it would work as well in people, and to determine if there's a risk of the transplant causing a recurrence of the cancer."

So far, a large proportion of them \u2014 53% \u2014 are new to science.\n\n\"The authors of this study are going to have a huge job on their hands just describing these alone,\" Allison Daley of the University of Lusanne, who was not involved in the new research, tells Axios.\n\nThe study, published Thursday in the journal Science, says it's possible the site contains more biodiversity than all other similar fossil sites from the Cambrian period.\n\n\"It is a huge surprise to find a new deposit of such incredible richness and with such a large proportion of species that are completely new to science.\"\n\n\u2014 Robert Gaines of Pamona University\n\nLike other Cambrian fossil sites, the majority of creatures here are soft-bodied \u2014 like fossil cnidarians, including jellyfish and sea anemones, both of which exist close to the base of the animal family tree, according to Gaines.\n\n\u201cThese fossils are among the best fossils I\u2019ve ever seen in my career,\" Daley says, noting that fossils at the Qingjiang site include soft tissues, eyes and internal organs.\n\nThe bevy of new life forms that first showed up during the Cambrian explosion include creatures that are related to modern animals, but would be utterly unrecognizable if you came across them today. Scientists have been trying to put each creature in its proper evolutionary context, and the new findings may help.\n\nThe site appears to have been located in an area that had environmental conditions that differ from some of the other Cambrian fossil deposit sites.\n\nAccording to Gaines, the Qingjiang site shows that differences among fossil assemblages can be caused by environmental conditions that influence ecosystem structure.\n\nOne cool thing: Many of the Cambrian creatures were truly bizarre-looking.\n\nMany had four or five eyes.\n\nSome, like the Hallucigenia, had a head that closely resembled its tail, and were characterized by spikes sticking out from its back.\n\nMost invertebrates that emerged during this period were small \u2014 though there were some that went against this trend, like the Anomalocaris, or \"abnormal shrimp,\" which measured 3 feet in length.\n\nThe bottom line: Gaines says a central lesson from the Cambrian explosion is that it takes a rare combination of ingredients to produce a tremendous diversity of life forms, and that once it exists, such biodiversity should be preserved."

One caveat is that Trump's policies have worsened income inequality and raised prices, which a savvy opponent will be able to use to their advantage."

Just ask Tesla, where an employee passed over for promotion sent trade secrets to competitors last year.\n\n\"Sometimes the people who don't get treated well or don't get promotions or are tired of being seen as the IT geeks, they can really cause the most damage,\" said O'Neill. \"So it really behooves you to take care of those people.\"\n\nAs in Hanssen's case, the biggest threats are the people with the most access, not necessarily the people with the highest status.\n\nTrust, but verify: The FBI knew that someone in the government was leaking secrets to the Russians. But during their investigations, the agency refused to look internally for the mole.\n\n\"It was a psychological flaw, willful blindness making the FBI so sure it was a CIA person that we didn't see that the guy was someone in the room with knowledge of these cases,\" said O'Neill.\n\nThat's a block many organizations have when looking for insider threats. It's hard to doubt your own employees, and hard for employees to accept being viewed as a threat.\n\nWith Hanssen, that meant actively ignoring warning signs, including a tip that Hanssen's wife had found a suspect pile of cash in their home.\n\n\"My favorite thing to ask people is 'When do you think was the first time Hanssen, a 25-year vet of the FBI, was polygraphed?'\" said O'Neill, noting that the FBI required a lie detector test every 5 years.\n\nThe answer is that he was never given a lie detector until after he was arrested.\n\nWhat's needed: There are ways to thread the needle and guard against insider betrayal without destroying trust between management and staff.\n\n\"You have to make everyone feel like they are part of the process rather than being watched,\" said O'Neill.\n\nThat means telling people to be on the lookout for abnormal behavior. \"If someone has a problem, it's not just their problem,\" he said.\n\nAuditing networks for the removal of files or other strange activity is a non-invasive way of spotting trouble.\n\nSegmenting networks \u2014 keeping data that doesn't need to be connected in separate compartments \u2014 and pruning unnecessary network access can limit exposure.\n\nEditor's note: This piece was corrected to show Hanssen's run ended early 2001 (not December 2000)."

He said a detailed platform is still weeks away, but offered some clues.\n\nTakeaways:\n\n1. Inslee offered hints that his climate and energy platform won't be constructed around a single big idea analogous to Medicare for All. Instead look for a constellation of policies.\n\n\"Here\u2019s some news: There is not one silver bullet on this,\" he told the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE).\n\nInslee cited several things enacted or proposed in his state and elsewhere around electric vehicle targets, a clean transportation fuels standard, \"net-zero\" buildings, and more.\n\n\"I don't think we should take carbon pricing off the table, but whether I propose it or not, that remains to be seen,\" he said onstage. (Carbon fee ballot measures have twice failed in his state.)\n\n2. His comments on the filibuster suggest a lot of his platform will require legislation, not just administrative action.\n\n\"I don't believe you can really be serious about saying you are going to defeat climate change unless you realize that we need to have the filibuster go the way of history,\" he told reporters.\n\n3. Inslee's basic jobs message is that what he's calling for is already happening \u2014 the country just needs more of it.\n\n\"I've got a shiny blue General Motors all-electric Bolt charging in my driveway made by American workers in Michigan. That is a pretty good vision for the United States,\" he said at the event.\n\n4. Inslee places more emphasis on the role of the private sector than some advocates of the GND, although he praises the concept. The resolution itself focuses huge public-sector investments and financing tools to a very rapid scale-up of zero-carbon energy and climate-friendly infrastructure and industrial practices.\n\n\"I think sometimes it's easy for folks to forget what is by far the largest driver and provider of equity and entrepreneurial skills, and labor skills, and intellectual talent. It is the private sector,\" Inslee said (although those remarks weren't made in relation to the GND).\n\n\"I think the most important public policy aspect is to create a demand for these products,\" he added.\n\n\"Once you can show a demand, a steady-state demand for your products and services, that is going to help have capital flow into this industry,\" he told ACORE.\n\nMy thought bubble: That sounds a lot like the rationale for policies like clean power targets that lots of states have imposed and federal lawmakers \u2014 like Inslee, a former congressman who's worked on climate problems for decades \u2014 have unsuccessfully pushed nationally.\n\nBut, but, but: \"We do have to have massive new investments in the public sector,\" Inslee later clarified to reporters.\n\n\"We do need massive public infrastructure investment, but we'll need more massive private equity which will really drive the development of a lot of this technology and infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nAnd his message doesn't flatly collide with the GND per se. This primer from the pro-GND think tank Data for Progress has similar things to say about policy goals that move private capital.\n\nGo deeper:"

Stocks fell from their highs of the day \u2014 the S&P 500 dropped from above 2,850, which it had touched for the first time since October \u2014 after the news.\n\n\"The markets have priced in the trade-war resolution, so if there's any chance this gets extended, delayed or changed, this causes markets to be jittery,\" Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management, told Bloomberg yesterday.\n\nRemember: China isn't paying the tariffs. U.S. businesses and consumers are. Tariffs are \"a consumption tax ... they hurt the economy,\" as Trump's former economic adviser Gary Cohn pointed out earlier this month.\n\nThe bottom line: While it now looks to be on shakier ground, an agreement between the U.S. and China on trade would be just the first step in a much longer negotiation process. NAFTA began as a proposal by Ronald Reagan in 1979 and was signed by President Bill Clinton, so the market is likely in for more surprises and more tariffs in the meantime.\n\nGo deeper: Investors bet on China beyond the trade war"

Fed funds futures prices show investors see a greater than 35% chance the Fed cuts rates this year and a 0% chance it raises them.\n\nWhat to watch: The yield curve has been inverted for some time out to 5 years, with maturities from 1-month to 3 years holding higher yields than the 5-year note.\n\nEditor's note: The headline was corrected due to a change made in the editing process to indicate the yield curve is on verge of inversion."

The state requires kindergarteners be vaccinated for chickenpox, but parents can cite religious exemptions or share evidence that their child already had the disease."

Sentiment surveys like these are watched closely because of their forward-looking nature, which could hint at what's ahead for the economy. If companies do rein in plans for hiring and spending \u2014 key drivers of growth \u2014 it could have big implications for an economy that's already feared to be slowing."

    "title": "The ratio of warm and cold temperature records is increasingly skewed",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "As the average global temperature increases due to human-caused global warming, the ratio between warm temperature and cold temperature records in the U.S. is increasingly skewed toward heat milestones, an Associated Press analysis shows.\n\nThe big picture: The analysis, shared with Axios, indicates that the biggest contributor to the trend is the rapidly shrinking number of cold records, although the extreme heat events are also becoming more common and severe.\n\nWhy it matters: The way we experience global warming is largely through extreme events, from heat waves to heavy precipitation events to wildfires. The fact that extreme cold records are getting more rare is one of the trends that's becoming clear to people.\n\nBackground: AP shared an analysis of warm temperature records versus cold records since 1920 within the Lower 48 states. The data consists of daily high maximum temperature records as well as daily low minimum temperature records set at a subset of 424 stations from the U.S. Historical Climate Network.\n\nContext: Global warming, by raising average surface temperatures, is making high maximum temperatures easier to set than low temperature milestones. This shift is particularly visible when looking at decadal averages.\n\nAP reports: \"Since 1999, the ratio has been two warm records set or broken for every cold one. In 16 of the last 20 years, there have been more daily high temperature records than low.\"\n\nIn a stable climate (one that is not warming or cooling significantly overall), one would expect that ratio to be closer to 1:1.\n\nA caveat: The analysis does not capture the increase in record warm overnight low temperatures, which is one hallmark of climate change and contributes to more dangerous heat waves, since warm overnight temperatures prevent the human body from cooling down.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"In a world without human-caused climate change, the rounds of record cold and record warm air would balance out over time,\" says Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, a climate research and news organization.\n\n\"That's not what's happening. Record warmth is far outpacing record cold. In fact, that's one of the reasons this winter's polar vortex was newsworthy, we just don't get record cold as often or intensely as we used to,\" she tells Axios.\n\n\"People often have a hard time feeling and visualizing a rise in average temperature, but extremes and records smack you in the face. The extremes are what reshape lives \u2014 change camp and sports practice schedules, interrupt and stress outdoor work (from farms to construction), require cooling centers, increase heat-related illnesses, and sometimes even lead to death,\" she adds.\n\nOther scientists Axios contacted said the ratio of warm to cold temperature records is not an intuitive indicator of climate change over time, though it's tied to increasing average temperatures.\n\nGo deeper:"

But in the limited time since we arrived, we\u2019ve focused on trying to understand the situation and needs in this city, as there are some 500,000 people who live here and most houses are damaged or destroyed.\n\n\u2014 Gert Verdonck, Doctors Without Borders' emergency coordinator in Beira, Mozambique\n\nDetails: The warnings from aid groups and governments grew more urgent on Tuesday as the massive scope of the disaster became clear. For example, UNICEF warned that the damage to water and sanitation infrastructure will bring great risk of water-born diseases and limit access to safe drinking water. The organization is hoping to raise $20.3 million to support relief efforts.\n\nThe European Commission announced it will release an emergency aid package of about $4 million to the countries affected by Idai. Zimbabwe's treasury is already planning to release $50 million for emergency infrastructure restoration.\n\nNullis said the storm could rank at the top of the deadliest weather disasters list if the figures coming from Mozambique's government and aid groups turn out to be true.\n\n\"We have to be careful with figures and different databases \u2014 and also whether all flooding deaths are related to the cyclone. We are not trying to compare it to slow onset related climate disasters, like El Ni\u00f1o triggered droughts,\" she added.\n\nThe state of play: It's been difficult to fully assess the damage and number of casualties in Mozambique because communication lines are down and many main roads have been destroyed.\n\nContext: Mozambique does occasionally get struck by tropical cyclones. Typically, the presence of the large and rugged island of Madagascar to the east of Mozambique weakens such storms before they hit the country. However, in this case, Idai was able to intensify rapidly in between Madagascar and Mozambique due to light wind shear aloft and warm ocean waters.\n\nWhile studies do show climate change-related trends in tropical cyclone intensity and rainfall amounts in parts of the world, the role climate change may have played in this disaster has not yet been analyzed.\n\nBecause of warmer ocean waters and air temperatures globally, storms are able to dump higher amounts of rainfall than they did several decades ago \u2014 with such trends expected to continue.\n\nHowever, with this storm, the biggest factor driving up the death toll is the vulnerability of the region, given the relatively poor population and weak infrastructure that is unable to withstand powerful winds and prolonged, heavy rainfall.\n\nA rescue team working to distribute supplies.

    "title": "ACLU reaches settlement with Facebook over discriminatory ads",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Background: A series of investigative reports over the past two years have uncovered ways that users can abuse Facebook's ad platform in order to discriminate against some populations, mainly people of color, when it comes to certain marketing for certain opportunities, like housing, employment or credit.\n\nFollowing the reports, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) filed a complaint against Facebook Friday under the Fair Housing Act, charging that the social network allows advertisers to illegally discriminate in housing ads by excluding some groups from seeing the ads.\n\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) filed a complaint against Facebook Friday under the Fair Housing Act, charging that the social network allows advertisers to illegally discriminate in housing ads by excluding some groups from seeing the ads. Shortly after, Facebook removed over 5,000 ad-targeting options to prevent that capability.\n\nFacebook removed over 5,000 ad-targeting options to prevent that capability. In September, the ACLU and its law firm, representing the Communications Workers of America and several individual job seekers, filed charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Facebook and a number of employers, alleging that they had unlawfully discriminated against certain populations via their ad targeting platform.\n\nThe details: As part of the settlement, Facebook will pay $5 million to several groups, including the ACLU, the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) and Communications Workers of America (CWA). It will also take three new steps to prevent advertisers from engaging in unlawful discrimination around employment, housing, and credit ads on Facebook and its subsidiaries (Instagram, Whatsapp, Messenger, etc.).\n\nFacebook is creating a new advertising process, specifically for marketers that are purchasing ads around employment, housing and credit. The new process will guide ad buyers through a separate portal that will certify that advertisers understand the policies and legal specifications around targeting population segments. As part of this process, Facebook is further cutting the number of options advertisers can use to target ads. Facebook will set up an archive for housing ads, which could be similar to the ad archive it built around politics. Once built, anyone searching for a housing ad in the U.S. will be able to search all housing ads active on Facebook, regardless of whether the ads are targeting that specific person. Facebook will start testing this feature by the end of the year. Facebook says it will continue to roll out education and certification requirements globally around all of its advertising policies.\n\nThe big picture: Unlike television or radio, internet platforms that sell ads aren't regulated. Lawsuits and media pressure have forced platforms to become more transparent about how their ad platforms work and take additional steps to prevent abuse by bad actors.\n\nOur thought bubble: Facebook and other tech companies will likely continue to innovate around ad transparency and fairness as more examples of abuse are uncovered."

After a two years of rocky headlines following its March 2017 IPO, Snap heads into the Summit with some positive press behind it.\n\nSnap stock jumped 12% last week on rare upgrades from Jefferies and BTIG's Rich Greenfield \u2014 mostly due to stabilized ad growth \u2014 and has seen its stock roughly double since its lowest-point in December.\n\nWhile Facebook struggles with privacy lawsuits and PR nightmares, Evan Spiegel looks prescient for his focus on ephemerality and private communication since the start of Snapchat.\n\nThe company has received positive press for its new Chief Business Officer, Amazon advertising sales vet Jeremi Gorman, who told Adweek last week that she plans to overhaul Snapchat's ad business.\n\nDon't forget: Snapchat recently lost its content chief Nick Bell, who departed to join startup incubator Human Ventures. The content production team is now led by Sean Mills.\n\nWhat's next? Snap also plans to unveil a gaming platform, according to a Cheddar report on Friday. Tencent, one of China's biggest gaming companies, purchased a 10% stake in the company in 2017, which sources say have helped guide Snapchat's foray into gaming.\n\nOur thought bubble: Snapchat is using its moments out of the spotlight to focus on creation and product development, which are arguably its greatest strengths."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's dancing video. But that was taken when the New York wunderkind was in college and ostensibly an adult.\n\nBy the numbers: Because of the age of candidates and the age of Facebook, we haven't seen many instances of high school hijinks coming back to haunt candidates for federal office. But that will change.\n\n2018 was the first election in history where someone with access to Facebook in high school was elected to federal office. That honor is split between Reps. Katie Hill, Abby Finkenauer and Ocasio-Cortez. (Facebook only started to allow kids 13 and up to join the service in 2006; it was previously limited to college students.)\n\nWhile the trio would have had access to Facebook, social media wasn't yet the pervasive force we know today. That shifted around 2012, when Facebook crossed the 1 billion visitors a month mark and smartphones became ubiquitous.\n\nBased on a back-of-napkin calculation, 85% of the Democratic nominees are 44 years old or older. Someone who was 13 in 2012 will be 44 years old in 2043.\n\nO'Rourke, who wrote essays shared to the Cult of the Dead Cow dial-up bulletin boards as \"Psychedelic Warlord,\" told an Iowa crowd, \"I'm mortified to read it now, incredibly embarrassed, but I have to take ownership of my words.\"\n\nTeenaged O'Rourke wrote and posted a short story that included his running over children with a car.\n\nHe also crudely railed against women he saw as punk rock posers, unlike real punks like him.\n\nTo be sure: We assume a public record of juvenilia will harm candidates, but it could just as easily humanize them. Beto's supporters are already pitching him as one candidate who won't get hacked by Russia.\n\nGo deeper on O'Rourke and the Cult of the Dead Cow and how that era's hackers grew into government service."

A blockchain-based system could verify not only whether those goals have been reached, but also how their achievement contributes to global progress.\n\nAnother essential application is tracking climate finance flows. Whether at the global, national, firm or household level, blockchain can verify products, services and distributors in energy and agricultural industries. Owing to its open nature, blockchain can also reduce costs associated with complex supply chains and connect disparate markets.\n\nYes, but: Blockchain isn\u2019t a silver bullet, and consumes a great deal of energy itself.\n\nDefining the metrics for impacts, on both emissions and costs, will be technically and politically complicated. Tracking and comparing adaptation approaches will be particularly challenging, as they are highly local and context-specific.\n\nCreating such a system on a global scale presents considerable legal and governance challenges.\n\nThere is little that technology can do to solve regulatory and institutional challenges or a lack of political ambition.\n\nWhat to watch: There is already momentum to bring blockchain to climate policy, with pioneers testing out peer-to-peer systems for energy trading, marine fuels, renewable energy credits (RECs), and carbon credit tokenization.\n\nAlzbeta Klein is the director for climate business at the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group."

For instance, reliance on the economic benchmark deserves part of the blame for the 2008 financial crisis, according to a 2009 report from a commission led by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz.\n\nIf economists had been watching other metrics, too, like indebtedness, they would have had an earlier warning of trouble ahead, the commission wrote.\n\nAmong the proposed alternatives:\n\nIn the early 1990s, a \"green GDP,\" developed at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, suggested that the mining sector's positive impact on the economy was being overstated. A congressman from the coal mining state of West Virginia led the successful drive to squash this attempt, its former director told NPR in 2004.\n\ndeveloped at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, suggested that the mining sector's positive impact on the economy was being overstated. A congressman from the coal mining state of West Virginia led the successful drive to squash this attempt, its former director told NPR in 2004. In 2016, a measure of contentment, akin to Bhutan's \"gross national happiness\" score, was boosted by USC economist Richard Easterlin.\n\nakin to Bhutan's \"gross national happiness\" score, was boosted by USC economist Richard Easterlin. In 2018, an \"extended GDP,\" suggested by University of Maryland's Charles Hulten and Leonard Nakamura of the Philadelphia Fed, would have captured more spending on the internet.\n\nThe latest proposal comes from a group of economists including MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson. In a forthcoming working paper, they propose a measure called GDP-B, adding in the benefits of free digital goods and new technology.\n\nThey estimate that hidden benefits from Facebook alone have added 0.05\u20130.11 percentage points to GDP every year since its 2004 launch. That would have totaled 1.54 percentage points from 2003 to 2017 \u2014 a result \"too large to be ignored,\" according to Hulten, who was not involved in this research.\n\nHow it works: The economists ran experiments in which they offered people varying sums of money to stay off of Facebook for a month, then extrapolated its total value based on the average amount people accepted. This is the willingness to pay test, a method for determining the hidden value of something that\u2019s free.\n\nThe economists ran experiments in which they offered people varying sums of money to stay off of Facebook for a month, then extrapolated its total value based on the average amount people accepted. This is the willingness to pay test, a method for determining the hidden value of something that\u2019s free. Right now, when an old-school product gives way to a digital substitute, only half of the trade-off shows up in GDP, says Avinash Collis, an MIT researcher who co-authored the GDP-B paper. The decline of landlines is captured, for example, but the rise of its replacement \u2014 social media and free messaging apps \u2014 is not.\n\nWhat's next: GDP has solidly hung on despite its critics, but Hulten, who advises the Bureau of Economic Analysis, says the body is now again considering alternatives. \"Agencies are very aware of the need to change,\" he says, but are burdened with a busy schedule \u2014 plus many decades of inertia.\n\nBut, but, but: Some economists are skeptical of the degree of angst over GDP.\n\nFree goods aren't totally unmeasured by GDP, says Laurence Ales, a Carnegie Mellon economist. When Facebook pays salaries, makes a profit, or sells ad placements, all that money is accounted for, he says.\n\nGo deeper: The trouble with GDP (The Economist)"

    "text": "Data: Adapted from a Bully Pulpit interactive chart; Chart: Axios Visuals\n\n\"The worldview from the Trump campaign is different than anything we've ever seen,\" says Michael Beach, CEO of marketing analytics firm Cross Screen Media and a veteran of Republican presidential ad campaigns.\n\nThe Trump campaign is led by digital vet Brad Parscale, whose home field is analytics and audience targeting.\n\n\"Spend can only scale with strong performance. We have an experienced team, still together from 2016,\" a senior member of the Trump 2020 team tells Axios' Jonathan Swan. \"But most of all, we have Donald Trump and nothing scales and converts like Trump,\"\n\nBe smart: While Democrats need to woo early donors with proof of momentum, President Trump needs to drive support from his base.\n\n\"The Trump campaign has built a low-dollar fundraising machine that makes hoarding cash less of a priority,\" says Beach. \"Adding votes, whether through persuasion or engagement, trumps cash-on-hand reports.\u201d\n\nThis allows the Trump campaign to focus on spending the money it's been able to accumulate during the past two years, while Democrats like Beto O'Rourke and Bernie Sanders focus their efforts on raising money for big future ads buys.\n\nWhen it comes to targeting, both parties' campaigns are currently spending most dollars nationally. But their goals and strategies are very different.\n\nTrump is running a heavy national blanket with small targeted buys in states like Florida.\n\nDemocrats are focused on building a national base of supporters and donors, not early state campaigning yet, according to the data.\n\nBy the numbers: Trump is outspending the top-spending Democratic candidates (Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris) 9-to-1 when it comes to total advertising spend on Google and Facebook so far.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented level of investment this early, and especially from an incumbent President,\" says Mike Schneider, partner at Bully Pulpit Interactive.\n\n\"Trump has spent at least $13 million in digital media since May 2018, and over $4.5 million in 2019 alone,\" says Schneider.\n\nThe Facebook ad spend by all candidates is far-outpacing Google ad spend, according to the data. Overall, all candidates are spending roughly 3 times as much on Facebook ads than on Google ads. The Trump campaign is investing even more heavily on Facebook, spending 3.5 times as much there as on it is on Google.\n\n\"If you want to reach actual voters, you have to go where they are and they're all still on Facebook and it's subsidiaries (Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger),\" says Jessica Alter, co-founder of Tech for Campaigns, a permanent digital arm for progressive and centrist campaigns.\n\nThe big picture: Trump's Facebook influence won't be limited to ad spend. Even though Facebook has experienced a major backlash since the 2016 election, data from news analytics companies suggests that the same organic media trends that propelled Trump's base on Facebook in 2016 are still prevalent leading up to 2020.\n\nNational political stories thrive on Facebook , according to data from news analytics company Parse.ly. Since February, almost 28% of all traffic referrals (direct and indirect) to articles about politics, law and government came from Facebook. By comparison, just 9% came from Google.\n\n, according to data from news analytics company Parse.ly. Since February, almost 28% of all traffic referrals (direct and indirect) to articles about politics, law and government came from Facebook. By comparison, just 9% came from Google. Partisan news sources also thrive on Facebook. Fox News is the most popular news outlet on Facebook so far in 2019, according to a new report from Newswhip, which measures social engagement. Right-wing publishers like The Daily Wire, Daily Mail and Breitbart almost made the cut, as well as some left-leaning outlets.\n\nThe bottom line: \"Trump's digital sophistication was one of the most over-reported stories of the 2016 election cycle,\" says Bully Pulpit's Schneider. \"Trump'\u2019s digital head start in the 2020 cycle is one of the most under-reported stories.\""

For instance, reliance on the economic benchmark deserves part of the blame for the 2008 financial crisis, according to a 2009 report from a commission led by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz.\n\nIf economists had been watching other metrics, too, like indebtedness, they would have had an earlier warning of trouble ahead, the commission wrote.\n\nAmong the proposed alternatives:\n\nIn the early 1990s, a \"green GDP,\" developed at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, suggested that the mining sector's positive impact on the economy was being overstated. A congressman from the coal mining state of West Virginia led the successful drive to squash this attempt, its former director told NPR in 2004.\n\ndeveloped at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, suggested that the mining sector's positive impact on the economy was being overstated. A congressman from the coal mining state of West Virginia led the successful drive to squash this attempt, its former director told NPR in 2004. In 2016, a measure of contentment, akin to Bhutan's \"gross national happiness\" score, was boosted by USC economist Richard Easterlin.\n\nakin to Bhutan's \"gross national happiness\" score, was boosted by USC economist Richard Easterlin. In 2018, an \"extended GDP,\" suggested by University of Maryland's Charles Hulten and Leonard Nakamura of the Philadelphia Fed, would have captured more spending on the internet.\n\nThe latest proposal comes from a group of economists including MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson. In a forthcoming working paper, they propose a measure called GDP-B, adding in the benefits of free digital goods and new technology.\n\nThey estimate that hidden benefits from Facebook alone have added 0.05\u20130.11 percentage points to GDP every year since its 2004 launch. That would have totaled 1.54 percentage points from 2003 to 2017 \u2014 a result \"too large to be ignored,\" according to Hulten, who was not involved in this research.\n\nHow it works: The economists ran experiments in which they offered people varying sums of money to stay off of Facebook for a month, then extrapolated its total value based on the average amount people accepted. This is the willingness to pay test, a method for determining the hidden value of something that\u2019s free.\n\nThe economists ran experiments in which they offered people varying sums of money to stay off of Facebook for a month, then extrapolated its total value based on the average amount people accepted. This is the willingness to pay test, a method for determining the hidden value of something that\u2019s free. Right now, when an old-school product gives way to a digital substitute, only half of the trade-off shows up in GDP, says Avinash Collis, an MIT researcher who co-authored the GDP-B paper. The decline of landlines is captured, for example, but the rise of its replacement \u2014 social media and free messaging apps \u2014 is not.\n\nWhat's next: GDP has solidly hung on despite its critics, but Hulten, who advises the Bureau of Economic Analysis, says the body is now again considering alternatives. \"Agencies are very aware of the need to change,\" he says, but are burdened with a busy schedule \u2014 plus many decades of inertia.\n\nBut, but, but: Some economists are skeptical of the degree of angst over GDP.\n\nFree goods aren't totally unmeasured by GDP, says Laurence Ales, a Carnegie Mellon economist. When Facebook pays salaries, makes a profit, or sells ad placements, all that money is accounted for, he says.\n\nGo deeper: The trouble with GDP (The Economist)"

Copies of the video were shared quickly and widely on other sites, including YouTube and Twitter.\n\nBetween the Lines: Facebook is being widely criticized for failing to block the footage. NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Sunday she wants answers from Facebook on how the video was able to be live-streamed. Some New Zealand business have stopped advertising on the social networking site in protest and asked businesses around the world to join the boycott, Newshub reports.\n\nThe other side: Facebook said Monday video footage of the New Zealand attacks was viewed fewer than 200 times during the live stream and 4,000 times in total before it was removed. \"The first user report on the original video came in 29 minutes after the video started, and 12 minutes after the live broadcast ended,\" it said.

But reliance on the U.S. has left gaps in capability that would, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, take at least 15 years to fill.\n\nThat\u2019s not even accounting for the political hurdles. Washington\u2019s security guarantee has papered over cracks that Moscow and Beijing would rush to expose. Removing it would \u201coverwhelm the Europeans politically, financially and militarily,\u201d said Michael R\u00fchle, a NATO official.\n\nParly paraphrased NATO\u2019s first secretary-general, Hastings \u201cPug\u201d Ismay, who quipped that NATO was designed to \u201ckeep the Russians out and the Americans in\u201d (she left out the part about keeping the Germans down).\n\nWhile President Trump has put one-half of that equation in doubt, Vladimir Putin continues to nibble away at the other.\n\nAngela Stent, author of the new book \u201cPutin\u2019s World,\u201d says the West has been flummoxed as to how a country with a GDP smaller than Italy\u2019s could play a great power role \u2014 how Vladimir Putin could invade Ukraine and deploy a nerve agent in Salisbury, England, and continue to be seen as a man with whom the world can do business.\n\nPutin is adjusting to the new global reality. China shields him from political isolation and offers him an economic lifeline. It\u2019s also a burgeoning superpower with which Russia shares a 2,600-mile border, much of it sparsely populated.\n\n\u201cThe potential China danger is something that you dare not speak its name,\u201d Stent says. She adds that the Kremlin recognizes, but would never acknowledge, that it's the junior partner in the relationship.\n\nBut while the U.S. turns its focus elsewhere, Alina Polyakova of Brookings notes, Russia is deploying trolls online and mercenaries in places like the Central African Republic: \u201cWe\u2019re not paying attention and ceding ground to a country that is relatively weak but is playing a weak hand well.\u201d\n\nEstonian President Kersti Kaljulaid, speaking at Brookings last week, expressed frustration that NATO allies are speaking in hypotheticals about conflict with Russia at a time when Moscow is occupying Crimea and flexing its cyber and disinformation capabilities:\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018This is nothing like the real thing.\u2019 It\u2019s the real thing of the 21st century.\u201d\n\nShe noted that the NATO security guarantee was not merely symbolic in Estonia and that Russia's \"hybrid\" activities are backed by conventional and nuclear capabilities. \"We've seen all this before, and none of it is good.\"\n\nParly also referenced Eastern Europe, contending that if the next flare-up was allowed to happen on NATO's turf, rather than in Georgia or Ukraine, it would signal \u201ca drastic reduction in U.S. power\" and have global repercussions.\n\nThe bottom line: China's rise poses new questions for the U.S., but it can't afford to ignore the old ones.\n\nGo deeper:"

It's not necessarily his politics that will be his downfall with these Obama/Trump and Romney/Clinton voters; it's his personality.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"I think he\u2019s a dirty crook that lies, cheats, and steals when he can,\" said George Engelmann, a 49-year-old Obama/Trump voter. \"There\u2019s just a plethora of things that are still coming out.\"\n\nAlthough Engelmann said there's nothing Trump has done politically that he disagrees with, \"I will definitely take a chance [on a Democrat]\" in 2020. \"I don't think I'll vote for Trump again.

I really wish we had a stronger third party that could actually have their hat in the ring.\"\n\n\"I didn't like Trump, like his TV shows and all that. I never liked him, but I just did really get the sense that he's going to get things done and I just like the straightforward approach that he had and still has.\"\n\n\u2014 Allison B., a 36-year-old Obama/Trump voter\n\nBetween the lines: While many of these voters are completely disenchanted with Trump, they're not excited about any of the Democratic candidates.

It has been a pleasure to work alongside each and every one of you, and I wish you all the absolute best.\n\nBe smart: All of the former Time Warner CEOs are now officially out.

Andreessen denies any such meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, another figure in the scandal, researcher Aleksandr Kogan, sued Facebook for defamation. Kogan maintains he's being made a scapegoat for Facebook's own missteps.\n\nFacebook came under intense scrutiny for the role it and other social networks played in spreading video of the Christchurch mosque shooting Friday.\n\nThe company's announcement that it pre-emptively blocked 1.2 million out of 1.5 million attempts to upload the video highlighted the magnitude of the challenge it faces. But it did little to quell concern that the company seems unable to stop its platform from being used to spread extremist violence.\n\nICYMI: All this follows what had already been an especially rough week, even for a company that has grown accustomed to negative stories. Last week saw...\n\nThe announcement that product chief Chris Cox and WhatsApp head Chris Daniels were leaving the company.\n\nFacebook's worst outage ever.\n\nThe revelation that the company is under criminal investigation for its data-sharing deals with other tech companies.\n\nThe bottom line: Facebook has been through a lot of rough weeks without losing its grip on advertisers, customers and investors, and the latest developments may not change that equation."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The intrigue: The juxtaposition was on stark display last week.\n\nI spent the first half of last week at a major oil and gas conference in Houston (CERAWeek by IHS Markit), where virtually all executives acknowledged climate change as a pressing issue and a few, including CEOs of major oil companies like BP Equinor, implored the industry to do more and embrace big policy changes.\n\nEquinor, implored the industry to do more and embrace big policy changes. The second part of the week I was back in Washington, D.C., where Republican leaders of House committees held a press conference to criticize\n\nWhere it stands: After a decade of either questioning or ignoring climate change, some Republicans are slowly beginning to discuss the issue. But for now it's mostly rhetoric and it's not enough to convince the majority of the party, and especially Trump, to change their views.\n\nTrump is considering creating a controversial panel questioning federal climate reports. A senior administration official said the government takes \"seriously the issue of climate change and it is important that policies and decision-making be based on transparent and defensible science.\"\n\nThe loudest voices in the Republican congressional caucus are those who make inflammatory or bizarre statements, such as likening the Green New Deal to genocide by explaining photosynthesis\n\nBetween the lines: Those remarks aside, a fundamental difference persists between what most Republicans say should be done about climate change versus almost all other leaders: mostly status quo with incremental bills versus more sweeping policy changes.\n\nRepublicans say what they\u2019re supporting now \u2014 relatively narrow bills on topics like carbon-capture technology nuclear power\n\nZack Roday, spokesperson for Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said: \u201cI disagree that those are minor bills \u2014 solutions that reduce emissions while expanding America\u2019s renewable energy options matter.\u201d\n\nBigger policies\n\nMatt Sparks, spokesperson for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, said: \"Conservatives are leaning into the debate on our future. ... But whether it is a carbon tax or Green New Deal, the conventional conversation in Washington today has impacts that hurt working Americans.\"\n\nAlmost everyone else says far broader policy changes are needed \u2014 including most oil and gas executives, other parts of corporate America, scientists, the United Nations, Democrats, economists, environmentalists and youth activists.\n\nThere\u2019s big disagreement about what that policy should be and how to ensure a big reduction in greenhouse gas emissions doesn\u2019t cost too much. Energy costs are traditionally regressive: hitting poorer people more.\n\nThere's certainly no consensus that it needs to be the Green New Deal, which shows how far\n\nAt the Houston conference, energy executives and other experts, including Ernest Moniz, President Obama\u2019s former energy secretary, said the proposal is unrealistic. Yet amid the criticism, there was widespread agreement the government should be acting more.\n\n\u201cI think there is a general acceptance in the energy industry that there should be some kind of pricing on carbon emissions,\u201d Charif Souki, a pioneer in the natural-gas industry and founder of Tellurian Inc., a Houston-based gas export company, told me on the sidelines of the conference.\n\nOn the Green New Deal, Souki said: \u201cThis is a bunch of aspirations. Tell me how we\u2019re going to get there and tell me how also we\u2019re going to provide electricity to a billion people who don\u2019t have it.\u201d Yet he said the debate around it is healthy: \u201cThat\u2019s part of democracy.\u201d\n\nRep. Garret Graves (R-La.), who is the top Republican on the new select committee Democrats created to discuss climate change, is looking for new bipartisan policies, according to spokesperson Kevin Roig.\n\nOne includes making changes to the Climate Change Technology Program to focus on \"technologies we can truly commercialize that will result in\u201d lower energy costs and emissions, Roig said.\n\nThat program dates to 2002 and is led by the Energy Department. Its website this 2006 report\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching: whether Republicans support new, more substantive policy, including a price on carbon emissions."

It also doesn't take into account drugs picked up at the pharmacy counter, or price decreases that may have occurred when competition for a drug first entered the market, as it looks at only one year of data.\n\nWhile some of these drugs cost mere pennies per dosage, each insurance claim can include multiple doses.\n\nInsulin delivered through a pump \u2014 which had 16 competitors \u2014 cost on average $9.45 per dosage in 2017, but the average claim was $958.65.\n\nThe bottom line: Drugs with monopoly power aren't the only ones that can raise their prices.\n\nEven with competition, \"you can\u2019t count on continual price decreases,\" said Vanderbilt's Stacie Dusetzina after reviewing the data.\n\n*Editor's note: An earlier version of this chart included colistimethate sodium, a drug with 15 beneficiaries in 2017. This chart has been updated to only include drugs with at least 300 beneficiaries in 2017."

Epstein's plea resulted in a lighter sentence in 2008 and eased his obligations to register as a sex offender.\n\nWhat they're saying: \u201cThey were cutting a plea deal. It wasn\u2019t a prosecution,\u201d the younger girl's attorney Spencer Kuvin told WashPost. \u201cThey had a grab bag of 40 girls [accusing Epstein] to choose from.\u201d\n\nWhy it matters: The Miami Herald reported in November allegations concerning a sweetheart plea deal between federal prosecutors and Epstein in which he averted federal prosecution for his participation in an international sex operation. In February, a judge ruled the prosecutors had broken the law in doing so. One of those prosecutors was Alexander Acosta \u2014 now President Trump's labor secretary. In New York this month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit signaled it was looking at unsealing documents that could elucidate more on the teen sex trafficking case, Bloomberg Law reported.\n\n\n\nGo deeper: Judge rules prosecutors broke federal law in Jeffrey Epstein case"

As we've previously reported, most of Trump's senior economic advisers \u2014 with the notable exception of Peter Navarro \u2014 think new car tariffs are a terrible idea.\n\nBut Trump tells everyone who'll listen that the threat of car tariffs is his best leverage in talks with foreign leaders.\n\nTrump's bargaining chips have expensive implications for the auto industry \u2014 and for consumers. Ford CEO James Hackett said last September that Trump's steel tariffs would cost the automaker about $1 billion in profits.\n\nNew tariffs would hurt auto suppliers, car dealers and U.S. factories that depend on global supply chains.\n\nToyota, which promises to spend $13 billion to expand U.S. manufacturing by 2021, warns that Trump's tariffs would raise the price of a U.S.-built Camry by $1,600.\n\n\"There are 137,000 Americans who design, build, sell and maintain American-built Toyota vehicles. They deserve to know if they\u2019re a security threat. And consumers need to know if their costs for American-made vehicles are going to go up.\"\n\n\u2014 James Lentz, CEO, Toyota Motor North America\n\nOver the past two years, Trump has latched onto all kinds of ideas he thought would help the car industry. But the auto industry asked for almost none of them.\n\nOne backdoor move that died: making foreign car companies adhere to higher fuel economy standards than American companies.\n\nUnwinding Obama-era fuel economy standards is popular with conservatives, but the auto industry is wary.\n\nAutomakers welcomed the regulatory review, saying Obama\u2019s higher standards would be tough to meet and didn\u2019t match consumer demands.\n\nPublicly, they say they're open to gradual increases. But privately, some welcome Trump's rollback, according to several sources.\n\nNow Trump is battling California over the issue, as the state fights to set its own stricter standards.\n\nAutomakers\u2019 top priority is ensuring the U.S. has only one nationwide standard.\n\nThe bottom line: \"There's political uncertainty everywhere you look, which is worse than any technological uncertainty because it has a chilling effect on investments,\" John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Association of Global Automakers, told Axios."

He's said he doesn't think autonomous vehicles make sense, according to four sources who've heard him discuss the subject.\n\n\"You know when he's telling a story, and he does the hand motions,\" said a source who has heard Trump talk about hypothetical accidents involving self-driving cars. \"He says, 'Can you imagine, you're sitting in the back seat and all of a sudden this car is zig-zagging around the corner and you can't stop the f---ing thing?\u2019\"\n\n\"He's definitely an automated car skeptic,\" the source said. Another source said Trump told him self-driving cars \"will never work.\"\n\nIn one of the early 2017 meetings with CEOs in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Elon Musk and Trump shared a lighthearted exchange about Tesla's \"Autopilot\" technology. Trump told Musk he preferred traditional cars, according to a source who was in the room.\n\nAnd in the summer of 2017, at his Bedminster golf club, Trump was chatting with club members when one raised the subject of AV technology. The club member was \"excited\" about a new Tesla he bought, recalled a source who was part of the conversation. \"And [Trump] was like, 'Yeah that's cool but I would never get in a self-driving car. ... I don't trust some computer to drive me around.'\"\n\nWhile Trump is in no hurry to see automated vehicles, Chao is actively promoting the technology.\n\nLast Tuesday at the SXSW conference, Chao announced a new regulatory body to speed up the adoption of cutting-edge transportation technologies like hyperloop tunnels and self-driving cars.\n\nThen on Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it would seek the public's opinion on an unprecedented idea: Should decades-old motor vehicle statutes be changed to allow cars with no steering wheels, pedals or gear shifts?\n\nThe bottom line: Currently, there are no federal regulations on self-driving cars \u2014 just a hodgepodge of state rules.\n\nEfforts to pass AV legislation stalled in the last Congress over concerns about privacy and safety. The issue will likely resurface this year, reports Axios' Joann Muller, who writes Axios' Autonomous Vehicles newsletter.\n\nAV companies say the tech is moving too fast to regulate anyway. By sharing test data, they say they could help define standards and practices themselves.\n\nFor now, companies are encouraged to file voluntary safety self-assessments each year; so far, a dozen have done so.\n\nBetween the lines: A source who has discussed autonomous vehicles with Trump says he thinks it wouldn't take much for the president to rapidly reverse his administration's hands-off approach to hands-free vehicles. Trump already calls self-driving cars out-of-control death traps, so any news fueling that fear could jolt him into action."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "In the case of the Lion Air crash in October and the Ethiopian Airlines crash last week, the information coming from the official crash investigations is focused squarely on a system built into the aircraft to prevent it from stalling, or running out of lift.\n\nAnother emerging thread from the investigation is the way that the plane \u2014 which has a total of more than 5,000 standing orders from carriers worldwide \u2014 was certified to fly in the first place.\n\nHow it works: Media outlets have been shining a spotlight on how the plane came to be approved as if it was simply another version of the best-selling 737 series, despite having so many new pieces of hardware. That includes new, more powerful engines, a redesigned tail, new wing design and more, along with complex, novel software.\n\nThe MAX\u2019s larger, more powerful engines are strapped farther forward on its wings compared to other 737 derivatives, which changed the aerodynamic characteristics of the plane and could push the nose upward in certain situations.\n\nBoeing installed software, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, to push the nose down and avoid a high speed stall. But this system gets its input from just a single angle of attack sensor mounted near the nose of the aircraft.\n\nIt's this system that is suspected of causing the two crashes, potentially due to faulty data from the angle of attack sensor.\n\nHad the MCAS compared data from both of the angle of attack sensors on the plane, it could have ignored erroneous data from one of them.\n\nContext: Despite the aerodynamic differences and new software system, many 737 pilots were not required to undergo intensive training in flight simulators, and they could instead do so on an iPad, according to the New York Times. The simulators also weren't ready when the plane began rolling out of the factory and taking to the sky.\n\nThe lack of simulator training was a selling point for the jet, since it meant airlines that already flew other versions of the 737 could save money on training.\n\nThe NYT reported that pilots at United Airlines, which flies the Boeing 737 MAX 9, were not initially trained on the MCAS system.\n\nMeanwhile: Another strand emerging from the accident investigations concerns how deferential the FAA was to Boeing in certifying the MCAS system and other aspects of the plane's certification.\n\nThe Seattle Times reports that deadline pressure prodded the FAA and Boeing to delegate more safety decisions to Boeing engineers working on behalf of the FAA. That's because across the Atlantic, Boeing's arch-rival company, Airbus, was developing a similar plane, known as the Airbus A320neo.\n\nThe Times story also shows that the original safety assessment for the MCAS system may have misstated its full capability in moving the tail of the plane, as well as how many times it could kick in before resetting.\n\nA federal grand jury issued a subpoena on March 11 to at least one person involved in the development of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft on behalf of the Justice Department, though it remains unclear if the action is related to government scrutiny of the FAA's approval of the plane's MCAS anti-stall safety system, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nWhat's next: Boeing has said it plans to roll out a fix to the MCAS software in April that should prevent a similar crash in the future. But it's likely that pilots will be briefed on it via additional personal computer training, since there is just one 737 MAX simulator available for training use in the U.S.\n\nCEO Dennis Muilenburg issued a new statement on Sunday:\n\n\"While investigators continue to work to establish definitive conclusions, Boeing is finalizing its development of a previously-announced software update and pilot training revision that will address the MCAS flight control law's behavior in response to erroneous sensor inputs.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to include the WSJ report of a federal criminal investigation.\n\nGo deeper:"

This week, the Wall Street Journal reported (and Axios later confirmed) that Goldman Sachs pulled the $100 million it initially invested in the fund. As a result, the fund's assets under management are now at an all-time low.\n\nBetween the lines: It's not uncommon for a market-maker to put in seed money when a new ETF launches and then pull that money at a later date. What's odd is that JUST launched with this much seed money in the first place.\n\nThe largest socially responsible ETFs, SUSA and DSI, launched with just $20 million and $25 million, respectively. Today, they're still small by ETF standards (SUSA is $922 million, DSI is $1.32 billion), but they're much bigger than relative newcomers like JUST and the gimmicky SHE. Both of those funds launched with great fanfare and $250 million under management; both are now significantly smaller than when they started.\n\nThe big picture, from Axios' Courtenay Brown: You can try to ensure that the ETF sponsor you choose is itself a good cause. A case in point: The sustainable-development SDGA fund, sponsored in part by the UN, which launched at just $2 million. That's a much more typical seed size for socially responsible ETFs. But an ETF that small will suffer from illiquidity and high fees.\n\nOf note: In a statement to Axios, JUST Capital CEO Martin Whittaker said the JUST ETF's remaining $100 million in assets under management is \"strong proof of the demand for this fund.\""

Such particles can cause cardiovascular problems, aggravate pre-existing conditions like asthma, and increase mortality from cancer, strokes and heart disease.\n\nWhat they did: The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, first estimates mortality from PM2.5 for the U.S. as a whole for all emission sources.\n\nNext, the researchers tied these emissions to the end-use activities and end-user parties responsible for generating this pollution.\n\nThe team compared the types of goods and services people spend their money on to the amount and geographic distribution of these activities.\n\nLastly, they compared results among racial and ethnic groups to calculate a metric known as \"pollution inequity,\" which they define as \"the extent to which groups disproportionately contribute to or bear the burden of pollution.\"\n\nMore simply, this metric is the difference between the pollution that people cause and the pollution to which they are exposed.\n\nWhat they found: The study found that the black population has a pollution inequity of 56%, while Hispanics (in this study, people of all races who are Hispanic or Latino) have a pollution inequity of 63%. The white population and other races, on the other hand, are exposed to 17% less PM2.5 pollution than they contribute and therefore enjoy a \"pollution advantage.\"\n\nThe study zeroes in on the role that the amount of personal consumption of goods and services (everything from going out to restaurants to buying a new house) plays in causing this pollution imbalance.\n\nThey found that the quantity of consumption accounts for the majority of the overall pollution imbalance between all races and ethnicities studied.\n\nMeanwhile: Exposure to PM2.5 has decreased among all ethnic groups during the 2003\u20132015 study period, which is a sign that clean air rules are succeeding. However, racial and ethnic inequities are persisting.\n\nWhat they're saying: \u201cSomeone had to make the pen you bought at the store. We wanted to look at where the pollution associated with making that pen is located. Is it close to where people live? And who lives there?\u201d said co-author Julian Marshall in a press release.\n\n\"They certainly make assumptions in their analysis that might be questioned down the line, but I doubt that the overall pattern they found will change,\" Ana Diez Roux, an epidemiologist at Drexel University who was not involved in the study, told NPR."

But it might end up being harder to root out more thoroughly.\n\nThe other side: Meanwhile, social media services continue to provide powerful organizing tools for causes that many users support, like Friday's worldwide youth protests on climate change.\n\nThe bottom line: No one has figured out how to prevent this from happening again."

Almost all of Amazon's best-selling vaccine books are by anti-vaxxers, though the company has removed some anti-vaccine documentaries from its Prime streaming service.\n\nThe anti-vaccine movement has also added political arms, with PACs in multiple Western states lobbying legislatures to maintain or expand vaccine exemptions \u2014 moves that would all but ensure future outbreaks.\n\nU.S. public health agencies have been reluctant to launch highly visible advocacy campaigns to combat anti-vaccine messaging. Meanwhile, Australia's government has launched a 12 million Australian dollar ($8.5 million) initiative.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed: Countering the anti-vaccine movement would require dismantling its media presence through a partnership between the federal government and the major social media and e-commerce platforms. In parallel, states with outbreaks underway could help stem their growth by closing non-medical vaccine exemptions.\n\nWhat to watch: The House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate HELP Committee have each held hearings on the outbreaks, but have yet to formulate new policies.

    "text": "\u201cThere are lots of entities out there ... that are willing to invest in infrastructure, and so we recognized that in order to make sure we got sufficient EV charging infrastructure out there fast enough, we were going to have to start working very actively with these companies.\"\n\n\u2014 Ableson\n\nHere are a few takeaways from our interview at the big CERAWeek by IHS Markit conference...\n\n1. New partners (maybe): Ableson reveals that GM is in discussions with more charging companies about joining an access and data-sharing initiative announced in January with 3 major networks: EVgo, ChargePoint and Greenlots.\n\nThe program is intended to provide information about station location, availability and status on the screen of recent Chevy Bolts, instead of consumers having to rely on separate phone apps for separate networks.\n\n\"We think we can take a lot of friction out of that whole experience,\" he says.\n\n2. Business model: Even in the long-term, don't look for GM to roll out its own charging network. And he doesn't think that would be a good idea for the auto industry as a whole.\n\n\"Having charge networks dedicated to a specific OEM is not the right answer long-term for society in general. We'd go nuts if you had GM gas stations and Ford gas stations and Chrysler gas stations,\" he says.\n\n3. A contrarian view: Ableson believes there's too much focus on comparing charging times to how long it takes to fill up a gasoline-powered car. That's the wrong metric, he argues.\n\nThat's because while the logistics of liquid fuels requires gas stations, charging can occur anywhere \u2014 at home, at work, while shopping and so forth.\n\n\"So what we are really interested in is, how do we get these chargers all over and ... you have the opportunity to make the experience frictionless, [with] no credit cards or anything, just plug your car in and everything resolves itself on the back end,\" he said.\n\n\"So I'm not as interested in getting down to below 10 minutes or whatever. I think a lot of that is driven because people compare back to filling stations, and I don't see that being the customer experience going forward.\"\n\nHe did note, however, that high-powered, very fast charging is relevant in some circumstances.\n\nMore from CERAWeek: Debating the future of electric vehicles in oil country"

When you \"place a bet\" that Apple's stock price will go up, you're doing the same thing.

Rather than thinking of sports betting as this criminal activity, they associate it with the idea of 'how much smarter am I than you because I did my research.'\"\n\nThe bottom line: Teenage sports fans are coming of age in a world where sports betting is being sold to them as an honest, legit and important addition to their fandom."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "After recording zero growth in the fourth quarter of 2018, narrowly avoiding back-to-back quarters of economic contraction, one of Germany\u2019s most prestigious research institutes Thursday cut its expectations for German growth this year by almost half.\n\nThe Munich-based Ifo Institute also said the pace of employment growth is decelerating. That followed data showing the country's all important manufacturing sector had significantly slowed, badly undershooting economists' expectations.\n\nThat's a major problem for Germany because exports make up about half of its GDP.\n\n\"Germany's economy is really exposed to any shifts in the international market,\" George Friedman, founder and chairman of Geopolitical Futures, tells Axios. \"You have a problem with the largest economy in Europe not really being in control of its own economy. So in that sense it's the most dangerous country in Europe because it's the most important country and incredibly vulnerable.\"\n\nThe big picture: As the driving economic and political force in the euro zone, and the world's third largest growth engine, Germany is expected to help pull its neighbors out of an economic malaise, but right now it's reflecting the broader weakness.\n\nThe 28-member bloc is facing widespread growth declines (Italy is in recession, Sweden just avoided one) and political instability from Brexit and growing anti-euro populism.\n\n\"At this point the German economy is more the victim of problems in the global economy than the cause,\" says Jeromin Zettelmeyer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nHowever, Zettelmeyer believes Germany still has some lifelines because its domestic economy remains strong and the ECB has positioned itself to help give Europe a boost. Germany could also pass fiscal stimulus, if lawmakers can agree on a bill.\n\nWhat to watch: \"If you see services slowing, consumer confidence going down significantly and payroll numbers falling, a softening of the labor market, one should start worrying more,\" Zettelmeyer tells Axios. \"The other thing to watch is how sustained is the decline in industrial production? If we see another decline in industrial production next month I would really be more worried.\""

    "text": "We saw something similar when a driverless car killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nWhy it matters: The way that Boeing and the FAA approach the latest crisis should provide a blueprint not only for the aviation industry, but also for autonomous vehicles and many other technologies taking over human decision-making \u2014 even the algorithm determining what you watch next on YouTube.\n\nOur thought bubble, from Axios editor-in-chief Nicholas Johnston: Too much computer can be anodyne, like Waze directing me off a highway when it erroneously thinks there's a jam up ahead. But it can also be a Boeing flying into the ground because it's confused about a stall.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know: The big unknowns in aviation right now:\n\nWhat caused Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 to crash on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board? Is the 737 MAX safe? Why didn't Boeing immediately ground the 737 MAX until it found out the answer to the first two questions?\n\nThe answers to the first two questions are known unknowns. We know that we don't know the answer; we can also be reasonably certain that an answer is forthcoming. The black box will be found, the aircraft's data will be retrieved (somewhere), and we will find out what went wrong.\n\nThe answer to the third question is harder, given that a safety-first reputation is the most valuable asset that Boeing possesses.\n\nWhat we do know: Pilots have registered complaints about the 737 MAX in a federal database, and they've criticized the training too. The Dallas Morning News reports that one captain called the flight manual \"inadequate and almost criminally insufficient.\"\n\nPilots have registered complaints about the 737 MAX in a federal database, and they've criticized the training too. The Dallas Morning News reports that one captain called the flight manual \"inadequate and almost criminally insufficient.\" By the numbers: Until we find out what went wrong, we have two simple fatality statistics to guide us. Air travel in general is incredibly safe, thanks to technology, but air travel on the 737 MAX is not. The plane has been flying for less than two years, and it has already crashed twice. That's unprecedented in modern aviation history.\n\nBe smart: The proof of the pudding \u2014 the reason why we know that technology has made air travel safer \u2014 is right there in the statistics. You don't need to know anything about ground proximity warning systems or wind shear alerts to know that planes have been getting safer, you can just look at the numbers.\n\nIt was reasonable to believe that the 737 MAX was safe before it crashed twice. All modern aircraft are safe. But then that assumption was tested in real-world conditions, and now it must be re-examined in the light of new evidence.\n\nBoeing said it has \"full confidence in the safety of the 737 MAX\" \u2014 before it has seen the data from the Ethiopian Airways black box, but after 346 people have died. That statement is going to make it very hard for the public and regulators to trust the company's safety statements in future.\n\nit has \"full confidence in the safety of the 737 MAX\" \u2014 before it has seen the data from the Ethiopian Airways black box, but after 346 people have died. That statement is going to make it very hard for the public and regulators to trust the company's safety statements in future. The New York Times reports that the FAA has outsourced safety designations on Boeing aircraft to Boeing's own employees, in a textbook case of regulatory capture.\n\nThis is bigger than just aviation. Technology has made cars, too, much safer over time. But it's dangerous to mindlessly extrapolate that tendency into the future.\n\nLike aircraft manufacturers, carmakers design redundant sensors and fail-safe technology into their vehicles to maximize safety, Axios' Joann Muller reports.\n\nAutomated vehicles need human monitoring, just as planes do. But without proper training and education, drivers \u2014 or pilots\u2014 are unprepared to deal with situations where something goes wrong.\n\njust as planes do. But without proper training and education, drivers \u2014 or pilots\u2014 are unprepared to deal with situations where something goes wrong. Mark Rosekind, chief safety innovation officer at Zoox, an autonomous vehicle startup, told Joann the crash sounds like another example of \u201cmode confusion\u201d \u2013 where the pilot (or the driver, in the case of an AV) doesn\u2019t understand what the machine is doing and is \u201cliterally battling the computer in the cockpit.\u201d\n\nchief safety innovation officer at Zoox, an autonomous vehicle startup, told Joann the crash sounds like another example of \u201cmode confusion\u201d \u2013 where the pilot (or the driver, in the case of an AV) doesn\u2019t understand what the machine is doing and is \u201cliterally battling the computer in the cockpit.\u201d \"We\u2019re adding complexity and technology to make it do its job better, but if you don\u2019t design around what the human is capable of doing, and their limitations, it ends up creating more risk,\u201d said Rosekind, who's also a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe bottom line: When evidence emerges that a technology is not safe, that's the time to re-examine a lot of priors about technology making us safer. That goes for planes, it goes for cars, and it even goes for social networks.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "What they did: For a new study, published in the journal Science on Thursday, an international research team determined how much carbon dioxide the oceans have been absorbing.\n\nWhat they found: The study finds that oceans have taken more than 100 billion tons of CO2 between 1994 and 2007, which is about one-third of total emissions during that period.\n\nThis shows the oceans roughly kept up with the ever-increasing rate of human-caused emissions during the 1994\u20132007 period.\n\nWhile the overall share of emissions absorbed by oceans has not changed, the rate at which they are absorbing carbon dioxide has increased fourfold between 1994 to 2007, when compared to the period from 1800 to 1994, the study found.\n\n\"If it wasn't for this uptake by the oceans, the atmospheric CO2 concentration would be as much as 480 ppm and the global atmospheric temperatures would be considerably warmer,\" study co-author Richard Feely of NOAA tells Axios.\n\n\"This means that the ocean has been providing humanity with an ecosystem service that can be valued at more than $1 trillion.\"\n\n\u2014 study co-author Nicolas Gruber of ETH Zurich tells Axios, assuming a carbon price of $10 per ton of CO2.\n\nThe research also shows that ocean acidification, which is occurring from chemical reactions as seawater absorbs CO2, is beginning to affect marine life well below the surface.\n\nSince the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean surface waters has declined by about 0.11 pH units, Feely says. The greatest decrease in pH is in the high latitudes.\n\nOcean acidification poses a major threat to calcifying organisms, such as sea butterflies and mussels, with indications that problems are already showing up in ecosystems.\n\nAnother study, published recently in Geology, provides a new long-term history of how carbon has accumulated in deep-sea sediments throughout geologic time. Carbon is absorbed this way as dead diatoms and plankton descend through the water column, accumulating slowly but steadily as \"marine snow\" on the seafloor.\n\n\"The more acidic the ocean becomes, the smaller the volume of dead carbonate plankton shells sinking through the water column that will make it to the seafloor without dissolving completely on their way down,\" study co-author Dietmar Muller tells Axios.\n\n\"In other words, we are continuously reducing the capacity of the oceans to store away atmospheric CO2 in deep-sea sediments.\""

On Tuesday, the margin was a mere 149 votes.\n\nMay has already cut a deal with the EU, which Brussels considers its final offer. That deal was defeated by the heaviest margin (230 votes) in modern U.K. history. On Tuesday, the margin was a mere 149 votes. The latest: Having overwhelmingly rejected on Wednesday the idea of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit, which would see the U.K.\u2019s trading arrangements with the EU vanish overnight, Parliament today collectively conceded that this won\u2019t get solved by March 29.\n\nHaving overwhelmingly rejected on Wednesday the idea of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit, which would see the U.K.\u2019s trading arrangements with the EU vanish overnight, Parliament today collectively conceded that this won\u2019t get solved by March 29. Between the lines: May is desperate to deliver Brexit without tearing whatever threads still hold her Conservative Party together. She\u2019s hoping fear of the unknown will lead Brexit enthusiasts in the party \u2014 who declare that her deal would spurn a historic opportunity to regain sovereignty \u2014 back into her camp. Hence, the third vote.\n\nThe big picture: This isn\u2019t just about Brexit anymore. It\u2019s a genuine political crisis. The prime minister has been repeatedly humiliated. The opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has largely been irrelevant. No one is at the wheel.\n\nWatching this week\u2019s proceedings, you could be forgiven for forgetting that the U.K. in many ways remains an economic, military and cultural power (perhaps a bold sentence for an American to write, I'll admit).\n\nThe Economist\u2019s Brexit editor, John Peet, sums it up (podcast): \u201cBritish stability has been built around the two main parties \u2026 but Brexit has cast across that stability because the bigger divide now is between those who support \u2018Remain\u2019 and those who support \u2018Leave\u2019 and both parties are split from top to bottom on this issue.\u201d\n\nThe debate goes beyond politics. \u201cBrexit is a feeling,\u201d a British former diplomat told me this week. He cited a 2017 YouGov poll that found a majority of \u201cLeave\u201d voters would support Brexit even if it damaged the economy, while just 38% said they\u2019d change their vote to save their job, or a family member\u2019s.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying:\n\n\u201cThe British have always kind of been a model for us,\u201d one diplomat from a small European country told me. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what to think.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tearing a country apart. It\u2019s actually tearing a lot of countries apart and it\u2019s a shame that it has to be that way,\u201d President Trump said today. \u201cI\u2019m surprised by how badly it\u2019s gone from the standpoint of a negotiation.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next: If May passes her deal by March 20, she\u2019ll need a short extension from the EU to get the necessary legislation in order. If not, she\u2019ll head to Brussels to face a roomful of exasperated European leaders. They\u2019re also anxious to avoid \u201cno deal,\u201d but don\u2019t want to simply give the U.K. more time to continue the current squabble.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk today supported a \u201clong extension\u201d to allow the U.K. to \u201crethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it.\u201d If any of the 27 member states vetoes an extension, though, things will get more chaotic still.\n\nLooming ever larger is the prospect of a second referendum to break the deadlock. May has long said a re-do would betray the faith of the British people in their government.\n\nIn the meantime, how about that third vote?"

    "text": "\"It's always interesting to see something that was so successful drop off,\" said RBS executive vice president Inga Goddijn.\n\nDetails: The RBS numbers are interesting.\n\nThe number RBS tracks tallies how often companies told regulators that hackers stole employee information, like W-2 payment forms, in apparent attempts to scam the IRS with fake tax returns to obtain tax refund checks. It is a good indicator of how often hackers are attempting these kinds of thefts.\n\nOf course, not all thefts are reported or are even discovered by the companies. And since the number of people who work at a company varies, it's hard to draw conclusions about total victims from the number of companies breached.\n\nTax season isn't done yet, and RBS anticipates the final number of reported breaches will be more than 5.\n\nBy the numbers: RBS isn't the only group seeing a downward trend. The IRS hasn't released information for this season yet, but noted in 2018, through October:\n\nReports of identity theft had dropped 17% since 2017 and 72% since 2015. (\"We've seen dramatic declines in identity theft since 2015,\" said IRS commissioner Chuck Rettig at a security summit in December.)\n\nFinancial institutions flagged 66% fewer checks from the IRS as likely to be the fruit of scams.\n\nThe intrigue: Typically, when one type of cybercrime goes down, another type goes up \u2014 if you prevent one way of exploiting people, hackers move on to another. But RBS hasn't found a corresponding rise in any other field.\n\nExperts don't see a clearcut reason for the decline, but there are some spitball-able theories.\n\nThe IRS has gotten better at detecting fraud during the refund process, before checks are mailed, which may remove the incentive to steal W2 information in the first place.\n\nEmployers may have gotten more aware about protecting employee information.\n\nThe scam could have changed into something harder to detect or less clear to report.\n\nScammers behind major schemes may have been arrested for other crimes.\n\nTo be sure: None of this is an excuse to stop protecting yourself or your employees."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "\u201cThere are lots of entities out there ... that are willing to invest in infrastructure, and so we recognized that in order to make sure we got sufficient EV charging infrastructure out there fast enough, we were going to have to start working very actively with these companies.\"\n\n\u2014 Ableson\n\nHere are a few takeaways from our interview at the big CERAWeek by IHS Markit conference...\n\n1. New partners (maybe): Ableson reveals that GM is in discussions with more charging companies about joining an access and data-sharing initiative announced in January with 3 major networks: EVgo, ChargePoint and Greenlots.\n\nThe program is intended to provide information about station location, availability and status on the screen of recent Chevy Bolts, instead of consumers having to rely on separate phone apps for separate networks.\n\n\"We think we can take a lot of friction out of that whole experience,\" he says.\n\n2. Business model: Even in the long-term, don't look for GM to roll out its own charging network. And he doesn't think that would be a good idea for the auto industry as a whole.\n\n\"Having charge networks dedicated to a specific OEM is not the right answer long-term for society in general. We'd go nuts if you had GM gas stations and Ford gas stations and Chrysler gas stations,\" he says.\n\n3. A contrarian view: Ableson believes there's too much focus on comparing charging times to how long it takes to fill up a gasoline-powered car. That's the wrong metric, he argues.\n\nThat's because while the logistics of liquid fuels requires gas stations, charging can occur anywhere \u2014 at home, at work, while shopping and so forth.\n\n\"So what we are really interested in is, how do we get these chargers all over and ... you have the opportunity to make the experience frictionless, [with] no credit cards or anything, just plug your car in and everything resolves itself on the back end,\" he said.\n\n\"So I'm not as interested in getting down to below 10 minutes or whatever. I think a lot of that is driven because people compare back to filling stations, and I don't see that being the customer experience going forward.\"\n\nHe did note, however, that high-powered, very fast charging is relevant in some circumstances.\n\nMore from CERAWeek: Debating the future of electric vehicles in oil country"

There'd also be another guy who'd show up every few weeks to do test prep stuff. And that's really what it was. Test prep. Getting all the applications in order. Things like that.\n\n\"A lot of it took place over email. 'Send me your essay.'

You're in the throes of it and have talked to other people who have relationships at various schools, so you listen.\n\n\"But then it got weird.

He makes it all sound so reasonable, except that he also says he'll need a picture and asks if I have one from freshman football.\n\n\"We keep having different communications going on, and at some point he brings up the USC thing again and maybe another school too. He uses the word 'side-door.' Something like, 'Your kid can't really get in here, but I've got a way to get him in the side-door.'\n\n\"He kept pushing it, but I finally just said to give some other child the opportunity.

But, when he was starting his latest venture, Pinpoint, he decided to leave the Bay Area and set up shop in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe bottom line: Haynie is not alone.\n\nWhile specific numbers are hard to come by, Bloomberg Beta partner Roy Bahat said he is definitely seeing more entrepreneurs with Bay Area ties setting up shop elsewhere. He highlighted the trend in a series of tweets back in February.\n\n\"You\u2019ve got to do your tour of duty in the Bay Area but once you have, you have your network and people are willing to write you a check,\" says Mark Johnson, former CEO of Zite, whose current startup, Descartes Labs, is based in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nOur thought bubble: This kind of story is often framed as a tug of war between Silicon Valley and the rest of the country. But Silicon Valley isn't going any where, and for every startup or founder who leaves the Bay Area, someone else graduates from Stanford or wants to move here. This is about tech becoming a bigger part of the overall economy.\n\nWhere to go: As for which cities will benefit, Bahat said to look at where Google, Apple and others are setting up shop.\n\n\"If you want to see where founders of the future will go, look at where today's successful companies are opening new offices,\" he said. \"Every hire in one of those offices could be tomorrow's extraordinary founder.\"\n\nThat means cities like Seattle, Portland and Austin that already have their share of tech growth \u2014 but also emerging tech hubs like Atlanta, Northern Virginia and Indianapolis.\n\nDriving the trend: There are a variety of reasons why those founders leaving the Bay Area are doing so. For some, it's the cost of labor and housing, while for others it's for more personal reasons. For Johnson, it made sense to be in New Mexico, because that's where the technology the company is built on was developed.\n\nDescartes Labs uses satellite imagery to find patterns using an approach developed at Los Alamos National Laboratories. Johnson worried about hiring, but says that he finds lots of good talent \u2014 \"not the people Google would have found, but the people Google should have found,\" he said.\n\nYes, but: While there are plenty of people with technical skills, one thing there is a lack of outside the Bay Area are the people who really know how to scale a fast-growing tech company.Johnson, who is in the midst of spending a month back in San Francisco, said he always imagined the company would eventually move back to Silicon Valley, but that being in New Mexico is now a core part of the company's identity."

In 2016, Disney installed a smaller 5-megawatt solar farm near the new installation in the shape of Mickey Mouse's head, which provides power for some of the attractions and features at Epcot Center.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Disney has launched initiatives to reduce emissions in its organization to 50% of 2012 levels by 2020. Other environmental goals include diverting 60% of waste from landfills by 2020 and reducing water consumption.\n\nOther theme parks are announcing plans to use renewables, including Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, which is aiming to open the first solar-powered theme park in 2020.\n\nMaggie Teliska is a technical specialist at Caldwell Intellectual Property Law, an intellectual property law firm, and CTO of Regent Power.

Manafort's longtime deputy Rick Gates, who is cooperating with Mueller and has a status hearing on Friday, reportedly provided information about these episodes to investigators.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump and his defenders have consistently argued that Manafort's crimes have nothing to do with the president or collusion with Russia. But as Jackson said at the sentencing: \"Any conspiracy, collusion was not presented in this case, therefore it was not resolved by this case.\"\n\nManafort is now heading to prison in part, as Jackson noted in an earlier hearing, because he repeatedly lied in an effort to \"shield his Russian conspirator from liability.\"\n\nQuestions about why the former Trump campaign chairman was willing to risk the rest of his life in prison to hide his Russian contacts remain unanswered.\n\nGo deeper:"

The first is aimed at getting the capsule and its supporting European Service Module into low Earth orbit, while the second aims to deliver a second-stage rocket that would power the spacecraft away from our home planet.\n\nNASA first signaled that it might not be fully committed to the SLS in its budget proposal, released Monday, which puts forward a $375 million cut to the SLS for a total funding of about $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2020.\n\nThe budget, which Congress must approve, recommends delaying a planned upgrade to the SLS that would make it even more powerful.\n\n\"SLS is struggling to meet its schedule,\" Bridenstine said. \"I think we as an agency need to stick to our commitments. Sir, if we tell you, and others, that we\u2019re going to launch in June of 2020 around the Moon, which is what EM-1 is, I think we should launch around the Moon in June of 2020.

    "text": "Assembling your profile: This is where your Facebook presence begins.\n\nWhen you create an account, Facebook asks for your name and birthdate, along with either a phone number or e-mail.\n\nThen there's all the information you give Facebook as you fill out your profile, potentially including schools, current and past occupations, relationship status, hometown and current city, as well as your physical address, birth name, website, and other social links.\n\nAll of this forms the core of the profile Facebook uses to serve you ads. It's why you see offers for clever T-shirts based on your college or job.\n\nFollowing what you do on Facebook: The company has near-total awareness of every move you make on its website or in its apps, including:\n\nWhen you log in, how long you spend online and where you are logging in from \u2014 hence it can welcome you to new cities and suggest places to visit and eat (and also serve up local ads).\n\nPlaces you check in.\n\nThe pages, accounts and hashtags you connect with on Facebook \u2014 and not just who you are connected with, but how often you interact and for how long.\n\nYour contacts, if you choose to upload your phone book or call history.\n\nThings you buy directly from or through Facebook, but also things you may not think about, like the metadata from photos you upload.\n\nYour friends can tag you in posts and photos, which gives Facebook additional information. (You can choose to have this displayed publicly or not via privacy settings.)\n\nFollowing what you say on Facebook Messenger: Facebook does scan your chat messages, but it isn't exactly reading them \u2014 it runs an automated scan for child pornography and other banned content.\n\nMessenger can collect information on who you talk to, how often and for how long, as well as phone history if users opt in. But the company says it isn't serving ads based on the content of users' messages.\n\nIt also has an option for users to encrypt their messages, but this is turned off by default.\n\nFollowing you outside Facebook: Facebook sees you less thoroughly outside its own digital turf, but it still sees a lot. This data comes from two places: partner services and third-party information brokers.\n\nFacebook has tools that partner websites use to integrate with Facebook, including the inclusion of \"Like\" and \"Share\" buttons, as well as a tracking cookie known as Facebook Pixel.\n\nThanks to an inquiry from Britain's Parliament, we have a sense of how prevalent these methods are. According to Facebook, between April 9 and April 16 of 2018 there were 2.2 million Facebook Pixels, 8.4 million pages with a Like button and 931,000 pages with a button to Share on Facebook.\n\nFacebook knows your location, even if you haven't directly given it permission to access your phone's GPS, by tracking the IP address of the phones, computers and other devices you use to access its servers.\n\nFacebook also reserves the right to enhance its data trove by adding information from outside providers, though it has ended one program that mixed Facebook and third-party data for advertisers. From its policy page: \u201cWe also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.\"\n\nFollowing you across your apps: Many apps are connected to Facebook, including through its popular Facebook Login feature, which uses your Facebook account as a shortcut for you to sign in.\n\nDevelopers can also use this system to get your permission to access Facebook data. In addition to iOS and Android, it also works across the web and on some smart TVs.\n\nIntegrating Facebook was once a way for outside apps to get a lot of info about you, but Facebook has tightened that up considerably, setting rules and instituting a review process for apps that want anything beyond basic identity information.\n\nFollowing you at home and around town: Facebook's new Portal video chat system is basically a camera that lives in your home.\n\nFacebook promises the device doesn't monitor or record conversations.\n\nHowever, because it uses Messenger, Facebook says it does know who you call and how long the calls last.\n\nFacebook doesn't know everything you do offline, but it does have some data from retail point-of-sale locations as well as Bluetooth beacons.\n\nWhat Facebook does with all this data: Facebook says, emphatically, that it doesn't sell your information.\n\nIt does use the data to sell you to advertisers who set criteria for people they want to target. The more the company knows about you, the more valuable those advertisements can be.\n\nIt also uses the information to enhance its social graph, which it uses to build new features and products, and to power its suggestions of \"People you may know.\"\n\nWhat Facebook doesn't know about you: Facebook insists it doesn't monitor your phone calls or secretly record you via microphone, despite long-running suspicions to the contrary.\n\nThe bottom line: Facebook's privacy policies reinforce the message that \"you have control over who sees what you share on Facebook.\" But if you use Facebook at all, you don't have much control over what Facebook itself sees about you.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "title": "The high-profile investors indicted in Operation Varsity Blues",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Here's a rundown on the scheme's big-name investors:\n\nBill McGlashan: A longtime private equity executive at TPG Capital, where he founded and runs both TPG Growth and The Rise Fund.\n\nMcGlashan allegedly participated in two different schemes. One involved flying with his son to a \"controlled\" ACT test site, and then having a \"proctor\" correct many of his son's answers after they flew home. He also faked an athletic profile for his son, in coordination with someone on the take at USC. The combined cost was $300,000.\n\nHis son apparently was unaware. Well, until yesterday.\n\nYes, he was caught on tape by the FBI.\n\nMcGlashan also allegedly expressed interest in similar efforts for his two younger children. Like the other defendants, he seems to have been unaware of his pending arrest (in fact, I'm told he had a ski trip planned for this coming weekend).\n\nTPG has put McGlashan on indefinite administrative leave, with firm co-founder Jim Coulter assuming his responsibilities. It also sent a note last night to investors, which says in part: \"The firm's leadership takes this matter very seriously... Over the next few days, expect to hear more from us as we learn more.\"\n\nIf this case holds, I see no way TPG can bring McGlashan back. This may be a personal issue, not a professional one, but felony fraud is felony fraud. Plus, it's possible that he'll go to jail.\n\nOh, and remember that The Rise Fund is all about social responsibility, including education (portfolio companies include EverFi).\n\nNo word yet on what TPG plans to do about its current efforts to raise $3.5 billion for a second Rise Fund \u2014 given that McGlashan is listed as CEO and a key-man on all the relevant documents. But so far I'm told there has been no effort to amend any active fund docs.\n\n\"People are rightfully asking, \u2018Is the system working?\" That's McGlashan, speaking just weeks ago to Forbes. No Bill, it clearly isn't.\n\nManuel Henriquez, founder and CEO of Hercules Growth Technology Capital.\n\nHe and his wife (also a defendant) are accused of paying a total of over $500,000 to fraudulently aid both of their daughters (at least one of whom knew about the scheme). This included cheating on standardized tests, faking athletic profiles and bribing a women's tennis coach at Georgetown University.\n\nYes, he was caught on tape by the FBI.\n\nHenriquez also allegedly used his connections at Northeastern University to help get another kid accepted, in lieu of another fee, for which that kid's parents paid $250,000 to the fraud's coordinator.\n\nHe's already out at chairman and CEO of HGTC, whose stock fell 9% on the news.\n\nBut he remains on the company's board of directors. Per a statement to Axios: \u201cAs the Board considered all of Hercules\u2019 constituencies\u2014including its many shareholders\u2014it felt that having consistent access to Mr. Henriquez would be very helpful particularly during this transition period. Mr. Henriquez will have no day-to-day management responsibilities and his role is purely in an advisory capacity.\u201d\n\nGordon Caplan, co-chairman of law firm Wilkie Farr & Gallagher. He also is a partner in its private equity practice and corporate services department.\n\nHe allegedly paid $75,000 for the standardized test fraud on behalf of his daughter, who was unaware her answers would be changed later.\n\nYes, he was caught on tape by the FBI.\n\nHis wife expressed unease over part of the ruse, but Caplan expressed no such moral compunctions once she got off the phone.\n\nWilkie Farr has issued no statement about Caplan, despite numerous requests. He also remains listed on its website, despite being an attorney accused of felony fraud.\n\nThe bottom line: I've seen lots of commentary about how rich folks have always used their bank accounts to help progeny attend top schools, primarily through large donations. But at least in those cases, all students get to benefit from the largesse. Not true here. Instead, the schools and their students got defrauded.\n\nGo deeper: Everything else we know about Operation Varsity Blues"

The ferocity of storm had eased by Wednesday night. East of there, in the Colorado Plains, winds were stronger, with snowfall of a foot or more.\n\nPortions of I-25, I-70 and other roadways in Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska were closed due to the combination of wind, snow and low visibility. Heavy snow, with snowfall rates of greater than 2 inches per hour at times, fell in Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska, with heavy snow forecast to spread to North and South Dakota as the evening goes on.\n\nThe winds have been ferocious, with a gust to 97 mph clocked in Colorado Springs, and an 80-mph gust at Denver International Airport. Widespread high winds have also caused damage in northern Texas.\n\nThere's also a wet side to this storm, which caused problems in many regions.\n\nThe storm has dumped heavy rain on top of a deep snowpack across the Midwest and Upper Midwest, leading to a threat of severe river flooding, ice jams and roof collapses from the weight of water-laden snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service said late Wednesday widespread flooding had been reported in eastern Nebraska, which would continue through the night. Significant flooding impacts were likely in parts of eastern South Dakota, southwest Minnesota\n\nand northwest Iowa, the forecaster said.\n\nand northwest Iowa, the forecaster said. Severe thunderstorms, including possible tornadoes, exist where the low pressure area is drawing warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, threatening Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, in particular, on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nEarly in the day a squall line moved through Texas, bringing 80-mph wind gusts to the Dallas metro region.\n\nWhat's next: By Thursday, the storm was moving northward into Canada and weaken, leaving floodwaters, wind damage and extensive snow cover in its wake."

    "text": "Zuckerberg might not have made such a climactic decision unless pushed commercially. Some 15 million Americans stopped using Facebook last year, according to a new study, and Wired's Molly Wood calls Zuckerberg's move an effort to get in front of a coming \"collapse\" of his core business.\n\nBut the shift also coincides with intense global public and political pressure over unabated abuse of the platform to spread hate, divide societies, traffic in humans, and commit murder, all of which proved exceedingly difficult to stop.\n\nWhat's happening: Zuckerberg announced the move last week in a long statement, setting Facebook on a course of building out a private, encrypted dimension of the platform that will ultimately eclipse the current public square.\n\nExperts surveyed by Axios are skeptical: Some said encryption and private channels will not rid Facebook of abuse, which they said may now be even harder to police. Others \u2014 after years of Facebook's slow, grudging admission of the truth going on behinds its walls \u2014 simply were not prepared to take Zuckerberg at his word (see below for more).\n\nSome said encryption and private channels will not rid Facebook of abuse, which they said may now be even harder to police. Others \u2014 after years of Facebook's slow, grudging admission of the truth going on behinds its walls \u2014 simply were not prepared to take Zuckerberg at his word (see below for more). Neither Zuckerberg nor anyone else at Facebook has publicly thrown in the towel. (\"Z would NEVER acknowledge that it is too hard for him to do anything!\" said Brian Balogh, a history professor at the University of Virginia.)\n\nFacebook has publicly thrown in the towel. (\"Z would NEVER acknowledge that it is too hard for him to do anything!\" said Brian Balogh, a history professor at the University of Virginia.) Yet, even if he did not say so explicitly, there was no getting around the main takeaway: His tacit admission that the current state of affairs at Facebook, with all of its calamitous social and political effects, is not repairable.\n\n\"Facebook was originally not designed as a public medium, so I think a return to its original friends-and-family focus makes sense for them to better match their users\u2019 expectations,\" Deb Roy, a professor at MIT and former chief media scientist at Twitter, tells Axios.\n\n\"Human roles that typically not only police bad behavior but more generally moderate and facilitate behavior were never part of Facebook\u2019s system design,\" Roy said.\n\nnot only police bad behavior but more generally moderate and facilitate behavior were never part of Facebook\u2019s system design,\" Roy said. \"Now with billions of users, it may indeed be impossible to retrofit such roles in an effective way.\"\n\nIn a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said:\n\n\"That\u2019s a fundamental misreading of the announcement. First, as we\u2019ve repeatedly made clear, we have built new products, hired tens of thousands of new people to keep our platform safe, and are a different company than we were in 2016. Second, as Mark pointed out, this announcement will take a real amount of time to implement and public sharing on social networks will always be important.\u201d\n\nThe big picture: In a previous post, we asked experts to imagine a world without Facebook. None could \u2014 all found the platform too useful to too many people, and admonished any government that would try to take it down.\n\nJust half a year later, it's hard to find any clear Facebook defenders \u2014 and that's the case with Zuckerberg's attempt at reform as well. Here are a couple of questions I heard while canvassing experts:\n\nCan Zuckerberg be believed at all?\n\nIan Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, has his doubts. \"It\u2019s hard to see how they end [the current Facebook business] model without ending their business success along with it,\" he said.\n\nhas his doubts. \"It\u2019s hard to see how they end [the current Facebook business] model without ending their business success along with it,\" he said. Tiffany Li, head of the Initiative on Intermediaries and Information at Yale Law School, agrees: \"What\u2019s really important is seeing if Facebook makes any actual changes to make their products and services safer. We\u2019ve seen them apologize for privacy violations before, and we\u2019ve heard them promise to do better many times before \u2014 without much to show for it.\"\n\nBut, if he can be believed, will the situation only become worse?\n\n\"From my perspective, this move to consolidated privacy is going to make it more difficult to assess the ways in which Facebook is manipulated. ... Media manipulators will adapt to this tactic and it will be harder to assess or take down content that is considered private,\" said Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard's Kennedy School.\n\nto consolidated privacy is going to make it more difficult to assess the ways in which Facebook is manipulated. ... Media manipulators will adapt to this tactic and it will be harder to assess or take down content that is considered private,\" said Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard's Kennedy School. \"If Facebook is encrypted, Zuckerberg and his employees won't know what is in the messages and won't be responsible for downgrading or deleting racist, threatening, anti-scientific, and politically manipulative content from domestic and foreign actors. Facebook is off the hook,\" said Andrew Feenberg, a philosophy professor at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.\n\nThe bottom line: Fifteen years after launching Facebook in his dorm room, Zuckerberg is again reinventing his creation. But Tim Derdenger, a professor at Carnegie Mellon, says the network effects of huge numbers of customers can work in exponential reverse as people leave you. In other words, Zuckerberg has no time to waste. \"They need to move fast.\""

For instance, Bloomberg NEF sees electric vehicles accounting for 55% of global light-duty vehicle sales by 2040, while several other major projections are more modest, some of the considerably so.\n\nThe most bullish remarks I heard yesterday came from Ulrich Spiesshofer, CEO of the Swiss industrial and tech giant ABB, which has EV charging and power grid equipment lines.\n\n\"When you listen to people arguing about the EV space nowadays, I feel very strongly that the passenger car and the car industry is at a Kodak moment,\" he said onstage, referring to the fast transition to digital photography.\n\n\"I think the world will be surprised [by] what is happening with electric vehicles,\" Spiesshofer told me on the sidelines of the conference.\n\nAnother session here, on the EV battery supply chain, delved into real challenges for producing and procuring growing amounts of lithium, cobalt and other materials. But none of the panelists made the case that this would act as major brake on deployment.\n\n\"You could have some hiccups, starts and stops, I just don't see a full-blown crisis,\" Colorado School of Mines professor Morgan Bazilian told me after speaking at the event.\n\nBut, but, but: On a separate panel, Marianne Kah of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy pointed to a suite of forces that can limit growth rates. Among them:\n\n\"There's an unrealism about timing based on how long it takes to turn over the fleet,\" she said, and as a related point, noted that when people get rid of internal combustion cars to switch to EVs, those cars are used elsewhere.\n\nAnother one, she said, is that as EVs do begin sapping gasoline demand, that will lower the price of the incumbent fuel. \"That will actually make it harder for the electric vehicle to compete,\" she said.\n\nOne wildcard in the U.S. is the future of policy. Derek Kan, the U.S. under secretary of transportation for policy, was not shy about saying that the Trump administration is not pro-EV.\n\nHe touted the administration proposal to end EV purchase tax credits (my thought bubble: that's not going anywhere in Congress).\n\nKan also noted upcoming rules \u2014 which don't require Congress \u2014 that will jettison Obama-era fuel efficiency increases in the first half of the 2020s.\n\nHe said the Obama-era standards were a de-facto EV deployment policy. \"We don't believe the federal government should be telling you 'Dan, you should be in a Tesla,'\" Kan told conference host Dan Yergin onstage.\n\nGo deeper: Climate chasm on display at Houston energy conference CERAWeek"

The issue is whether Cohen, who will begin a three year prison sentence in May, lied to Congress when said he had \"never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon\" from Trump.\n\nAdditionally, offering the prospect of a presidential pardon to discourage someone from assisting investigators could also be seen as witness tampering or obstruction of justice.\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of Davis' quote included the phrase, \"When Mr. Cohen stopped, and decided he wanted to get out of the club...\""

This is a good thing for markets as it adds to consumer choice and flexibility and helps to improve global oil security.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The U.S. is exploiting its natural advantages. The type of oil found in the U.S. is lighter and sweeter (contains less sulfur) than oil from other major producers like Canada, Venezuela and Iran. U.S. shale also allows eager investors to get oil fields online quickly rather than taking multiple years to develop.\n\nThat's leading investors to push more money towards shale projects, Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets, tells Axios.\n\n\"As a result what we believe you're on track for is a timeframe where the barrels that are coming to market are becoming lighter and sweeter and ... heavy, sour barrels are becoming increasingly constrained.\"\n\nGlobal dynamics also are strongly in the U.S.'s favor.\n\nFirst, U.S.-led sanctions on Venezuela combined with its state-oil company's slow collapse will see the country with the world's largest oil reserves reduce its already marginalized capacity by almost half over the next year.\n\nIran's production capacity is expected to fall by 1.2 million barrels per day and Nigeria is facing homegrown oil market woes.\n\nSecond, the UN's International Maritime Organization next year will bar ships from carrying fuel that contains sulfur content higher than 0.5% and cap their sulfur emissions, benefiting light, sweet crude.\n\nMaritime shipping accounts for about 4%\u20135% of the oil market's 100-million-barrel-per-day total.\n\nThird, developing countries like China, which are driving new demand for crude exports, also are likely to move more toward light, sweet crude as their populations rely less on generators and heating oil, and as construction spending slows down, reducing the need for asphalt \u2014 all of which rely on heavy crude oil.\n\nThe bottom line: Both market forces and international regulations are pushing global demand towards exactly what the U.S. is selling.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "In general, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. While it isn't tropical in origin, this storm could have a minimum central air pressure that's typically found in a Category 2 hurricane.\n\nThe big picture: The storm is likely to bring nearly every weather hazard possible at once. In a swath of land from south Texas to eastern Nebraska, a severe thunderstorm outbreak is predicted to take place on Wednesday, which includes the potential for tornadoes. The region at risk for severe thunderstorms will push eastward on Thursday as warm, humid air is drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nMeanwhile, in the plains of eastern Colorado and parts of Nebraska and Kansas, rain, freezing rain, sleet and heavy snow are forecast as the storm intensifies. Some areas may pick up more than a foot of snow as wind gusts to 70 mph lead to blizzard conditions. The closures of entire interstates, including I-70 in Colorado, are possible.\n\nBlizzard warnings have been posted from Colorado (including Denver and Colorado Springs) into southeastern Wyoming, as well as Nebraska and southwest South Dakota.\n\nAs the storm spins northeastward, it's predicted to bring heavy rain on top of a deep snowpack in the Upper Midwest, with the potential for severe flooding in some areas.\n\nBecause of the storm's low air pressure, it will generate a huge and powerful wind field as air rushes toward the storm center. High wind watches cover a vast region from South Texas to Iowa, and wind gusts of up to 70 mph are possible in the hardest-hit regions, the National Weather Service warns.\n\nThe bottom line: The storm system is going to affect the entirety of the Central states, from the U.S.-Mexico border to the U.S.-Canadian border. It's unusual to see a low pressure area intensify so rapidly over land, since this is more common over the oceans, where the contrast between air masses tends to be sharper along with added potential energy from the oceans."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Sallie Krawcheck was one of the most senior women in the male-dominated world of Wall Street.\n\nIn today's Masters of Scale podcast Krawcheck, who now runs a digital investment platform for women called Ellevest, talks about how business embraces employee diversity in boom times and rejects it when things go south:\n\nDid you know that for a long time after the financial crisis, diversity went backwards on Wall Street? And it's actually not unusual for industries that go through a period of crisis, where you circle the wagons. And what I saw was, \u201cWe'd love to promote this woman or this person of color, but we can't take the risk.\u201d And so everybody reverts to their comfort, and uses that excuse, the fact that we're in the midst of this battle.\n\nWhy it matters: We're in the midst of a lengthy economic expansion, low unemployment and a record run for stocks. But there are plenty of economic storm clouds on the horizon and, if Krawcheck is correct, then Corporate America's push for greater employee diversity could already have peaked.\n\nThe same goes for Silicon Valley, where even the most socially-progressive companies are still overwhelmingly male and white.\n\nGo deeper: Hear the episode.\n\nEditor's note: Details of this podcast available exclusively to Axios readers first through a partnership with Masters of Scale."

Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the Democratic lawmaker who addressed the conference. He's a coal advocate and one of his party's most conservative members.\n\nI chatted with Maarten Wetselaar, a senior Shell exec, about whether they will increase the $1 billion to $2 billion per year they're investing until 2020 in low-carbon efforts.\n\nShell's out front among majors, but it was a reminder that the industry sees the transition happening on their terms.\n\n\"We're hoping to increase it.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Driving the news: Last week Democratic hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled a broad case for breaking up big tech icons like Google, Apple, and Amazon, arguing that operators of platform-style marketplaces should not also be participants in those markets.\n\nWhether or not Warren's campaign takes off, the combination of privacy scandals, misinformation scares and charges of anti-conservative bias mean tech companies face antitrust action no matter who's in charge of Washington.\n\nInside tech's corporate suites, executives foresee a wave of legal challenge, legislative inquiry, and regulatory action.\n\nLike the Trump White House, they will be required to cough up emails and internal documents, to send key personnel for further committee testimony, and to face potentially damaging leaks.\n\nFlashback: Microsoft's antitrust fight with the feds two decades ago shows the kind of damage such an assault can wreak.\n\nA federal judge initially ordered Microsoft to split in two, with Windows and Office to be part of two separate companies. While that order was overturned on appeal, the combined effects of more limited regulation in the U.S. and prolonged scrutiny in Europe had a profound effect on the company's innovation in the ensuing years.\n\nRegulators in Europe and Korea for years forced Microsoft to offer versions that excluded Windows Media Player or allowed consumer to choose a default browser other than Internet Explorer.\n\nLawyers became part of the software development process, and the company cautiously separated its products at a time when Google and Apple were further integrating software, hardware and services on new mobile platforms.\n\nIBM fought a similar epic federal antitrust suit from 1969 to 1982, ultimately prevailing. In both instances, the targeted companies found themselves focused on their legal quandaries and missed the next turn of the industry wheel.\n\nAntitrust action pinioned these tech Gullivers while new competitors in new kinds of businesses stole their initiative \u2014 Microsoft and the PC industry rose on IBM's turf, and Google and Facebook later emerged on Microsoft's.\n\nIntel, by contrast, cemented its dominant share of the personal computer chip market by playing along with regulators instead of fighting them. Intel's aggressive marketing skated right up to the line, but whenever a regulator balked, the firm settled. (It did miss out on mobile, though, creating a whole new set of headaches.)\n\nThe bottom line: No tech giant has ever been split up by courts, regulators or legislators.\n\nThe breakup of AT&T in the '80s was a different story, since the telephone giant was a tightly regulated, quasi-public utility.\n\nYou have to go all the way back to the vivisection of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil a century ago for an example of a large-scale government-ordered antitrust breakup in the U.S.\n\nBe smart: For antitrust advocates, the corporate breakup endgame may not matter if, even without such a dramatic outcome, they can still achieve a key goal \u2014 ensuring that dominant incumbents can't squash or swallow the next wave of tech innovation."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Details: Without evidence, Maduro blamed the power outage on the U.S., as the Chavista regime has since rolling blackouts began in 2009. The high command of the military, as well as the party hierarchy, have offered support, but Maduro has yet to convene his cabinet and top political lieutenants in public.\n\nThe opposition-controlled National Assembly declared a \u201cstate of alarm\u201d and drew attention to Maduro\u2019s subsidized oil sales to Cuba to underscore the regime\u2019s criminal neglect of basic goods and services.\n\nJuan Guaid\u00f3, named interim president by the Assembly, doubled down on his plan to oust Maduro, calling for street demonstrations and international humanitarian aid. That strategy has yet to break the regime, raising questions about whether the resistance could develop into an armed insurrection.\n\nWhat to watch: Venezuelans will take the next steps, but if clashes continue yielding a stalemate, both sides may soon turn to their international backers for renewed support.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s commitment to regime change in Venezuela seems stronger than ever, and secondary sanctions to expand the scope of unilateral oil sanctions are being prepared. Support for the Guaid\u00f3 government is having material impact, with a new board appointed at Venezuela-owned CITGO \u2014 a step that sets up a key legal battle over republic assets.\n\nFor now, the U.S. strategy has stiffened China and Russia\u2019s resistance, with the countries vetoing U.S.\u2013proposed resolutions at the UN Security Council, and expressing willingness to provide Maduro a degree of financial flexibility.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s neighbors have continued to work via the Lima Group, heightening the rhetoric about the security implications of the crisis but thus far rejecting military intervention.\n\nMichael McCarthy is a research fellow at American University\u2019s CLALS, an adjunct professor at George Washington University's Elliott School for International Affairs, and the founder and CEO of Caracas Wire."

They said Trump's support for Netanyahu is obvious through his public statements, his sharing of Netanyahu's election billboards on his Instagram account, and the fact that he didn't ask Netanyahu to stop using him in Likud campaign ads.\n\nDriving the news: Netanyahu discussed the possibility of U.S. recognition of the Golan Heights during a visit to the territory on Monday with Sen. Lindsey Graham. U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman attended all of Netanyahu's talks with Graham.\n\nAfter the talks, Graham stood next to Netanyahu in front of cameras and said that once he arrives back to Washington, he will help push Sen. Ted Cruz's initiative to pass a bill in the Senate for U.S. recognition in the Golan Heights.\n\nThe White House position on the issue is unclear, but nobody in the Trump administration pushed back on Graham's statement.

Now, the tables are turning.\n\nWorried about the group's future, OPEC's Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo toured Washington, D.C., last week to spread his \"sustainable stability\" pitch.\n\nYes, but: Barkindo's message is going to be a hard sell to U.S. policymakers who have been considering federal legislation that would subject foreign oil producers to possible antitrust action by the Justice Department amid the rising role of U.S. oil and gas in global markets.\n\nBetween the lines: The geopolitical fallout could be monumental, as the technology boom has lessened the common interests between oil-producing states and Western industrialized nations.\n\nNorway, where one in three cars are electric, just announced that its national pension fund will drop some oil investments amid concerns about oil\u2019s future, and other countries may follow its lead (as they have in the past on coal). Norway's divestment spared oil companies that are investing in clean technologies \u2014 a move that explains Big Oil's recent romance with green investment announcements.\n\nAs a new wave of civil unrest spreads across the Middle East, technological changes could threaten the viability of OPEC to sustain member oil revenues by making oil cheaper just when the world will need less of it, rendering OPEC less useful. The group already offers little hope to countries whose oil industries are imploding, such as Venezuela and to a lesser extent Nigeria and Libya.\n\nWhat to watch: The U.S. may have to help vulnerable oil dependent economies make economic reforms to diversify away from oil and create new jobs for growing populations.\n\nGo deeper: Read \"The Tech-Enabled Energy Future\" report from CFR.\n\nAmy Myers Jaffe is the David M.

Ilhan Omar's use of a hijab was antithetical to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nLast week, The New Yorker published an in-depth report calling out Fox's cozy ties to the White House and ways that it impairs the network's editorial independence.\n\nDays later, the Democratic National Committee said it wouldn't be working with the network on any debates for the upcoming presidential election.\n\nWhy it matters: History shows that these scandals likely won't impact Fox's ratings or popularity among loyal conservative viewers. But they do make it harder for the network to land certain interviews and partnerships that could drive lucrative programming opportunities, like debates.\n\nA Media Matters spokesperson also told CNN Monday that the group plans to release more audio clips this week, ahead of an event for advertisers at the Fox studios on Wednesday.\n\n\"We certainly want to make sure [the new audio tapes] are released when they can be most helpful to the media buying decision-makers,\" the Media Matters spokesperson said in an email to CNN.\n\nBe smart: Despite Fox's reputation as a megaphone for the White House, it does employ credible journalists that want to do good work and may not feel empowered to do so if Fox doesn\u2019t address these issues.\n\nThe big picture: Last week's series of critical reports shows how difficult it is for the network to balance news programming with opinion personalities whose actions and words draw high ratings, but are often at odds with the professed mission of the network."

    "title": "Solar geoengineering could offset global warming without causing harm",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The new study, published Monday in Nature Climate Change, finds that this futuristic fix is neither the panacea that some advocates portray it to be nor is it an option that would automatically cause significant harm to some parts of the globe.\n\nWhat they did: For the new study, researchers at Harvard, MIT, Princeton and Georgia Tech used computer models to project how climate change would play out if solar geoengineering were used to cut in half the global warming from a simulated doubling of CO2. They looked at differences in regional precipitation and shifts in extreme weather events, including tropical cyclones, between a world with and without solar geoengineering.\n\nWhat they found: Contrary to earlier studies that focused on solar geoengineering schemes that would aim to cancel out all human-caused global warming, the new study found that halving the amount of warming would not have widespread, significant negative impacts on temperature, water availability, the intensity of hurricanes or extreme precipitation.\n\nTrying to offset all the warming, on the other hand, could cause significant harm to some regions, previous studies have shown.\n\nBut, but, but: There are many \"ifs\" in this study, from the possible flaws in climate models to assumptions about how solar geoengineering would be conducted. Therefore, the results should be taken with some caution.\n\nThis study does move the geoengineering conversation forward, however, by showing the benefits from solar geoengineering used as a complement to emissions cuts rather than a substitute for them.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"This suggests solar geoengineering could have large and equally distributed benefits, but it doesn't prove it. It's an idealized model,\" study co-author David Keith tells Axios. \"There are still huge uncertainties. And also it's clear that if misused, solar geoengineering could have huge damages.\"\n\nKeith cautioned against seeing geoengineering as a way to avoid human-caused global warming.\n\n\"If people are thinking this is a get out of jail free card, a technological fix it means we don\u2019t need to cut emissions, then they are mistaken. Or to be harsher: delusional.\"\n\nGernot Wagner, a research associate in environmental science and engineering who works with Keith but did not co-author this study, tells Axios that the work shows that geoengineering could be done in such a way that the positive effects significantly outweigh the negative side effects.\n\n\"Many who look at solar geoengineering for the first time consider it too good to be true. This study shows that there really is a broad consensus among climate models that its effects, when done sensibly, are net positive. The emphasis, of course, needs to be on 'when done sensibly.' None of this means that solar geoengineering is a good idea. The governance challenges are vast.\"\n\nThe big picture: Geoengineering is viewed by many as controversial, since it would involve deliberate human intervention with the climate, with potentially unforeseen consequences, in order to combat human-caused global warming. At a UN Environment Assembly meeting in Nairobi this week, officials are trying to grapple with some of the governmental implications of researching and deploying geoengineering technologies.\n\nWhy you'll hear about this again: With the world on track for more than 2\u00b0C, or 3.6\u00b0F, of global warming this century relative to preindustrial levels, policy makers may turn to geoengineering as a way of damping warming, and therefore reducing the severity of its impacts."

Warren has repeatedly said on the campaign trail that she is a capitalist, not a socialist, but that she believes America's current application of capitalism is so lawless as to be counterproductive."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "\u201cLike many things in this administration, the bureaucracy is trying to slow roll things as much as possible to keep it away from the political decision-makers.\u201d\n\n\u2014 David Goldwyn, former top energy official, President Obama's State Department\n\nGoldwyn, now president of his own consulting firm, says the policy has the makings of everything Trump likes, including expanded executive branch power and a chance to show off America\u2019s energy dominance. \u201cIf he gets it, he\u2019ll sign it. If someone asks him, he\u2019ll say yes,\u201d Goldwyn said.\n\nThe big picture: America\u2019s oil production has more than doubled over the last decade, going from 5 million barrels a day (b/d) in 2008 to an estimated more than 12 million b/d this year. America is now the world\u2019s biggest producer of both oil and natural gas.\n\nThe boom in American oil is giving Trump a tool to test the nearly 60-year-old OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries). The more than a dozen nations are mostly in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia the dominant member.\n\nCritics, including Trump, say OPEC\u2019s goal is to keep oil prices artificially high.\n\nThe group says it\u2019s not a cartel and that it works to stabilize oil markets.\n\nOPEC nations control 40% of the world\u2019s oil and 60% of the oil traded internationally, according to Energy Department statistics.\n\nDetails: The legislation at issue would give the U.S. attorney general the ability to bring lawsuits against OPEC for perceived anti-competitive conduct with petroleum commodities. Previous attempts to sue OPEC have lost in court.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee approved the bill last month, having done the same thing in the last Congress under GOP control.\n\nlast Congress under GOP control. Republican lawmakers have asked the Trump administration since last summer for its official position on the bill, and to date they haven\u2019t gotten an answer, according to a spokesperson for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), one of the bill\u2019s backers.\n\nCongressional committees have approved the legislation several times in the past, but both presidents facing it \u2014 George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u2014 opposed it.\n\nTrump has been consistently critical of OPEC.\n\nHis 2011 book, \u201cTime To Get Tough,\u201d devotes multiple pages to criticizing OPEC and includes an explicit endorsement of the bill, the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (thus the apt acronym NOPEC).\n\n\"We can start by suing OPEC for violating antitrust laws,\u201d Trump writes in the book, which was republished in 2016.\n\nSince taking office, Trump consistently touts what he calls American energy dominance, and he has criticized OPEC over Twitter when oil prices are rising at least a half-dozen times since last spring.\n\nIt's also not just Trump. Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, a top official in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, wrote a 2008 op-ed\n\nAssistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, a top official in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, wrote a In congressional testimony\n\nOn the other side, Energy Secretary Rick Perry said recently the bill could cause long-term spikes in oil prices, and thus higher pump prices.\n\nBush and Obama opposed the policy because they sided with experts who say it would likely hurt relations with OPEC nations and risk American companies\u2019 investments overseas.\n\n\u201cIt would be the end of energy dominance for the U.S. because investment would flee the industry,\u201d said one highly regarded energy expert who would only speak on the condition of anonymity.\n\nFor the record: A senior administration official told Axios: \u201cThe administration does not have a position on NOPEC legislation at this time.\" Requests for comments to the Justice Department and OPEC weren\u2019t returned.\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching: Oil prices and Trump\u2019s Twitter.\n\n\u201cEveryone we talk to in the House and Senate all agree the one thing that would make NOPEC fly is if Trump tweeted about it,\u201d said Bob McNally, former energy adviser to Bush who now runs his own firm, Rapidan Energy Group.\n\nThe thing that could make Trump tweet about it is if oil prices rise. He could also do so if they remain higher than Trump wants going into re-election.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump\u2019s tweets at OPEC \u2014 paired with the potential of the bill itself \u2014 have helped keep oil prices in check, which may make passing the bill unnecessary from Trump's perspective.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot safer to tweet angry than to start a lawsuit and change the oil world forever.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kevin Book, managing director, research firm ClearView Energy Partners"

    "title": "What Google knows about you",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Google is the undisputed leader in the tech giants' race to accumulate user data, thanks to its huge array of services, devices and leading share of the digital ad business (37% to Facebook's 22%). It likely knows everything you've ever typed into your browser\u2019s search bar and every YouTube video you\u2019ve ever watched.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. It may also know where you've been, what you've bought and who you communicate with.\n\nWhat Google collects:\n\nThe terms you search for.\n\nThe videos you watch.\n\nVoice and audio information when you use audio features.\n\nPurchase activity.\n\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content.\n\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use Google services.\n\nThe ads and content you view on Google's sites, as well as interactions with that content.\n\nChrome browsing history you've synced with your Google Account.\n\nLocation data, which Google can either gather directly via GPS data or infer from other sensors and data, including IP addresses, nearby Wi-Fi routers and Bluetooth beacons.\n\nWhat Google doesn't collect:\n\nGoogle Docs data from business customers who use the paid enterprise version.\n\nInternet traffic from its Google Wi-Fi home routers.\n\nThe company used to use the content of emails in Gmail to choose ads to display, but it no longer does so, saying its other data is more efficient.\n\nThe big picture: Google isn't just its namesake search service. It also gets lots of data from its Chrome browser, as well as from YouTube, devices running its Android operating system, the Google Assistant, and Google Maps, along with hardware products like Nest and Google Home.\n\nEven those who don't actively choose Google's services still probably have a fair amount of information landing on its servers. It's a huge player in digital advertising, with widely used tools for serving ads and providing analytics.\n\nGoogle's privacy policy (which you probably haven't read) offers a good overview of its practices, while a separate tool allows users to see what information the company has been collecting.\n\nBetween the lines: A study last year by Vanderbilt University's Douglas Schmidt found that Google and Chrome are sending plenty of data to Google even without any user action, including location data (assuming a user hasn't chosen not to share such information). And nearly half the data came from people's interaction with Google's services for advertisers, as opposed to consumers directly choosing to use a Google service.\n\nGoogle challenged some of the study's points and highlighted some new privacy tools, but Schmidt says his key findings remain the same.\n\n\"You can fiddle around with a few knobs and make yourself feel better,\" Schmidt tells Axios. \"I don't think much has changed.\"\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nLocation data raises some of the thorniest issues for Google users.\n\nLetting Google track your location can help it learn where you work and live, predict when you need to leave the house and even tell you when you need an umbrella.\n\nAt the same time, such data hands Google a picture of our lives so incredibly detailed that it will make many people uncomfortable.\n\nThat picture will only grow in scope as Google expands the array of hardware products, from Nest cameras and thermostats to Google Home Hub and Pixel, that point more cameras and microphones at your life.\n\nWhat else?\n\nIn addition to everything Google collects via its services, Google search aims to be a repository for all the world's information. That means there's a mountain of information accessible on Google because someone, somewhere in the world has put it online.\n\nIf embarrassing pictures from your high school yearbook or information about your DUI is posted online, Google will help people find it. (An exception is for those in Europe, where the \"right to be forgotten\" lets people request certain info be removed.)\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nThere's a fair amount you can do to at least limit what Google knows about you.\n\nYou can use another search engine, like Microsoft's Bing or the even more privacy-centric Duck Duck Go.\n\nChoosing an iPhone alone won\u2019t get you out of Google's grasp. Google pays Apple billions of dollars each year to be the default search engine on the iPhone, iPad and Mac. You can change that default, but relatively few people do.\n\nOn the browser front, you can choose to use Firefox or Safari, or also use Google's Chrome in private browsing mode, or choose something like the privacy-oriented Brave.\n\nYou can choose not to stay signed in to your Google account when using its services. Outside of just not using Google products, this is probably the single biggest step you can take to hide yourself from the company \u2014 but it means you will need to log back in every time you want to, say, check a Gmail account or read a Google Doc.\n\nAnd you can go here to see what Google does know about you. Just make sure you are signed in (and check all your accounts if you have more than one).\n\nYou can also clear your Google history, something Facebook has promised users but has yet to deliver. Clearing your history means Google won't use the information to personalize your Google experience. Deleting it is another matter.\n\nWhatever steps you take, it can be incredibly tough to block out Google entirely, even if you want to, as Gizmodo's Kashmir Hill found, because Google's services power so many others. If you really wanted to shut out Google, you'd also have to give up Uber, Lyft and Spotify.\n\nWhat's next: Today, Google uses its vast trove of data mostly to target ads at us. Increasingly, it will apply the same resource to powering and optimizing the artificial-intelligence-based services that it and its rivals are building.\n\nGo deeper:"

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Beto O'Rourke, as well as presidential hopefuls like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Howard Schultz, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who drew massive crowds.\n\nHigh-end cocktail parties hosted these figures as special guests. At one party Axios attended, Ocasio-Cortez received far more attention than the Hollywood celebrities in the room.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was particularly busy. The freshman representative participated in on-stage interviews and attended events to promote the new Netflix documentary \"Knock Down the House,\" which follows the 2018 political campaigns of four female progressive candidates, including AOC.\n\nSeizing on the moment, CNN aired a live presidential town hall Sunday night from Austin in the middle of the festival, which brought well-known political journalists to the event.\n\n\"We want to give every single candidate a platform. It seemed logical for CNN to come in and have a town hall at SXSW,\" CNN Digital executive vice president Andrew Morse told Axios on stage Saturday.\n\nBetween the lines: Part of the political blitz at SXSW relates to the rise of attention to the regulation of Big Tech companies, which have long-participated in the festival.\n\nAttendees at a Vox Media party were shouting \"break them up!\" during a panel discussion about antitrust policy in tech.\n\nThe EU stepped up its presence at the event this year, flying its competition secretary Margrethe Vestager in for an interview with Kara Swisher.\n\nNoticeably absent from the conversations, events and parties were conservative politicians and media outlets.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) addressed one event.\n\nNone of the major conservative news outlets threw big parties or set up exhibitions on Austin's famous Rainey Street, while CNN, NBC, the New York Times, Buzzfeed, Vox Media and others all had a big presence.\n\nBe smart: SXSW has progressive, indie-alternative roots, but the festival's new political dimension makes the lack of ideological diversity more visible.\n\nThe big picture: Politics' entry into SXSW now becomes part of the history of the festival, which started in 1987 as a music showcase and has evolved over the years to include film, media and technology components.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to mention Rep. McCarthy's SXSW appearance."

The people who rent out the information-economy pipes (Comcast, Verizon, AT&T) are big enough to eat any media company for breakfast (NBC Universal, Yahoo, Time Warner). When Netflix pivoted from DVDs-by-mail to streaming, the one thing that stayed sacrosanct was its subscription-based business model. The move to a rental economy has been good for consumers \u2014 so far. According to research by Austan Goolsbee and Peter Klenow, inflation in the digital world is much lower than inflation in the economy as a whole, with a difference of more than 1 percentage point per year.\n\nWhat's next? Price hikes are certain in a digital economy where many companies are burning cash at an unsustainable rate.\n\nLyft alone lost $911 million in 2018; Uber lost twice as much.\n\nThe entire minotaur business model is based on buying a dominant position in a market and then exploiting that position. Once they have stopped growing and their markets mature, for instance, companies like Salesforce and Slack have astonishing latitude to raise their prices before their clients even think about switching.\n\nOwnership is a hedge against rental price increases. That's true in the housing market, as economists Todd Sinai and Nicholas Souleles have shown. But it's true in other rental markets, too. Owning a car is a hedge against price hikes at Uber; owning your own computer server is a hedge against price hikes at AWS, and so forth. Renting might be cheaper, but it's also more uncertain.\n\nInflation isn't monolithic; it hits different people differently. (In 2014, apparently, it was hitting Republican billionaires quite hard.) In a world where prices on Amazon fluctuate by the second, the cognitive cost of inflation \u2014 the amount of time we spend thinking about how much things cost \u2014 can be substantial even when inflation itself is low.\n\nThe bottom line: A world of continuously variable price is unstable and uncertain, even when overall inflation is low."

In fact, Americans over the age of 55 are more than twice as likely to cite the national debt as a top problem than Americans under the age of 39.\n\nContext: Economists who worry about the national debt generally frame it as an issue of intergenerational equity. An individual borrowing money is essentially borrowing from her future self: future-you becomes a bit poorer so that present-you can be richer. On a national level, countries that borrow money are effectively borrowing from future generations.\n\nEconomically speaking, older Americans should be happier about the debt (it means the government is spending more money on them today), and younger Americans should be more worried about it (since they're the ones who are going to have to pay it back out of their future income). But that's not what we see in reality.\n\nWhy it matters: Younger Americans seem to be on board with the new economic consensus that the national debt is not a pressing issue. Their voice should be heard on this, since they're the ones who have the most skin in the game."

Major tech companies have announced sweeping changes to their businesses, with privacy \u2014 or at least their own versions of privacy\u2014 in mind.\n\nJust this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will rebuild all its services and apps around several privacy-focused principles, a major departure from how the company has positioned itself for the past decade.\n\nNew online models that prioritize more data control are beginning to take shape, like innovative data storage and transfer mechanisms and new ways of thinking about data ownership and portability.\n\nYes, but: The reckoning will happen slowly, and few people have said they'd be willing to pay to access services.\n\nThe majority of respondents in an Axios/SurveyMonkey poll say they're unlikely to pay for a company to not track their personal data.\n\nBusiness models are cemented around the capture and trading of personal information, and consumers are still hooked on the free, real-time services they get in exchange for that data.\n\nSurprisingly few consumers are taking meaningful action to restrict access to that data, or even read privacy policies. There's also no clear way for consumers to see how their data is priced and bartered.\n\nBe smart: Giving consumers more control of their data also means they'd have to take more responsibility for it and actively manage it, like managing financial accounts. And there's going to be a lot more to manage over time.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: In 2025, each connected person will have at least one data interaction every 18 seconds \u2014 or nearly 5,000 times per day, according to a recent IDC white paper.\n\nSomebody's going to benefit from all that information.\n\nRead the full special report."

But again, there's no punishment \u2014 and neither the NHL nor the NHLPA needs to know about it.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"We are elite athletes and as long as it's not performance-enhancing or illegal, we know what's best for our own bodies.

    "text": "Background: As of last October, 71% of Americans \"support the idea that the government should set and update energy efficiency standards for appliances,\" and 95% agree it's beneficial for appliances to be more efficient.\n\nWhy it matters: U.S. investment in efficiency standards has delivered an average 5-to-1 return on innovation costs and allows businesses to compete for consumer trust and set benchmarks for quality and value.\n\nBy the numbers: Standards also save a typical household about $321 per year on energy bills.\n\nProvided that standards are properly updated, those savings will reach $529 annually by 2030.\n\nThe DOE also estimates that the energy savings will add up to more than 14o quads through 2030 \u2014 more energy than the entire nation consumes in a year.\n\nWhat's happening: The DOE is seeking to roll back the scope of congressionally established lighting efficiency standards that would otherwise take effect in 2020. It's also changing its process rules to allow more room for industry to contest standards and test procedures, and to set a new energy-savings threshold that a product must meet before being considered for new or stronger efficiency standards.\n\nRolling back the lighting standards alone could cost households up to $100 a year starting in 2025.\n\nA new proposed threshold in the department's process rule would make it harder to improve standards for products like consumer electronics that use little electricity individually, but collectively account for almost 40% of home electricity use.\n\nThe bottom line: Updating and enforcing these standards is both required by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and in the interest of U.S. consumers.\n\nDavid Friedman is vice president of advocacy at Consumer Reports and a former deputy and acting assistant secretary for the Department of Energy. He is testifying Thursday at a House Energy Subcommittee hearing on these DOE policies."

    "title": "Ice in the Bering Sea drops to lowest level since 1850",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Why it matters: The ice pack's ebb and flow each year has far-reaching consequences for the broader Bering Sea ecosystem, including determining the reach and abundance of prized fish species such as Alaska pollock and Pacific cod. This is the richest fishing ground in the U.S., featured in the Discovery Channel's \"Deadliest Catch.\"\n\nThe big picture: Scientists who keep close tabs on this region say the ice's early melt is upending life in the Last Frontier. It also portends consequences for the Lower 48 states and beyond. In a new study published in Earth's Future on Thursday, scientists warn that Arctic climate change is already reverberating far outside the region.\n\nBy the end of February, Bering Sea ice extent was lower than it has been since written records began in 1850.\n\nThe March 6 departure from the long-term average shows that an area of ice equivalent to California and Montana combined is missing from the Bering Sea.\n\nDetails: Rick Thoman, a scientist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, tells Axios that a combination of unusually mild ocean waters and a persistent, anomalous weather pattern combined to decimate the region's sea ice cover: \"One year maybe is a fluke, two years sure looks like we\u2019ve crossed a threshold now.\u201d\n\nSince Jan. 23, a series of 16 powerful low-pressure systems have moved north from the Pacific into the Bering Sea region, bringing heavy precipitation and mild southerly winds.\n\nThese winds have vaulted warm, moist air into the region and northward into the Arctic. They've also broken up the thin ice cover.\n\nThe impact:\n\nMarch is normally when people would be crabbing and fishing out on the ice. That's not happening now.\n\nThe sea ice loss makes hunting animals like walrus and seals, which serve as key food sources for native Alaskans in coastal villages, far more risky: It's much harder to haul a dead walrus into a boat than up onto solid ice.\n\nCommunities exposed to high seas are seeing severe erosion and threats to their infrastructure.\n\nDiana Haecker, a reporter for the Nome Nugget newspaper in Nome, Alaska, tells Axios in an email: \"The disappearance of sea ice and the ensuing weather is not only impacting our lives, it is disrupting life and is forcing each one of us, hunter or not, to refocus our energy on sheer survival.\"\n\nContext: Zack Labe, a PhD candidate at the University of California at Irvine, says that although the past two years have brought historically low Bering Sea ice conditions, year-to-year trends there can fluctuate considerably.\n\nLabe says some years may see temporary upticks in Bering Sea ice extent, but that overall, climate change is now in the driver's seat.\n\nA study published last year found that a marine heat wave in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska in 2016 cannot be explained without including human-caused global warming.\n\nWhat's needed: Thoman says residents of the Lower 48 should be aware of and concerned about what's happening in Alaska: \"The environment is changing and it\u2019s impacting your fellow Americans now.\"\n\nThe bottom line: The loss of sea ice could change ocean temperatures, salinity and currents enough to alter the distribution and abundance of commercially valuable fish in this region. The stakes here are high, as the Alaska pollock fishery alone was worth $413 milion in 2017."

Privacy protected by encryption, easier-to-understand settings and self-deleting messages could help reverse that.\n\nThe catch: Many of the worst aspects of Facebook's platforms thrive in private spaces that are either invisible or not readily visible to moderators. Emphasizing private group chats could multiply these problems.\n\nMobs in India enraged by WhatsApp messages killed dozens of people falsely believed to be kidnappers in 2018.\n\nIn the U.S., hyperpartisan fringe groups congregate in Facebook's private areas. \"Facebook groups are where unsavory narratives ferment and are spread, often with directions about how to achieve maximum impact,\" noted Nina Jankowicz, global fellow at the Wilson Center, via email.\n\nThese can become echo chambers of false content and propaganda without much oversight from Facebook.\n\nFacebook has worked to mitigate some of these problems \u2014 including limiting the number of people WhatsApp users can forward messages to, reducing the spread of false stories.\n\nTo be sure: No one blames the telephone for the content of phone calls. Private group chats are a difficult gray area between public, many-to-many communications online where most people expect moderation and direct person-to-person communications where they generally do not.\n\nThe bottom line: If Zuckerberg is correct about the future of private group communications, this won't be only Facebook's problem. Any communications platform that seeks privacy through encryption will be just as entangled in it.\n\nGo deeper: Facebook's pivot is bigger than privacy"

The filibuster battle is heating up.\n\nWhat's happening: The Associated Press' Elana Schor reports that some liberal advocates are using the Democratic primary fight to argue that big things like Medicare for All can't happen with a 60-vote threshold.\n\nSome of the field is supportive or leaning towards agreeing the filibuster should be killed, while others want to keep it or, like Sen. Kamala Harris, are conflicted.\n\nWhy it matters: Even if Democrats take full control of Washington, nobody thinks they'll have close to 60 Senate seats.\n\nThis can't be untethered from climate. A number of candidates are supporting the GND concept and calling for aggressive policies.\n\nWhat's next: If Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's climate-focused presidential run gains traction, this could come up even more. He wants to see the filibuster done away with, and a campaign aide tells me it's something he'll keep talking about.\n\nGo deeper: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal gets first fight in Senate"

If you want to reduce the trade deficit, have a recession. Look at 2009,\" says William Reinsch, a senior trade adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Of course no one wants a recession.\n\nThe background: Trump is conducting a multi-front trade war, the main purpose of which is to push down the country's global trade deficit, which he calls unfair and bad for Americans. Although most mainstream economists disagree \u2014 trade deficits reflect economic health, not malaise, they say \u2014 cutting the gap is a pillar of Trump's presidency.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe annual U.S. trade deficit surged to $621 billion in 2018. For December alone, there was an 18.8% jump. In both cases, the gaps are the largest since October 2008.\n\nThe gap was 3% of GDP, up from 2.8% in 2017. \"It\u2019s still significantly smaller than in the decade before the Great Recession, when it approached 6%,\" reports Bloomberg's Katia Dmitrieva.\n\nThe annual gap is up by $119 billion since Trump became president. But, if you go by economic orthodoxy, that's an issue only because he has emphasized it.\n\n\"Trump is over a barrel because he has made reducing the trade deficit a measure of his success in trade policy. And by that measure he is failing,\" said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA thought bubble: Trump has voiced his view on debt for decades. His obsession doesn't mean he is taking the U.S. into recession, but that \u2014 if he wants a materially lower trade deficit \u2014 he needs to hope for one. Or to pile burdens on the economy that take the country there.\n\nThe numbers on China have especially worsened, putting Trump in a difficult political position:\n\nThe Chinese goods deficit is the largest ever recorded.\n\nBut a new trade accord with Beijing is coming: At the scale some have reported \u2014 $1.2 trillion in imports of U.S. goods over six years, or two-thirds more than 2018 spending \u2014 the agreement, if fully enacted, would reduce the deficit substantially.\n\nAt the scale some have reported \u2014 $1.2 trillion in imports of U.S. goods over six years, or two-thirds more than 2018 spending \u2014 the agreement, if fully enacted, would reduce the deficit substantially. \"The real question there is whether the U.S. economy can actually produce that much more stuff,\" Reinsch said.\n\nThe bottom line: As of now, the relatively robust U.S. economy is staving off recession for the rest of the world. The widening trade deficit lowers 2018 GDP growth to 2.9%, 0.3% below previously reported, and that's likely to be the peak before the next economic downturn, says Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM."

But the central government also has managed to run up significant debt.\n\nVenezuela's debt stock rose from around $62 billion in 2007 to nearly $156 billion last year, IIF's economists estimate.\n\nDetails: IIF economists tracked debt to exports and found that Venezuela's external debt is about 738% of its exports.

It's also more than 200% higher than the level of debt to exports IIF estimated Venezuela carried just 2 years ago.\n\nThe next closest country is Tajikistan, which issued its first ever bond in 2017 for $500 million.\n\nBecause Venezuela hasn't kept reliable economic data for years and has barred bodies like the IMF and World Bank from conducting their own research, it's not even possible to determine Venezuela's debt to GDP ratio.\n\nOn the bright side: Nomura's head of Latin America fixed income strategy, Siobhan Morden, tells Axios she expects that Venezuela will be in much better position to pay off investors once a new government is in place.\n\n\"When bonds are repaid in 10 years or so the ability to repay should be much higher if you assume that they can recover oil production.\"\n\nGo deeper ...

A new Transport Policy study found that the deployment of 2,000 AVs in downtown San Francisco could bring traffic speeds down to 2 miles per hour.\n\nFleet management software could route vehicles around dense, highly trafficked areas on alternative routes. AVs in particular will need to be routed around areas with heavy traffic from the get-go, because once in traffic, they will likely remain on their programmed route.\n\nSoftware like the Transportation Mobility Cloud, Fleet Planner, and Auro can direct vehicles, and can intentionally disperse them to alleviate traffic on popular routes.\n\nYes, but: Fleet management technology can't be deployed at scale without more accurate maps, directions that factor in a vehicle's capabilities, and idle vehicle management.\n\nCompanies like Toyota and Deepmap are developing HD maps using existing data from test AVs already in use.\n\nThere are tasks AVs currently cannot perform, like navigating through a construction site. Routing vehicles around their own limitations will be crucial.\n\nRouting vehicles away from cities' thoroughfares while they're awaiting their next passenger could involve infrastructural solutions paired with tech solutions, like waiting lots near popular downtown pick-up and drop-off points.\n\nThe bottom line: Fleet management could begin to address congestion now, and prevent it from becoming far worse as AVs are introduced.\n\nChris Blumenberg is the co-founder and CTO of rideOS, which is developing transportation planning and mapping technologies."

Citizens use their SG$500 allowance to sign up for classes that will accelerate their careers.\n\nBetween the lines: To address a growing domestic skills gap and maintain a globally competitive workforce, the U.S. could invest in its own re-education and skills training programs. These solutions can come from three sources: trade organizations, government and industry.\n\nTrade apprenticeship programs are helping to close the gap in Germany, for example. Business leaders in the U.S. could also offer education resources for their workforces.\n\nThe U.S. government could partner with community colleges and online education platforms to make courses on sought-after skills, like programming languages.\n\nYes, but: To help Americans who already feel impacted by the skills gap, these programs would need to be accessible and affordable, and may require limits on the role of for-profit colleges, which can leave workers with unsustainable debt loads.\n\nThe bottom line: According to a Deloitte study, skills now expire every five years, at which point workers must learn new skills to meet existing responsibilities. U.S. unemployment is low, which suggests that a skills gap hasn't largely hurt the workforce \u2014 but if it does, it would take time to build out robust education programs.\n\nRichard Qiu is a senior vice president at Udemy an online learning platform, where he manages Udemy's education partnership with the Singaporean government."

Breaking the stigma around replacement therapies like methadone has been a long-standing priority.\n\nAnd he leaned into the FDA's ability to help spur a more competitive marketplace for drugs, largely through generics. He maintained the agency's effort to clear away a backlog of generic drugs awaiting approval decisions and also prioritized complex generics, like a new EpiPen.\n\nHis reputation as a competent, no-nonsense regulator, combined with near-constant outreach, made Gottlieb popular, even with Democrats who were sometimes surprised they liked him.\n\nFlashback from last February: Everybody likes Scott Gottlieb\n\nThe other side: Some conservative activists thought he went too far on vaping, and he was never popular with liberal advocacy groups like Public Citizen, who saw him \u2014 and who see the FDA generally \u2014 as overly friendly to industry.\n\nWhat we're watching: Tobacco stocks were up and biotech stocks were down after news of Gottlieb's resignation broke.\n\nGottlieb presented his vaping proposal to the White House just last week, so even though he's sticking around for about another month, the vaping industry will have more opportunities to soften or kill his plans once Gottlieb leaves.\n\nGo deeper: FDA chief hands the WH his plan to restrict flavored e-cigs"

While \"Beyond Coal\" has helped to retire coal plants, that advocacy effort basically swims with the current.\n\nThat's because cheap natural gas, the rise of renewables, regulations and other forces have all been shoving coal aside in power markets.\n\nBut, but, but: The oil-and-gas industry is bigger than coal and has deeper pockets. And trying to get \"beyond\" those fuels is trickier.\n\nTake oil in transportation, for example. Electric vehicles are a tiny (though fast-growing) fraction of the car market, and it's even harder to wring oil from other forms of transportation, like heavy trucking, shipping, planes.\n\nI'll be curious to see this campaign unfold."

But the EU\u2019s three largest economies \u2014 Germany, the U.K. and France \u2014 have all resisted pressure to sign on.\n\nInstead, they have encouraged Beijing to increase transparency around lending, raise environmental standards, and improve other areas where Chinese projects have fallen short in recent years.\n\nBetween the lines: While Italy\u2019s decision sends an important political signal, the announcement itself is unlikely to change much on the ground: On paper, endorsements of China\u2019s BRI are vague and do not carry real commitments for either side. That\u2019s why, as the list of participants has grown, \u201cmembership\u201d in the BRI has become almost meaningless.\n\nWhat's next: Italy\u2019s announcement could come at an opportune moment for Xi, who plans to visit Rome later this month and will host an international BRI forum in Beijing next month. But the political win might also come with longer-term costs, encouraging greater scrutiny of Chinese investments within the EU and a stronger response from the United States.\n\nJonathan Hillman is director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies."

Each of our grantees running standard shelters is licensed by the respective state for child care services. In addition to other rigorous standards put in place by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) at HHS' Administration for Children and Families, background checks of all facility employees are mandatory.\"\n\n\u201cThese are vulnerable children in difficult circumstances, and ORR fully understands its responsibility to ensure that each child is treated with the utmost care.

Axios assumed that some ORR allegations are referred to DOJ, so the numbers included in our chart are conservative.\n\nAll allegations referred to DOJ are also referred to HHS, according to the documents.\n\nIn many cases, the staff members were removed from duty and ultimately fired.\n\nORR's sexual assault policy\n\nDetails on the sexual abuse allegations"

No partisan divide on this one: Republicans ranked the government #95 out of the 100 companies, Democrats ranked it #98, and independents put it dead last.\n\nBetween the lines: It's not any one disaster that caused this. Harris Poll CEO John Gerzema says it's the endless barrage of bad political news \u2014 from the Russia investigation to the Brett Kavanaugh hearings to the fights over President Trump's border wall.\n\n\"They're just fed up \u2014 fed up with the shutdowns, the subpoenas, the wall,\" Gerzema said. \"It comes out as one perpetual negative news cycle ...

And it affects all three branches of government, Gerzema said \u2014 the executive branch with the investigations, Congress with the shutdowns, and the judiciary with the Kavanaugh hearings.\n\nBut Trump is at the center of most of this. None of these storylines would have happened without him.\n\nIt's not like Congress suddenly got worse than it's been over the last 20 years \u2014 it was already at rock bottom.\n\nthan it's been over the last 20 years \u2014 it was already at rock bottom.

Bill Clinton even got impeached. And think of it this way: the U.S. government ranked just two slots below the Trump Organization.

Twitter showed up on the list for the first time, and it's near the bottom.\n\nBut there's great news for Samsung and Sony, both of which moved way up in the rankings since last year.\n\nfor Samsung and Sony, both of which moved way up in the rankings since last year.

Rounding out the bottom five: Wells Fargo, Sears, and Phillip Morris.\n\nThe bottom line: The U.S. government has a worse reputation than a bank with a fake accounts scandal, a failing retail chain, and a tobacco company. It's going to take years to recover from that.\n\nGo deeper: Check out all 100 company scores.\n\nMethodology: The Axios Harris Poll 100 survey was conducted November through January in a nationally representative sample.

In addition, the packaging for the new treatment will contain a so-called \"black box\" warning label \u2014 the most serious category \u2014 indicating potential sedation, problems with attention, judgment and thinking, as well as abuse and suicidal thoughts.\n\nBut, but, but: The drug, which contains an active form of ketamine, has antidepressant properties that are not entirely understood, particularly when it comes to its long-term effects, Jeffrey Lieberman, a Columbia University psychiatrist told the Post.\n\nThe bottom line: Esketamine represents the first depression drug in years to be approved that works via a completely different mechanism in the brain, as compared to the previous generation of medications. For many with treatment-resistant depression, the new drug offers newfound hope of relief."

But they are looking for higher-level skills than those possessed by the men and women who ordinarily would be found in caravans, moving for better times. What's largely left in the workforce are, on one end, jobs requiring only a high school education, and on the other college graduates. Only 20% of jobs require just a high school education, said Anthony Carnevale, Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThe internet is a key unspoken actor in this dynamic of motionlessness. According to the Minneapolis Fed report, people know much more what they are getting into, and are seeing little romance in experiencing it for themselves. \"There isn't this a sort of naive, 'I'm from Northern Wisconsin, and I'm going [to California] for the Palm trees,'\" Carnevale tells Axios.\n\nI asked a string of other economists why Americans no longer move.\n\nJoan Williams, UC Hastings: \"A more important factor is the Two Body problem, as it's called in academia. Families now need two better jobs, not just one. And they have to be so much better that the family will all be better off even after paying for services they get a home for free, notably child and elder care.\"\n\nAndrew Challenger, Challenger, Gray & Christmas: \"It can be a cultural issue. People are scared of moving to the big city. When there is a very divided political and cultural moment, it could certainly keep some people from moving for opportunities.\"\n\nAnthony Carnevale, Georgetown University: \"From 1946 through the 1970s, you could be pretty fancy free. If you were able-bodied and had a good attitude, there was something for you out there. Even without a high school education, you could get a job. Then the boom was over, and everything changed. In the 1970s, automation across industries began, and starting in the early 1980s, a double-dip recession. Computing skills began to be required, and better education. We are just a mature post-industrial society. The Tom Joads are in trouble.\"\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist, Moody's Analytics: \"Because people don\u2019t need to move to the job, they can do the job where they already live. The creation and use of information can be done almost anywhere. This even applies to those with lesser skills, who are increasingly part of the information economy.\"\n\nDaniel Shoag, Case-Western University: \"The big action is on where people move, not so much a general decline in overall mobility. I know that's a controversial point, but my read of the data is more in line with this. In terms of where people move, I think it's mostly about out of control housing markets more than the internet.\""

While border apprehensions had been near all-time lows, the most recent month matches levels from the George W. Bush administration. The Trump administration is likely to use the high border numbers to bolster its claim of a national emergency."

Any group releasing a free, high-quality tool democratizes research into how cyberattacks are waged.\n\nBut the NSA isn't just any group. Spy agencies typically keep their tech close to the vest, and sharing it in this way changes the dynamic of the NSA's relationship with the American and global public.\n\nGHIDRA will become an open source project, meaning any software developer can use it, modify it and contribute code to help improve the product.\n\nUsers familiar with GHIDRA describe it as comparable to (some said better than) commercially available offerings, although it may be a little buggy.\n\nThat's probably not a huge deal to anyone trying to learn or teach the art of malware analysis.\n\n\"GHIDRA will help level the playing field for cybersecurity personnel, where there is a well-documented skills gap, by providing a tool that they otherwise wouldn't have access to or could afford,\" said Patrick Miller, a Raytheon researcher and fan of the tool. \"This will likely lead to the tool being used in cyber and coding competitions as well as in school curricula.\"\n\nMiller noted that GHIDRA and commercial tools like IDA and Binary Ninja each offer advantages, and serious researchers would find uses for all three programs in their arsenals.\n\nThe impact: To the NSA, the move offers a number of advantages.\n\nIt brings the agency, which has been maligned since the Edward Snowden revelations, out of the shadow and demonstrates a commitment to the public good.\n\nMaking research easier raises the cost for foreign adversaries to attack Americans, both public and private.\n\nIt demonstrates NSA confidence in the tools it keeps secret and in those used by its sibling agency, U.S. Cyber Command, in offensive missions.\n\nTo answer your least pressing questions: GHIDRA is pronounced \"Gee - dra,\" according to NSA official Rob Joyce, who will be presenting the tool to the RSA cybersecurity conference for its official release later Tuesday.

That is partly because of their scattered emergence. But it is also because since 2011, Arab regimes have lived in fear of the sudden diffusion of unrest\" and made preventing it a top priority.\n\nIn Sudan, President Omar al-Bashir has declared a yearlong national emergency and dissolved national and state governments after three months of protests sparked initially by economic distress. He also stepped down as leader of his party.\n\nBashir has led one of the world\u2019s most repressive regimes for three decades and is wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. This is the most significant challenge to his rule to date, and he seems intent to answer it with force.\n\nIn Algeria, huge demonstrations this weekend greeted a letter from President Abdelaziz Bouteflika confirming he would seek a fifth presidential term next month. Bouteflika, who turned 82 on Saturday and has rarely appeared in public since suffering a debilitating stroke in 2013, wrote that he\u2019d oversee a \u201cnational dialogue\u201d before stepping down early.\n\nThe Atlantic Council\u2019s Karim Mezran says Bouteflika remains nominally in power six years after his stroke because the country's factionalized elites can't agree on another way to \u201censure the equilibrium of power.\" Now facing swelling protests, he says, \"they are really freaking out. When I read the letter, my first thought was: \u2018They are at the last resort.'\"\n\nIn the years since the Arab Spring, says Mezran, the Algerian regime \u201chas been able to say, \u2018See what happened in Egypt?\u2019 \u2018See what happened in Libya?\u2019 And it has worked for a time. But not anymore.\u201d\n\nThe regime in Algeria survived the Arab Spring in part through economic subsidies made possible by its energy wealth. There have been scattered protests since, but a combination of cash and repression kept them isolated. \u201cThe shame of appointing a guy who is in effect not alive was finally enough to unite them,\u201d Mezran says.\n\nWhere things stand: Now there\u2019s less money to dole out, more doubts surrounding the army\u2019s loyalty, and no obvious Plan B. To find another candidate who satisfies protestors and elites alike \u201cwould be the act of a magician,\u201d Mezran says. \u201cHow can they do it in one month when they couldn\u2019t do it for four years?\u201d\n\nNow there\u2019s less money to dole out, more doubts surrounding the army\u2019s loyalty, and no obvious Plan B.

The RSS sees Pakistan, a Muslim-majority neighbor, as the ultimate enemy.\n\nYes, but: Going to war with Pakistan would not guarantee an electoral victory for Modi, because there's no evidence that launching surgical strikes within Pakistan would deter militant groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba \u2014 responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks \u2014 from attacking Indian forces in Kashmir.\n\nRather, surgical strikes would lead to a conventional war that would destabilize the region, potentially creating a devastating nuclear conflict or a refugee crisis in a region already experiencing its fair share (the Afghan crisis after the Soviet invasion, for example, and the ongoing Rohingya crisis).\n\nThe congressional opposition, for its part, has criticized Modi and the BJP for politicizing the standoff with Pakistan for its own political gains during this election season.\n\nThe bottom line: Modi's re-election prospects would not be improved by his initiating a war.

    "text": "How it works: The legislation sets a zero-emissions standard, but doesn't specify any preferred energy technology. This tech-neutral approach would help control costs of de-carbonization by allowing businesses to choose any qualifying zero-emissions energy source based on affordability and business needs. That leaves the door open for non-renewable, zero-emissions sources to qualify for compliance plans, including nuclear, hydro, carbon capture and market entry for yet-to-be-discovered energy technology.\n\nConservatives have been advocating for this tech-neutral concept in a number of ways:\n\nBetween the lines: Republicans are generally more comfortable with climate action when policies go beyond wind and solar solutions to include all energy and technology options for minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. Tech-neutral advocates hope that preserving as much freedom of choice as possible will make climate change legislation both economically practical and environmentally effective.\n\nThis approach can also accelerate affordable decarbonization because it allows all existing zero-emissions energy technology to compete.\n\nThe bottom line: Mayes\u2019 bill may be the best chance for electric utility companies and climate change advocates to cooperate on meeting California\u2019s climate goals: Currently, there is a binding requirement for 60% of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030 and a non-enforceable goal of 100% of electricity from zero-emissions sources by 2045. Mayes' bill would increase the enforceable zero-emissions target to 80% by 2038.\n\nSarah E. Hunt is the co-founder and CEO of Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy."

    "text": "Driving the news: As reported by Politico Friday, President Trump's re-election campaign had latched on to the idea of a nationwide \"wholesale\" 5G network, which is a dramatic departure from the free-market position of Trump's own administration.\n\nPolicy staffers working on the issue were taken by surprise, and the FCC hadn't been contacted by the campaign, per an agency spokesman.\n\non the issue were taken by surprise, and the FCC hadn't been contacted by the campaign, per an agency spokesman. On Sunday, the Trump campaign walked back that position and said there was \"no daylight\" between the campaign and the administration, as Axios reported.\n\nthe Trump campaign walked back that position and said there was \"no daylight\" between the campaign and the administration, as Axios reported. It's the second time an idea for a national 5G network has been tamped down. When Axios reported last year that a Trump National Security Council staffer was considering a national 5G network, administration officials reiterated the White House's support for a free-market, private-industry driven approach.\n\nYes, but: Wireless industry insiders worry they haven't seen the end of it.\n\nThe broad outlines of the plan have been described in op-eds and tweets from people close to Trump.\n\nIn June last year, Trump's re-election campaign manager Brad Parscale described \"a great 5G network\" as an \"open wholesale market with a privatized company that is not a carrier,\" in his \"personal opinion.\" Last month he tweeted again about the need for a \"wholesale\" network.\n\nNewt Gingrich said in a Newsweek op-ed last month that a \"public-private partnership\" was needed for a \"carrier-neutral, wholesale-only, nationwide 5G network.\"\n\nThe company pushing the latest iteration of this idea is a small firm called Rivada, which says its technology can set up auctions for use of the airwaves and manage the demands of different companies accessing them.\n\nThe company unsuccessfully bid on wireless airwaves to build out a national public safety network, a deal that AT&T ended up securing. The company has talked with the Defense Department and other bodies in Washington, but has not submitted a formal proposal, said Rivada spokesman Brian Carney.\n\nRivada CEO Declan Ganley wrote in an op-ed after last year's leak of an NSC official's plan to build a nationwide 5G network that doing so \"with private capital\" wasn't nationalization, but a worthy \"moonshot.\"\n\nA year later Gingrich described his ideal plan as \"a kind of wireless moonshot (but with private capital).\"\n\nBetween the lines: The system they're describing, which is similar to what the Trump campaign appeared to be backing, would be a major break from today's wireless network arrangements.\n\nRight now, carriers like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint buy exclusive rights from the government to use certain blocks of airwaves to build their networks.\n\nGingrich and Parscale appear to be backing the idea that the government should allocate a broad swath of airwaves to a single private company that would then manage the sharing process between different wireless providers.\n\nRivada describes its offering in similar terms.\n\nCarney told Axios he was not aware of conversations between the company and Parscale or the Trump campaign on the subject.\n\nThe revival of the national network plan comes amid mounting anxiety about China's 5G ambitions and efforts to inject its chips and equipment into U.S. infrastructure.\n\nThe Trump administration had reportedly been working on an executive order to stop Chinese chip maker Huawei from selling advanced telecom equipment to the U.S., but an order was put off during trade negotiations, per Bloomberg.\n\nIn a tweet last month, Trump called on U.S. firms to \"step up their efforts\" and that the U.S. should win through competition, \"not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies.\"\n\nFears about China gave Rivada an opening to push government intervention in 5G as a way for the U.S. to stay ahead, wireless industry sources tell us.\n\nGo deeper:"

That could mean 2 of the world's 10 largest economies in a recession, with Canada joining Italy, which fell into recession at the end of 2018.\n\nWorse, Canada hasn\u2019t hasn't had a recession without the U.S. economy also contracting since 1951.\n\nFor Trudeau, the news couldn't come at a worse time."

The former goal is currently is 20%\n\nThe two parties currently in power as a coalition, the Liberal and National parties, are more closely aligned with America\u2019s GOP.

The disagreement here in Oz is over how fast this transition could occur.\n\nTo the executives managing coal exports at the Port of Newcastle, a sprawling industrial site a couple hours' drive north of Sydney, they\u2019re banking on a long shift.

There is no daylight between the White House and the campaign.\"\n\nWhy it matters: It's highly unusual \u2014 if not unprecedented \u2014 for a presidential campaign to advocate for a different position from the sitting president's administration.\n\nBehind the scenes: \"Lots of policy folks were caught off guard,\" a senior Trump administration official told Axios. \"And the industry thought it [the plan Parscale just endorsed] was dead.\"\n\nAnother administration official who works on tech policy said, \"Yes, we were surprised.\"\n\nAs Politico reported, Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow has distanced the administration from a government intervention in 5G. \"The White House is officially behind this free-enterprise, free-market approach,\" he said last year, in the wake of Axios publishing leaked documents showing Trump's National Security Council was considering a national 5G network.\n\nWhat's next? Parscale has been privately telling people that the reason why he tweets his personal advocacy for an \"open wholesale market with a privatized company that is not a carrier\" is because he believes it would be politically advantageous to Trump in 2020, per a source familiar.\"\n\n\"A 5G network that connected rural America to high-speech internet would increase turnout and let the president talk directly to rural Americans,\" the source added, paraphrasing Parscale's private views. (Parscale is correct in that there are concerns that wireless carriers don't have financial incentive to spend the billions necessary to build out to those rural areas because they won't get a good return on that investment.)\n\nOn Feb. 21, Trump sent a pair of intriguing tweets that seemed to come out of nowhere. \"I want the United States to win through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies,\" he wrote. \"I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible,\" he added.\n\nIt's possible Trump's inspiration for these tweets came from an interview that aired on CBS \"This Morning\" shortly before he tweeted during that morning's Executive Time. CBS had just aired an interview with the Huawei CEO in which he said: \"We are rolling out 5G and soon we\u2019ll welcome 6G. In the future, I said there will be new equipment that is suitable for the United States.\"\n\nGo deeper: Behind the scenes of the Trump campaign's 5G network plan"

Similarly, Dan Galves, an automotive industry analyst at Wolfe Research, tells Axios that if Musk wanted to do another large offering, that too would be bullish for the stock, since it would assuage market worries about a possible cash crunch. Musk's compensation package is contingent on him reaching market-cap milestones that start at $100 billion and range all the way up to $650 billion. If he reaches that goal, he gets more than 20 million shares, which could be worth more than $50 billion. The deal gives him every incentive to remain in hypergrowth mode.\n\nData: FactSet; Chart: Naema Ahmed/Axios\n\nThe other side: Maybe PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel drank all of Musk's minotaur blood, because Musk now has the zeal of the convert when it comes to cutting costs.\n\nTesla is effectively shutting its entire retail network to bring the price of the Model 3 down by 6%.

Elon Musk told Axios on HBO in November that the company came \"within single-digit weeks\" of death \u2014 that \"if we didn't solve these problems in a very short period time, we would die.\" Which is to say: Musk considered running out of cash to be akin to death, even as the stock market was clearly showing that he could raise new equity capital at will.\n\nin November that the company came \"within single-digit weeks\" of death \u2014 that \"if we didn't solve these problems in a very short period time, we would die.\" Which is to say: Musk considered running out of cash to be akin to death, even as the stock market was clearly showing that he could raise new equity capital at will. The latest round of cost cutting coincides with the maturity of a $920 million convertible bond. Because the Tesla share price is below $360, the whole bond is being paid out of Tesla's shrinking cash pile.\n\nDriving the news: Given Musk's rapidly escalating war with the SEC, trying to issue new equity at this time would require a decidedly uncharacteristic level of delicacy and diplomacy. But that doesn't fully explain why Musk doesn't want to keep on growing as fast as he can.\n\nThe bottom line: Musk has persuaded himself that a company making 500,000 cars per year can and should be able to fund itself out of its own cashflows. Just like we saw with Tesla's door handles, once he's made that decision, no force on Earth is going to be able to move him."

The instruments are designed to record the radiation, G-forces and other parameters a human would be exposed to when riding in the spacecraft.\n\nBackdrop: Before they can launch humans into space, SpaceX and Boeing must meet strict safety requirements, including limiting the risk of loss or permanent disability of crew to at-or-below a 1-in-270 chance.\n\nDifficulty in meeting the loss of crew requirement, as well as design and production challenges, has led to considerable delays in the Commercial Crew program, so much so that NASA had to consider contingency plans to maintain ISS access in the event neither Boeing or SpaceX is ready to launch safely.\n\nNASA is hedging its bets against the possibility of further delays by considering the purchase of 2 additional Soyuz seats in 2019 and 2020, Space News reports.\n\nWhat they're saying: \u201cThis first launch of a space system designed for humans, and built and operated by a commercial company through a public-private partnership, is a revolutionary step on our path to get humans to the Moon, Mars and beyond,\u201d said NASA administrator James Bridenstine, in a press release.\n\nWhat's next: An in-flight, uncrewed abort test will take place after the Demo-1 mission.

The officers feared for their lives and had \"acted lawfully under the circumstances.\"\n\nClark's mother, SeQuette Clark, said his previous actions and his actions in the days before his death were \"no one's business.\" \"That is not a permit to kill him,\" she said. \"We\u2019ve been sitting for a year patiently allowing [Schubert] an opportunity to do right, and she has failed us. ... This is just the beginning. The fight for justice has just begun.\"\n\nManni said the district attorney's decision was \"continuing the shameful legacy of officers killing black men without consequences, and breaking my family\u2019s hearts once again.\"\n\nWatch the full statements by Clark's family and campaigners below:\n\nWhat's next: Clark's family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Sacramento and the officers involved in the case. The California Attorney General's Office is conducting its own investigation of the shooting and the state's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom called for \u201csystemic reforms\u201d to the state's criminal justice system following the Sacramento District Attorney's announcement."

The drama escalated to the point that YouTube said Friday evening it has stopped running ads with all videos of Momo.\n\nhappened. The drama escalated to the point that YouTube said Friday evening it has stopped running ads with all videos of Momo. This month, some local authorities warned parents about a supposed social media trend called the \"48-Hour Challenge\" which encourages teens to go \"missing\" in an effort to get pickup on social media. But so far, there's been no credible reports to suggest that any child has gone missing as a result.\n\nPolicymakers are frustrated. While many bipartisan efforts have attempted to create guardrails for kids, enforcing rules across the rapidly proliferating media platforms can feel like whack-a-mole to regulators.\n\nTikTok, a short-form video app owned by Chinese tech giant Bytedance, agreed Wednesday to a $5.7 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission for illegally collecting personal data from children. It's a record fine for a violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.\n\n\"Kids\u2019 lives are increasingly lived online, and companies like TikTok have been all too eager to take advantage of child app users at every turn,\" said Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.).\n\nSeparately, a coalition of advocacy groups filed a complaint with the FTC last week alleging that Facebook violated children's privacy and unfairly pushed them to make purchases in applications hosted on its platform. The FTC hasn't indicated that it will investigate the complaint.\n\nThe impact: Some parents respond to these dangers by dropping free platforms like YouTube that host user-generated content and instead opting for subscription streaming services like Netflix, Nickelodeon, Hulu or Disney that vet kids' content.\n\nBut many lower-income families can't afford cable TV packages or subscription streaming channels. That means families who rely on free, ad-supported video platforms are disproportionately at risk of being exposed to nefarious content.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission has proposed relaxing requirements for educational content on free, over-the-air broadcast channels. Millions of households rely on those channels, including large numbers of people of color.\n\nAdvocacy groups argue this will make broadcast TV content less suitable for children, but the FCC argues there's a plethora of new options for kids.\n\nThe bottom line: Online platforms like YouTube and Facebook were first created to capture the data and attention spans of adults. Now their youngest users need the opposite: more privacy and protection from bad actors.\n\nGo deeper:"

The company told the NYT that users can disable the \"matching\" option to prevent their data from being visible. Ancestry.com and 23andMe say they require a warrant or subpoena before they consider turning over data to law enforcement. It's not the first time genetic data has been used in cold cases. To catch the Golden State Killer last year, police detectives compared crime scene DNA against publicly available genetic data to identify the suspect.\n\nDrugmakers also want access. Ancestry.com and 23andMe \u2014 the largest companies that, combined, have DNA data of 15 million users \u2014 both share anonymized genetic data with outside researchers and companies.\n\nLast summer, 23andMe struck a drug-development deal with GlaxoSmithKline, and it's working on developing its own line of drug treatments.\n\nAncestry has worked with Google spinoff Calico to study human longevity.\n\nThe companies say they obtain customers' \"informed consent\" \u2014 or explicit permission \u2014 before DNA is used in scientific or medical research.\n\nKathy Hibbs, 23andMe's chief legal and regulatory officer, said that assembling large aggregated datasets of human DNA can speed up drug development. The company says 80% of its customers opt in to research programs.\n\n\"It's not individual data that's interesting for research \u2014 it's the ability to look at large groups of people to see what's unique.

But DNA data that is unique is arguably not capable of being fully de-identified and would still be personally identifiable, Hepp said. So use of such data \u2014 even if all identifying information is removed \u2014 may require consent, and it may even become part of your medical record.\n\nLast year, the Future of Privacy Forum worked with 8 leading DNA testing companies, including 23andMe, Ancestry and Helix, to establish best (but voluntary) practices for data use and security \u2014 as well as restrictions on marketing based on DNA data and allowing consumers to delete their data.\n\nYes, but: \"Even if a consumer deletes their DNA information, that is only effective if the DNA hasn't already been shared,\" Hepp said. \"This is new territory.\"\n\n\"Even if a consumer deletes their DNA information, that is only effective if the DNA hasn't already been shared,\" Hepp said. \"This is new territory.\" Also, \"subsequent researchers may want to use genetic data for future investigations, making it difficult to keep participants abreast of the various uses of their genetic data,\" according to a paper published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings journal last summer.\n\nThe DNA services have grown popular without most consumers realizing that their data could be used for purposes other than genealogy, such as forensics, said Benjamin Berkman, a bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health, who wrote about ethical issues of using genealogy data to solve crimes in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nNot so long ago, serious concerns were raised about genetic research because of fears about potential discrimination by insurance companies and employers.

    "text": "The big picture: The launch at 2:48 a.m. Saturday signals a passing of the baton from government-led space missions to public-private partnerships, in which billionaires like Elon Musk, who founded and leads SpaceX, will share the credit for U.S. space exploration.\n\nThis will be the first time a privately-built spacecraft designed to carry astronauts will launch to the space station.\n\nBeginning later this year or early next, U.S. astronauts and their cargo will hitch a ride to the International Space Station (ISS) on rockets built by private companies.\n\nDetails: During the 6-day mission, SpaceX's Crew Dragon will attempt to dock autonomously with the ISS, thereby testing most of the capabilities of the crew transport system.\n\nThe demo launch is part of NASA's long-delayed Commercial Crew program, under which a combined $6.8 billion in contracts has been awarded to Elon Musk's SpaceX and Boeing to launch astronauts and cargo to the ISS. The contracts amount to $4.312 billion to Boeing so far and $2.5 billion to SpaceX, according to NASA.\n\nThough no one will be riding in the capsule on Saturday, it will include a dummy named \"Ripley\" (in homage to \"Alien\") containing sensors that will allow SpaceX and NASA officials to get a better idea of what a person would be exposed to in terms of G-forces and radiation.\n\nBoeing will test its CST-100 Starliner vehicle no earlier than April.\n\nThe test flights are steps toward certifying the safety of these companies' spacecraft before crewed test flights.\n\nYes, but: Before they can launch humans into space, SpaceX and Boeing must meet strict safety requirements, including limiting the risk of loss or permanent disability of crew to at-or-below a 1-in-270 chance.\n\nSuch a standard is more stringent than those used for NASA's Shuttle program.\n\nDifficulty in meeting the loss of crew requirement, as well as design and production challenges, have led to considerable delays in the Commercial Crew program, so much so that NASA had to consider contingency plans to maintain ISS access in the event neither Boeing or SpaceX is ready to launch safely.\n\nThe demo-1 flight is expected to reveal some flaws in the SpaceX system in order for them to be fixed, NASA says.\n\n\"I fully expect we\u2019re going to learn something on this flight,\" he said. \"I guarantee everything will not work exactly right, and that\u2019s cool. That\u2019s exactly what we want to do.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Bill Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for NASA\u2019s human spaceflight program, during a pre-launch briefing\n\nNASA is hedging its bets against the possibility of further delays by considering the purchase of two additional Soyuz seats in 2019 and 2020, Space News reports.\n\nWhat to watch: NASA is overseeing and certifying these companies, but is now taking on the role of supporting player.\n\nBut this doesn't mean NASA will fade into the background, says Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, which promotes the development of the commercial space sector.\n\n\"NASA is an iconic brand and is going to continue to do incredible things,\" Stallmer tells Axios. He says that SpaceX, Boeing and other private spaceflight company logos may be viewed with a similar reverence in the future.\n\n\"We're a commercially-minded nation,\" he says. He called it \"a national embarrassment\" that the U.S. has gone about 8 years without the ability to launch its own astronauts.\n\nWhat's next: An in-flight, uncrewed abort test will take place after the demo-1 mission. Assuming all goes smoothly and the company meets certification requirements, then the first crewed SpaceX test flight to the ISS, with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board, could blast off as early as July. The Boeing timeline is proceeding at roughly the same pace, as well.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated to include the April date of Boeing's uncrewed flight test of its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft."

Zarif has sought to cultivate the image of a sober statesman, a task aided by his popularity in the West.\n\nBut his habitual outbursts \u2014 during the Iran deal negotiations, at the Munich security conference, and most recently, taking to social media to resign \u2014 paint a picture of an egoist as much as a strategist.\n\nYes, but: Real foreign policy decision-making remains concentrated in the hands of the Supreme Leader and military elite of the IRGC. For Zarif to resign over differences with this lot, as some observers have speculated, would first require him to have genuine disagreements that in all likelihood don\u2019t exist.\n\nIt would also mean that Zarif failed to understand the role the foreign minister plays in the Islamic Republic, which is to convey Iran\u2019s mere stylistic change in the past six years as substantive progress.\n\nThe bottom line: Most likely, Zarif was simply feigning to fall on his sword to deflect pressure from Rouhani, who has faced criticisms for the lack of dividends from the nuclear deal. The predictable public outcry in favor of Zarif buys space for their strategy: outlast Washington\u2019s pressure policy by staying within the broad boundaries of the nuclear deal, while stigmatizing the Trump administration to drive a wedge between the transatlantic alliance.\n\nBehnam Ben Taleblu is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "From the American perspective: Earlier this week, the Center for American Progress issued a report on China's global governance ambitions. Among the highlights...\n\nThe current global governance system is rules-based, and it privileges liberal democratic values and standards; Beijing\u2019s alternative vision is a system based on authoritarian governance principles in which nations negotiate issues bilaterally instead of following common rules and standards.\n\nFrom a liberal democratic perspective, if Beijing succeeds in bringing about that vision, the world will be less free, less prosperous, and less safe.\n\nThis report aims to provide a deeper and more nuanced perspective on China\u2019s real global governance intentions by mapping what President Xi and other Chinese leaders are saying to their domestic audience and how Chinese foreign policy scholars interpret those statements...\n\nDeeper analysis indicates that there is ample reason for concern. China\u2019s stated goals include watering down liberal democratic principles and either replacing or augmenting them with authoritarian ones. At the same time, this analysis also reveals that liberal democracies have powerful levers for shaping China\u2019s actions in the global governance space.\n\nFrom the Chinese perspective: The Feb. 27 People's Daily had a page 1 article titled \"Participating in the transformation of the global economic governance system (\u53c2\u4e0e\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6cbb\u7406\u4f53\u7cfb\u53d8\u9769).\" The article is the fifth in a series that the Communist Party's most authoritative newspaper is running on \"grasping the new implications of developing our nation's important strategic opportunities.\" Some excerpts...\n\nToday's world is once again at the \"crossroads\" of progress: the global governance system is undergoing profound changes and a new international order is being nurtured. As the world's second largest economy, China is fully capable of seizing new opportunities to participate in the transformation of the global economic governance system and play a more important role...\n\nSince the international financial crisis, the trend of \"east rising and west falling\" and \"south rising and north falling\" in the global economic landscape has developed in depth.\n\nMajor emerging market countries have taken the lead in economic recovery and developing countries have contributed about 80% of the global economic growth. However, in the global economic governance, it has failed to form a symmetrical right, a matching voice and a reasonable compensation mechanism...\n\nWhy it matters: Xi and his government have an expansive agenda to reshape global systems to serve China's interests. Be wary of reports that Xi is somehow chastened and pulling back on global ambitions."

In that regard, it failed.\n\nWhile the government once again used force against civilians, further eroding its credibility, the opposition failed to achieve its goals: Humanitarian aid did not reach the people, and the small number of security force desertions highlighted the government\u2019s resilience more than its frailty.\n\nThe episode ended in a draw, but, given that Maduro was on the defensive, a draw was a government win.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: If Maduro refuses to step down and the anti-Maduro camp insists that he does, the crisis will endure.\n\nThis won\u2019t be optimal for the government, which could well stay in power but find it increasingly difficult to govern for lack of resources.\n\nBut the pain will be felt chiefly by others: ordinary citizens who will suffer the devastating effects of a crumbling economy and oil sanctions, and Venezuela\u2019s neighbors, who will face a growing influx of refugees.\n\nTwo unfavorable scenarios could result: steady aggravation of the country\u2019s misery, with no plan for recovery; or renewed interest in a perilous foreign military intervention that could sow chaos in a country awash with weapons and armed groups.\n\nThe bottom line: To avoid either of these outcomes, third-party mediation will be required to appeal to more pragmatic forces among those sympathetic to former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and those on the opposition side. The optimal outcome would be an inclusive transitional government comprising Chavistas and the opposition, as well as the military, followed by free and fair elections under a neutral electoral body with international monitoring.\n\nRobert Malley is president and CEO of the International Crisis Group."

The national mean temperature for the summer of 2018-19 was 2.14\u00b0C, or 3.8\u00b0F, above the 1961-90 average, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).\n\nThe mean maximum temperature for the summer and the mean minimum temperature also broke all-time records.\n\nThe summer was the warmest on record for the states and territories of New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory.\n\nHeat waves this summer were \"unprecedented in size and scope,\" BOM stated.\n\nThe record heat was accompanied by numerous damaging wildfires, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nThe big picture: The BOM points out that the summer of 2018-19 comes on the heels of \"a string of warm months and seasons for Australia.\" In a seasonal summary, the agency states, \"This pattern is consistent with observed climate change.\"\n\n\"Temperature records are likely to continue to be broken in the coming years,\" BOM added.\n\nAustralia's climate has warmed just over 1\u00b0C, or 1.8\u00b0F since 1910, \"leading to an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events.\"\n\nOceans around Australia have warmed by nearly the same amount since 1910, \"contributing to longer and more frequent marine heat waves.\"\n\nIn addition, the length and severity of the fire season has increased \"across large parts of Australia,\" the report found.\n\nBy the numbers: Numerous all-time heat records were broken across Australia this summer. Here are some of the most noteworthy:\n\n35.9\u00b0C, or 96.6\u00b0F: The overnight low temperature on Jan. 17 in Noona, New South Wales, which was the country's hottest nighttime low on record.\n\nThe overnight low temperature on Jan. 17 in Noona, New South Wales, which was the country's hottest nighttime low on record. 40\u00b0C, or 104\u00b0F: The temperature reached or exceeded in Canberra for 4 consecutive days, something that had not occurred since records began there in 1939.\n\nThe temperature reached or exceeded in Canberra for 4 consecutive days, something that had not occurred since records began there in 1939. 49.3\u00b0C, or 120.74\u00b0F: High temperature in Marble Bar, Australia, which was the highest temperature for anywhere in Australia in 2018.\n\nHigh temperature in Marble Bar, Australia, which was the highest temperature for anywhere in Australia in 2018. 44.1\u00b0C, or 111.3\u00b0F: Average monthly temperature in Marble Bar during December, a new national record for the month.\n\nAverage monthly temperature in Marble Bar during December, a new national record for the month. 40.19 \u00b0C, or 104.3\u00b0F: Average daily maximum temperature for Australia on Dec. 27, which was the hottest December day on record for the country.\n\nThe bottom line: Numerous climate studies have tied increasingly persistent, frequent and severe heat waves to human-caused global warming.\n\nA study published in 2017, for example, found a fingerprint of climate change in heat milestones worldwide. The study found that climate change has boosted the odds of record-breaking heat across more than 80% of the surface area of the globe for which reliable observations were available, including Australia.\n\nSpecific extreme event attribution studies need to be carried out before more conclusive links can be made to this summer's heat in Australia, but it fits national and global trends.\n\nGo deeper: 2018 was Earth's fourth-warmest year, EU scientists find"

Ridecell's is currently being tested by BMW, Group Renault and VW.\n\nBetween the lines: This kind of mobility technology could prove crucial for automakers to implement AVs in ride-sharing and car-sharing, and for them to capitalize on those services and the data they will generate, while reaching their customers directly.\n\nYes, but: These platforms all offer similar features, and software products are not the core competency of most automakers.\n\nWhat we're watching: It's possible that automakers could eventually coalesce around a standardized platform, which could come from an automaker, a start up, or even a municipality integrating transportation options.\n\nSudha Jamthe is CEO of IoTDisruptions and teaches AV Business at Stanford Continuing Studies."

Amazon is building a subscription streaming service for games, The Information reports.

    "text": "Background: Lithium-ion batteries transport electrons through the use of cathode and anode materials, the latter of which is commonly constructed of graphite. The expanding electric vehicle market has been a major contributor to the global rise in graphite demand.\n\nGraphite mining and production have created environmental concerns in China as pollution worsens.\n\nGrinding graphite produces particulate air pollutants, which can cause respiratory issues.\n\nHarsh chemicals used during processing are sometimes discharged from the plant into the surrounding land and water. In one instance, discharged pollutants from a graphite-producing plant prevented a local Chinese river from freezing in the winter, potentially disrupting the ecosystem.\n\nIn the past, inspections were done by local authorities. But since 2010 inspections have occurred under the central government, which has made pollution control a priority.\n\nWhat's next: Although graphite development is expanding to African countries \u2014 including Madagascar, Namibia and Tanzania \u2014 China will continue to dominate the market despite the shutdowns. It will take time to develop more capacity outside of Asia; in the meantime, battery prices, outside of long-term pricing agreements, may continue to rise with demand.\n\nMaggie Teliska is a technical specialist at Caldwell Intellectual Property Law, an intellectual property law firm, and CTO of Regent Power.

    "text": "The big picture: The launch at 2:48 a.m. Saturday signals a passing of the baton from government-led space missions to public-private partnerships, in which billionaires like Elon Musk, who founded and leads SpaceX, will share the credit for U.S. space exploration.\n\nThis will be the first time a privately-built spacecraft designed to carry astronauts will launch to the space station.\n\nBeginning later this year or early next, U.S. astronauts and their cargo will hitch a ride to the International Space Station (ISS) on rockets built by private companies.\n\nDetails: During the 6-day mission, SpaceX's Crew Dragon will attempt to dock autonomously with the ISS, thereby testing most of the capabilities of the crew transport system.\n\nThe demo launch is part of NASA's long-delayed Commercial Crew program, under which a combined $6.8 billion in contracts has been awarded to Elon Musk's SpaceX and Boeing to launch astronauts and cargo to the ISS. The contracts amount to $4.312 billion to Boeing so far and $2.5 billion to SpaceX, according to NASA.\n\nThough no one will be riding in the capsule on Saturday, it will include a dummy named \"Ripley\" (in homage to \"Alien\") containing sensors that will allow SpaceX and NASA officials to get a better idea of what a person would be exposed to in terms of G-forces and radiation.\n\nBoeing will test its CST-100 Starliner vehicle no earlier than April.\n\nThe test flights are steps toward certifying the safety of these companies' spacecraft before crewed test flights.\n\nYes, but: Before they can launch humans into space, SpaceX and Boeing must meet strict safety requirements, including limiting the risk of loss or permanent disability of crew to at-or-below a 1-in-270 chance.\n\nSuch a standard is more stringent than those used for NASA's Shuttle program.\n\nDifficulty in meeting the loss of crew requirement, as well as design and production challenges, have led to considerable delays in the Commercial Crew program, so much so that NASA had to consider contingency plans to maintain ISS access in the event neither Boeing or SpaceX is ready to launch safely.\n\nThe demo-1 flight is expected to reveal some flaws in the SpaceX system in order for them to be fixed, NASA says.\n\n\"I fully expect we\u2019re going to learn something on this flight,\" he said. \"I guarantee everything will not work exactly right, and that\u2019s cool. That\u2019s exactly what we want to do.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Bill Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for NASA\u2019s human spaceflight program, during a pre-launch briefing\n\nNASA is hedging its bets against the possibility of further delays by considering the purchase of two additional Soyuz seats in 2019 and 2020, Space News reports.\n\nWhat to watch: NASA is overseeing and certifying these companies, but is now taking on the role of supporting player.\n\nBut this doesn't mean NASA will fade into the background, says Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, which promotes the development of the commercial space sector.\n\n\"NASA is an iconic brand and is going to continue to do incredible things,\" Stallmer tells Axios. He says that SpaceX, Boeing and other private spaceflight company logos may be viewed with a similar reverence in the future.\n\n\"We're a commercially-minded nation,\" he says. He called it \"a national embarrassment\" that the U.S. has gone about 8 years without the ability to launch its own astronauts.\n\nWhat's next: An in-flight, uncrewed abort test will take place after the demo-1 mission. Assuming all goes smoothly and the company meets certification requirements, then the first crewed SpaceX test flight to the ISS, with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board, could blast off as early as July. The Boeing timeline is proceeding at roughly the same pace, as well.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated to include the April date of Boeing's uncrewed flight test of its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft."

Last week, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said WarnerMedia would operate more independently than previous AT&T acquisitions.\n\nBetween the lines: Rumors emerged that Stephenson was looking to potentially combine the HBO and Turner units just as the government gave up on its effort to block the deal, following an appeals court ruling the went AT&T's way.\n\nBe smart: It's likely that Plepler's resignation is tied to pressure coming from AT&T to make more, commoditized content. Last summer, the New York Times received an audio recording of AT&T executives' first meeting with HBO staffers. The recording included a terse exchange between WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey and Plepler over the network's production strategy.\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Mr. Stankey said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to make money at the end of the day, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do that,\u201d Mr. Plepler responded, to scattered applause.\n\n\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cJust not enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, now, now, be careful,\u201d Mr. Plepler said.\n\nThe Information was the first to report Levy's departure.\n\nEditor's note: Axios has a show on HBO."

    "text": "Background: The crisis began with a Feb. 14 attack by Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistan-based militant group, in Pulwama, Kashmir, that killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers. India blamed Pakistan for giving Jaish the space to operate in its territory, while Pakistan stressed the homegrown nature of the attack.\n\nIndia responded with airstrikes on Balakot in Pakistan, crossing the line of control that divides the two countries for the first time since 1971.\n\nPakistan then launched a retaliatory strike, downing an Indian plane and capturing an air force pilot. But Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan followed up with a conciliatory speech asking Modi to come to the table for talks, including about terrorism.\n\nBetween the lines: As the world largely leaves it up to these two countries to resolve this crisis, Modi faces pressure to act muscularly in the lead-up to India\u2019s May elections. But it\u2019s hard to see how another round of escalation would benefit his endgame, given Pakistan\u2019s willingness to retaliate.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: If Khan and Modi meet, Modi might ask for Pakistan to take concrete, permanent steps against Jaish and Lashkar-e-Taiba.\n\nThat\u2019s the hard part: Khan may be willing to do so, and he seems to sincerely want peace with India. But Pakistan\u2019s military has never been willing to root out these groups completely, as they allow the country to maintain the semblance of power parity with India.\n\nThe big question: Depending on the extent to which he\u2019s willing to rein in these two militant groups, Khan could create a fissure in his alliance with the military. How Khan navigates that relationship will determine whether steps can be taken toward an elusive peace with India \u2014 key for the two nations that are home to 1.5 billion people.\n\nMadiha Afzal is a visiting fellow in the foreign policy and global economy and development programs at Brookings and the author of \u201cPakistan Under Siege: Extremism, Society, and the State.\u201d"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "\"The technology is fascinating and an exciting example of applied engineering being formulated and utilized to assist the care of some of our littlest, most fragile infants.\"\n\n\u2014 Lawrence Eichenfield, who was not part of this study, tells Axios\n\nBackground: Current technology, first developed in the 1960s, uses rigid electrodes with strong adhesives on the baby connected to giant computing systems that monitor the heart rate and oxygen saturation of healthy preterm babies.\n\nFor those born with critical issues, more monitors are often added, such as those to check the levels of carbon dioxide breathed out, monitor other breathing parameters and watch electric brain wave activity.\n\nThe adhesives can damage and even scar the underdeveloped skin of neonates, says co-author Steve Xu of Northwestern University.\n\nThe wires can make it difficult for doctors or nurses to access the baby quickly and for parents to hold the baby, skin-to-skin as therapeutically recommended, or even to breastfeed, co-author Amy S. Paller of Northwestern University tells Axios.\n\n\"The most exciting thing for me is for the parents,\" Paller says. \"I've seen the faces of the parents. They're sitting in the [NICU] room, sometimes trying to hold their little hands, but the babies are absolutely tethered.\"\n\nWhat they did: Researchers worked on both developing soft mechanics and adhesives that wouldn't damage the baby's skin and creating the lightest technology that wouldn't need wires or batteries but could still monitor and integrate vital signs, Xu tells Axios.\n\nThe outside of the sensor uses advances in materials science and biomedical engineering to create a skin-like silicone material encasing the technology.\n\nUsing near-field communication (similar to Apple Pay), the sensors collect vital signs data at high sampling frequencies and use a bluetooth chip to transmit the data to a mobile device.\n\nThe device is powered wirelessly through radio frequency energy. \"The absence of the battery allows the device to be ultra-thin and low profile. It also allows the device to be easily cleaned ... and compatible with medical imaging,\" Xu says.\n\nThey tested this on 21 neonates (while simultaneously using the traditional monitoring system) for the published study and conducted further testing on about 60 more babies with the same results, Paller says.\n\nWhat they found:\n\nPaller says they're \"thrilled\" at the accuracy of the sensors, the fact that they work well when wet, and are compatible with advanced medical imaging techniques like MRI and CT scans. None of the babies have experienced any negative side effects, she adds.\n\nRuth Guinsburg of Escola Paulista de Medicina\u2013Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo writes in a Science perspective piece that it's an \"innovative approach.\"\n\n\"The integrated monitoring brings efficiency and integration, which will allow integrated assessment of vitals and other parameters to assess the health status of infants. It is also exciting to make the baby more accessible to parents (and staff), without the tangle of leads that is now standard,\" says Eichenfield, who's a professor of dermatology and pediatrics at UC San Diego.\n\nDeveloping countries may also benefit from this, since it would require less technology, the authors say.\n\n\"We leverage smartphones and tablets to transmit and display data. This eliminates the need for expensive legacy equipment. The cost of the devices are low at high-scale manufacturing facilitating deployment in poorer countries. If you can apply a bandaid, you can use the technology,\" Xu says.\n\n\"This technology may improve the care of very preterm infants in developed-world settings, but also has great potential impact on monitoring practices all over the world and may give many neonates a more equitable opportunity to survive,\" per Guinsburg.\n\nYes, but: Eichenfield says more research is needed on a larger cohort of preterm babies. Paller says that's the plan, and adds that while other research has shown the benefit of skin-to-skin contact, they were unable to evaluate that particular benefit in this study because the babies were required to wear the traditional monitors.\n\nWhat's next: Paller says the team is planning to start a large trial in Zambia, India and Pakistan later this year and will continue research in the U.S. If all continues well, she says they hope to have FDA approval in 5 years.\n\nWatch more via Northwestern's video."

Sportsradar is the exclusive seller overseas, but won't have the same exclusivity within the U.S. It will also help the MLB monitor bets for \"integrity.\"\n\nThe big picture: With this deal comes more questions. There's still a big battle brewing across all sports about tracking and how players should be compensated when data is sold in deals like this one.\n\nFor example, if the MLB is selling access to information like how fast Clayton Kershaw's next pitch will be, shouldn't he get a cut of that revenue? The answer is unclear so far.\n\nThe bottom line: This new deal gives the league a cut for its data feeds and allows it to maintain the legitimacy of wagers placed on its games. But questions about data privacy and players will have to be answered at some point.\n\nGo deeper: Sports leagues struggle to deal with data"

Kim was willing to freeze the activity of only some nuclear facilities, but not all critical ones, and in return expected massive sanctions relief \u2014 a deal that Trump could not accept.\n\nBetween the lines: The outcome of this summit may be sufficiently sobering to spur Trump to better prepare for some of his future diplomatic moves.\n\nHowever, he may merely choose to make the same personalized diplomatic gambles on other challenges, such as those in the Middle East, with potentially far worse consequences in the event of failure.\n\nThe summit also marks a severe setback for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who pinned his hopes for reviving the stagnant South Korean economy on a diplomatic breakthrough with the North.\n\nWhat's next: Even as extensive UN sanctions remain in place, North Korea will continue to make qualitative and quantitative upgrades to its nuclear arsenal, but presumably will keep its commitment not to conduct additional nuclear and missile tests. Because both parties remain invested in de-escalation, war on the peninsula is unlikely, and there may yet be opportunities for U.S.\u2013North Korea diplomacy conducted on a sounder basis.\n\nAriel E.

The two that aren't \u2014 energy and oil production and technology.

    "text": "After the worst performance in a decade in 2018, China's stock market has been one of the best performers in the world in 2019.\n\nIts outperformance of the U.S. has largely been driven by gains this month, which has seen onshore Chinese stocks rise a full 10% more than the S&P. Of note was Monday's 6% gain after President Trump delayed a planned tariff increase on Chinese goods.\n\nDriving the news: Today, index maker MSCI will announce its decision on increasing the number of onshore Chinese companies in its indexes. So far, just 5% of the so-called A shares are included, but investors expect to see that rise to around 15%.\n\nDetails: A shares would be added to the MSCI World and China indexes as well as the Emerging Markets index, which tracks $1.9 trillion of securities.\n\nIf and when A shares are fully included in MSCI's indexes, a full 40% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexwould be made up of Chinese stocks.\n\nThe bottom line: Raising the level of A shares would underscore China's progress in opening up its markets despite tensions with Washington, less than a year after MSCI admitted Chinese A shares to its index for the first time \u2014 after 3 rejections.\n\nGo deeper: China's unclear economic outlook"

Observers say the hearing was a distraction for Trump, who said he watched as much as he could of the testimony, during which Cohen called the president a \"racist,\" a \"conman\" and a \"cheat.\" \"Having a fake hearing like that and having it in the middle of this very important summit is really a terrible thing,\u201d Trump said from Hanoi, Vietnam, where he failed to reach a deal with Kim. \"He lied a lot but it's very interesting because he didn't lie about one thing: He said no collusion with Russia. I said, 'I wonder why he didn\u2019t lie about that too like he lied about everything else.\""

    "text": "\"Just like Amazon sells third-party goods, we are going to also offer third-party transportation services,\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said last year. \"So we wanna kinda be the Amazon for transportation.\"\n\nFor years, both Uber's and Lyft's U.S. apps offered only their various car ride services.\n\nOver the years, the companies gradually added more options, including higher-end ride services as well as carpooling.\n\nThey also experimented with special discounts and drop-off locations for riders heading to major public transit hubs.\n\nWith the boom in bike and scooter rentals last year, both companies started adding new transportation options to their apps.\n\nIn February 2018, Uber inked a partnership with JUMP in San Francisco and made its electric bike rentals available to some customers via its app.\n\nShortly after, Uber acquired JUMP\n\nMeanwhile, Lyft acquired bike-sharing operator Motivate and has begun to roll out Lyft-branded scooters in a small number of cities. (At one point, Lyft was also exploring a partnership with scooter startup Spin, as Axios reported.)\n\nUber has also experimented with car rentals via a partnership with startup Getaround, though it recently suspended a pilot rental service for Uber riders. It continues to offer rentals to Uber drivers who need a car.\n\nIn September, Lyft started adding public transit information in its app, now available in a handful of cities, while Uber made its first foray last month, starting with Denver.\n\nThe big picture: Expanding their apps' services only makes these companies' relationships with Google Maps more complicated.\n\nDespite strongly prohibiting third parties from creating \"aggregator\" apps that display both companies' services side by side, both Uber and Lyft have long made an exception for Google Maps. For years now, Google Maps users have been able to see Uber and Lyft rides in the app with routes, get approximate fares and hail a ride via the respective apps.\n\nLast year, Google also inked a partnership with Lime to make its bike and scooter rentals available as a transportation option to users in some cities.\n\nAnd of course, Google Maps has long made it possible for users to plan a route via public transit and even compare it to alternatives like driving and walking.\n\nAll this has made Google Maps the original all-in-one transportation planning app.\n\nPayments for transportation also remain a tricky area.\n\nA year ago Uber inked a partnership with Masabi, which handles ticket payments for 30 public transit agencies, but has yet to make that available. (The company says that's coming soon \u2014 first in Denver, where it integrated transit data.)\n\nIn 2017 Google Maps announced it would provide the ability to book and pay for an Uber ride via its own app, but the short-lived experiment ended the next year. A separate app for Android, Google Pay, does let users pay for some local transit services.\n\nMeanwhile, some smaller players, like transportation apps Transit and Citymapper, have been able to make inroads in local transit purchases.\n\nThe bottom line: Uber and Lyft have an opportunity to broaden their apps' value by integrating more information and services with them. But they'll have to improve fast to best Google and persuade users that their apps are good for more than summoning a car."

When I saw it was less than a penny per package, why on Earth would we add a checkbox, why don\u2019t we just do it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Josh Silverman, Etsy CEO in Axios interview\n\nBut, but, but: The effectiveness of this type of policy, called carbon offsetting, is disputed for a few reasons. Whether the aforementioned projects are reliant on the related investment or would have happened otherwise is up for debate, though Silverman says his company is ensuring they fit the bill for genuine offsets.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have 20 years. We need to move now,\u201d said Silverman, arguing that implementing an offsetting policy is quicker than trying to reduce its supply chain emissions, which it doesn\u2019t directly control.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Etsy, which already has a 100% renewable-electricity goal it\u2019s expected to meet by 2020, is offsetting the entire U.S. package-shipping industry\u2019s emissions Thursday, at a cost Silverman says is less than $100,000, to raise awareness on the issue.\n\nGo deeper: Taking a different route, Amazon announced earlier this month its plans to make half of all its shipments carbon-neutral within 11 years by urging suppliers to make greener packaging and investing in renewable energy, per the AP."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "What's happening: Public anger has been the most uniform signal from the raft of U.S. and European elections won by anti-establishment figures since 2016. As sociologists and other researchers have sought reasons why, a common answer has been a sense of loss of accustomed community and stature \u2014 a rising number of immigrants, a cratering of jobs from automation and the movement of factories abroad, and a feeling of siege by menacing outside forces.\n\nAs we've reported, a number of experts call this tribalism, a feeling of attack on a person's elemental identity. Now, CEOs and academics are looking for how to restore the lost sense of security.\n\nAs my colleague Erica Pandey wrote, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said earlier this month, \"When someone walks into Walmart, I want them to feel, 'I belong here.'\"\n\nIn \"The Future of Capitalism,\" British economist Paul Collier writes that people need a renewed sense of purpose. They lost the one many felt from World War II through the 1970s. Instead, the economic system has beaten them down.\n\nThe problem, Collier argues, is that the advanced economies have truncated the lessons of Adam Smith, the father of capitalism. They have focused on the invisible hand \u2014 self interest \u2014 and neglected their need to belong to a job or community. Capitalism fails, he writes, when it is \"tainted by relying on the single drive of greed.\"\n\nThe upside of bowling: While McMillon suggests the answer is more trips to Walmart and Collier a rehabilitated sense of purpose, Samuel Abrams, a professor at Sarah Lawrence College, calls for more visits to traditional local hangouts.\n\nAbrams spent three years conducting a survey of 2,411 people along with the American Enterprise Institute and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.\n\nA major finding: If you want to create a sense of belonging, a bowling alley is a great place to start. \"They are booming. People want to go somewhere,\" he told me this morning. \"In bowling alleys there is real interaction. There is not texting. You are standing around doing something together.\"\n\nWhat is a bowling alley? A shared space where people can gather physically \u2014 versus virtually \u2014 and connect with their neighbors.\n\nThis may sound superficial, but it's not, says Abrams. A survey of people who answered some 60 pages of questions found a correlation between the presence of a library or bowling alley close to a person's residence, and their feeling of community. And when they had that feeling, they tended to speak positively about their neighbors and neighborhood.\n\n\"When you have [a bowling alley] in your community, the sense of belonging number goes up,\" Abrams said.\n\nThis is full circle from Robert Putnam's classic \"Bowling Alone,\" which, as a metaphor for lost community, bemoaned a shrinkage in the number of bowling leagues.\n\nBut, but, but: A lot of people \u2014 perhaps lacking a nearby bowling alley \u2014 are still finding their anchor in partisan politics, according to Bruce Mehlman, a political lobbyist in Washington, DC. \"Politics increasingly fills the void previously served by rotary clubs and bowling leagues,\" he says, \"with partisan tribalism replacing communitarianism.\""

Security Council draft document obtained by CBS News finds North Korea has furtively sold arms to Syria, dodged sanctions, and there has been a \"massive increase\" in the country criminally acquiring coal and oil.\n\nBetween the lines: Since President Trump's first meeting with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, in June 2018, the country has continued to violate the arms embargo as the U.S. and U.N. have pressed Pyongyang with sanctions on virtually every sector of its economy, according to the United Nations report. And despite the United States' efforts, \"financial sanctions remain some of the most poorly implemented and actively evaded measures of the sanction regime,\" the report finds.\n\nNorth Korea has long employed cyberattacks to sabotage enemies and collect intelligence, but the report says Pyongyang is now using more sophisticated techniques to generate revenue for the regime. It also says North Korea bamboozled an unidentified U.S. bank into payment for oil. The 67-page document is expected to be made public in early March.\n\nJung Pak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former senior CIA official, told CBS ahead of Trump and Kim's meeting in Vietnam Wednesday, the biggest danger is \"the pageantry of the summit is making it harder to punish North Korea for their bad behavior that is being downplayed amid the hoopla.\""

But that seems unlikely, as Pakistan relies on militant proxies and the world's fastest-growing nuclear arsenal to counterbalance India. The challenge for New Delhi will be mitigating terrorism without inciting reactions that could prove disastrous to India's prospects as an emerging power.\n\nJames Schwemlein is a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former U.S. State Department official."

The two affected provinces also haven't experienced the disease before.\n\nThis creates the need to educate and push against misinformation, Daniel Lucey, adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Georgetown University Medical School, tells Axios.\n\nWhat's new: On Feb. 24, there was a \"traumatic\" attack on the Ebola Treatment Center in Katwa, which ended up killing 1 person, partially burning down the facility, and forcing personnel and 10 patients to be evacuated, MSF announced.\n\n\u201cThis attack has crippled our ability to respond to what is now the epicenter of the outbreak,\" Emmanuel Massart, MSF\u2019s emergency coordinator in Katwa, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"After some successes in stopping transmission in the initial epicenters of Mangina and Beni \u2014 and some ancillary locations such as Tchomia, Mutwanga, and Masereka \u2014 the epidemic has spread from four to 19 health zones,\" MSF announced.\n\n\"We increased security around ETCs as we constantly receive threats of attacks,\" DRC Ministry of Health spokesperson Jessica Ilunga tells Axios. \"The attack in Katwa was incredibly shocking for health teams. We were lucky that patients did not escape and that we managed to transfer them safely to other facilities. But if there is another similar attack, we might not be as lucky.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases tells Axios that patients from the Katwa facility were transferred to another center in Butembo.\n\n\"I really admire the people on the ground who are doing this day and night. ... Their lives are at risk and they're still doing it, but that's what it'll take to get this done,\" Lucey said.\n\nYes, but: Lucey also said he's \"hopeful\" that the same measures can be taken in Katwa that succeeded in Beni, the former epicenter where there's been no new cases for 23 days, with 1 exception \u2014 a suspected case of sexually transmitted Ebola from a man who had been successfully treated.\n\nVery rarely, the Ebola virus can remain in a survivor's semen for months or even a year after it's no longer present in the blood, Lucey said.\n\nA synopsis in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases says more research is needed for studying immunologically protected body sites, like male gonads and parts of the eye, as potential new chains of transmission.\n\nGo deeper:\n\nEditor's note: This story has been corrected to better explain where the virus might be able to persist in the body (not in the tears) after a person survives."

Goldman Sachs believes divestment has been a key driver of the 60% price drop coal stocks have suffered over the past five years. At the same time, over $6.2 trillion in AUM have some form of fossil fuel divestment restrictions, which has driven sell-offs of the stocks and bonds in coal companies and commitments not to purchase them in the future.\n\nYes, but: Globally, there's still $420 billion in proposed coal plants in the pipeline, with construction finance in Southeast Asia, the last frontier for new coal expansion, coming largely from public institutions in South Korea, Japan and China. The current cohort of plants under construction represents $231 billion of investment committed in recent years.\n\nWhether those East Asian countries will further limit available investment and favorable terms will be an important test of restriction policies.\n\nThe bottom line: Global investors have siphoned capital from the coal industry through a combination of policy restrictions, divestment, public resistance to new plants, and the shifting economics of coal and clean energy. Expect that trend to continue as more global financial institutions turn away from the economic and reputational costs of coal.\n\nJustin Guay directs global climate strategy at the Sunrise Project and advises the ClimateWorks Foundation."

It is perhaps best known for the National Weather Service and its hurricane hunter aircraft.\n\nDetails: An email went out to NOAA employees on Monday to announce the leadership swap, stating that it was ordered by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. It gave no reason for the change, however.\n\n\"Today, Commerce Secretary Ross asked me to perform the nonexclusive functions and duties of Under Secretary and NOAA Administrator. As Senate confirmed Assistant Secretaries, I will continue to serve as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction, while Admiral Gallaudet will continue to serve as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere.\"\n\n\"In no way will this impact our mission or shift our priorities.\"\n\nThe all-staff email said that Gallaudet will now focus his time on oceans issues, taking him out of a climate communications role.\n\nA NOAA spokesperson tells Axios the switch is a \"natural shift that occurs in agencies and departments over time. Both leaders are dedicated professionals who believe in the people, science and missions at NOAA. The agency's important work on behalf of the American people and businesses will occur seamlessly into the future.\"\n\nBetween the lines: NOAA gave little notice to its overseers on Capitol Hill, with Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, only receiving word an hour before the move was announced.\n\nGallaudet made news in December when, under repeated climate change-related questioning from reporters at a science conference, admitted that he has never briefed President Trump on the issue, despite the agency's role as a major scientific research entity that funds and conducts climate studies.\n\nWhy you'll hear more about this: The Trump administration has nominated Barry Myers, the former CEO of the private weather forecasting company AccuWeather, to serve as NOAA administrator.\n\nThe Senate has not voted on the nomination, in part due to concerns over conflicts of interest stemming from his business career and investments.\n\nMyers resigned from AccuWeather and divested his interests in the company in January. However, his brother continues to lead the company.\n\nMy thought bubble: The elevation of Jacobs, who previously ran weather programs at Panasonic Avionics, could position the administration to pull Myers' nomination if opposition is too strong to overcome.\n\nGo deeper: Rapid global warming is bringing unprecedented changes to Arctic"

At a minimum, the U.S. says, Chinese law requires a company like Huawei to aid its home country if the government demands.\n\nThe U.S., Japan and Australia have each banned Huawei products \u2014 either outright or functionally \u2014 from being used as they build out national 5G networks.\n\nThe U.K.'s cybersecurity authority and Germany both suggested that there may be ways to mitigate the risk to Huawei products without banning them.\n\nHuawei denies any espionage or wrongdoing.\n\nThe allies' rejection is a black eye for the U.S. in global efforts to thwart a threat, particularly if the U.K. doesn't follow the U.S. lead. The U.K. is perhaps the closest U.S. intelligence ally.\n\nWhat went wrong: In part, neither Germany nor the U.K. might have been the most receptive audience for the American message.\n\nThe U.K. has facilities to reverse engineer Huawei products to check if they have been sabotaged. Most experts agree that the U.K.'s position is likely closer to the United States' than media reports have let on \u2014 and Britain's failure to ban Huawei doesn't rule out other British action against Huawei.\n\nBoth Britain and Germany want to preserve their access to the Chinese market.\n\nYes, but: That doesn't mean the U.S. has played its hand particularly well.\n\nThe U.S. may have undermined itself by waging aggressive, America-first diplomacy against traditional partners.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t help that we have eroded our soft power,\" said Christopher Painter, the State Department's top cyber diplomat from 2011 to 2017.\n\n\"The administration is in a time warp. They think it's 1983 and everyone will do what we say,\" said Robert Manning, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \"We can't keep beating up on Europe and thinking they won't react.\"\n\nInconsistent U.S. stances on China have not helped, either. Getting others to take Chinese threats seriously is harder for the Trump administration after it suggested that just about anything related to China could be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations \u2014 from the allegations of espionage by ZTE, another major Chinese manufacturer, to the arrest of Huawei's CFO for fairly significant crimes."

His strategy so far has been to convince Kim that North Korea\u2019s denuclearization would bring the country a \u201cbright future.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Trump must address Kim\u2019s concerns about whether any agreement reached with his administration will withstand the Democrat-controlled House and survive the post-Trump era.\n\nBetween the lines: Successful diplomacy sometimes entails purposeful ambiguities, and the ambiguities of the first Trump-Kim summit might indeed have been strategic. At this critical juncture, however, a failure on Trump\u2019s and Kim\u2019s part to commit to defined objectives could hurt the bilateral relationship.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump and Kim need support more than ever to advance their diplomatic endeavors. While spectators have good reason to be skeptical, and one can only be cautiously hopeful with North Korea, a return to confrontation or \"strategic patience\" is in no one\u2019s interest.\n\nGi-Wook Shin is the William J.

    "text": "\"I don't see us at any time going to paid model, where content is gated, because I think there's a better opportunity for us to continue to engage a larger audience of sports fans, who show no evidence from us that that's what they want ... I just don't believe that gating journalism is the best way for us to grow this business.\"\n\nYes, but: Bleacher Report does charge consumers for live games or access to its over-the-top live TV app, Bleacher Report Live. A single game or match is $2.99, while a monthly subscription is $9.99 \u2014 nearly twice the monthly cost of ESPN+, which has exclusive sports content and niche live sports rights. A yearly subscription to B/R Live is $79.99.\n\nThe app is currently driven by ads, which bring in between $80-$100 million for the company, according to estimates based on revenue ranges from Mittman. Users have to sign into the free app through an authentication service, like they would for a paid subscription. That helps the company collect better first-party data and in turn, sell ads for a higher premium.\n\nwhich bring in between $80-$100 million for the company, according to estimates based on revenue ranges from Mittman. Users have to sign into the free app through an authentication service, like they would for a paid subscription. That helps the company collect better first-party data and in turn, sell ads for a higher premium. The regular Bleacher Report app has 10 million people signed up to get push alerts, which Mittman believes will be a critical service once real-time betting becomes widespread. \"Our alerts are fast,\" Mittman said. \"You\u2019ll get them anywhere between 1 minute and 7 minutes faster than any other subscription alert service. Speed is the key performance indicator that we monitor in terms of alerts.\"\n\nMittman takes over as CEO in place of Dave Finocchio, one of the company's four original founders, who announced his summer 2019 departure last week.\n\nMittman has been chief revenue officer and chief marketing officer of Bleacher Report since August 2017. He takes over just months after AT&T purchased parent company Turner, which acquired Bleacher Report for $175 million+ in 2012.\n\nThe AT&T acquisition has been smooth so far, Mittman says. \"Nothing has changed yet day-to-day, but the opportunity is massive.\" He believes Bleacher Report's digital data, combined with AT&T's customer data, could be a big sell for advertisers looking to better target hyper-sports fans.\n\nWhen it comes to betting, Bleacher Report announced a new deal last Thursday with Caesars Entertainment, a casino operator, to build a live 24/7 sports-betting content studio inside the sports book section of one of Caesars\u2019 Las Vegas casinos.\n\nBleacher Report announced a new deal last Thursday with Caesars Entertainment, a casino operator, to build a live 24/7 sports-betting content studio inside the sports book section of one of Caesars\u2019 Las Vegas casinos. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson recently told Recode that AT&T itself doesn't plan to get into the gambling business, but recognizes the content opportunities around gambling.\n\nThe big picture: In an era where venture-capital backed media companies appear to be struggling, Bleacher Report is an example of a pretty stable exit."

Such screens first showed up in devices with curved but relatively fixed phones, including the Galaxy Round and LG Flex back in 2013.\n\nFast forward a few years and display technology now makes possible a device that can fold.\n\nThe real breakthrough will be when this technology is not just cheaper, but even more flexible. Imagine something that can unfold like a newspaper or wrap around your wrist. To get there, we need other innovations, like batteries that are as flexible as the displays.\n\nAR and VR that you actually want: The HoloLens 2 was the most talked-about new product launched at the MWC trade show, and for good reason. It addresses 2 of the biggest criticisms of the original model \u2014 its limited field of view and cumbersome fit. The new model also builds on its predecessor with improved performance.\n\nAlso impressive is another mixed reality headset, introduced a couple weeks ago by a Finnish startup called Varjo. They have produced a headset that offers far better resolution than anything else on the market.\n\nAs with the other products mentioned above, the price of Varjo's VR-1 is hardly consumer friendly. At $6,000, Varjo is targeting business customers. But the kind of screen resolution it's offering could be what it will take for consumers to be willing to spend significant periods of time in VR.\n\nThe bottom line: For real tech enthusiasts, eras in which everyone can afford to buy the latest and greatest are a little dull. The real thrills happen when there are products on the way that are out of your reach \u2014 because they won't be for long."

    "title": "This Japanese news app quietly pushes traffic to millions",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Yes, but: SmartNews' audience is still tiny in the U.S. compared to that of other news aggregators, like Facebook, Google or Twitter, and it's not considered a strong partner for strategic news distribution. \"It's very much just sugar rush traffic,\" says one audience development manager.\n\nDetails: SmartNews is a free news discovery app that was created in Japan in 2012 and launched in the U.S. in 2014. It's raised $88.3 million to date and at the time of its last raise in 2016, was reportedly valued at between $500 and $600 million. SmartNews has an audience of roughly 15 million monthly users, most of which are from Japan.\n\nBut the company is aggressively pushing to expand its U.S. presence, in part because audience and ad revenue opportunities are great here. It's hired 25 people across three offices in San Francisco, Palo Alto and New York City, Head of U.S. Marketing Fabien-Pierre Nicolas tells Axios.\n\nin part because audience and ad revenue opportunities are great here. It's hired 25 people across three offices in San Francisco, Palo Alto and New York City, Head of U.S. Marketing Fabien-Pierre Nicolas tells Axios. The company has also been buying cable news ads across Fox, MSNBC and CNN. Its goal is to attract older news consumers in the U.S. across all demographics and political ideologies. \"For now, the 18-24 demographic is skipping us. Therefore, we are focused on users ages 25 and higher,\" says Nicolas.\n\nBe smart: In Japan, SmartNews is a market leader and considered one of the top news discovery apps, with roughly 3,000 news publishing partners. But in the U.S., it so far has only signed on 350 publishing partners.\n\nAccording to Parse.ly, SmartNews didn't start to really distribute traffic to publishers until the summer of 2017. In March of 2018, that growth accelerated even further, and has been trending upwards ever since. To date, traffic referrals to publishers have grown by 125%, per Parse.ly.\n\nHow it works: SmartNews is similar to Apple News in that it selects traffic distribution partners to work with and helps them set up channels that users can follow. But when it comes to most traffic referrals, the app relies on algorithms to elevate news from vetted publishers in its feed.\n\n\"Quality is a big weight in the algorithm,\" says Nicolas. The push alerts SmartNews sends that drive big traffic spikes to U.S. publishers are algorithmically selected, and then reviewed by a human curation team. That team will also respond to content that is flagged as problematic by users.\n\n\"If you're a publisher, the best way we can do something together is to make sure you have a channel, and to make sure your channel is correctly indexed. We are happy to work on co-marketing strategies, but trust machine learning will do the job and provide quality content from curated sources. We think this can really help people move away from filter bubbles.\"\n\nBetween the lines: Axios spoke with several audience development professionals from different types of publishers, and while most agreed that the added traffic surges from SmartNews are helpful, many argued that they haven't yet become a very strategic audience development partner for a number of reasons.\n\nIt doesn't have a great sense of editorial strategy. Publishing executives complain that it will alert breaking news coverage from outlets that didn't actually break the news, often pushing an aggregated story. Traffic spikes are high, but not as sustained. \"Traffic shoots up but quickly wanes after it's moved from the top position on the SmartNews feed,\" says one audience development manager. Bounce rates are very high. Because there's little strategy around audience development and platform optimization, it's hard to build audience loyalty with a brand on SmartNews, which means people visit the article after it's pushed to them, but don't engage further with a news brand after that. There's no pitch process. Publishers say they've offered to pitch news strategically to the app, but it only ranks news algorithmically after a publisher is added as a curated source.\n\nThe bottom line: SmartNews is starting to send a lot of news traffic to U.S. publishers, but there's no real mechanism to build an audience yet. For now, it's an added bonus, but not a platform that a company can really invest in strategically."

Ancestry.com and 23andMe say they require a warrant or subpoena before they consider turning over data to law enforcement. It's not the first time genetic data has been used in cold cases. To catch the Golden State Killer last year, police detectives compared crime scene DNA against publicly available genetic data to identify the suspect.\n\nDrugmakers also want access. Ancestry.com and 23andMe \u2014 the largest companies that, combined, have DNA data of 15 million users \u2014 both share anonymized genetic data with outside researchers and companies.\n\nLast summer, 23andMe struck a drug-development deal with GlaxoSmithKline, and it's working on developing its own line of drug treatments.\n\nAncestry has worked with Google spinoff Calico to study human longevity.\n\nThe companies say they obtain customers' \"informed consent\" \u2014 or explicit permission \u2014 before DNA is used in scientific or medical research.\n\nKathy Hibbs, 23andMe's chief legal and regulatory officer, said that assembling large aggregated datasets of human DNA can speed up drug development. The company says 80% of its customers opt in to research programs.\n\n\"It's not individual data that's interesting for research \u2014 it's the ability to look at large groups of people to see what's unique.

But DNA data that is unique is arguably not capable of being fully de-identified and would still be personally identifiable, Hepp said. So use of such data \u2014 even if all identifying information is removed \u2014 may require consent, and it may even become part of your medical record.\n\nLast year, the Future of Privacy Forum worked with 8 leading DNA testing companies, including 23andMe, Ancestry and Helix, to establish best (but voluntary) practices for data use and security \u2014 as well as restrictions on marketing based on DNA data and allowing consumers to delete their data.\n\nYes, but: \"Even if a consumer deletes their DNA information, that is only effective if the DNA hasn't already been shared,\" Hepp said. \"This is new territory.\"\n\n\"Even if a consumer deletes their DNA information, that is only effective if the DNA hasn't already been shared,\" Hepp said. \"This is new territory.\" Also, \"subsequent researchers may want to use genetic data for future investigations, making it difficult to keep participants abreast of the various uses of their genetic data,\" according to a paper published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings journal last summer.\n\nThe DNA services have grown popular without most consumers realizing that their data could be used for purposes other than genealogy, such as forensics, said Benjamin Berkman, a bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health, who wrote about ethical issues of using genealogy data to solve crimes in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nNot so long ago, serious concerns were raised about genetic research because of fears about potential discrimination by insurance companies and employers.

This is just the first of several phases, however; next phases could expand the capacity of the array to 92 megawatts, and later to as much as 252 megawatts.\n\nBetween the lines: Proving that a given energy technology works at a competitive price point takes time, but is crucial to attract the private investment needed to see the project ramp up to full capacity. It's a classic catch-22: Investors want demonstrated performance before investing, but the companies need capital in order to demonstrate proof of concept over long periods.\n\nThe challenge of proving reliability is even more significant for marine energy because of unique environmental factors, such as saltwater corrosion, biofouling (degradation caused by microorganisms), and, in the case of tidal turbines, underwater operation.\n\nThe bottom line: The scale of MeyGen may be modest in comparison to some of the recent offshore wind leases, which operate on the order of gigawatts, rather than megawatts, but it is nevertheless an important project to the marine energy sector that will help prove its viability.\n\nDavid Hume is a contractor supporting the marine renewable energy portfolio at the U.S. Department of Energy's Water Power Technologies Office and the founder of The Liquid Grid.

North Korea is the one ferocious holdout among the remaining Communist nations, but even there markets have been changing the nature of the economy,\u201d Englund writes.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un is in the midst of a multi-day train journey to Vietnam, where he will hold his second summit with President Trump. Since taking power in 2011, Kim\u2019s top priorities (other than consolidating power) have been to bolster North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and its beleaguered economy.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community believes Kim views nuclear weapons as so critical to the survival of his regime that he is unlikely to ever give them up.\n\nHaving made substantial progress on the nuclear front, though, Kim used his New Year\u2019s address to lay out a \u201cnew strategic line focusing exclusively on the economy,\u201d says Suzanne DiMaggio, a Carnegie fellow who has facilitated dialogue with the North Koreans on behalf of both the Obama and Trump administrations.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, he has to deliver on it,\u201d DiMaggio adds, and he won\u2019t be able to without relief from sanctions. Trump hasattempted to sell Kim on the idea his country \u201cwill rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse\u201d if he only gives up his nukes.\n\nVietnam, which liberalized its economy beginning in the 1980s, in many ways represents the future the Trump administration is encouraging Kim to pursue.\n\n\u201cProsperity and security abound. When the leaders in Hanoi go to bed at night, the notion of conflict with America is the last thing on their minds,\u201d Secretary of State Pompeo said on a visit to Vietnam last year before addressing Kim: \u201cIt can be your miracle in North Korea as well.\u201d\n\nChina's economic might is viewed in Washington less as a miracle than as a threat. But Trump today gave the clearest indication yet that he plans to wind down a trade war that has posed pointed questions to Beijing.\n\nHe has been demanding fundamental changes to China\u2019s economic model on issues like intellectual property, forced technology transfers and support to state-owned enterprises.\n\nTrump said today that after \u201csubstantial progress\u201d on those fronts, he expects to sign a deal with President Xi Jinping, perhaps next month at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHowever, Axios contributor Bill Bishop writes in his Sinocism newsletter: \u201cEverything I am hearing supports that idea that Chinese have offered little in the way of the core structural concessions the U.S. wants, but Trump is eager for a deal regardless of what some of his advisors are telling him.\u201d\n\nFinally in Cuba, voters have ratified a new constitution for the first time since 1976."

    "text": "A decade ago, the theories and actions of America's financial elite boiled over into the Great Recession, the fallout of which is still with us. Now we are hearing a new, ultra-assured drumbeat from the same circles \u2014 spend, spend, spend, because public debt doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: According to the new gospel, big countries like the U.S. that print their own money appear able to run up debt without economic consequence. In op-eds, papers and speeches, some of the best-known economic minds seem to have given the green light to splurge with abandon on normally guilty items like unfunded tax cuts and big social programs.\n\nBe smart: Contrary to articles in the WSJ, the NYT and Foreign Affairs, the new orthodoxy of public debt is much more caveated than many are suggesting \u2014 no serious economist I know of has given blanket permission to let loose on top of the current $22 trillion in U.S. debt.\n\nAnd many of its high priests appear to have ulterior motives. \u201cBoth sides want to feel free to spend heavily on their priorities and their base when in power,\u201d Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of \u201cThis Time is Different,\u201d tells Axios.\n\nThe big picture: The birth story of the new zeitgeist is innocent enough. Back in the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes proposed deficit spending in times of want in order to induce consumer demand, reignite production and get people back to work. For similar unassailable policy reasons, the U.S. ran up a historically high debt in World War II, equaling 106% of GDP.\n\nAll along, though, the flip side has been that, in times of plenty, you pay down the debt in order to avert a spike in inflation and interest rates and to avoid crowding out economically more productive private investment.\n\nhas been that, in times of plenty, you pay down the debt in order to avert a spike in inflation and interest rates and to avoid crowding out economically more productive private investment. This is what the new orthodoxy is challenging: The economic record shows that \u2014 especially for the U.S., as the holder of the default global currency for loans, investments, commodities and more \u2014 debt creates little or no inflation, interest rate or investment penalty, debt proponents say.\n\nWho are the debt proponents?\n\nIn a Jan. 4 speech, Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist for the IMF, gave new cover for high deficit spending in a low-interest rate environment. And in his annual shareholder letter, Warren Buffett said, \u201cThose who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits (as I regularly did myself for many years) might note that our country\u2019s national debt has increased roughly 400-fold\u201d over the last 77 years.\n\nBut proponents have quoted selectively: Blanchard said that the motive behind his remarks was \u201cto show that high public debt is bad, but may not be catastrophic.\u201d\n\nBlanchard said that the motive behind his remarks was \u201cto show that high public debt is bad, but may not be catastrophic.\u201d In his letter, too, Buffett voiced no support for limitless deficit spending and debt. He merely argued against panicking when it happens, and for continuing to invest. If he had panicked over the years, he wrote, he would be worth almost nothing today.\n\nDebt proponents have paid less attention to a Jan. 28 speech by Keith Hall, director of the Congressional Budget Office. Hall forecast that the debt will grow to 93% of GDP by 2029, and 150% by 2049, the largest in U.S. history. That\u2019s up from 78% of GDP at the end of last year and 34% before the financial crash.\n\n\u201cDebt is on an unsustainable course,\u201d Hall said.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "text": "Polls show that non-junta parties, including those linked to the populist politician Thaksin Shinawatra, will do well if the vote is free. But the electoral environment is already unfair: The junta limited the period of campaigning, Thailand's top court might dissolve one major pro-Thaksin party, and Thai police could prosecute another top opposition leader.\n\nStill, it's very possible that a coalition of anti-junta, pro-democracy parties, including several who have vowed to cut the military's budget, could take a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.\n\nYes, but: The military is keeping all its options open, in one of the few wealthy or middle-income countries on earth where coups are still common. In a recent, rare, interview with Singapore's Straits Times, hardline army commander Apirat Kongsompong refused to rule out a coup in the future and offered veiled threats against anyone who disrespects the armed forces.\n\nThailand\u2019s king, too, is hardly a democrat. As the army prepares to hold on to power, he has grown increasingly powerful, and appears to want to push Thailand back in the direction of an almost absolute monarchy.\n\nAlthough he does not technically have the right to determine who can and cannot run in elections, he effectively prevented his sister, Princess Ubolratana (who had renounced her title and is technically a private citizen) from running for prime minister at the head of one of the pro-Thaksin parties.\n\nWhat to watch: Even without a coup, the armed forces could try to prevent an anti-junta coalition from wielding power by using the judiciary, widely seen as allied with the army and the crown, to start disqualifying politicians on dubious charges, a tactic used in Thailand many times in the past.\n\nJoshua Kurlantzick is senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations."

Steps toward a peace agreement would provide a foundation for future successful negotiations between the two countries.\n\nWhere it stands: South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been making efforts to build a better relationship with Kim Jong-un and between their respective governments.\n\nThis diplomatic approach has borne fruit, including the removal of landmines and guard posts within the Demilitarized Zone and the discussion of opening a joint liaison office in the North Korean city of Kaesong.\n\nNorth Korea has reciprocated with matching overtures of its own, leading to agreements that might precede more decisive actions.\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, is considering an economic package that could encourage Kim Jong-un to agree to dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\n\nThis would mark a departure from Washington\u2019s past efforts of \"maximum pressure\" on North Korea and could, along with similar actions on the part of the U.S., make the prospects of denuclearization more realistic.\n\nThe bottom line: Inter-Korean diplomacy has offered a path toward normalizing relations and disarmament. If the U.S. wants North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, it must support South Korean overtures and take a more measured, holistic policy to reduce tensions and lay the foundation for trust. A peace treaty to formally end the Korean War would benefit U.S. efforts to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.\n\nBonnie Jenkins is the founder and executive director of Women of Color Advancing Peace, Security and Conflict Transformation, a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and a former ambassador at the U.S. Department of State."

    "text": "Background: Many Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries have advocated applying the TEP to NS2, which they see as Russia\u2019s attempt to expand its influence by dominating the European gas market.\n\nBut some Western EU members strongly support NS2. Germany \u2014 where the pipeline would land \u2014 sees the investment as a way to facilitate its energy transition goals with natural gas backing up its renewable power.\n\nDetails: The compromise leaves the EC 2 options: negotiate directly with Russia on how EU laws apply to the stretch of the pipeline in German waters, or allow Germany to negotiate while keeping supervisory power and the ability to step in or take over if needed.\n\nThe big picture: The proposal\u2019s passage reveals much about the EU\u2019s operational dynamics.\n\nEU institutions make it difficult for either its most powerful members (Germany) or any group of countries (CEE) to impose their preferred outcomes on the entire union. It matters which country drives the agenda, and rotating positions with short terms provide a check on self-interest and a reason for compromise: The proposal moved very quickly as NS2-skeptical Romania succeeded NS2-supportive Austria in the EC presidency. The NS2 debate illustrates that conflicts of interest impair common EU policy. That should worry the EU as euroscepticism gains momentum.\n\nWhat's next: If the proposal becomes law, NS2 likely won't be abandoned, but might suffer construction delays, cost increases and revenue losses. Germany will likely try to cushion these impacts by pushing for TEP exemptions. The EC can step in if it believes EU members' interests and antimonopoly laws are at stake, but that could expose further divisions on both NS2 and other pipeline projects.\n\nAnna Mikulska is a nonresident fellow in energy studies at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute's Center for Energy Studies and a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy.

Last month, those numbers were 20% and 75%, respectively.\n\nAmong Americans under 45, 47% identify as pro-life vs. 48% pro-choice. In January, those numbers were 28% and 65%, respectively.\n\n\"This has been a measure that has been so stable over time. To see that kind of change was surprising,\" Carvalho said. \"And the increased discussion [of late-term abortion] in the public forum in the past month appears to have made the biggest difference in how people identify on the issue.\"\n\nWhy it matters: Republicans have been on the offensive about this issue since the State of the Union, when Trump seized on the outrage over Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s abortion comments and the passage of a New York law to promote a congressional ban on late-term abortions.\n\nIn November, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed a new rule that would require insurers send customers separate bills for coverage provided for abortion services.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration issued a new rule barring organizations that provide abortion referrals, like Planned Parenthood, from receiving federal family planning money.\n\nAxios health care editor Sam Baker points that by far the most significant thing Trump has done on abortion is replace Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy with Brett Kavanaugh. \"State abortion restrictions will very likely be upheld no matter what public opinion is.\"\n\nGo deeper:\n\nMethodology: This survey of 1,008 adults was conducted via landline or cell phones, Feb. 12\u2013Feb. 17 by The Marist Poll, sponsored and funded in partnership with The Knights of Columbus.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been corrected to reflect that, among Americans under 45, 47% identify as pro-life vs. 48% as pro-choice.

But over the past decade or so, inflation has been a non-factor, even after back-to-back years of above trend growth and government spending binges.\n\nEconomists have argued about the reasons, pointing at everything from the internet to the lack of unions to globalization to the way companies have invested their profits. But the end result remains the same.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"We've got inflation well under control here, and we don't need to be pre-emptive trying to control inflation going forward,\" St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday.\n\nIn an interview the same day, Bullard elaborated, saying there has been a breakdown in the \"Phillips curve,\" or the relationship between unemployment and inflation. \"That's got people backing off the idea that there\u2019s such a lockstep relationship between the real economy and inflation,\" Bullard said.\n\nFurther, officials at the Federal Reserve now are reconsidering the 2% inflation target that has been in effect since 2012.\n\nOther central banks also are moving away from raising rates or slowing down stimulus as inflation has globally gone missing in developed markets like the Japan and Europe as well.\n\nBut, but, but: The ongoing crisis in Venezuela has shown that too much money chasing too few goods can still create problems. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's money printing has led to an expected 10,000,000% inflation this year, undermining any attempts to stabilize the country's currency or its economy.\n\nGo deeper: Warren Buffett argues government budget deficits don't matter"

There are now more than 50 DNA-testing kit services on the market, estimates Carson Martinez, a health policy fellow at the Future of Privacy Forum.\n\nMIT Technology Review predicts more than 100 million people may be part of commercial genetic databases within the next two years.\n\nAmid controversies over internet companies' collection of personal data, millions are paying to hand over DNA samples to a largely unregulated industry.\n\nSome worry law enforcement, employers or insurance companies could end up using that DNA information against them.\n\nDriving the news: This month FamilyTreeDNA came under fire for voluntarily giving the FBI routine access to its database of more than 1 million users' data, allowing agents to test DNA samples from crime scenes against customers' genetic information to look for family matches.\n\nFamilyTreeDNA apologized for not disclosing the agreement to consumers. The company told the NYT that users can disable the \"matching\" option to prevent their data from being visible. Ancestry.com and 23andMe say they require a warrant or subpoena before they consider turning over data to law enforcement.\n\nfor not disclosing the agreement to consumers. The company told the NYT that users can disable the \"matching\" option to prevent their data from being visible. Ancestry.com and 23andMe say they require a warrant or subpoena before they consider turning over data to law enforcement. It's not the first time genetic data has been used in cold cases. To catch the Golden State Killer last year, police detectives compared crime scene DNA against publicly available genetic data to identify the suspect.\n\nDrugmakers also want access. Ancestry.com and 23andMe \u2014 the largest companies that, combined, have DNA data of 15 million users \u2014 both share anonymized genetic data with outside researchers and companies.\n\nLast summer, 23andMe struck a drug-development deal with GlaxoSmithKline, and it's working on developing its own line of drug treatments.\n\nAncestry has worked with Google spinoff Calico to study human longevity.\n\nThe companies say they obtain customers' \"informed consent\" \u2014 or explicit permission \u2014 before DNA is used in scientific or medical research.\n\nKathy Hibbs, 23andMe's chief legal and regulatory officer, said that assembling large aggregated datasets of human DNA can speed up drug development. The company says 80% of its customers opt in to research programs.\n\n\"It's not individual data that's interesting for research \u2014 it's the ability to look at large groups of people to see what's unique. It's the aggregate data, not individual data, that's meaningful.\"\n\n\u2014 Kathy Hibbs, 23andMe\n\nA firm called Helix acts like an \"app store\" platform that gives third-party software developers access to parts of customers' DNA data for apps and personalized services that consumers opt into separately. Helix has partnerships with around 25 companies. Fitness and wellness apps are among the most popular, said Elissa Levin, Helix's senior director of clinical affairs and policy.\n\nFor example, weight-loss app Lose It integrates genetic information to tailor diet and exercise recommendations.\n\nHelix analysts work closely with third parties to provide privacy guidelines, but does not dictate their policies, Levin said.\n\nPersonal DNA tests are used to help predict genetic risk factors for health complications. 23andMe offers FDA-approved genetic risk reports for inherited breast cancer and colorectal cancer.\n\nThe results may allow customers to manage their own health, but can also lead to revelations that are surprising or alarming.\n\n\"We're encouraging companies to provide education to consumers about the risks and benefits and unintended consequences of the results,\" said John Verdi of the Future of Privacy Forum.\n\nReality check: Commercial DNA-testing services aren't specifically covered by federal privacy rules, such as HIPAA, because they aren't health providers or insurers.\n\nThey are subject to the FTC's protections around privacy disclosures, as well as some FDA standards for how data is used in drug and medical device research.\n\nBut protections can get murky when genomic data is used for human-subject medical research or for treatment, says Pamela Hepp, a health care attorney at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney specializing in data privacy.\n\nFor example, research using de-identified data in a clinical setting may not require participants' consent. But DNA data that is unique is arguably not capable of being fully de-identified and would still be personally identifiable, Hepp said. So use of such data \u2014 even if all identifying information is removed \u2014 may require consent, and it may even become part of your medical record.\n\nLast year, the Future of Privacy Forum worked with 8 leading DNA testing companies, including 23andMe, Ancestry and Helix, to establish best (but voluntary) practices for data use and security \u2014 as well as restrictions on marketing based on DNA data and allowing consumers to delete their data.\n\nYes, but: \"Even if a consumer deletes their DNA information, that is only effective if the DNA hasn't already been shared,\" Hepp said. \"This is new territory.\"\n\n\"Even if a consumer deletes their DNA information, that is only effective if the DNA hasn't already been shared,\" Hepp said. \"This is new territory.\" Also, \"subsequent researchers may want to use genetic data for future investigations, making it difficult to keep participants abreast of the various uses of their genetic data,\" according to a paper published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings journal last summer.\n\nThe DNA services have grown popular without most consumers realizing that their data could be used for purposes other than genealogy, such as forensics, said Benjamin Berkman, a bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health, who wrote about ethical issues of using genealogy data to solve crimes in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nNot so long ago, serious concerns were raised about genetic research because of fears about potential discrimination by insurance companies and employers.

    "text": "Why it matters: The D.C. Circuit feeds judges to the Supreme Court \u2014 raising the stakes of Rao's confirmation. She's already had a bumpy ride. Hawley isn't the only Republican senator to register concern about Rao, and in this polarized environment she can't afford to lose many others when the Senate votes on her soon. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said during Rao's committee hearing that Rao's 1990s writings on date rape \"do give me pause.\"\n\nWhat we're hearing: I checked with Hawley and he confirmed what I was told about him. He elaborated on his concerns in a phone interview on Sunday. \"I am only going to support nominees who have a strong record on life,\" Hawley told me.\n\n\"To me, that means ... someone whose record indicates that they have respect for what the Supreme Court itself has called the interests of the unborn child; someone whose record indicates they will protect the ability of states and local governments to protect the interests of the unborn child to the maximum extent ... and number three somebody who will not extend the doctrines of Roe v. Wade and Casey, which I believe are deeply incompatible with the constitution.\"\n\nHawley said he'd read Rao's academic work and was concerned that some of her writings suggested to him that she might be comfortable with \"substantive due process\" \u2014 a legal interpretation, loathed by many conservatives, that can be used to protect rights, such as the right to an abortion, that aren't mentioned in the Constitution.\n\nHawley told me that if there's evidence out there that Rao opposes substantive due process he'd like to see it.\n\nAfter Axios published the Sneak Peek newsletter on Sunday, another Republican senator reached out to say they had concerns about Rao's judicial philosophy and views on abortion.\n\nHawley added: \"I have heard directly from at least one individual who said Rao personally told them she was pro-choice. I don't know whether that\u2019s accurate, but this is why we are doing our due diligence.\"\n\nBehind the scenes: Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life group, also raised concerns about Rao with the White House. But Dannenfelser told me on Sunday she's no longer concerned about Rao, at least so far as her appointment on the D.C. Circuit.\n\nThe other side: Word spread around some conservative movement figures that Axios was working on this story about Rao.\n\nCarrie Severino, chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network, a group that spends millions on Republican Supreme Court confirmations, blasted Hawley in an unsolicited statement:\n\n\u201cNeomi Rao is President Trump\u2019s nominee to the second highest court in the land because she is committed to the Constitution and because she has been a warrior in President Trump\u2019s fight against government overreach. Sadly, barely a month after moving to Washington, Josh Hawley is already acting like Claire McCaskill when it comes to judges. Instead of supporting President Trump's top judicial nominee, he is spreading the very same kind of rumors and innuendo and character assassination that Republican leaders fought during Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Hawley could be working to confirm her and other extraordinary nominees, but it seems he\u2019d rather be making headlines.\u201d\n\nAmericans for Prosperity plans to ramp up its grassroots and digital advertising efforts this week urging the Senate to support Rao. AFP President Tim Phillips called Rao \"fair, impartial, extremely qualified,\" adding that she has the group's \"full support.\"\n\nAnd a Rao ally who is familiar with the process told me he disagreed vehemently with Hawley's interpretation of Rao's academic work. He said there's no evidence she supports substantive due process and \"some of her writings describe the problems that other people have pointed out with that doctrine.\"\n\n\"One final thing,\" the source said. \"Any U.S. senator who is running on the legacy of Ronald Reagan ought not to be using any political or social policy litmus tests for whether they're going to vote for a judge.\"\n\nGo deeper: Trump's pick for Kavanaugh replacement grilled over controversial op-eds"

    "text": "The survey also found that 80% of Americans support abortion being limited to the first three months of pregnancy, an increase of 5 percentage points since last month's Marist poll.\n\nBetween the lines: Marist has been polling Americans' attitudes on abortion for over a decade, and Carvalho told Axios this is the first time since 2009 that as many or more Americans have identified as pro-life as have identified as pro-choice.\n\nBut what Carvalho said she found most significant was that Democrats, specifically those under the the age of 45, seem to be leading the shift: This month's poll found 34% of Democrats identify as pro-life vs. 61% pro-choice. Last month, those numbers were 20% and 75%, respectively.\n\nAmong Americans under 45, 47% identify as pro-life vs. 48% pro-choice. In January, those numbers were 28% and 65%, respectively.\n\n\"This has been a measure that has been so stable over time. To see that kind of change was surprising,\" Carvalho said. \"And the increased discussion [of late-term abortion] in the public forum in the past month appears to have made the biggest difference in how people identify on the issue.\"\n\nWhy it matters: Republicans have been on the offensive about this issue since the State of the Union, when Trump seized on the outrage over Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s abortion comments and the passage of a New York law to promote a congressional ban on late-term abortions.\n\nIn November, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed a new rule that would require insurers send customers separate bills for coverage provided for abortion services.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration issued a new rule barring organizations that provide abortion referrals, like Planned Parenthood, from receiving federal family planning money.\n\nAxios health care editor Sam Baker points that by far the most significant thing Trump has done on abortion is replace Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy with Brett Kavanaugh. \"State abortion restrictions will very likely be upheld no matter what public opinion is.\"\n\nGo deeper:\n\nMethodology: This survey of 1,008 adults was conducted via landline or cell phones, Feb. 12\u2013Feb. 17 by The Marist Poll, sponsored and funded in partnership with The Knights of Columbus.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been corrected to reflect that, among Americans under 45, 47% identify as pro-life vs. 48% as pro-choice. (An earlier version of this story stated those figures reflected Democrats under 45.)"

Jackie Speier, who serves on both the House Oversight and Intelligence committees, told Axios she thinks Michael Cohen could be \"the John Dean of the Watergate crime\" \u2014 some Democratic members privately acknowledge they don't expect Cohen to offer any new, substantially damaging information on Trump.\n\n\"We can't go into Russia stuff, because we can't in any way say something that hampers an ongoing investigation,\" said a Democratic aide on the House Oversight Committee. \"Because of those parameters \u2026 it's not going to be any more damaging than what you've already seen.\" (House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings laid out 10 areas of focus for the hearing in a letter last week, and noted Russia was off-limits.)\n\nInstead, Cohen will talk about Trump's character, and is expected to describe the \"dirty deeds\" he claims Trump directed him to carry out \u2014 some of which made him a felon.\n\n\"What Michael Cohen has to say will confirm what people already know about Donald Trump,\" Lanny Davis, Cohen's attorney, told Axios. \"The question is, some people care about Michael's experience with repetitive lies and misconduct that in the private sector seem less surprising, but as president may seem very frightening.\"\n\n\"This is his chance to tell America in some comprehensive way what his involvement with Trump did to his life and what Trump is doing to our country,\" said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who serves on the Oversight committee.\n\nCohen's closed-door hearings before the Senate and House Intelligence committees (Tuesday and Thursday) may be more fruitful than the public Oversight hearing given both committees plan to focus on ties between Trump's 2016 campaign and the Kremlin, as well as whether foreign entities have any leverage over Trump, his family, and his businesses, according to sources on both committees.\n\n\"We will be conducting a closed-door interview with Mr. Cohen to fully explore his previous testimony before our committee, allow him to correct the record, and answer questions related to our probe,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"We are particularly interested in hearing from Mr. Cohen about the Trump Tower Moscow project and any other foreign financial entanglement...\"\n\nA Democratic staffer on the Senate Intelligence Committee indicated their questioning will be similar, but said they'll also ask about allegations in the Steele Dossier that Cohen met with Kremlin officials in the Czech Republic in 2016, as well as whether any foreign payments were made to Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nGo deeper: How the Mueller probe closed in on Michael Cohen"

    "title": "Inside Trump's Venezuela pivot",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Behind the scenes: A pivotal moment came in early 2017, when Lilian Tintori, the wife of political prisoner Leopoldo Lopez, met Trump in the Oval. The conversation wasn't planned, and the State Department didn't even know she was in the building; she had come for a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence that Sen. Marco Rubio arranged.\n\nToward the end of their conversation, Pence said to Tintori, \"I want to introduce you to somebody. Come this way,\" according to a source with direct knowledge. Then he and Rubio walked her into the Oval.\n\nTrump had no idea who she was. But he was taken by their conversation, some details of which The Washington Post first reported. After a short talk, Trump handed his iPhone to his social media guru, Dan Scavino.\n\n\"Take a picture, Dan,\" he ordered.\n\nScavino snapped a photo of Trump, Tintori, Rubio, and Pence. Then Trump drafted a caption to accompany the photo for Twitter.\n\n\"What do you think, Marco?\" the president asked, handing the phone to Rubio. \"You can edit it if you want.\"\n\nRubio eyeballed the tweet \u2014 sources dispute whether he changed anything \u2014 then handed the phone back to Trump, who hit send. And with that, the United States toughened its stance toward the Maduro regime.\n\n\"At the time, we were like, 'Wow, he just stuck it to Maduro!'\" said a source with direct knowledge of the conversation.\n\nWhy this matters: Conversations like this one have shaped Trump's Venezuela approach. Privately, Trump often talks about his fondness for the Venezuelan expats who frequent his golf club in Doral.\n\n\"We have many Venezuelans living in the United States,\u201d he said in a press conference last September. \"Many of them live in the Doral area of Miami. I've gotten to know them well. They are great, great people. We are going to take care of those people.\"\n\nBetween the lines: That's not all, of course. His senior advisers universally support unseating Maduro. And people close to Trump say he takes a markedly different view of Venezuela than Middle Eastern war zones. He sees Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq as beyond help, a waste of American lives and money. Venezuela, in his view, is different: It's a neighbor, and a crisis there directly affects the U.S., via trade and migration. Trump thinks Venezuela should be rich and peaceful.\n\n\"Venezuela is not anything like the Middle East; it is a western country, with western institutions and western cultural leanings,\" said Rubio, a key player in Trump's Venezuela policy.\n\n\"The president sees this country with extraordinary economic potential, which has been run into the ground,\" Rubio told me. \"I think he believes some of these issues in the Middle East are intractable and just can't be fixed. But he actually thinks Venezuela and the western hemisphere can [be fixed].\"\n\n\"He also takes some of this stuff personally. The fact that Maduro and others have reacted the way they have [with their fiery rhetoric about Trump]... Ultimately there comes a point, for this president, where he become personally invested in it...he becomes an enemy and then he goes after you pretty hard.\"\n\nPolitical opportunism also plays a big role. \"It's a real-life example of the failure of socialism and there's an appeal in that,\" a senior White House official told me.\n\nTrump and his advisors see their approach as a way to court Venezuelan expats, who may be friendly to the American right-wing because of the failure of Maduro's leftist government.\n\nThe fact that the bulk of those expats live and vote in Florida, of all states, is not lost on Trump and his political team.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump's instincts on Venezuela find daily reinforcement from the growing uprising on the ground there, the rare unity with other democratic Western governments, largely favorable media coverage, and bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "text": "Nobody has had more influence over Trump's Venezuela policy than Pence.\n\nNational Security Advisor John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Sen. Marco Rubio also play pivotal roles, but from the first days of the Trump presidency, Pence has dominated the issue.\n\nIt was Pence who ushered the wife of a Venezuelan political prisoner into the Oval Office for a historic meeting with Trump.\n\nIt was Pence who made the administration's first tour of Latin American countries, in the summer of 2017, soon after Trump threatened to use military force in Venezuela.\n\nIt was Pence who phoned Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, in January, and told him Trump would back him if he declared himself Venezuela's interim president. (Guaid\u00f3 did so the next day, and Trump kept Pence's promise.)\n\nPence has rallied Venezuelan expats at churches throughout Florida and Latin America, making the faith-based case for overthrowing Maduro.\n\nOn Monday, Pence will give a speech in Bogot\u00e1, at the invitation of Colombia\u2019s president, touting the U.S.'s \"unwavering support\" for Guaid\u00f3, who he will also meet with. It will be Pence's fifth trip to Latin America as VP.\n\nThe big picture: Pence also exerts power on other critical foreign policy issues. He publicly \u2014 and controversially \u2014attacked European allies in a recent Warsaw speech for not supporting Trump's maximum pressure campaign on Iran.\n\nHe infuriated Turkish officials while working with Trump to secure the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson from a Turkish prison.\n\nHe also gave the toughest speech on China by any American leader in recent history, and has worked with key officials, including John Bolton, to shape the administration's China policy.\n\nBut Latin America is closest to his heart. As an Indiana congressman, Pence fiercely opposed Castro and railed against communism in Latin America. His faith colors his work. \"We are with you,\" Pence told a crowd of several hundred South Florida Venezuelans at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church after his first vice presidential trip to Latin America, in the summer of 2017.\n\n\"I remember standing at a shelter in Colombia where he was deeply impacted by the stories of the refugees,\" recalls Pence's former chief of staff Nick Ayers.\n\n\"One grandmother told the story of watching her young grandchildren leave their home before 5 a.m to go stand in breadlines all day, only to receive one small piece of bread. She held his hand while crying and explained that they were once proud and happy people, now they were hungry and homeless. It was an emotional moment for him.\"\n\nGo deeper:"

    "text": "Details: The panel would be the reincarnation of an idea put forward by former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who pushed for a \"red team-blue team\" debate on the science modeled after military studies. That proposal was squashed by then-White House chief of staff John Kelly. However, in the new version, there is no other team representing mainstream climate science \u2014 other than climate reports themselves.\n\nThe new panel will likely include William Happer, a physicist who sits on the National Security Council and has long argued that more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will benefit humanity \u2014 a view contradicted by thousands of studies.\n\nBetween the lines: The Trump administration appears to have the National Climate Assessment in its crosshairs. The administration released the assessment on Black Friday last year in an attempt to bury its findings.\n\nThe report detailed the ways that climate change is already harming Americans nationwide, and emphasized that there will be more severe impacts to come if greenhouse gas emissions are not dramatically reduced.\n\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the NCA, telling Axios on HBO that the climate goes through natural cycles, \"Is there climate change? Yeah. Will it go back like this, I mean will it change back? Probably.\"\n\nHe also portrayed it as a report primarily prepared by federal agency scientists working under the Obama administration.\n\nThe state of play: Trump has presented the NCA as an Obama-era project, but most of the report was written and reviewed during Trump's time in office, says Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and lead author of the NCA.\n\nIt underwent an exhaustive peer review process that consisted of 2 rounds of review by the numerous federal agencies responsible for climate science activities, multiple public review periods, and 2 rounds of scrutiny from a panel of independent experts put together by the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe report garnered 3,416 comments, which are available online along with the responses.\n\n\"This is the most exhaustively reviewed report on climate change in the U.S.,\" Hayhoe said, noting she responded to hundreds of public comments individually. \"At this point the question is who is going to review this who has not already had the chance? The answer is no one. Everyone had a chance to review this.\"\n\nUnlike the NCA, the new White House panel may be structured to be exempt from disclosure requirements, meaning that it would not have to submit its work for peer review, the Post reports.\n\nWhat they're saying: Mainstream climate scientists and other experts were withering in their criticism about the proposal.\n\n\"This is like assembling a panel of 'gravity skeptics' who insist it\u2019s safe to jump off tall buildings, except in this case they want to take us all with them,\" NASA climate scientist Kate Marvel tells Axios.\n\n\"Really what we're seeing is what I call a 'zombie-idea'. This is a truly bad idea that just refuses to die. All bureaucracies have them \u2014 they are just more dangerous when they originate and live in the White House,\" retired Rear Admiral David Titley, who served as oceanographer of the Navy, tells Axios.\n\nChris Field, director of Stanford's Woods Insitute for the Environment, notes that a new panel within the White House would also depart from past practice. He tells Axios that the George W. Bush administration turned to the National Academies for such insight on climate science in 2001, leading to the publication of a report that went on to guide policy.\n\nGo deeper: Trump's pipeline of bad climate information"

But adding its own fleet of autonomous trucks could drive its prices down even further and thwart rivals' attempts to leverage AV tech through Waymo, Aurora or others.\n\nDetails: Amazon formed a small team to investigate driverless technology several years ago and partnered with Toyota in early 2018 to explore AV deliveries. It has also been spotted using self-driving trucks to haul cargo in Arizona. But in recent weeks, they've doubled down...\n\nIn January, Amazon introduced Scout, a cooler-sized, electric robot for last-mile deliveries.\n\nEarlier this month, it joined a $530 million investment round in AV startup Aurora Innovation, led by an all-star team of engineers from Google, Tesla and Uber.\n\nA week later, it led a $700 million investment in Rivian, whose modular electric chassis can be adapted for virtually any type of vehicle.\n\nWith Aurora's self-driving system and Rivian's flexible \"skateboard,\" Amazon could potentially fashion different sized AVs for any purpose.\n\nThe bottom line: Amazon has a history of expanding into areas within its own value chain wherever it can be successful, notes Roy Bahat of Bloomberg Beta. \u201cAutomated vehicle technology is now mature enough that it's within the striking distance of Amazon's long arm.\u201d\n\nGo deeper: The next five years of Amazon"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The big picture: Increasing numbers of experts say the concentration of wealth in big cities, along with the rise of automation, is putting low-wage jobs out of the physical reach of workers.\n\nOften they live on the periphery of cities, without easy access to public transportation.\n\nAnd for the first time in the nation's history, big numbers of Americans have stopped moving for work. Even when there are jobs in another city or state, they have been unwilling, for reasons no one has been able to decisively explain, to pick up and start a new life.\n\nBoth workers and employers are getting hit.\n\nAs we've reported, about 13 million working-age people in the U.S. are unemployed, involuntarily working part-time or have wholly given up on the job hunt. The problem, though, isn't a lack of jobs \u2014 employers complain that they can't fill open positions \u2014 but a slew of barriers.\n\nA new report from the Urban Institute analyzed 2017 application data across several types of low-wage, hourly jobs in 16 major U.S. cities, looking at the mismatch between openings and job seekers by zip code.\n\nIn 41% of Boston-area zip codes, there were far more openings than job-seekers who lived a reasonable distance away. In other words, most possible applicants lived too far from the workplace \u2014 there either was no efficient public transportation to the job, or it cost too much to get there.\n\nthere were far more openings than job-seekers who lived a reasonable distance away. In other words, most possible applicants lived too far from the workplace \u2014 there either was no efficient public transportation to the job, or it cost too much to get there. In New York, 32% of zip codes had this problem. In San Francisco, 29%.\n\n32% of zip codes had this problem. In San Francisco, 29%. The trend stretched to middle-sized cities, too: 24% of Denver-area zip codes had this mismatch. In Columbus, 37%.\n\n\"These are people who are looking to enter the job market, and if they can't find it feasible from a transportation or cost or distance perspective, that's saying that there are significant barriers in place.\"\n\n\u2014 Joseph Kane, Brookings Institution\n\nThe backdrop: Half a century ago, there was a hollowing out of big cities. As high-earning workers moved to suburbs, low-income residents were left behind.\n\nToday, as cities have had a resurgence, there are tons of jobs in downtowns, but gentrification and a surge in housing costs are once again keeping low-income workers away from jobs, says Yingling Fan, a professor at the University of Minnesota.\n\nWhat's happening: Poorer city residents live in the \"last-subway-stop\" parts of cities, a couple of hours, or further, from work \u2014 and they can't afford to move.\n\nOften, the long commute is not worth the trouble. \"You could take a couple buses to that restaurant job if there\u2019s a career ladder there or if the wages and benefits are worth it,\" says Christina Stacy, lead author of the Urban Institute report. But that's rarely the case.\n\nAnother bucket of low-wage jobs, those in factories or warehouses, have the opposite problem. Companies like Amazon are building their warehouses far away from city centers, close to airports and highways and away from major public transit lines. They can be difficult to access without a car, says Brookings' Kane.\n\nIn Minneapolis, Amazon and General Mills have started offering shuttles to ferry workers from the city to the warehouses, reports the Star Tribune.\n\nThe solution is two-fold, Stacy tells Axios: Cities need to revisit train and bus lines and build affordable housing closer to downtown. \"Until we figure out how to make every job a high-quality job, connecting people to a job is crucial.\""

Both leaders travel with secure communications and nuclear codes.\n\nPelosi will be in New York Monday morning and D.C. in the afternoon, according to a spokesperson.

But he found nothing. \"It was a real surprise to me that so many other species have been sequenced and coffee was kind of like an orphan,\" he tells Axios. So he and a team at UC Davis set about doing it themselves, focusing on a variety of the popular arabica plant. They published initial findings in 2017 and are continuing to map out the genome, convinced it could be the key to saving coffee.\n\nThe goal is a more robust plant: Medrano and other biologists are looking for genes associated with resistance to deadly diseases like coffee rust, or with resilience against increasingly common extreme temperatures and drought. If they can connect genes with the physical characteristics they control, they could create plants that can stand up to steadily worsening threats.\n\nAmong the challenges:\n\nMapping the genome is a long and expensive process, made difficult by the complexity of the most popular type of coffee plant, a hybrid of two other species. \"It's like doing a puzzle \u2014 where you have four puzzles with slight differences mixed together,\" says Megan Hochstrasser of the Innovative Genomics Institute, a partnership between UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco.\n\nmade difficult by the complexity of the most popular type of coffee plant, a hybrid of two other species. \"It's like doing a puzzle \u2014 where you have four puzzles with slight differences mixed together,\" says Megan Hochstrasser of the Innovative Genomics Institute, a partnership between UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. And researchers don't always have the raw materials they require. \"The lack of research in coffee agronomy and biology in the last 20 years means that there are currently few gene candidates for editing that could result in agronomically relevant traits, like disease and pest resistance, climate adaptation, improved yields or new qualities,\" says Alvaro Gaitan, director of Cenicaf\u00e9, Columbia's national coffee research center.\n\nThe upside is that the labs have several tools to work with.\n\nMedrano's preferred approach is to breed plants, selecting for traits that make them hardy.

I don\u2019t believe it is inevitable. But as World War I showed, you can stumble into war \u2014 a war which nobody wants. We are still a ways away \u2014 somewhere in the 1890s by my estimation.

Did capitalism disintegrate when nationalism/authoritarianism were dominant forces between 1800 and 1945? No. It eventually rose to take over the world. Geopolitics is critical to the equation. To say that 'capitalism is disintegrating' is different from saying we are returning to geopolitical competition over spheres of influence and to the historic divide between democracies and authoritarians. And the two together suggest increasing likelihood of conflict, especially if Americans are not interested in deterrence any more.\"\n\nRichard Haass, Council on Foreign Relations\n\n\"The internal challenges capitalist/developed/democratic countries are facing are real and could threaten social cohesion and our willingness and ability to tackle international challenges.

Most major U.S. cities have fewer than 13 paratransit vehicles for every 100,000 residents.\n\nWhere it stands: Even in large metropolitan areas, the current supply of wheelchair-accessible vehicles is too low to provide reliable, on-demand transportation. This lack of supply cuts across public transit, private transportation companies like Uber, and taxi services.\n\nWhat's happening:\n\nVW, Toyota and Renault have concept AVs that could accommodate wheelchair users.\n\nAccessibility features for blind people embedded in the Android and iOS smartphone operating systems, along with application developer tools, could be programmed into human-machine interfaces in AVs.\n\nWhat we're watching: The market for accessible AVs is large and projected to grow. The U.S. wheelchair-using population is expected to grow 120% by 2022, and the Census Bureau projects that by 2030 an additional 21.5 million Americans over age 55 will need alternatives to driving themselves.\n\nHenry Claypool is a policy expert affiliated with UCSF and the American Association of People with Disabilities, and a former director of the U.S. Health and Human Services Office on Disability."

    "text": "Details: Tan allegedly downloaded hundreds of confidential files, including information related to manufacturing a downstream energy market product, and planned to provide the information to his new Chinese employer.\n\nWhy it matters: Corporate espionage and IP theft is an expensive problem, costing the U.S. up to $600 billion annually. If the Chinese government succeeds in stealing energy manufacturing and research secrets from the U.S., American energy companies may end up competing against their own technological innovations and ideas. This would severely stunt U.S. innovation and global energy leadership.\n\nYes, but: The burden of current U.S. regulatory structures also encourages American energy companies to take advanced energy research to China, further putting them at risk for stolen IP.\n\nIn response, the Department of Energy recently implemented a policy restricting the ability of U.S. companies to develop new nuclear energy technology in China \u2014 a move that may protect national security and intellectual property, but at the expense of energy innovation.\n\nThe bottom line: Tan\u2019s case is a fresh reminder of China's willingness to engage in corporate espionage in the fight for global energy dominance \u2014 and the country shows no signs of slowing down. While the Department of Energy has taken reasonable steps to prevent IP theft, including banning recruitment programs suspected of foreign spying, a more effective response would also require Congress and the energy industry to join forces and explore regulatory reforms.\n\nSarah E.

Many Wi-Fi-equipped devices today never get connected because consumers either don't see enough benefit or get frustrated with the set-up process.\n\nEverything is encrypted, with secure credentials stored on the device itself.\n\nUsing Notecard, devices can connect to cloud providers like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft\u2019s Azure without ever having to cross the public internet, offering additional security benefits.\n\nYes, but: The problem is more than a technical one, Ozzie acknowledges: Cellular connections cost money, and efforts to connect devices in the past left customers to manage the data costs themselves.Blues Wireless hopes to take that hassle away by using a Kindle-like business model, selling the modules at enough of a profit to cover the cost of the device and the wireless data the devices will use. It isn't saying just how much it expects to charge.Also, Blues is still small, using mostly contractors and bankrolled by Ozzie.\n\nHistory lesson: In the past, Ozzie's brainstorms have typically been directionally correct but ahead-of-their-time products looking to capitalize on shifts in the way people and computers interact. This time around, Ozzie says he's banking on making it easier for companies to get on board an inevitable hardware trend."

    "text": "Driving the news: A slew of media reports about anti-vaccination videos thriving on social media services has sent companies scrambling to address them. Most recently, BuzzFeed published a report explaining how the problem is prevalent on YouTube. Health experts are calling on Facebook to manage anti-vaccination groups.\n\nThe problem has gotten even more attention as members of Congress begin to publicly address the issue, which has troubled platforms for years.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff last week sent a letter to Google and Facebook requesting additional information on the steps they're currently taking to provide medically accurate information on vaccinations to users.\n\nThe big picture: Tech companies prefer not to serve as content arbiters and have long struggled to balance free-speech ideals with efforts to limit undesirable online interactions like hate speech, bullying and misinformation. But the issue is harder to duck when the spread of false information can lead to real-world harm.\n\nFor this reason, many companies are taking stronger action against false vaccine-related information than they have in other areas of dubious content.\n\nEach company is addressing the problem differently. Some are removing search results for vaccinations altogether. Others are treating medically inaccurate content like a policy violation.\n\nYouTube: The company announced last month it will begin reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways, including videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness. \"This includes certain types of anti-vaccination videos,\" the company says.\n\nThe company announced last month it will begin reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways, including videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness. \"This includes certain types of anti-vaccination videos,\" the company says.

However, Axios searches for \"vaxxer\" or even \"autism vaccine\" still returned a slew of returns, suggesting it's still fairly easy for a user to be exposed to this content.\n\nThe bottom line: In taking action against anti-vaccination content, online platforms are accepting arguments made by health care professionals and policymakers that they should treat it more as an incitement to public harm, like shouting \"fire\" in a crowded theater, than as reasonable debate."

Republicans are seizing on the issue and President Trump, who is pushing Maduro to step aside, recently visited Miami where he sought to make inroads with Venezuelan-Americans and other Democratic-leaning Latinos who have fled Venezuela's authoritarian regime."

When the U.S. led the nuclear market through the 1990s, Washington cultivated long-term partnerships with emerging economies and designed strong international nuclear nonproliferation and security standards. The U.S. risks losing this advantage if Russia and China take the reins.\n\nMoscow has a demonstrated history of exploiting energy dependencies for political gain in Europe. Beijing, too, has already made predatory investments, trapping countries in debt. Each nuclear reactor exported could serve as a source of geopolitical leverage for Russia and China over its lifespan of 60\u201380 years.\n\nThe bottom line: Insider dealing and sidestepping of Congress, while irresponsible and counterproductive, have little to do with the national security merits of a nuclear deal.

However, they saw far fewer touches and landings from biting flies, which can spread disease, than bare horses did.\n\nVideo analysis showed that horse flies approached zebras at faster speeds and failed to decelerate before hitting their skin. Proportionately, more horse flies hit zebras and simply bounced off when compared to horse fly approaches to horses, which involved more successful landings and bites.\n\nThe horses cloaked in stripes saw fewer fly landings on the striped portions, but there were no differences in landings and bites to their bare heads.\n\nWhat they're saying: \u201cStripes may dazzle flies in some way once they are close enough to see them with their low-resolution eyes,\u201d How said in a press release."

    "title": "Scientists call for rules on evaluating predictive AI in medicine",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The FDA tells Axios it is working on developing a framework to handle advances in AI and medicine, as pointed out by Commissioner Scott Gottlieb last year. While unable to comment on this paper, a spokesperson says the FDA has used its current process for novel medical devices to authorize these AI algorithms:\n\nViz.ai for helping providers detect stroke in CT scans.\n\nIDx-DR for detecting diabetic retinopathy.\n\nOsteoDetect for detecting bone fractures.\n\nMeanwhile, Ravi B. Parikh, co-author of the paper and a fellow at University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine, tells Axios that the FDA needs to set standards to evaluate the \"staggering\" pace of AI development. He adds:\n\n\"Five years ago, AI and predictive analytics had yet to make a meaningful impact in clinical practice. In just the past 2-3 years, premarket clearances have been granted for AI applications ranging from sepsis prediction to radiology interpretation.\"\n\n\"But if these tools are going to be used to determine patient care ... they should meet standards of clinical benefit just as the majority of our drugs and diagnostic tests do. We think being proactive in creating and formalizing these standards is essential to protecting patients and safely translating algorithms to clinical interventions.\"\n\nWhy it matters: Advanced algorithms present both opportunities and challenges, says Amol S. Navathe, co-author and assistant professor at Penn's School of Medicine. He tells Axios:\n\n\"The real opportunity is that these algorithms outperform clinicians in medical decisions, not a small feat. The challenge is that the data generated for algorithms is not randomly generated, rather, most of [what] the data algorithms 'see' is a result of a human decision. We have a ways to go in our scientific approaches to overcome this challenge and uniformly develop algorithms that can help improve upon human clinician decisions.\"\n\nDetails: The authors list the following as recommended standards...\n\nMeaningful endpoints for clinical benefit from the algorithms should be rigorously validated by the FDA, such as downstream outcomes like overall survival or clinically relevant metrics like the number of misdiagnoses. Appropriate benchmarks should be determined, similar to the recent example of the FDA approving Viz.AI, the deep-learning algorithm for diagnosing strokes, after it was able to diagnose strokes on computed tomography imaging more rapidly than neuroradiologists. Variable input specifications should be clarified for all institutions, such as defining inputs for electronic health records so results are reliable across institutions. Plus, algorithms should be trained on data sources from as broadly representative populations as possible so they are generalizable across all populations. Guidance on possible interventions that would be connected to an algorithm's findings to improve patient care should be considered. Run rigorous audits after FDA clearance or approval, particularly to check on how the new variables included by deep-learning may have altered its performance over time. For instance, regular audits could find the algorithm had a systematic bias against certain groups after being deployed across large populations. This could be tracked in a manner similar to the current FDA Sentinel Initiative program for approved drugs and devices.\n\nOutside comment: Eric Topol, founder and director of Scripps Research Translational Institute, who was not part of this paper, says the timing of these proposed standards is \"very smart\" before advanced algorithms are placed into too many devices.\n\n\"[The algorithm] doesn't translate necessarily into helping people,\" Topol tells Axios. \"It can actually have no benefit.\"\n\nEven worse, he adds, if the variables are off, the predictive analyses can have negative ramifications.\n\nWhat's next: The scientists hope the FDA considers integrating the proposed standards alongside its current pre-certification program under the Digital Health Innovation Act to study clinical outcomes of AI-based tools, Ravi says."

(Previously, the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv handled all matters relating to Gaza while the consulate in Jerusalem dealt with the West Bank and Jerusalem.)\n\nBetween the lines: The merger might create the impression that the administration envisions not a two-state solution, but what Israel's Netanyahu has called a \"state-minus\" Palestinian entity, with most of Jerusalem, save some potential adjustments, falling under Israeli sovereignty, along with much of the West Bank.\n\nComing a month before Israeli elections, the merger will also strengthen the bond between Trump and Netanyahu and further the perception that the administration wants Netanyahu re-elected.\n\nThe other side: Palestinians will see the merger of the consulate \u2014 after the closing of the Palestinian Liberation Organization office in Washington \u2014 as a further effort to downgrade their status. It will only fuel the apprehension that the Trump administration has no policy toward Palestinians beyond pressure and that Washington has surrendered its role as an effective broker.\n\nWhat to watch: The administration's most decisive litmus test for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will come after Israel's April 9 elections, when it plans to unveil its much-touted \"ultimate deal\" Middle East peace plan. The odds of success for such an unprecedentedly comprehensive peace plan are vanishingly small.\n\nAaron David Miller is vice president for new initiatives and director of the Middle East Program at the Wilson Center and a former Middle East analyst and negotiator at the State Department under Democratic and Republican administrations."

Now, the only goal is the latter \u2014 the Kim regime declared victory on the former last April.\n\nNorth Korea's chief resource right now, beyond its heavily sanctioned mineral deposits, is a giant corps of state-sanctioned cyber criminals.\n\n\"North Korea will want to leapfrog its way into the global economy,\" said Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike. \"Vietnam is frequently mentioned as the model North Korea would follow to build a sustainable economy. But China would be on the table, too.\"\n\nWhile CrowdStrike isn't seeing any current intellectual property theft, Meyers suggested a shift (if one is coming) could happen in the next two years.\n\nDepending on the continuation of sanctions, there aren't too many ways to spur economic growth in North Korea, noted Meyers \u2014 there are no viable sources of external investment.\n\nYes, but: North Korea lacks the infrastructure for the kinds of high-tech manufacturing that China succeeded with. Despite the finest 1970s-era Soviet manufacturing technology, North Korea doesn't have the equipment to mass-produce cheap, modern products, even if it stole the know-how to make them.\n\nAlso, \"they\u2019re making a fair amount of money through hard currency, and they'd have to reassign those resources to do this,\" noted a skeptical Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nSegal views North Korean IP theft as a technically possible but remote chance.\n\nWhat they're saying: Other experts thought the possibility was, at least, something to monitor.\n\nRobert Manning, an Atlantic Council resident senior fellow with previous stints at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and State Department, said he wouldn't be surprised by the development. But he cautioned that any intellectual property theft would probably skew toward goods that are easy to fabricate.\n\nThat would include products like pharmaceuticals and pirated movies rather than the consumer, telecommunications and computer memory chip products China appropriated. Of course, North Korea might steal more complex secrets and sell them to other nations, Manning said.\n\nJenny Town, an analyst for the Stimson Center and managing editor of its North Korea-focused 38 North blog, said the shift CrowdStrike is predicting is something to watch out for.\n\n\"It has been dangerous in the past to underestimate North Korea on these things,\" Town said.\n\nThe big picture: With a summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un slated for next week, the isolated regime's international situation is more in flux than it has been for decades."

Mahathir will be visiting China in April and participating in the second Belt and Road Forum. It\u2019s a major diplomatic event, and Chinese officials are even more eager than usual to play up the BRI\u2019s successes and downplay its failings.\n\nYes, but: Counterintuitively, one of the smartest things China could do to change the narrative around the BRI is cancel more projects, getting rid of bad deals that have accumulated and raising the bar on the BRI.\n\nThe problem is that megaprojects are always hard to kill. After starting, they have strong constituencies to defend them, and few rewards for those who try to cancel them. Sunk costs can be a powerful, and dangerously misleading, justification for spending even more. It\u2019s why management experts call megaprojects \u201cVietnams\u201d \u2014 easy to begin and difficult and expensive to stop.\n\nChinese projects are even harder to kill because the Belt and Road is Xi Jinping\u2019s signature foreign policy initiative. Large projects like Malaysia\u2019s railway take on symbolic importance, and cancellation comes with a higher reputational cost.\n\nWhat to watch: The political incentives on both sides encourage salvaging deals and saving face, creating the conditions for bigger failures later on. Keeping too many Belt and Road projects from the grave could come back to haunt China and its partners.\n\nJonathan Hillman is director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies."

Scoville.\n\nTrump's ambassadors' average contribution far exceeded the previous record of $60,721.83 set by George W.

Meanwhile, just 58.6% of Trump's appointees were career Foreign Service Officers, a record low among presidents since Ronald Reagan.\n\nScoville's paper is based on more than 1,900 certificates of competency \u2014 documents the president is legally required provide to Congress for each ambassadorial appointment. He obtained most of them from the State Department under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nIn addition to experience in the Foreign Service, Scoville compares presidents' ambassadorial appointees by how familiar they are with their host countries, an area where Trump's ambassadors fare somewhat better.\n\nKey data points:\n\nAmong ambassadors chosen from outside the Foreign Service , the average contribution to the president who nominated them was about $88,135.

Kach was also blacklisted as a terrorist organization in the U.S., Canada and the EU.\n\nKahane managed to get elected in 1984 and was boycotted by all other parties in the Knesset.\n\nHe proposed a series of racist laws that would have stripped non-Jews of citizenship, mandated separate beaches for Jews and Arabs, and more. At the time, senior members of the Likud attacked Kahane's policies and said they were similar to the Nuremberg Laws passed by the Nazis before the Holocaust.\n\nThere are direct links from Kahane to Jewish Power today.\n\nBaruch Marzel, now a senior member of Jewish Power, was chairman of Kach after Kahane was assassinated.\n\nItamar Ben Gvir, another senior member, was convicted of supporting a terror organization and inciting racism.\n\nMichael Ben Ari \u2014 a former member of the Knesset from Jewish Power \u2014 was denied a visa to the U.S. due to his membership in a terror organization (Kach).\n\nOver the last two weeks, Netanyahu has made tireless efforts to unite Jewish Power and two other radical right-wing, pro-settler parties into one party.\n\nNetanyahu made phone calls to rabbis and family members of party members and issued numerous public statements calling on them to unite.\n\nHe signed a formal agreement with the united ultra right-wing party promising its members two ministerial posts in the next government, as well as two seats in the Security Cabinet.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, he even promised a spot on Likud's election list for one of the united party's members.\n\nWhat to watch: Netanyahu wants to make sure all three factions pass the electoral threshold so that no right-wing votes go to waste. He also wants to make sure the right-wing bloc in the Knesset gets at least a 61-member majority. Such a majority will allow him to stay in power and face a potential corruption indictment against him from a position of greater strength.\n\nBehind the scenes: Inside Likud \u2014 the same party that ostracized Kach and Kahane in 1984 \u2014 there hasn't been even a whiff of criticism over a move designed to get the Israeli equivalents of David Duke into the Knesset."

It offers a computing platform with a plethora of chip offerings for deep learning that take advantage of GPUs' massive parallel computation abilities. Next-generation technology, however, will introduce more efficient chip architectures designed expressly for deep neural network computation rather than graphics processing.\n\nGoogle has developed a circuit called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) that has run common neural networks 15\u201330 times faster than a comparable GPU, and used far less power to do so.\n\nGraphcore, a startup, develops accelerators and software framework together, which arguably combine to make the fastest and most flexible platform for AI applications. Graphcore has developed an Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), which offers promise for AV use.\n\nWhat to watch: Roughly 12\u201315 companies are pulling ahead with their next-generation AI chips, but solidifying a lead will require producing and scaling them as well, which could favor established players or motivate smaller companies to merge with larger ones, as Nervana Systems and Intel did.\n\nBibhrajit Halder is the CEO of an early-stage AV startup and has worked on autonomous vehicles at Ford, Caterpillar and Apple.

    "text": "\"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, a Class 4 felony, weeks after he reported he was the victim of a hate crime, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday evening.\n\nThe details: \"Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest,\" Guglielmi tweeted. Smollett, who's black and gay, told police on Jan. 29 that he was attacked in Chicago by two people who yelled homophobic and racist slurs. But in recent days, the case took a strange turn amid reports that detectives were considering whether the attack was a hoax."

    "text": "Flashback: For decades, Democratic presidential candidates have stood out by branding themselves as the tech-savvy candidate in the race.\n\nGary Hart, who mounted primary campaigns in 1984 and 1988, was one of several lawmakers branded \"Atari Democrats\" in the 1980s because they championed tech investments.\n\nAl Gore was another Atari Democrat who ran for president, hitting the 2000 trail\n\nHoward Dean famously embraced what he called \u201cthe Net\u201d to plot his his presidential run, before his \u201cDean scream\u201d went viral\n\nBarack Obama dined with tech leaders, hired a Facebook co-founder to build his online organizing operation and weighed in on tech issues like net neutrality.\n\nEven early on, debates about technology were proxies for broader societal shifts. Hart said that his 1984 Democratic primary with Walter Mondale \"divided the country\" around questions of how to deal with changes wrought by technology and globalization.\n\nNow, candidates are all declaring their tech bona fides.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) called for digital privacy and net neutrality rules while announcing her candidacy. \u201cHey guys, it\u2019s not just coming, it\u2019s here. And if you don\u2019t know the difference between a hack and Slack, it\u2019s time to pull off the digital highway,\u201d she said.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) made online harassment a signature issue as a prosecutor and took on some tech issues in the Senate.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was an early proponent of stronger antitrust policies to take on tech giants.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), spokesperson Evan Lukaske said in an email, thinks America lags on privacy and cybersecurity.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is friendly with Mark Zuckerberg and tried to lure Amazon\u2019s HQ2 to Newark, but has also expressed concerns about the size and power of large tech companies.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) mounted a successful campaign against Amazon over its labor practices.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is exploring a long shot bid, said he's interested in questions around job automation, cybersecurity and consumer privacy. He, too, is friendly with Zuckerberg.\n\nAnd Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), another long shot candidate, has called for policies that reckon with job automation due to artificial intelligence.\n\nThe bottom line: \u201cWhen everybody\u2019s mom and dad and grandpa can operate a phone and be on social platforms, it\u2019s not a differentiator,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).\n\nYes, but: Tech issues are rarely at the top of voters\u2019 agendas compared to pocketbook or public safety issues.\n\nA Klobuchar aide said the challenge will be convincing voters that the tech issues that play a huge role in their lives matter in the campaign.\n\nThis group of Democratic candidates skews slightly younger, meaning they've come up in the era of the internet. Sanders, who joined the race this week, and former Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to say whether he is entering, belong to an older generation.\n\nDriving the news: Democrats have given up on their cozy relationship with Silicon Valley as major companies face controversies over privacy, content moderation and their market power.\n\n\u201cSenator Gillibrand believes technology, when harnessed correctly, can create jobs, strengthen American security, and expand educational opportunities,\u201d said Gillibrand's spokesperson Lukaske. \u201cHowever, she also recognizes that governments and private businesses can exploit an individual's personal data, which must stop.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: Once, understanding the way technological innovation was transforming America might have seemed novel, but now it's just reality \u2014 and stands to drive political conversations for decades to come."

Earlier on Wednesday, Pompeo said Mathana would not be re-admitted into the country because she has no \"legal basis\" to claim American citizenship. However, a representative for Muthana claims she is a citizen and that she was born to a former diplomat in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1994."

California is dialing down expectations for the much-vaunted high-speed line from San Diego to Sacramento and San Francisco, which now will focus just on the Central Valley.\n\nWhy it matters: A strong passenger rail system would help America reduce greenhouse emissions, ease the stress on our degraded road infrastructure and provide an option for young urbanites to keep avoiding cars.\n\nThe bottom line: Amtrak will struggle to make this happen. The Senate blocked a proposal to convert part of one long-distance line into a bus route last year, by a vote of 95 to 4, the Journal notes."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Background: Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro counts Ortega among his closest allies, and the Ortega regime's troubles stemmed partially from the recent end of Venezuelan aid and oil subsidies.\n\nFor over a decade, economic growth had compelled Nicaraguans, especially the country\u2019s business elite, to accept Ortega's democratic erosion and consolidation of his family dynasty.\n\nHowever, the regime's marriage of political authoritarianism with economic liberalism \u2014 Ortega was more an IMF darling than a 21st-century socialist \u2014 proved unsustainable. In April 2018, anger over corruption and rigged elections exploded into street protests.\n\nWhere it stands: Repression, widespread terror and inchoate economic collapse threaten to create a refugee crisis and further destabilize a region already plagued by weak institutions and transnational organized crime, especially in the so-called Northern Triangle.\n\nYes, but: Nicaragua mostly evades the spotlight.\n\nIt lacks the geopolitical stakes of the imbroglio in Venezuela, which possesses the world\u2019s largest oil reserves.\n\nUnlike Maduro, who benefits from leftist nostalgia for the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Ortega long ago abandoned the socialist politics of the 1980s Sandinista Revolution that once garnered sympathy from global progressives.\n\nFinally, Nicaragua is largely irrelevant to U.S. electoral politics: Nicaraguans account for less than 1% of the U.S. Hispanic population, about one-fifth the share of Cubans.\n\nThe EU and most Latin American countries see early elections as the solution. But early talks between opposition groups and the government have stalled for months.\n\nIn a bid to force democratic concessions from Ortega, the U.S. government sanctioned several individuals in his ruling circle, while Congress passed wide-ranging economic sanctions with broad bipartisan support.\n\nWhat to watch: It's unclear if such pressure will succeed in bringing Ortega, still backed by the country's security forces, to the negotiating table. Only one thing is certain: The Nicaraguan people, already among the hemisphere's poorest, will increasingly suffer the consequences of a prolonged crisis.\n\nMateo Jarqu\u00edn is a doctoral candidate in the department of history at Harvard University."

Without a driver, AVs would be able to deliver goods even cheaper and faster, KPMG researchers say, increasing pressure on brick-and-mortar retailers and triggering even more online shopping.\n\nMcKinsey predicts autonomous deliveries will slash retailers\u2019 shipping costs by 40%.\n\nContext: Several big-name retailers are already experimenting with driverless delivery.\n\nKroger is partnering with the newly flush Nuro to deliver groceries with robot vehicles in Arizona.\n\nWalmart has enlisted Waymo, Google's self-driving car unit, to bring shoppers to its stores in autonomous minivans, though it isn't delivering goods in AVs.\n\n\"The economics of pulling the driver out of the vehicle to get the last mile or the last 50 feet is astonishing. That's why everybody is investing in AV technology.\"\n\n\u2014 Gary Silberg, automotive sector leader, KPMG\n\nYes, but: Amazon is bigger and stronger. Its Prime membership business, worth an estimated $100 billion per Morgan Stanley, has already overwhelmed the competition with its speedier and cheaper delivery.\n\nLast holiday season, the company kicked off a race to the bottom on shipping prices by offering free delivery for weeks.\n\nAmazon already has thousands of trucks, a handful of airplanes and even some drones that it uses to deliver packages.\n\nAmazon faces the same challenges as others \u2014 AV technology is new and widespread deployment is not a given. But adding its own fleet of autonomous trucks could drive its prices down even further and thwart rivals' attempts to leverage AV tech through Waymo, Aurora or others.\n\nDetails: Amazon formed a small team to investigate driverless technology several years ago and partnered with Toyota in early 2018 to explore AV deliveries. It has also been spotted using self-driving trucks to haul cargo in Arizona. But in recent weeks, they've doubled down...\n\nIn January, Amazon introduced Scout, a cooler-sized, electric robot for last-mile deliveries.\n\nEarlier this month, it joined a $530 million investment round in AV startup Aurora Innovation, led by an all-star team of engineers from Google, Tesla and Uber.\n\nA week later, it led a $700 million investment in Rivian, whose modular electric chassis can be adapted for virtually any type of vehicle.\n\nWith Aurora's self-driving system and Rivian's flexible \"skateboard,\" Amazon could potentially fashion different sized AVs for any purpose.\n\nThe bottom line: Amazon has a history of expanding into areas within its own value chain wherever it can be successful, notes Roy Bahat of Bloomberg Beta. \u201cAutomated vehicle technology is now mature enough that it's within the striking distance of Amazon's long arm.\u201d\n\nGo deeper: The next five years of Amazon"

But they now look prescient \u2014 or calculated.\n\nThe big picture: As recently as November, the Fed had clearly articulated a plan to raise interest rates 3 times this year and to reduce its balance sheet by $50 billion a month, on \"automatic pilot.\" That would have pulled U.S. interest rates to 3.00\u20133.25% and reduced balance sheet holdings to around $3.5 trillion. Those numbers are much closer to normal interest rates and balance sheet holdings throughout the Fed's history.\n\nBe smart: The lower interest rate could be reflective of the lack of inflation currently in the economy, but the increased level of debt held by the Fed on its balance sheet suggests policymakers still feel the need to stimulate what Williams on Tuesday called an economy \"in a very good place.\"\n\nThat's not how this is supposed to work.\n\nDon't forget: The Fed isn't just holding $4 trillion in U.S. Treasuries and mortgage debt, it's actively buying new debt to replace bonds that mature.\n\nIn his remarks earlier Tuesday, Williams said he expects the Fed to continue reducing its balance sheet this year.\n\nGo deeper: \"No one believes the Fed\" on interest rates"

Scoville.\n\nTrump's ambassadors' average contribution far exceeded the previous record of $60,721.83 set by George W. Bush's ambassadors.\n\nfar exceeded the previous record of $60,721.83 set by George W. Bush's ambassadors. Meanwhile, just 58.6% of Trump's appointees were career Foreign Service Officers, a record low among presidents since Ronald Reagan.\n\nScoville's paper is based on more than 1,900 certificates of competency \u2014 documents the president is legally required provide to Congress for each ambassadorial appointment. He obtained most of them from the State Department under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nIn addition to experience in the Foreign Service, Scoville compares presidents' ambassadorial appointees by how familiar they are with their host countries, an area where Trump's ambassadors fare somewhat better.\n\nKey data points:\n\nAmong ambassadors chosen from outside the Foreign Service , the average contribution to the president who nominated them was about $88,135. Among career Foreign Service Officers, by contrast, the average contribution was only about $31.\n\n, the average contribution to the president who nominated them was about $88,135.

Arnall served as ambassador to the Netherlands from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe big picture: Though favored by presidents, America's preference for selecting ambassadors from outside the professional diplomatic corps is rare among advanced democracies and is opposed by the U.S. Foreign Service's professional association."

More than 3.5 million people have sought safety in Turkey, which now hosts more refugees than any other country in the world. The likelihood that they will be able to return home in the near future is low.\n\nWhere it stands: Turkey already has a customs union with Europe, but it covers only manufactured goods. Expanding the arrangement to cover agricultural products could open up new opportunities for refugees to join the workforce. Agreements between the EU and two other refugee-hosting countries, Jordan and Lebanon, could prove useful (if imperfect) models for how to engage the private sector in such an endeavor.\n\nThe bottom line: How Turkey fares at integrating newcomers will bear significantly on the wellbeing of millions of people and the trajectory of consequential migration flows.\n\nJessica Brandt is a fellow in the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution.

If Pakistan\u2019s military leaders fear that their nuclear deterrent is at risk, they will reinforce their terrorist proxies.\n\nBetween the lines: Pakistan\u2019s aggressive approach to its security has left itself and its neighbors poorer and more violent. But that does not mean that Pakistan can be ignored.\n\nWhile Pakistan\u2019s control of the Taliban is often exaggerated by Afghan political elites seeking to minimize the civil nature of Afghanistan\u2019s war, it can still provide safe haven and other support to dissatisfied Afghan groups, using them as proxies to undermine any peace deal if it thinks its interests \u2014 including the ongoing conflict with India \u2014 have not been taken into account.\n\nWhat to watch: Navigating Afghan peace will require that the Trump administration not only stick to a clear message, but also prioritize the peace process when making decisions linked to the issue in complex, non-obvious ways. A deal with the Taliban that secures some important U.S. and Afghan interests remains possible, but not if the U.S. chooses unnecessary public confrontations with Pakistan on less urgent issues.\n\nJarrett Blanc is a senior fellow in the Geoeconomics and Strategy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace."

    "text": "Details: The 100-page report by the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee on \"Disinformation and 'Fake News',\" released Sunday, says Facebook only acts to protect user privacy when problems become public.\n\n\"Facebook has not provided us with one example of a business excluded from its platform because of serious data breaches,\" the report says. \"We consider that data transfer for value is Facebook's business model and that Mark Zuckerberg's statement that 'we've never sold anyone's data' is simply untrue.\"\n\nThe report also accuses Facebook of failing to cooperate with its inquiry.\n\nWith regard to one organization that distributed pro-Brexit messages, the committee wrote: \"We consider Facebook\u2019s response generally to be disingenuous and another example of Facebook\u2019s bad faith. \" It also accuses Zuckerberg of \"showing contempt\" for the U.K. Parliament.\n\nThe report makes extensive use of files from a U.S. lawsuit \u2014 against Facebook, by a company called Six4Three \u2014 that Parliament seized from an American businessman's laptop. The files, the committee said, show that \"working with 'sketchy' or 'abusive' apps\" is \"an intrinsic part\" of Facebook's business model.\n\n\"The evidence that we obtained from the Six4Three court documents indicates that Facebook was willing to override its users' privacy settings in order to transfer data to some app developers, to charge high prices in advertising to some developers for the exchange of that data, and to starve some developers \u2014 such as Six4Three \u2014 of that data, thereby causing them to lose their business.\"\n\nThe big picture: The EU and other European agencies have been moving against Facebook, Google, and other tech companies for the past year and show no sign of slowing down.\n\nThe EU's antitrust authority is in the process of levying a $5 billion fine against Google for using the Google Play app store to promote its own apps.\n\nFrance also brought a $57 million penalty against Google under the EU's GDPR privacy rules.\n\nGermany's antitrust authority is moving to bar Facebook from certain kinds of data collection, charging that the company is abusing its market power.\n\nThe EU has a variety of content regulation efforts underway, including a proposed \"link tax.\"\n\nThe U.K. Information Commissioner's Office levied the maximum fine allowed under GDPR for Facebook's role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which it failed to prevent the now-defunct British company from working with a third-party developer to gain access to millions of users' personal data so they could be targeted with political ads.\n\nIn the U.S., by comparison, moves against Facebook on the antitrust front have been minimal, and privacy-related enforcement lacks the teeth GDPR gives the EU.\n\nFacebook has been accused of violating terms of a 2012 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to protect user privacy, and last week the Washington Post reported that the commission and Facebook are discussing a new settlement that would fine Facebook billions of dollars.\n\nYes, but: The European assault on big tech platforms under GDPR privacy regulations and EU antitrust rules may take a toll on Facebook and Google, but complying with the region's labyrinth of regulations will be even harder for upstart challengers and smaller competitors.\n\nOur thought bubble: Europe starts out with a more privacy-oriented culture than the U.S. and is less conflicted about antitrust action. When it comes to regulating Big Tech, Europe had the \"first-mover advantage,\" and it's keeping it.\n\nFacebook's response: \"We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee's recommendation for electoral law reform ... We also support effective privacy legislation ... While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago.\""

    "text": "This is all according to security expert Bruce Schneier, who will host the first symposium on the subject at March's RSA conference (\"Bridging the Gap: Cybersecurity + Public Interest Tech\").\n\n\"But it's not just a policy problem,\" Schneier told Axios' Codebook newsletter. \"Civil groups need cybersecurity professionals for protection.\"\n\nThe big picture: There's plenty of need for hackers to serve in public interest roles \u2014 but groups are unaware they need the help, and there is little infrastructure to guide civic minded security pros to those groups.\n\nThis isn't an abstract problem. We've recently seen nations target outmatched nongovernmental groups that antagonize them in even trivial ways. Mexico appears to have spied on advocates of a soda tax in 2017 with militarized spyware that's only sold to governments.\n\nSchneier sees the gap as two solvable problems: \"There's a supply problem and a demand problem,\" he noted.\n\nQualified professionals don't currently know they are needed. And when they do, they often don't know how to get involved.\n\nAdvocacy, governmental and charitable groups will never be able to pay as much as the private sector.\n\nBut, said Schneier, that hasn't stopped these groups from being able to employ other traditionally highly paid workers at steep discounts. \"I don't know how to solve the salary issue,\" he said, noting that volunteering and rotating in and out of public service jobs might be an option. \"But I do know that the ACLU can only pay a fraction of what a law firm can, but that every time there is an opening they get 100 applicants.\"\n\nThe demand problem can be especially complicated for protection positions.\n\nMany public interest groups don't realize they are targeted by governments. Those that do might still decide they'd prefer to use their limited resources on their actual mission rather than on cybersecurity protection.\n\nBut the problem has grown big enough that the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab has built an international reputation by investigating nation state breaches of public service groups.\n\n\"High risk groups have resource constraints all over the place,\" said Citizen Lab's John Scott-Railton, who will appear at the RSA symposium. \"A top flight researcher is going to go to an NGO and discover they haven\u2019t set their printer up correctly.\"\n\nBetween the lines: Security tech doesn't work without a qualified person to run it, said Scott-Railton. This isn't a problem that can be solved without funneling new bodies into the sector.\n\nRSA is a high profile conference attracting much of the field's talent. It's also a particularly business-focused event, making this a unique place to launch this initiative. Schneier said he doesn't know what size crowd to expect. But sometimes, he said, just getting the conversation started is enough.\n\nGo deeper: \"White hat\" hackers fill companies' cybersecurity demand"

By 2014, total screen time among children aged 0 to 2 years had risen to 3.05 hours per day. In comparison with other devices, screen time allocated to television comes in highest.\n\nIn 1997, the study found that on average, children ages 0-2 and ages 3-5 watched television for roughly 43% and 48% of their screen exposure, respectively.\n\nIn 2014, the study found that on average, children ages 0-2 and ages 3-5 watched television for roughly 86% and 78% of their screen exposure, respectively.\n\nYes, but: Dylan Collins, CEO of children's tech company SuperAwesome, emails that this study stopped measuring viewing habits after a pivotal switch occurred in the media diets of young children.\n\n\"The real acceleration of decline in kids TV started in 2013/2014 so I think what you're seeing here is the passing of peak kids TV.

In fact, biosimilars will enter the market for the non-orphan indications two years before the latest Humira orphan-designated indication exclusivity expires,\" said MK Steel, a spokeswoman for AbbVie, which makes Humira, the world\u2019s best-selling drug.\n\n\"We\u2019re proud to have studied [Remicade] in orphan indications. These are small populations with large unmet need,\" said Linda Davis, a Janssen spokeswoman, adding that all of Remicade's orphan exclusivity periods have expired.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019ll be up to insurance companies and providers to decide whether an orphan approval makes a biologic more desirable than a biosimilar, even for the non-orphan uses that drive most sales.\n\n\u201cIt may be giving already marketed drugs a commercial advantage...but that\u2019s why we have payers and [pharmacy benefit managers]. They're supposed to be negotiating,\u201d Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Some critics say drugs that are already raking billions shouldn\u2019t be able to rack up so much extra protection in the first place. And change may be coming.\n\n\u201cFor a drug that\u2019s already on the market, maybe you don\u2019t need as much incentive to study a subsequent indication,\" Gottlieb said. \"Maybe we make the designation harder to get.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think with these big established drugs, there needs to be a streamlined way of giving enough incentive for it to be used in a smaller population, but not necessarily the system that we have now,\" said Ted Okon, executive director of the Community Oncology Alliance.\n\nThe bottom line: \u201cThese are examples of drugs where the financial returns absolutely appear to be there,\" Dusetzina said. \u201cThey\u2019re not meeting the spirit of the law, even if they\u2019re technically meeting the letter of the law.\u201d"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Driving the news: Shell is set to complete a review of its membership in trade associations in April to determine if they contradict the company's positions supporting action on climate change. Major trade groups, such as the American Petroleum Institute, have fought climate policies in the past but more recently have sought to be more agnostic on the matter.\n\nThe big picture: Shell, the world's second-largest publicly traded oil company after ExxonMobil, has over the past year ramped up enough investments and commitments in this area to surpass any other producer similar in size.\n\nCEO Ben Van Beurden is far more forceful than most other oil executives about positioning his company to profit off a world drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions as envisioned in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.\n\n\"I'm quite confident that Paris will be delivered because there is a very significant societal push behind it and if it has to be delivered, it has to be delivered through business. And I intend to fully benefit from that.\"\n\n\u2014 Shell CEO Ben van Beurden, Jan. 31 earnings call\n\nIn response to investor pressure, the Netherlands-based company announced plans in December to set short-term targets linked to executive pay to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the products it sells, not just from its operations. BP recently resisted calls from its investors to take a similar step. This move may seem like a subtle distinction, but its potential repercussions are huge.\n\n\"Shell is the only company in the industry that has been willing to cross that philosophical divide and actually set a goal for reducing emissions that it doesn't directly control. Product emissions are typically eight to 10 times the size of operational emissions at an integrated oil and gas company.\"\n\n\u2014 Andrew Logan, oil and gas program director, Ceres, a sustainable investment advocacy group\n\nThe details: A report Shell released last year suggested that coal, oil and natural gas would begin to drop dramatically after three decades if world leaders cut greenhouse gas emissions as laid out in the 2015 Paris deal, a far more aggressive scenario than other oil companies.\n\nShell has already significantly shifted its business from oil to natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel, in the last several years. Eventually, oil and gas will become a far smaller part of the company, with electricity and petrochemicals gaining in share, Van Beurden said on the latest earnings call.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe company set long-term \u2014 but non-binding \u2014 targets in late 2017 to cut its net carbon emissions from the products it sells by 20% within 16 years and by 50% by 2050.\n\nShell\u2019s New Energies division, created in 2016, is investing $1 to $2 billion a year in renewables and other forms of cleaner energy types. Within the last month, it's made investments in electric-vehicle and home battery charging.\n\nCritics say that\u2019s a sliver compared to what Shell makes \u2014 $21 billion in profits last year. a recent report\n\nVan Beurden says he wants to double the division\u2019s funding by 2020, but in another test of Shell\u2019s strategy, it hasn\u2019t yet confirmed whether it will.\n\nThe division launched with fewer than 80 employees and now has several hundred, according to Mark Gainsborough, the executive running the department whose salary is newly tied to carbon-reduction efforts.\n\nReality check: The company's shift has not been matched by lobbying dollars in Washington, D.C. , raising doubts about how serious the company is about its clean-energy pursuits.\n\nShell has not yet decided whether it will fund an advocacy campaign for carbon tax policy on Capitol Hill, according to spokesman Curtis Smith. This puts the company behind American producers ExxonMobil ConocoPhillips\n\nThis positioning is also at odds with what Shell has indicated it wants to do, which is profit off of the world\u2019s energy transition while remaining a good investment for shareholders in the meantime.\n\n\"If you don't have government policies that are enabling the transition to happen it\u2019s probably very hard to deliver on the world-class investment case.\"\n\n\u2014 Mark Gainsborough, executive vice president, Shell\n\nGo deeper:"

And older people are retiring earlier in the U.S. than in places like Canada, economist Diane Schanzenbach, director of the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, told Axios.\n\nSome economists and researchers point to a lack of generous family leave or child care assistance policies as a reason the rate of working women has fallen behind other nations, said Lisa Barrow, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve in Chicago. Ivanka Trump has made this her signature issue.\n\nBy the numbers: Women with a bachelor's, master's or professional degree are still less likely to be working than men with the same education level, according to BLS.\n\nLess educated women are worst off: Workforce participation rates have fallen the most and wages have risen the least among women with only a high school diploma or less, Schanzenbach said.\n\nThe big picture: The U.S. used to be a global leader for female workforce participation. But the U.K., Canada and even Japan are now ahead, according to World Bank data.\n\nThe bottom line: The gender gap in the U.S. workforce is still a big problem \u2014 and it will be harder to maintain economic growth and sustain a large, retired generation if it isn't closed."

It's also a very effective hidden forced-savings mechanism for millions of Americans, who every year discover hundreds or thousands of dollars that they had been putting away every paycheck. For most workers, the salient number when it comes to annual taxes is not the annual amount payable, but rather the difference between the tax due and the amount withheld. If you owe an unexpectedly large amount, that's a nasty hit; if you receive an unexpectedly large refund, that's a frabjous day.\n\nThe big picture: When Trump cut taxes in 2017, the White House also cut the amount that workers saw withheld from their paychecks.

Obama used executive power without apology when Congress blocked his agenda in the latter years of his presidency. And George W. Bush enthusiastically pushed the boundaries of presidential power.\n\nTrump has looked for creative ways to use executive power to advance his agenda. His shock-and-awe series of executive orders early in his presidency resulted in protracted court battles, some of which he won.\n\nHis agencies are sweeping away regulations, including the most aggressive gutting of environmental regulations since at least President Reagan, and maybe ever.\n\nBehind the scenes: More than half a dozen current and former White House officials told me that after they passed their big tax bill last Congress, a broad consensus emerged: Trump wouldn't get anything else big through Congress before his re-election bid.\n\nTrump appears to share that view. Since the tax bill's passage, he has focused on issues where Congress has little power, including foreign policy and trade.\n\nWhile Congress can block his trade deal with Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has made clear they won't need the Hill\u2019s signoff for the China talks. But there's a trade-off for his legacy: The next president will be able to unilaterally undo any China agreement \u2014 just like Trump reversed Obama's Iran deal.\n\nThe bottom line: This concentration of power in the executive branch is part of the reason Republicans have invested so much in confirming new judges. In a world of government by executive order, Congress loses its relevance and judges become the surest check on an overreaching executive.\n\nGo deeper:"

And older people are retiring earlier in the U.S. than in places like Canada, economist Diane Schanzenbach, director of the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, told Axios.\n\nSome economists and researchers point to a lack of generous family leave or child care assistance policies as a reason the rate of working women has fallen behind other nations, said Lisa Barrow, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve in Chicago. Ivanka Trump has made this her signature issue.\n\nBy the numbers: Women with a bachelor's, master's or professional degree are still less likely to be working than men with the same education level, according to BLS.\n\nLess educated women are worst off: Workforce participation rates have fallen the most and wages have risen the least among women with only a high school diploma or less, Schanzenbach said.\n\nThe big picture: The U.S. used to be a global leader for female workforce participation. But the U.K., Canada and even Japan are now ahead, according to World Bank data.\n\nThe bottom line: The gender gap in the U.S. workforce is still a big problem \u2014 and it will be harder to maintain economic growth and sustain a large, retired generation if it isn't closed."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The number of new Ebola cases has dropped slightly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the World Health Organization. However, some experts warn that doesn't mean the world's second-largest Ebola outbreak on record is yet under control, and in fact it could simply be moving to new areas of the sprawling country.\n\nThe big picture: There are 33% fewer cases to date in February compared with the same time period in December per STAT's Helen Branswell, but some experts warn Axios that there remain signs that this outbreak is far from over.\n\nBetween the lines: Johns Hopkins' public health expert Jennifer Nuzzo points to several reasons people should continue to view this outbreak as a cause for concern.\n\nThere appears to be a \"shifting geography\" of cases with small groups in different locations, Nuzzo says.\n\n\"It almost feels like we're playing whack-a-mole where we concentrate [resources] in one area, but take our eyes away from another area\" where the disease then spreads, Nuzzo says.\n\nThere continues to be a number of community deaths, which means the government hadn't been aware of the infected person and therefore the disease is more likely to have spread.\n\nAnd, transparency hasn't been great, she adds, as officials haven't made known how many of those confirmed and suspected cases were known contacts of sick individuals.\n\nMeanwhile, DRC Ministry of Health spokesperson Jessica Ilunga tells Axios that violence and community mistrust continue to hamper their efforts to control and end the outbreak, which started Aug. 1.\n\n\"Any violent incident with the population slowed down the response as it prevents response teams from doing their job freely. Laboratories remain closed, surveillance teams can\u2019t track alerts in the community, safe and dignified burials can\u2019t proceed, vaccination activities are temporarily suspended, etc.,\" Ilunga says.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we had to step up the protection of our team with additional local police agents. It is not ideal but it is the only way to protect health agents from being beaten up by the population,\" she adds.\n\nLast week, MOH launched their third \"strategic response plan\" for the next 6 months to stop Ebola in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces as well as neighboring countries. To reach this goal, DRC, WHO and its partners are asking the international community for $148 million.\n\nYes, but: Congo needs more than money from the international community and the U.S. in particular, Nuzzo says. Safety concerns have largely caused the CDC to limit its Ebola experts to the capital city of Kinshasa, where some have returned after being evacuated during an uptick in election-related violence. Now is the time for the U.S. to send them into the field, she says.\n\n\"The WHO is doing a heroic job, but the CDC is unparalleled in its expertise\" from working prior outbreaks over the past 40 years, she says.\n\nThe bottom line: Ilunga agrees they need to remain vigilant against the outbreak. \"The strategies put in place have proved effective to contain the outbreak in the main hotspots like Mangina and Beni. However, it remains a very challenging response and outbreak. We will continue adapt our strategies until we manage to completely stop it,\" she says.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "It seems unlikely, though, that Mulvaney will put much effort into advocating for debt prioritization in his current role as chief of staff. He's told colleagues he thinks the administration will get more leverage out of the threat of spending cuts than it will by using the debt ceiling.\n\nThe Trump administration is so internally divided over the debt ceiling that many in Congress wouldn't believe the White House if they threatened to hold it hostage.\n\nBehind the scenes: Before a recent Cabinet meeting, Mulvaney and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin chatted about the debt ceiling, per a senior White House official. According to that official and another source briefed on the chat, Mnuchin said, \"Democrats will give us a clean debt ceiling.\"\n\nMulvaney \"sort of giggled,\" according the senior official. \"Steven, no they won't,\" he added.\n\nMnuchin said Democrats wanted a clean hike last time; Mulvaney retorted that Democrats weren't in charge then.\n\n\"Now they're going to end up tying one of their priorities to the debt ceiling increase,\" Mulvaney predicted to Mnuchin, according to the official. \"You cannot assume that because they wanted something the last time, it's exactly the same thing they want this time. ... There's not much consistency when it comes to this in politics.\"\n\nA source familiar with Mnuchin's thinking told me, \"The secretary is focused on raising the debt ceiling, but hasn't expressed a strong preference for how it's done. That's up to Congress.\"\n\nSo what's debt prioritization? Before the Tea Party, Congress routinely raised the debt ceiling (the limit on how much the Treasury can borrow) with every annual budget. But after 2010, House conservatives argued that this shouldn't happen without concessions to the right, such as cuts in how much the government spends. To make that happen, they advocated for debt prioritization, the idea that the U.S. government could pay creditors on time (e.g., interest on the national debt) but delay paying other bills. It's a type of brinkmanship.\n\nLast February, Trump signed a bill suspending the debt ceiling until March 1, 2019. As soon as this week, the Treasury Department is expected to start issuing guidance for \"extraordinary measures\" \u2014 a term of art to describe actions the Treasury secretary can take to delay the U.S. government from defaulting on its debts.\n\nExperts who monitor this issue say they think Mnuchin will probably be able to use extraordinary measures to delay a debt crisis until at least late summer, giving Congress about six extra months to deliberate.\n\nBehind the scenes: Mnuchin is expected to make it clear \u2014 as he did the last time the Trump administration bumped into the debt ceiling \u2014 that he won't mess around with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. He calmed markets last time by saying he wanted Congress to pass a clean debt ceiling increase and that he thought prioritizing debt payments \"doesn't make much sense.\"\n\nBut a senior White House official told me that \"elements within the administration,\" including Mulvaney, will be \"encouraging the president to consider the possibility of prioritization of payments.\"\n\n\"We will certainly raise, for the president, the options that we have going into the next round of negotiations. Certainly the debt ceiling will be part of that.\"\n\nGo deeper: If the U.S. can't pay its bills"

Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) being re-elected after his highly publicized trial on corruption charges. (He was acquitted on seven counts, and the Justice Department dropped the rest of the charges.)\n\nAnd let's not forget the obvious: The \"Access Hollywood\" tape didn't exactly keep Donald Trump out of the White House.\n\nWhy is it happening? Part of it is \"the atomized, 24-second news cycle where the speed of digitized platforms and the compressed attention spans of the audience have us careening from one controversy and outrage to the next,\" says Kevin Madden, a veteran GOP strategist who worked on Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.\n\nBut it's also because scandal-ridden politicians can use social media to mobilize their supporters: \"If Richard Nixon had Fox News or Twitter, would he have felt as much public pressure to ultimately resign?\"\n\nAnd to Michael Feldman, a Democratic strategist who worked on Al Gore's presidential campaign, it's also a sign that we're just surrounded by so much scandal \u2014 starting with Trump's Russia investigation and other scandals \u2014 that the shock value has worn off.\n\n\"We are more hardened, we are more distracted, and if you're under siege, you have reason to believe that everyone might move on,\" Feldman said. \"The president is the ultimate example.\"\n\nAnother factor: hyper-partisanship. With Republican and Democratic heels dug in on issues big and small and legislatures and electoral votes hanging on razor-thin margins, neither side has reason to toss one of their own overboard too fast when scandal hits.\n\nIt's not just an American phenomenon, either. As Axios' Dave Lawler points out, British Prime Minister Theresa May didn't step down after her Brexit plan went down in flames. Jeremy Corbyn didn't let a few allegations of anti-Semitism stand in the way of leading Britain's Labour Party.\n\nAnd Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is running for re-election even though Israeli police want him indicted for bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\n\nThis isn't a completely new tactic: Bill Clinton blazed the trail when he shrugged off his impeachment and stuck around. But look at that list, and it's hard to argue that the \"hell no I won't go\" club isn't bigger than it used to be.\n\nThe bottom line: They're betting that the public will move on \u2014 and they're usually right.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Hi! Steve LeVine here as guest editor today. I\u2019m Future Editor at Axios, where I write a daily newsletter on the outlook for how we live, how we are governed and how we will work. This Sunday edition of the Daily Rundown features some very smart thinking on the real status \u2014 and age \u2014 of the world order, researching dead presidents and getting rid of Lyme disease. Read on and join the conversation.\n\nStop mourning the coming end of the world order. We\u2019re already in a new one. Much time and angst have been spent the last two years kneading hands over the damage to the post-World War II order, the economic and geopolitical system that\u2019s probably prevented a new great power war. But history suggests world orders die long before anyone notices, argues Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. The one we grew up with is gone, though it\u2019s too early to know what the new order is \u2014 or what it will look like once it\u2019s fully formed. The certain thing \u2014 we need to be on guard in case things go wrong. \u201cThe good news is that it is far from inevitable that the world will eventually arrive at a catastrophe,\u201d Haas writes. \u201cThe bad news is that it is far from certain that it will not.\u201d\n\nWe saw this kind of unraveling way back when: Among the most interesting conversations I\u2019ve had in recent months has been with Charles Mann, author of \u201c1493,\u201d a history of the years after Columbus discovered the New World. Mann tracks the populist unrest we are witnessing today to the very same period five centuries ago. Then as now, he told me, \"the complete mixing of all these peoples make people think they are losing their identities and leads to all sorts of upheaval.\" It\u2019s a reminder that transitions in historical cycles \u2014 including the one we are in \u2014 can last a long time, and cause \u201call kinds of havoc, all over the world.\u201d The political mayhem we are watching across countries and continents is nowhere close to ending \u2014 our children and grandchildren, too, will be dealing with it.\n\nThe Roaring Twenties are making a comeback, too: Gabriel Zucman, an economist at UC Berkeley, says in a new paper that inequality has tripled since the 1980s \u2014 with just 400 Americans possessing more wealth than the 150 million people who account for the bottom 60% of earners. Things now look a lot like the pre-Depression 1920s, writes The Washington Post\u2019s Christopher Ingraham. This is no mere statistic, but a primary subtext to the anger of the last few years, as people fall out of the middle class. \u201cThat shift is eroding security from families in the lower and middle classes, who rely on their small stores of wealth to finance their retirement and to smooth over economic shocks like the loss of a job,\u201d Ingraham writes. \u2022 Here\u2019s what people are saying.\n\nTo beat Lyme disease, turn to mice: Some 40,000 people in the U.S. contract Lyme every year, making it the most common disease spread by ticks, fleas or mosquitoes, writes Angus Chen. This affliction can cause muscle, nerve and brain damage. In 1998, a vaccine called LYMErix came onto the market, with high effectiveness, but was then withdrawn over reports that it harmed those taking it. Now, Chen writes, Maria Gomes-Solecki, the inventor of LYMErix, has resurrected it for use not with humans, but with mice. The vehicle \u2014 a delicious kibble made up like a peanut M&M. The original withdrawal of the vaccine, Chen writes, was \u201cstoked by anti-vaccine sentiment.\u201d Now, if enough mice eat the kibble, Lyme may be seriously reduced. \u2022 Here\u2019s what people are saying.\n\nRobert Caro\u2019s advice? Leave no stone unturned: In his early 20s, biographer Robert Caro got off to a slow start at his first job, at Newsday. Until his first investigation. Among our chief national treasures are Caro\u2019s stunning biographies of Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson. Now 83 and still working on the final volume of his Johnson biography, Caro decided he wanted to interject with a different kind of book \u2014 on the journalistic lessons he has learned. I am a hopeless Caro fan, making this a must-read. Chief among his own life lessons, he writes, are the words from his first editor about good investigative reporting: \u201cTurn every page. Never assume anything. Turn every goddam page.\u201d\n\nOne last idea: Almost every country on the planet is shrinking and aging, meaning people are going to have to \u2014 and in many cases, want to \u2014 work a lot longer. But ageism persists. How to navigate the workplace if you happened to be one of the elders? Ask Tom Brady, who has managed to maintain his relevance and respect on the Patriots despite being 19 years older than the rookies, writes Adam Kilgore. Because of how he relates with the younger players, his age is treated like any other difference among the players. Kilgore quotes Brian Hoyer, Brady\u2019s backup quarterback:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said, it\u2019s unfortunate that the rest of America couldn\u2019t be in an NFL locker room for a year, because I think a lot of problems would be solved. You\u2019re not always going to get along with people. You\u2019re not always going to have the same views. You\u2019re not always going to be the same religion, the same race, all those things. The one thing we have going is, we have this common goal. We know that we\u2019re all putting it on the line for each other. When you have that relationship, you\u2019re able to understand people a lot better.\u201d\n\nWhat's your take? Join the conversations on today's stories in the comments.\n\n\u2014 Steve LeVine"

Manafort subsequently lied to investigators about doing so \u2014 one of the false statements that caused him to breach his plea deal.\n\nWhat we don't know: It's unclear when Manafort shared the data and whether it was public or private campaign information.

Photo: Mark Wilson via Getty Images\n\nBackground: In 2014, Blackstone acquired control of Black Rhino to invest billions into energy and infrastructure projects in Nigeria and Ethiopia, but it failed to close the large deals Blackstone was looking to finance. Blackstone\u2019s departure comes after years of big American PE players leaving the market.\n\nBetween the lines: The mismatch between the size of available deals in African markets and the target investment size of global asset managers such as Blackstone continues to be an issue.\n\nIn 2017, roughly 90% of Africa-focused PE fund sizes were over $100 million, yet only about 15% of African private companies reported revenue over that number.\n\nMoreover, the typical PE timeframe of a five-year holding period is often too short in African markets, where companies require more wholesale change, currency risk is a challenge, and exit opportunities are limited.\n\nWhat to watch: As global PE giants leave the region, Africa-focused firms continue to grow. DPI, for example, is in the process of raising a third fund with an $800 million target. DPI and competitors like ECP, Helios, Actis, and Ethos tend to focus on smaller deals, often between $70 million and $100 million.\n\nThe bottom line: Funds that successfully tap opportunities in some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing markets tend to share the traits of Africa specialization, patient capital, and tolerance and capacity for smaller assets. The big U.S. players appear uninterested in adapting to these realities in the near term.\n\nAubrey Hruby is a senior fellow in the Atlantic Council's Africa Center."

    "text": "But while its partnerships \u2014 with chains like 7-11 and Walgreens \u2014 may serve a lot of Chinese visitors, these stores' main clientele is ordinary locals, who now will become acquainted with the Alipay name.\n\nThe big picture: Alibaba is enticing U.S. businesses with Alipay, which allows users to pay by scanning a QR code on the app. It has more than 700 million Chinese users. It is telling U.S. companies that if they add the system, they'll get a big piece of the tens of billions dollars Chinese nationals spend in the U.S. every year.\n\nAlipay already has 4 million U.S. users and works with luxury brands like Lacoste and Rebecca Minkoff, and can be used at duty-free shops and Vegas hotels \u2014 places frequented by Chinese tourists.\n\nBut the move this week into 7,000 Walgreens, and earlier into 7-Eleven in Canada, is part of a separate strategy, says Humphrey Ho, managing director of the Hylink Group. \"The real play here is for the students, the new immigrants, and the people here to work for just a few years,\" Ho says.\n\nThere's a massive market of Chinese nationals who are in the U.S. longer than tourists, but would still like to use Alipay instead of applying for a credit card.\n\nMy thought bubble: Though it's possible that Alibaba could follow Japan's strategy from the 1960s and 1970s and break open the American market, it seems to me that Alipay's expansion will be limited to Chinese nationals for the foreseeable future."

The sentence here should reflect the seriousness of these crimes, and serve to both deter Manafort and others from engaging in such conduct.\"\n\nWhy it matters: This would essentially be a life sentence for the 69-year-old Manafort. He is also facing a separate case in D.C., where a judge recently ruled that he had violated his plea agreement with Mueller and could therefore lose out on any potential leniency he might be offered."

It later broadened its approach with the introduction of such IoT products as Amazon Echo and Google Assistant.\n\nIt raised around $44 million in venture capital, from firms like CRV, Greylock, True Ventures, Khosla Ventures and First Round Capital. According to PitchBook, its most recent post-money valuation was just north of $160 million.\n\nThe upfront deal value is said to be around $30 million, plus around $10 million in potential earn-outs for management. That would include CEO Oren Jacob, who once served as Pixar's CTO.\n\nVoice is seen as one of the next big things and Apple has been way behind both Google and Amazon in terms of adoption and being open to developers. Making it easier to write voice apps combined with a more open Siri could help close the gap, even though both Google and Amazon continue to invest heavily in voice.\n\nApple was not immediately available for comment."

    "text": "Background: The U.S. economy is 60% less oil-intensive than it was in the 1970s, with virtually no oil used in electricity generation and limited quantities in manufacturing. Still, the transportation sector \u2014 with 350 million liquid-fuel cars on the road \u2014 has made little progress reducing its overwhelming dependence on oil-based fuels. That means Americans remain susceptible to the effects of an oil-price shock.\n\nYes, but: President Trump has shown a willingness to release the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which could help drive down prices in the event of further supply reductions. This is particularly pertinent for Saudi Arabia, which shut down an oilfield after a power accident two weeks ago, and Venezuela, whose oil sector would need several years, billions of dollars and new foreign investment to return to previous production levels, even with a change in government.\n\nWhat's new: Trump, together with Congress, appears to have one other card up his sleeve. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee unanimously passed a bill that would subject the assets of any oil-producing country that participates in an OPEC agreement \u2014 or even individual countries with side agreements to limit oil supply \u2014 to U.S. antitrust action, including federal lawsuits to force sales of subsidiaries and compensation payments to harmed parties.\n\nThat threat alone caused Qatar to quit OPEC, and prompted its secretariat to caution members against making explicit statements about using production cuts to reach a particular price.\n\nWhat to watch: While OPEC has the reins for the moment, the threat of the House bill might give Trump more leverage over the organization and its members and collaborators.\n\nAmy Myers Jaffe is the David M. Rubenstein Senior Fellow for Energy and the Environment at the Council on Foreign Relations and director of its program on energy security and climate change."

The free 90-minute workshop is also available online.\n\nSAE International, an engineering group, has a series of AV demonstration events, which started for seniors in Florida in December.\n\nOne key takeaway: 61% said they would prefer to own a self-driving car versus 12% who said they'd prefer shared AV access, SAE tells Axios.\n\nThe bottom line: Seniors value their independence, especially when it comes to transportation, and may be the first to adopt AVs if companies can prove their worth and earn their trust."

Mel Watt (D-N.C.), former director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency under President Obama, abused his position by attempting to \"coerce or induce\" a relationship with a female employee who was working toward a promotion.\n\nWhat they're saying: Watt has denied the allegations. Simone Grimes, the former employee named in the investigation, said in an email to the Post that she was satisfied with the results of the report. She filed a federal complaint against Watt last year, alleging that he blocked her from career advancement opportunities after she denied his advances."

Demographers believe an undercount could reduce the political power of heavily Democratic states with large immigrant communities during redistricting in 2021."

Like the popular but insecure kid who just learned that some classmates said unkind thing behind his back.\n\nAmazon spent more than a year, and countless dollars and hours, to determine the ideal location(s) to house tens of thousands of new employees. It was a strategic imperative. And now, suddenly, it's not?\n\nWhat are shareholders to make of that reversal?\n\nAmazon seems to feel burned by NYC Mayor De Blasio and NY Gov. Cuomo, likely following their advice to cut out certain local politicians from the negotiation process. But Amazon should have enough savvy to know that the success of any such project requires buy-in, or at least transparency, among all major stakeholders.\n\nIt's mind-numbing that certain NYC politicians, including AOC, are gloating over Amazon's decision to bail. Maybe if she and others had worked for months to negotiate and ultimately couldn't find a workable compromise. But that's not what happened.\n\nAnd the notion that this somehow frees up $3 billion for other efforts is just plain wrong (the actual figure is around $500 million).\n\nOur thought bubble: But, at the same time, it's disingenuous for an Amazon policy spox to tell NBC that AOC's criticism was a significant factor. AOC is a federal representative who has no say over state or local tax incentives. Plus, Amazon made its initial picks after progressives helped Democrats retake the House. The new politics were known.\n\nThe bottom line: New York City is now reminiscent of Washington, D.C., where both sides too often allow viral rhetoric to overwhelm common-sense compromise. And, although Jeff Bezos nor Donald Trump will appreciate the comparison, an ultimate arbiter who becomes capricious when criticized."

    "title": "Hospitals are making a lot of money on outpatient drugs",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "How it works: Hospitals have acquired a lot of doctors' clinics over the past several years and converted them to outpatient departments. That allows them to set a higher price for the same services and drugs before they head into negotiations with insurers.\n\nOn average, private insurers pay hospital-owned clinics about 67% of the amount the clinic initially charges.\n\nThe big picture: \"There's this large proportion of hospital outpatient billing that is really based on those charges, or a complex calculation of those charges,\" said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University who studies drug prices and reviewed the AllianceBernstein analysis. \"It's surprising and concerning.\"\n\nBy the numbers: Analysts at AllianceBernstein scoured the chargemasters of 34 hospital systems, looking specifically for a handful of outpatient drugs. Hospital list prices are now required by federal law to be posted online.\n\nAcademic hospitals, already known for their high costs, had the highest prices and markups for both brand-name and generic drugs.\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian, in an extreme example, charges more than $55,000 for cancer drug Neulasta, which is 12.5 times Medicare's average sale price. Other hospitals charge around $20,000 on average for Neulasta.\n\nDepending on the drug and type of hospital, markups ranged on average from 3-7 times more than Medicare's average sale price. Markups were even higher for generic drugs.\n\n\"One pharma CEO noted to us that if prices dropped sharply on oncology drugs, 'every hospital in the country will go broke,'\" AllianceBernstein analysts wrote in their report.\n\nThe other side: Aaron Wesolowski, a vice president at the American Hospital Association, said in a statement that Medicare and Medicaid payments are low, while \"private payers tend to negotiate competitive rates with hospitals that often lead to bundling the cost of drugs.\"\n\nHe also had quibbles over the report's methodology and sample size. Wesolowski did not answer follow-up questions, including what \"competitive rates\" mean.\n\nThe bottom line: Hospital charges are not irrelevant. Publicly available data indicate hospitals make a lot of extra money from expensive drugs, and commercial insurers go along with it.\n\n\"I don't think hospitals are doing this as a way to break even,\" Dusetzina said. \"Like every other single entity in the system, they are trying to make money.\"\n\nYes, but: This is still just one component of the country's drug pricing maze, where pharmaceutical manufacturers play a central role."

    "title": "Experts consistently underestimate U.S. oil production",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "A new report this week underscores a wider trend: The Energy Department's data arm and private forecasters alike have consistently underestimated the U.S. crude oil production surge in recent years.\n\nWhy it matters: There are geopolitical, economic and environmental repercussions from the faster-than-expected growth, which is driven largely by surging output in the Permian Basin region of Texas and New Mexico.\n\nWhat's new: The EIA's latest monthly forecast sees U.S. crude production, already at record levels, averaging 12.4 million barrels per day this year and 13.2 million bpd in 2020. That's a substantial uptick from projections just a month earlier, and if history is any guide, the latest increase won't be the last upward revision.\n\nThe intrigue: EIA is hardly alone in low-balling the surge, which saw U.S. output climb 2 million barrels per day last year alone.\n\nThe price recovery that began in 2016 and saw consistent gains from mid-2017 until last October has spurred things along.\n\nBut the known unknowns of price forecasting aren't enough to explain why U.S. growth has confounded banks, the International Energy Agency, and consultancies.\n\nBy the numbers: Harry compared EIA's forecasts in their monthly short-term energy outlook with actual production data that arrives later. He found...\n\nU.S. crude oil production has outpaced EIA forecasts every month since January 2017. The one-year forecasts have been too low by an average of more than one million barrels.\n\nDuring the same time period, the 6-month forecasts were always revised upwards but still proved too low \u2014 by an average of about 465,000 barrels per day.\n\nBetween the lines: This faster-than-expected growth has several effects, including...\n\nIt complicates the joint OPEC-Russia efforts to continue propping up prices through their supply-cutting pact.\n\nIt brings economic gains to Texas and elsewhere, but the speed has also left local officials playing lots of catch-up on housing, infrastructure and other civic matters.\n\nIt could boost global greenhouse gas emissions in the long-term if it keeps going higher and higher, based on findings from a recent study released via the think tank Resources for the Future.\n\nWhat we're hearing: Analysts offered a suite of reasons why growth has exceeded forecasts, such as the decline in technology costs, which helped U.S. producers expand output at lower costs.\n\n\"Since the end of 2016 through now, operators have really shown that they can optimize their operations and kind of get the most out of different prices far more than we have previously anticipated,\" Meg Coleman, a senior EIA analyst, tells Harry.\n\nQuick take: One overarching thing is that it's just hard to get a handle on how to model the characteristics of the shale resource, given the complicated geology and the limited history of the U.S. boom.\n\n\u201cIt is just a dynamic resource theme, a dynamic time in the industry where so much is changing so fast. That it makes it hard for anyone to take a snapshot and say this is what informs me about the future,\" says Wood Mackenzie analyst R.T. Dukes.\n\nAfter all, the boom began relatively recently \u2014 in the mid-late 2000s \u2014 as advances in fracking and horizontal drilling unlocked huge resources in Texas, North Dakota and elsewhere.\n\nAnother big challenge is that the U.S. industry is very fragmented, with players of all shapes and sizes undertaking scattered developments. It's harder to analyze than big conventional projects planned far in advance, like big Gulf of Mexico projects.\n\nThe big picture: \u201cThis is hundreds of operators utilizing hundreds of service companies, accessing hundreds of markets and making their own individual decisions, and the markets have largely rewarded growth,\" Dukes said.\n\nWhat's next: Coleman said EIA is working to improve its forecasting models. \"Every month we're looking to update parameters, to find that predictor that is a leading indicator of growth,\" Coleman said. \"We're constantly updating and improving models to capture a very very dynamic industry.\""

    "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Vice President Mike Pence at the Warsaw conference on the Middle East on Feb. 14. Photo: Xinhua/Jaap Arriens via Getty Images\n\nThe big picture: To Washington's frustration, both Iran and the rest of the world have stuck with the deal nearly a year after the Trump administration withdrew unilaterally. Even as its oil exports have more than halved since the U.S. restored sanctions in November, Iran has remained compliant with the deal's restrictions on its nuclear program.\n\nBackground: When it withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018, the Trump administration said the intention was to bring the Islamic Republic back to the negotiation table. U.S. officials said they sought a more comprehensive agreement that would cover Iran's regional interventions, ballistic missile program and imprisonment of dual nationals.\n\nBut the underlying motivation appeared to be a hope that Iran would also quit the JCPOA, making it easier to convince the rest of the world to abandon it.\n\nWhat's new: European countries, far from quitting, have come up with a payment mechanism intended to facilitate humanitarian trade with Iran at a time when Western banks are too terrified of U.S. sanctions to attempt even authorized business with Tehran.\n\nVice President Mike Pence inveighed against the so-called Special Purpose Vehicle, warning in Warsaw that it \"will only strengthen Iran, weaken the EU and create still more distance between Europe and America.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Warsaw conference was intended to create a coalition for \"war\" against Iran \u2014 a comment that was later softened to \"confrontation.\"\n\nYes, but: This pressure does not have broad international support. Although Israel and Iran's Arab rivals attended the gathering, Russia, China, Turkey and most European foreign ministers declined.\n\nWhere it stands: Iran is facing a bleak immediate future, with its economy expected to shrink 6% in 2019, on the back of falling oil exports, high inflation and unemployment. Even still, Iranians are not raring for another revolution, as Secretary Mike Pompeo has continued to suggest. They keenly recall how the last one turned out, and how chaotic a process regime change has been for their neighbors Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThe bottom line: Current U.S. policy will neither bring Iran back to the negotiating table nor kill the JCPOA.\n\nBarbara Slavin directs the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council."

The collective volume of approximately 160 million tons a year makes the area the single biggest port for coal exports in the world, according to executives at the Port Waratah Coal Services, which runs the largest operation on site here.\n\nThe expansive terminal sits along the banks of the Pacific Ocean along Australia's Southeast coast and loads 10,000 tons of coal an hour onto ships.\n\nsits along the banks of the Pacific Ocean along Australia's Southeast coast and loads 10,000 tons of coal an hour onto ships.

About 1,300 ships a year come through Port Waratah's operations, sending the coal mostly to Southeast Asian countries, including Japan and South Korea.\n\nBetween the lines: The type of coal exported from Newcastle is considered a cleaner type compared to the world\u2019s other big coal exporter, nearby Indonesia. This is why Australia\u2019s coal producers think they can thrive in a world addressing climate change.\n\n\"There's definitely industry recognition that the world is on a certain path. The industry in Hunter Valley expects to be a part of the thermal coal picture for as long as there is a significant thermal coal industry on the basis of having a superior product that\u2019s accessible to large parts of what is going to be longer term markets.\"\n\n\u2014 Hennie du Plooy, CEO, Port Waratah Coal Services\n\nWhat's next: du Plooy says growth is expected to remain stable through at least the next decade or more due to demand from Southeast Asia. This contrasts with government policy moves in places like Europe, much of which is looking to shut down coal plants due to climate-change concerns.\n\nThe big looming challenge for Australian producers is to what degree permits for new coal mines in Hunter Valley and elsewhere are rejected on the basis of climate change concerns, based on a potential precedent setting court ruling\n\nGo deeper: The world needs clean coal but can't get it"

And Republicans are more open to that idea than ever before.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s terrible that Big Pharma sort of abuses the system to try to sort of evergreen these patents and keep them around forever, and I think it\u2019s part of the answer,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said.\n\n\"I'm open to looking at a lot of things, and I think maybe Big Pharma might be more cooperative if they thought we might actually limit the exclusivity,\" he added.\n\nIt's not just flame-throwers like Paul who are talking about this.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she's introducing legislation soon that's \"aimed at some of the gaming of the system that we see going on.\u201d\n\n\"I think it's time to look at the broader issue of whether the way in which companies are protecting their patented drugs is leading to higher costs,\" Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said.\n\nIn the past, Republicans were quick to defend the existing patent system, saying it's a necessary incentive for innovation, while they avoided defending individual bad actors. But many members' tone, at least, is changing, and they aren't ruling out reform.\n\nAnd drug companies are getting worried about the GOP's interest in patents, according to a GOP lobbyist who works with the companies.\n\nBetween the lines: It's unclear how far any of this will ultimately go. But some Democrats are optimistic about compromise.\n\n\"Evergreening might be an area where we can get some bipartisan agreement on rooting out the worst of the abuses,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nHow it works: New drugs get patent protections and a period of market exclusivity, both of which block competition from cheaper generics. The idea was to reward innovation and give drugmakers an incentive to come up with new products.\n\nBut critics say pharma is gaming the system \u2014 for example, by making minor changes to their drugs and taking out a new patent, extending their monopolies longer than the system intended.\n\nOne study published in the Oxford Academic last year found that 78% of the drugs awarded new patents between 2005 and 2015 weren't new drugs, but existing ones.\n\nThere has been a bipartisan push to end specific categories of gaming, but there is a much wider world of potential targets.\n\nThe bottom line: A mix of Trump's rhetoric, his administration's aggressive policies, and Democrats' leftward march on health care has forced Republicans to become more proactive on drug prices."

    "text": "Context: Amazon has played a high-handed game all along in its headquarters search.\n\nWhen it launched the $5 billion HQ2 competition in September 2017, it invited mid-sized cities across the U.S. to compete in what felt like a reality-TV pageant.\n\nThen, in November 2018, it announced it would split its new headquarters between two of the country's most powerful regions, New York and greater D.C.\n\nNow it says it really only needs one of these two projects, after all, and will make smaller investments in many other U.S. cities.\n\nHow it works: Along the way, Amazon gave us a glimpse into the new playbook that a tech company functioning like a quasi-state can use to flex its power.\n\nClose the doors: Dicker with cities and states in secret, as if you're negotiating an arms-control deal, not a local building project.\n\nHide your cards: Tell the other side what you want without letting on how flexible you're actually going to be.\n\nChange the game: In the end, Amazon may simply prefer to rewrite its entire expansion plan than have to horse-trade with demanding and unpredictable local elected officials.\n\nWinners: Leaping to conclusions about who came out on top here is a mistake.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district is next door to the Amazon site, tweeted about defeating \"Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world.\"\n\nIn this version, New Yorkers won and Amazon lost: It suffered a PR black eye and has to regroup.\n\nBut New York didn't win much. Polls showed wide support in the area for bringing Amazon to Queens, even as some residents feared rent increases.\n\nThere's another way to play this game. Google and Apple have been undertaking major expansions outside of Silicon Valley and doing so with a lot less tax money and a lot less drama.\n\nApple said a year ago it was looking at a spot outside of California and Texas in which to expand. It decided instead to expand in Austin, pledging to invest $1 billion there.\n\nIt's also setting up new offices in Seattle, San Diego and the Los Angeles suburb of Culver City and expanding operations in Pittsburgh, New York, Boston, Portland, Oregon and Boulder, Colo.\n\nImpact: No public search, minor tax breaks.\n\nGoogle announced last year a major expansion in New York, spending $2.4 billion to acquire Chelsea Market and then, in December, announcing a further $1 billion investment.\n\nThis week the company announced it was spending $13 billion this year on data centers and offices throughout the US.\n\nImpact: Lots of jobs in New York, no tax breaks.\n\nGo deeper:"

Kamala Harris of California is leading the field of Democratic presidential candidates in capturing the public's attention during the opening wave of the 2020 campaign.\n\nWhy it matters: That puts Harris in a strong position to help set the Democratic primary agenda, much as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing for the House Democratic agenda.\n\nThe numbers from the past three months (Nov. 12\u2013Feb. 12) say it all:\n\nOn Google, Harris was searched twice as often as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who were next closest, according to Google Trends.\n\nInstagram interactions, according to CrowdTangle:\n\nHarris: 8.3 million Sanders: 4.6 million Warren: 2 million\n\nTwitter interactions, according to CrowdTangle (combining Senate and personal accounts):\n\nHarris: 14.4 million Sanders: 8 million Warren: 4.1 million\n\nThe exception is Facebook, where Sanders gets much of his clout, according to CrowdTangle (combining Senate and personal accounts):\n\nSanders: 22.1 million Harris: 2.4 million Warren: 2.3 million\n\nIn the past three months, articles about Harris have generated 16.5 million interactions on Facebook and from shares on influential Twitter accounts, according to social media analytics company NewsWhip.\n\nThat compares with 14.2 million for Warren and 10.6 million for Sanders.\n\nHarris' follower growth across those platforms during the past three months has been striking:\n\nOn Facebook , her main account has added 123,000 fans, per CrowdTangle. The next closest jump among 2020 competitors is Beto O'Rourke with 51,000.\n\n, her main account has added 123,000 fans, per CrowdTangle.

The next closest spikes came from O'Rourke and Warren with 200,000 followers added. On Twitter, she has added 420,000 followers. Next closest is O'Rourke with 245,000.\n\nThe big picture: The size of the major social media platforms makes for a useful barometer of public opinion and interest. They also signal a level of enthusiasm that is difficult to capture with traditional polling.\n\nYes, but: Early polling indicates former Vice President Joe Biden and Sanders have the highest favorables among 2020 Democrats. But, this early in the cycle, those numbers are often just a sign of name recognition.\n\nHaving already announced \u2014 or formed exploratory committees \u2014 Harris, Warren, and Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar have benefited from announcement-driven spikes of interest. The others can expect that when it's their time \u2014 but Harris has dominated the attention well beyond her initial announcement.\n\nThe bottom line: President Trump showed in the 2016 campaign that the ability to generate attention and make the public care about you is a precious commodity. Maintaining that edge, more than fundraising totals or a ground game, could be the key for Harris in 2020.\n\nGo deeper:"

Cardiac devices deliver low-energy pacing and electrical currents to correct heart rhythms and potentially fatal arrhythmias.\n\nMost are made of titanium and include a pulsed generator with a sealed lithium battery and wires incorporated with electrodes attached to the heart.\n\nCurrently, the batteries in these devices are not rechargeable and typically require surgical replacement after 5\u201312 years. The surgery, although considered minor, always carries risk of infection and death.\n\nWhat's new: Engineers were able to convert the kinetic energy of the heartbeat into electricity by adding a thin, energy-converting film to existing devices. The Dartmouth innovation follows other improvements made in recent years.\n\nWhat to watch: Engineers are currently testing the Dartmouth technology and expect potential market introduction in 5 years.\n\nMaggie Teliska is a technical specialist at Caldwell Intellectual Property Law, an intellectual property law firm, and CTO of Regent Power.

    "text": "\"It's an avoidable tragedy,\" Gottlieb, who says he's usually a proponent of state rights, tells Axios. \"Too many states have lax laws.\"\n\nBackground: The highly contagious disease can only be controlled if there's a large vaccination rate in the population, which the World Health Organization says should be 93%\u201395% of people.\n\nStates are allowed to adopt their own rules over what types of exemptions are allowed for vaccines. All of them allow exemptions for medical reasons, but many also provide exemptions on religious and/or philosophical grounds.\n\nThese pockets of unvaccinated people are transmitting measles in the U.S., which is particularly dangerous to those who can't get vaccinated, including babies under 12 months and people with susceptible immune systems.\n\nGottlieb says the vaccine is one of the most effective ones (97% with 2 doses) created so far, and for one of the most contagious viruses.\n\nMeasles can cause various complications, including pneumonia, brain damage and sometimes death, and it has been linked to longer term immune problems.\n\nWhat's happening now\n\nWHO reported last week that measles cases tripled globally in 2018 from the prior year, and current reports show multiple deadly outbreaks in the Philippines, Ukraine, Israel and Madagascar.\n\nIn Washington state, the number of confirmed cases has more than doubled since Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency on Jan. 25, to 54 as of Feb. 13.\n\nClark County, where a majority of the Washington cases are located, reported a 70% MMR vaccination rate for 19\u201335 month olds. But since the outbreak, there was an almost 450% increase in vaccination rates in January compared with the same month the prior year.\n\nIn New York, there is an outbreak in Rockland County, Monroe County and New York City, and Texas reported 8 cases in 5 different counties as of Feb. 14.\n\nThe debate\n\n\"It's a self-inflicted wound,\" says Peter Hotez, dean at Baylor College of Medicine who published a study last year showing possible U.S. \"hotspots\" of measles due to vaccine exemptions, that he says is already proving to be true.\n\nPro-vaccination groups are \"losing the battle\" to anti-vaccination groups, who've been very active on social media and forming at least one PAC to promote their message, he says.\n\nThe other side: Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the nonprofit National Vaccine Information Center often labeled as anti-vaccination, tells Axios that 100 cases of measles in a population of 320 million \"is not a public health emergency.\"\n\n\"[It] should not be used to justify eliminating the legal right to exercise informed consent to vaccination, which is protected by the inclusion of flexible medical, religious and conscientious-belief vaccine exemptions in public health laws,\" she says.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "text": "Details: Coal consumption, 82% of which stems from electricity generation in coal-fired power plants, has fallen to its lowest point in four decades. Spurring on the decline is a nationwide retreat by power providers from coal-fired electricity generation, which fell by a near-record 14.3 gigawatts last year.\n\nWhile the coal industry has claimed that regulation is a major driver of coal\u2019s decline, official projections\n\nBe smart: The Trump administration's failed attempt to block the closure of the remaining coal-fired unit in the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s (TVA) Paradise Fossil Plant made little economic sense. After shutting down two other coal-fired units in the Paradise location in 2017 and replacing them with more efficient gas power generators, the TVA officially voted to close the third on Thursday. This is a trend grounded in the need for efficiency and lower operations and maintenance costs associated with coal units.\n\nWhat to watch: Now at just 691 million tons, U.S. coal consumption is expected to continue declining, down from 29% to 2% of total electricity production by 2035. This generating capacity will be replaced mostly by less expensive natural gas power plants, whose share is expected to rise from 30% to 37% over the same time period.\n\nThe bottom line: With electricity power providers seeking cleaner, more cost-competitive options and the shale revolution unlocking new natural gas reserves, the market \u2014 if left alone \u2014 will continue to replace coal with natural gas as the dominant fuel source for U.S. electricity.\n\nRichard D.

In New York, as we reported yesterday, Amazon is the target of a massive campaign accusing it of greed for the $3 billion in breaks it has received to build a new headquarters employing some 25,000 high-paid workers.\n\nWalmart \u2014 at least in rhetoric \u2014 is attempting to move into the breach. Out of sheer necessity to survive the Amazon juggernaut's retail onslaught, it is casting itself as the foil.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe rebrand has its skeptics: Louis Hyman, a historian of capitalism at Cornell University, tells Axios: \u201cI\u2019m sure Walmart wants to position itself as a small-town business, but that\u2019s just not true. Walmart is still a 500-pound gorilla.\u201d\n\nWith $500 billion in revenue last year, Walmart remains by far the biggest company by sales in the U.S., and is no less ruthless than it ever was, Hyman said.\n\nIts own e-commerce business is ballooning every quarter.\n\nYet Walmart's rebranding appears to have traction: With a network of some 4,700 stores that are within 10 miles of 90% of Americans, Walmart is perhaps better positioned than any government agency, think tank or company to take the economic pulse of the U.S. It is using that on-the-ground presence to position itself as a champion of distressed and alienated America.\n\nOn stage at a conference in Bentonville today, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon sat across from New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, who asked him the ultimate question: How will you stay relevant?\n\nMcMillon said: \"There\u2019s a strong and heavy dose of humanity in it. ... A differentiating characteristic of our company will be that we still care about people, and they know it.\""

There are fears a bruising and close-fought election could give way to violence and instability.\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest economy but the government is almost entirely reliant on oil revenues. The country is ranked among\n\n\u201cNigeria has a laundry list of challenges, and it\u2019s hard to see any positive inroads on any of them,\u201d says Matthew Page of Chatham House, a U.K. think tank. He says the question is: \u201cCan they take them on or will they just twiddle their thumbs as Nigeria barrels toward this moment of catharsis?\u201d\n\nIncumbent Muhammadu Buhari made history in 2015 \u2014 three decades after he was toppled as a military strongman \u2014 by becoming the first opposition candidate to defeat a sitting president.\n\nBuhari\u2019s appeal rests on his incorruptibility, but institutionalized corruption remains unscathed after four years, according to Transparency International\n\nIt has been a grueling four years. Buhari has faced health struggles, economic headwinds and a relentless Boko Haram insurgency.\n\nAtiku Abubakar, a former vice president, represents the People\u2019s Democratic Party, which ruled Nigeria for 16 years until Buhari\u2019s election. This is his fourth run for the top job.\n\nAbubakar, a wealthy businessman, says he\u2019ll open the country up for more investment. He has been dogged by allegations of corruption and \u201calmost symbolizes\u201d Nigeria's infamous system of political patronage, Page says.\n\nAs Max Siollun puts it in Foreign Policy\n\nBoth men are in their 70s. Both are Muslims from Nigeria\u2019s north. Neither is proposing transformative reforms. \u201cThis is kind of their last bite at the apple before a younger generation comes in,\u201d Page says.\n\nThe big picture: The population has doubled over the past two decades to 200 million and is set to double again by 2050 \u2014 at which time Nigeria will have the third-largest population on Earth.\n\nNearly 3 in 4 Nigerians polled told Gallup\n\nConfidence in the fairness of elections is improving\n\nJohn Tomaszewski, Africa director for the International Republican Institute, says that beyond who wins, it\u2019s essential that this election keeps Nigeria\u2019s democracy moving forward.\n\nWhat he\u2019s watching for: Voter intimidation from police or security personnel, a lack of transparency from the electoral commission, long lines and confusion at polling places, and \u201ctensions spilling over into possible violence.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: \u201cNigeria needs to get this right for Nigeria, first of all. That will have reverberating effects all around Africa but also for Europe. This is an important election for the world,\u201d Tomaszewski says."

    "text": "\u201cEverything we know about transportation is going to get disrupted ... including charging. ... What we have to do is make sure that we are early in supporting that.\"\n\nHow it works: If AVs, EVs, and the electrification of fleets \u2014 think ride-hailing services, commercial delivery vehicles and government vehicles \u2014 were a Venn diagram, there would be lots of overlap.\n\nMost AVs will be ultimately be electric. AVs and electric fleet vehicles are likely to charge at different places than personal vehicles. Charging will probably be concentrated in depots that can handle a range of vehicle types, Romano notes.\n\nBetween the lines: That's a seismic shift over the long-term.\n\n\u201cIt changes your architecture for your products. It changes the scope of what your software has to talk to on the fleet side, it changes the scope of what your hardware has to deal with on the fast-charge side.\"\n\n\u2014 Romano\n\nWhy you\u2019ll hear about this again: Romano, whose California-based company says it has the world's largest commercial charging network, agrees with projections that as AVs rise, so will total vehicle miles traveled (VMT).\n\n\"As long as we are attached economically to VMT in some way, we should be fine. This is a huge market,\u201d Romano says.\n\nRomano says that preparing for the use of EVs and AVs, especially in vehicle fleets, means \"you have got to be thinking literally with a 20-year lens\" \u2014 and even much longer.\n\nHere are a few more takeaways from my interview with Romano, whose decade-old company is expanding in the U.S. and Europe...\n\n1. The red state opportunity: He expects that southern states where automakers are expanding EV production \u2014 he mentioned Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee \u2014 will be a charging growth area.\n\n\u201cThe primary reason is there is actually really good economic alignment. It is hard to be making something in your state and not promoting the use of it in your state,\u201d Romano said.\n\n2. The European market: \u201cMy assumption is that there will be continued consolidation. It is not going to 1 player. It is too large a market, right? But it can\u2019t be 20,\u201d he said, noting companies need scale to compete.\n\n3. The future of retail: In addition to electrified bus fleets, which is a focus for the company, Romano sees the growth of online retail presenting a big opportunity.\n\nElectrification of delivery vehicle fleets already makes sense from a cost perspective, but there are currently few options, he notes.\n\nBut more vehicle makers like Daimler (one of ChargePoint's investors) are developing more products. \"When the vehicles are here for all the different sizes of trucks, then I think that is going to electrify quickly,\" Romano says.\n\n\u201cThose fleets are operating globally, so the charging infrastructure vendors ... are going to have to operate globally [too], because you don\u2019t want to ... have a regional patchwork,\" which would make it too complicated, he says.\n\nGo deeper:"

In each case, he pushed it aside and thought he and Laura were meant for each other,\" said Crane Hassold, senior director of threat research at Agari, the email security firm that profiled Scarlet Widow. \"It really shows the psychological damage these scams cause.\"\n\nEven with those warnings, when that victim lost contact with Laura, he became increasingly desperate, emailing \"I JUST WANT TO TALK TO MY BABY.

Hassold suggests that might be because \"these are people who put faith in things they have not seen, being asked to put faith in a person they will never see in person.\"\n\n\"It gives you a glimpse into what other groups scammers think are vulnerable,\" he added.\n\nAs Agari re-created Scarlet Widow's past scams, it was also able to identify how the group evolved over time.\n\nThe group's other fake personas included Sterling Michael, a 43-year old captain serving in Afghanistan, and Britney Parkwell, a fabric saleswoman living in San Jose.\n\nincluded Sterling Michael, a 43-year old captain serving in Afghanistan, and Britney Parkwell, a fabric saleswoman living in San Jose.

It responded with this statement:\n\n\"We are excited to work with New Yorkers over the coming months and years to bring a new Amazon headquarters to Long Island City and help support the community. We will create 25,000 corporate and technology jobs directly, as well as tens of thousands of other jobs in construction, building services, hospitality and other service industries for all of Queens.

They apply a set of community standards using rulebooks of hundreds of pages to:\n\nbalance rules barring depictions of violence and nudity against claims to \"newsworthiness\" \u2014 to, say, block porn but allow a Vietnam War-era news photo of a naked, napalmed girl;\n\nenforce bans on hate speech, terrorist recruitment, bullying, and other harmful behavior;\n\nlook for signs of \"coordinated inauthentic behavior,\" like Russian-backed misinformation campaigns during the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nIt can be a grueling job, even with a variety of automated flagging tools and the beginnings of AI-driven systems that are getting better at identifying objectionable posts.\n\nWhile the creation of an independent appeals body won't cut the moderation workload, it could increase public satisfaction with the results, as users see a more transparent and accountable process.\n\nFacebook will also be able to hand tough choices off to the new board.\n\nYes, but: Government-by-constitution is hard. Building a framework for a new kind of online legal system that's able to resolve conflicts fairly and efficiently is also likely to be slow and painful.\n\nThe appeals board will offer more recourse than unhappy users have today when their content is removed, but they may not be happy with the final calls.\n\nFacebook's legal governance structure remains its corporate charter and its shareholders (among whom Zuckerberg controls a voting majority), and any power it gives the new board it could also take back.\n\nThings the draft charter doesn't address:\n\nWhat happens if a board ruling conflicts with the needs of a key Facebook business initiative.\n\nWhat happens if a board ruling establishes a principle that makes sense in one region of the world and offends people in another.\n\nWhat happens to the board if Facebook's leadership changes or the company's actual Board of Directors wants to dismantle it.\n\nFlashback: Facebook tried a short-lived experiment in letting users vote on platform policy beginning in 2009, but gave it up when too few users participated in what many saw as a burden rather than a privilege."

The Middle East now accounts for almost a third of worldwide sales by volume of non-alcoholic beer.\n\nDespite overall beer declines between 2011 and 2016, consumption of non-alcoholic beer in Germany increased 43%, according to Euromonitor International. In China, about 30% of the new beers launched in 2016 were non-alcoholic, according to market research firm Mintel.\n\nSurprise: While non-alcoholic beer has traditionally been seen as a replacement for alcoholic beer, today, one in five low-or-no-alcohol products sold is replacing a soft drink, according to a recent UBS survey.\n\nGo deeper: Bud Light to begin disclosing nutrition facts"

Kamala Harris of California is leading the field of Democratic presidential candidates in capturing the public's attention during the opening wave of the 2020 campaign.\n\nWhy it matters: That puts Harris in a strong position to help set the Democratic primary agenda, much as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing for the House Democratic agenda.\n\nThe numbers from the past three months (Nov. 12\u2013Feb. 12) say it all:\n\nOn Google, Harris was searched twice as often as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who were next closest, according to Google Trends.\n\nInstagram interactions, according to CrowdTangle:\n\nHarris: 8.3 million Sanders: 4.6 million Warren: 2 million\n\nTwitter interactions, according to CrowdTangle (combining Senate and personal accounts):\n\nHarris: 14.4 million Sanders: 8 million Warren: 4.1 million\n\nThe exception is Facebook, where Sanders gets much of his clout, according to CrowdTangle (combining Senate and personal accounts):\n\nSanders: 22.1 million Harris: 2.4 million Warren: 2.3 million\n\nIn the past three months, articles about Harris have generated 16.5 million interactions on Facebook and from shares on influential Twitter accounts, according to social media analytics company NewsWhip.\n\nThat compares with 14.2 million for Warren and 10.6 million for Sanders.\n\nHarris' follower growth across those platforms during the past three months has been striking:\n\nOn Facebook , her main account has added 123,000 fans, per CrowdTangle.

The next closest spikes came from O'Rourke and Warren with 200,000 followers added. On Twitter, she has added 420,000 followers. Next closest is O'Rourke with 245,000.\n\nThe big picture: The size of the major social media platforms makes for a useful barometer of public opinion and interest. They also signal a level of enthusiasm that is difficult to capture with traditional polling.\n\nYes, but: Early polling indicates former Vice President Joe Biden and Sanders have the highest favorables among 2020 Democrats. But, this early in the cycle, those numbers are often just a sign of name recognition.\n\nHaving already announced \u2014 or formed exploratory committees \u2014 Harris, Warren, and Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar have benefited from announcement-driven spikes of interest. The others can expect that when it's their time \u2014 but Harris has dominated the attention well beyond her initial announcement.\n\nThe bottom line: President Trump showed in the 2016 campaign that the ability to generate attention and make the public care about you is a precious commodity. Maintaining that edge, more than fundraising totals or a ground game, could be the key for Harris in 2020.\n\nGo deeper:"

Witt allegedly revealed to the Iranian regime a \"highly classified intelligence program\" and the identity of a former fellow intelligence officer, actions that Air Force Special Agent Terry Phillips called \"a betrayal of our nation\u2019s security, our military, and the American people.\" Witt remains at large as one of the FBI\u2019s \"most wanted\" criminals."

It is putting the potential for a robust climate action at risk. ... The resolution itself did a great job of avoiding these controversies and finding a way to appeal to a broad spectrum of Democrats. But because the FAQs drove the narrative, McConnell sees it as a way to hurt vulnerable Democrats and embarrass the 2020 field.\"\n\nWhat's next: It's not exactly clear what McConnell will bring up or when, and whether Democrats will use Senate procedure to force Republicans to vote on anything related (such as the reality of human-caused warming and its effects).\n\nThe big question: How will Democrats approach the vote, especially the members running for president.\n\nGreg Carlock of the progressive think tank Data for Progress says he agrees Congress should go on record about bold action, but that it should happen via \"due legislative process that allows for transparent debate and compromise.\"\n\n\"I would not fault members and even cosponsors of the resolution [who] abstain from a vote, signaling they aren't here to play politics but to work out real solutions,\" he tells Axios.\n\nMy thought bubble: McConnell would not be doing this unless he saw a political opening. But it's far too early to know whether the GND is ultimately a political winner or loser for Democrats.\n\nIn the short term, let's see what the first waves of polling after the plan's release.\n\nLonger term, let's watch how the public responds to the big ideas that are in the resolution as the 2020 cycle unfolds.\n\nThere's plenty of examples of disconnects between what's publicly popular and what has been long been politically unviable in Washington, such as \"Medicare for All.\"\n\nGo deeper:"

The tour-based model: Unlike traditional sports leagues, where each franchise calls one city home, the PLL will use a tour-based model that will see its six teams travel to the same location each weekend to play a series of games.\n\nSaves money: Teams don't have to negotiate costly venue agreements.\n\nTeams don't have to negotiate costly venue agreements.

Most, though, said Apple was probably just starting negotiations high.\n\nEven assuming Apple took a far lower cut, though, it's not clear the economics would be great for large publishers.\n\nThe New York Times, for example, gets $15 per month for a non-discounted digital subscription. WSJ fetches close to $40 a month.\n\nIt's not clear what Apple might charge, but it's hard to see it getting much more than that. Publishers would then face a high risk of losing existing customers to the service while likely collecting a much smaller amount from Apple.\n\nPublishing execs also stressed their unwillingness to give up the business advantages of a direct relationship with customers.\n\nData: With Apple News, Apple will own audience data and insights, as well as transaction data, leaving publishers less able to market to customers, whether for subscriptions or other revenue streams, like events or commerce.\n\nWith Apple News, Apple will own audience data and insights, as well as transaction data, leaving publishers less able to market to customers, whether for subscriptions or other revenue streams, like events or commerce.

John Barrasso calling it a \"socialist manifesto that lays out a laundry list of government giveaways.\"\n\nDemocrat are responding by bashing Republicans' lack of a climate plan, although it's unknown where the majority of Senate Democrats stand on the GND itself, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who hasn't weighed in on the GND resolution led by Sen. Ed Markey.\n\nMarkey's office said McConnell is trying to \"sabotage\" the resolution by bringing it up without hearings or a \"true national debate.\"\n\nThe intrigue: Here's what a former senior Obama administration official who worked on energy and asked to remain anonymous tells me about the FAQ:\n\n\"It was a monumental screw up. It is putting the potential for a robust climate action at risk. ... The resolution itself did a great job of avoiding these controversies and finding a way to appeal to a broad spectrum of Democrats. But because the FAQs drove the narrative, McConnell sees it as a way to hurt vulnerable Democrats and embarrass the 2020 field.\"\n\nWhat's next: It's not exactly clear what McConnell will bring up or when, and whether Democrats will use Senate procedure to force Republicans to vote on anything related (such as the reality of human-caused warming and its effects).\n\nThe big question: How will Democrats approach the vote, especially the members running for president.\n\nGreg Carlock of the progressive think tank Data for Progress says he agrees Congress should go on record about bold action, but that it should happen via \"due legislative process that allows for transparent debate and compromise.\"\n\n\"I would not fault members and even cosponsors of the resolution [who] abstain from a vote, signaling they aren't here to play politics but to work out real solutions,\" he tells Axios.\n\nMy thought bubble: McConnell would not be doing this unless he saw a political opening. But it's far too early to know whether the GND is ultimately a political winner or loser for Democrats.\n\nIn the short term, let's see what the first waves of polling after the plan's release.\n\nLonger term, let's watch how the public responds to the big ideas that are in the resolution as the 2020 cycle unfolds.\n\nThere's plenty of examples of disconnects between what's publicly popular and what has been long been politically unviable in Washington, such as \"Medicare for All.\"\n\nGo deeper:"

    "text": "What's happening: Two AV companies scored huge rounds of fresh funding in the last few days, giving them the resources to keep developing their technology and add engineering talent.\n\nMeanwhile, in more modest but still important news yesterday, May Mobility raised $22 million in Series A funding to keep developing its last-mile AV transit solution.\n\nQuick take: These companies have something in common: a path to commercialization. Nuro and May Mobility already have tiny fleets of low-speed AVs on the road. Aurora is developing a \"driver\" for any vehicle and has big-name partners including Hyundai and Volkswagen.\n\nLeadership credibility matters, too. Some co-founders of all three companies are veterans of the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge and others worked on Google's self-driving car project (now Waymo) before starting their own companies.\n\nWhat we're seeing: With the magnitude of the challenges facing AV technology sinking in, investors have stopped chasing the dream and are narrowing their focus to companies with a commercial niche and actual revenue potential.\n\nIn contrast to the way software apps multiply, AV companies need to map each city individually and then test their vehicles on local roads before launching \u2014 a meticulous, 6-month effort that must be repeated for each city.\n\nEven with massive investments of time and money, full-scale deployment remains slow and limited.\n\nSafety must come before speed and scale. Consider Uber's missteps in Phoenix that led to a pedestrian's death.\n\nPublic fear of AVs remains an issue. People still have to decide whether AVs are safe, affordable, convenient \u2014 or even needed.\n\nWhere it stands: Some 60 companies are spending \"high single-digit billions\" annually to try to grab a commanding share of what's expected to be a $1 trillion AV market, says Mark Wakefield, managing director of advisory firm AlixPartners.\n\n\"The worry is that most of the money is going to be wasted because every one of them is hyper-convinced that they\u2019re going to win. They\u2019re clearly not going to win.\"\n\n\u2014 Mark Wakefield\n\nThe bottom line: After a lot of churning, the cream is rising to the top, says Varun Jain of Qualcomm Ventures, which exited an early-stage investment in Cruise Automation when GM bought the AV startup in 2016.\n\n\"Companies that have a difficult path to market, or don\u2019t have the talent, will struggle. So there will be a correction. But that's healthy.\"\n\nEditor's note: this story was clarified to show that some of the founders of all three companies are veterans of the DARPA Urban Challenge."

Mike Rogers, (R-Ala.), the ranking member of the committee.\n\nRogers questioned the value of increasing spending on security, given that it would be difficult to spend the money before the next round of primaries.\n\nBe smart: Voting machines are indeed hackable, but election security touches on deep issues of distrust between states and the federal government. States control elections, including election machine purchases, and both Congress and federal agencies have struggled in the past to convince the states that even voluntary help from the national government does not amount to a government takeover.\n\nThat relationship is improving, said the director of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Christopher Krebs. \"Right now that relationship is strong and getting stronger.\"\n\nKrebs and Thomas Hicks, commissioner of the Election Assistance Commission, emphasized that upgrading infrastructure to increase the audit-ability of elections \u2014 from registration through voting \u2014 is a current key priority.\n\nThe bottom line: It may be time for a more forceful hand by the federal government, witness Jake Braun, CEO of Cambridge Global Advisors, told Axios before the afternoon hearing.\n\n\"The best model might be MADD [Mothers Against Drunk Driving],\" he said. \"States didn't raise all their blood alcohol level laws until Congress withheld funding from the Department of Transportation.\"\n\nGo deeper: House Democrats' first bill has an eye on election security"

And the fight against big corporations and big tax breaks is a ripe political issue, says Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke's Fuqua School of Business.\n\nWhat's happening: At a press conference Monday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called HQ2 \"the single greatest economic development transaction in the state\u2019s history,\" and said it would be wrong to stop the deal due to some political backlash.\n\nAt the center of that pushback is state Sen.

But he tells me, even if the governor rejects him, it'll be difficult to find widespread support for HQ2 in the state legislature.\n\nThe other side: Despite the very public and very loud opposition to Amazon, the public seems to generally approve of the deal. Per a new Siena College Research Institute poll, New Yorkers support HQ2 by a 20-point margin.\n\nThere are still several cities itching to welcome Amazon to town.\n\nA few of the losing locales geared up to throw their names into the mix once again.

It responded with this statement:\n\n\"We are excited to work with New Yorkers over the coming months and years to bring a new Amazon headquarters to Long Island City and help support the community. We will create 25,000 corporate and technology jobs directly, as well as tens of thousands of other jobs in construction, building services, hospitality and other service industries for all of Queens.

China apparently hasn\u2019t proposed satisfactory subsidy cuts across China 2025 sectors, nor a credible commitment to scale back informal \u201cbuy China\u201d policies. China denies that it requires technology transfers for market access, limiting what it can offer. The U.S., meanwhile, hasn\u2019t offered to buy Huawei equipment or to stop its campaign to dissuade allies from patronizing one of China\u2019s leading companies.\n\nWhere it stands: A modest deal that preserves the truce \u2014 marked by ongoing talks, the resumption of Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods and a stay on U.S. tariff increases \u2014 remains within reach by March 1. That could provide a bridge to a longer-term deal, potentially announced with fanfare at a summit even with key details unresolved.\n\nBetween the lines: Further escalation isn\u2019t in the short-run economic interest of either country. Increasing the current 10% tariffs to 25%, as the U.S. threatened, would reduce the purchasing power of U.S. consumers and eat into the profits of U.S. firms with China-centric supply chains. It would effectively be a $30 billion tax hike on the U.S. economy (and more if the scope of the tariffs were broadened).\n\nAs China\u2019s own economy weakens and its global exports slow, avoiding further tariffs also has appeal to the Chinese side, even if it means rolling back China\u2019s retaliatory measures before the U.S. removes all its tariffs.\n\nThe bottom line: The prospects of another extension depend on the Trump administration\u2019s endgame \u2014 whether rolling back tariffs to maintain the current level of integration, escalating them with a big step toward economic decoupling, or simply holding on through 2020 and leaving the big decisions for a second term or a new president.\n\nBrad Setser is the Steven A.

But very real progress has been made in terms of U.S. crisis prevention. Plus, American households are much less leveraged than they were pre-crisis, and the global liquidity glut is flowing into equity rather than into dubiously-rated synthetic debt obligations.\n\nWeWork and Netflix might well go belly up.

The question now is whether the financial crisis brewing in South Africa will be a big enough deterrent to dissuade Southeast Asian governments from falling victim to economic crises of their own.\n\nJustin Guay directs global climate strategy at the Sunrise Project and advises the ClimateWorks Foundation."

In their \"high case,\" where there's regime change that ends sanctions and brings new financing to the country's battered oil sector, the decline is less pronounced, with production falling to 1.11 million barrels per day this year and slightly further in 2020.\n\nWhat's next: Even if Maduro is ousted, production will come back only gradually as sanctions are lifted and new financing comes in, Rystad projects.\n\nThey see output from the country's massive reserves climbing to around 1.54 million barrels per day in 2025, still well below the 2.44 million barrels per day at the start of this decade.\n\nThe big picture: So far, oil markets haven't been especially rattled by the crisis there, in part because production has been declining for years.\n\nBut, but, but: This new commentary from the Center for Strategic and International Studies warns that there could be bumpy times ahead, both for Gulf Coast refiners that rely on Venezuelan heavy crude and the market more broadly.\n\n\"Gulf Coast refiners are likely to be increasingly short of the heavier grade crudes and scrambling for alternative supplies, especially later this spring as maintenance season ends,\" author Frank Verrastro writes.\n\nHe says the Trump administration seems to be counting on a swift resolution to the standoff, and \"the protracted loss of substantial heavy oil volumes could also complicate the next round of sanctions and waivers on Iranian oil.\"\n\nThe bottom line: \"Add to that Venezuela\u2019s assumption of OPEC\u2019s presidency, planned changes in maritime fuel standards and resurgent calls for climate action, and 2019 has all the earmarks of another year of high volatility,\" Verrastro adds."

Michael Hewitt and retired U.S. Army Gen. Jack Keane. Hewitt and Keane represent a company called IP3 International that seeks to secure nuclear deals overseas.\n\nA White House official said: \"This is being led by General Keane. This is a group that he has put together; the president talks with him periodically. He wanted to bring in a group to have a discussion about the important renewable energy sources and talk about nuclear construction efforts around the world.\"\n\nA source familiar with the meeting said that while the Saudi issue will be discussed, there will be \"a larger discussion about how to make the U.S. nuclear industry more competitive.\"\n\nThe source added that the meeting will also focus on the question of, \"do U.S. companies have the right tools to compete?\" The source said on that front, the U.S. nuclear industry needs a properly functioning Export-Import Bank and support for the so-called \"123 agreements\" required for countries to use U.S. nuclear technology.\n\nBetween the lines: The most significant 123 agreement currently being negotiated is with Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn the early days of the Trump administration, one of the strongest backers of the Saudi process was Michael Flynn, who resigned as national security adviser over his communications with Russia. Flynn wrote on a disclosure form that he had served as an adviser to IP3 International before joining the White House, though the company said it \u201cnever paid Flynn and that he did not accept its offer to serve as an adviser,\u201d the Washington Post reported in 2017.\n\nThe NY Times noted last November that: \u201cPrivately, administration officials argue that if the United States does not sell the nuclear equipment to Saudi Arabia someone else will \u2014 maybe Russia, China or South Korea.\u201d\n\nA deal to help Saudi Arabia acquire nuclear technology would not require Senate approval, per Pro Publica, but Congress could block the deal with a joint resolution opposing it. Senior Democrats have previously expressed concerns.\n\nThe White House official said the meeting would also focus \u201con future civil nuclear energy in the U.S. and the supply chain for nuclear energy.\u201d Representatives from GE, Exelon and Westinghouse declined to comment.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been corrected to note that Fluor will not attend the meeting."

The internet operates on domain name system (DNS) servers, which operate like a kind of phone book, \"resolving\" the verbal web addresses (like \"axios.com\") users send from browsers into numerical internet addresses that the network understands.\n\nBy 2020, Russia has announced it wants to resolve as much as 95% of its DNS requests on servers within the country. Doing so would give Russia the opportunity to prevent users from accessing content the government wished to censor.\n\nPreparing Russia's network to function while isolated from the global internet would help create the infrastructure the country would need to prevent citizens from circumventing national control.\n\nThere's a good chance Russia's internet test could cause a little chaos, noted Tim April, principal architect of Akamai, because much of the internet's functionality comes from globally coordinated systems \u2014 everything from web analytics platforms to synchronized timing to spam blocking lists.\n\nChina uses its tight-fisted control of its domestic internet, the so-called \"Great Firewall,\" to keep granular control over ideas its citizens are allowed to communicate.\n\nIt famously bans everything from the history of Tiananmen Square to Winnie the Pooh memes.\n\nRussia may be freer than China, but it is still restrictive about dissent.

    "text": "\"Real wages went up recently mostly because [real] inflation was zero,\" Bill Spriggs, chief economist at labor union AFL-CIO tells Axios. \"And there are still a number of headwinds going forward that will keep prices in check.\"\n\nSpriggs argues that significantly lower rates of unionization have hurt employee bargaining power and diminished the ability for higher union wages to set the standard. But he says the problem has also been that government has sided with business rather than labor over the past few decades, giving businesses an unassailable advantage.\n\nThat's good news for shareholders who rely on high margins to boost profits and returns.\n\nAs Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners, notes, businesses have many tools at their disposal to tackle rising employee wages and have shown themselves adept at using them. The most popular have been changing location and automation.\n\n\"Businesses are saying, 'We're not going to pay you more because we're moving to Texas' or 'We'll bring in a robot to replace you.'\"\n\nYes, but: Firms also are dealing with a lack of pricing power. Companies like Amazon have largely kept companies from raising the prices of goods because customers can quickly and easily find substitutes online for a lower price.\n\nDiscount stores like Dollar General, one of the few retailers seeing unequivocal success with more than 15,000 stores and a stock price that has risen more than 400% since its 2009 debut, are also abetting this trend.\n\nOf note: 17% of CEOs and CFOs in a December UBS survey said they expect labor costs to be a headwind, up from 14% in May and from 10% in November 2017. In the most recent NABE survey 58% of respondents reported rising labor costs, the highest on record, while just 19% reported higher prices charged to customers.\n\nHowever, those same UBS survey respondents expect sales growth to accelerate and profits to rise.\n\nGoldman Sachs points out that its economists expect net profit margins of 10.9% in 2019, down from their level a year ago. But last year's 11.2% profit margins were an all-time high.\n\nGo deeper: The case for a higher minimum wage"

    "text": "Background: The Food and Drug Administration defines e-cigarettes as a tobacco product, while traditional cigarettes and cigars are combustible tobacco products. \"Current users\" are defined as people who've used a tobacco product in past 30 days, while \"frequent users\" are for those who've used the product for more than 20 out of the past 30 days.\n\nTobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S. and nearly all tobacco use begins in adolescence, Schuchat said.\n\nWhile e-cigs don't have the heavy carcinogenic toll that traditional cigarettes do, they do have high levels of addictive nicotine. One vaping pod can equal roughly one pack of cigarettes for nicotine.\n\nBy the numbers: Public health officials from CDC, the FDA, and Minnesota's health department discussed the findings, which were from the 2011\u20132018 National Youth Tobacco Surveys and published in Vital Signs.\n\n27.1% of high school students and 7.2% of middle school students used a tobacco product in 2018.\n\nFor high school students, e-cigs were the most commonly used tobacco product at 20.8%, followed by cigarettes at 8.1%, cigars at 7.6%, smokeless tobacco at 5.9%, hookah at 4.1%, and pipe tobacco at 1.1%.\n\nAmong middle schoolers, e-cigs were 4.9%, which is also the most commonly used tobacco product, followed by cigarettes at 1.8%, smokeless tobacco at 1.8%, cigars\n\nat 1.6%, hookah at 1.2%, and pipe tobacco at 0.3%.\n\nat 1.6%, hookah at 1.2%, and pipe tobacco at 0.3%. Among youth using tobacco products, 2 in 5 high school students and 1 in 3 middle school students are using 2 or more tobacco products \u2014 primarily e-cigs and traditional cigarettes.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told Axios the agency will \"have to reconsider our enforcement policy\" if these numbers aren't turned around.\n\nWhile Gottlieb said there are some indications that e-cigs may help people quit from combustible tobacco products that are carcinogenic, it \"can't be on the back of the youth.\"\n\nIn this long Twitter thread from Sunday, Gottlieb said, \"[W]e could be looking at more kids addicted to nicotine than we've seen in a long time.\"\n\nMatthew Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, agrees. He said e-cigs have created a new generation of tobacco users that's \"erased all the progress we made over the years.\"\n\nThese trends are \"incredibly disturbing,\" particularly with the \"meteoric rise in the use of e-cigarettes,\" Myers told Axios.\n\nHe said the problem is not just the increased numbers of young people using e-cigs, but that \"the data shows almost conclusively that ... roughly 27% of [tobacco-using high school] kids are using e-cigarettes 20 days or more per month, which is a clear sign of addiction.\"\n\nEditor's note: This piece was updated to add the FDA's definition of tobacco products and to clarify the quote in the last sentence."

When it was awarded in 2004, the private industry took off.\n\nBetween the lines: A space program has become a must-have for governments, and not just for the usual players:\n\nUnited Arab Emirates: In 2021, coinciding with the country's 50th birthday, the UAE plans to have a spacecraft orbiting Mars.\n\nIn 2021, coinciding with the country's 50th birthday, the UAE plans to have a spacecraft orbiting Mars.

As long as people are just going places, \"then do what the hell you want in space. Go mine asteroids, set up colonies. It's a big universe.\"\n\nBut, he goes on, \"if you go to the Moon or to Mars and set up a military base, that can be viewed as a threat.\"\n\nTo protect American interests, President Trump last summer ordered the establishment of a Space Force.\n\nAlready, says Nicholas Wright, a U.K.-based analyst, equipment in orbit jams signals, blinds with lasers, and spies using cyber tools. That makes him wonder, \"Is space fundamentally a military story?\"\n\nIt won't be, if the private players have anything to do with it. By 2040, estimates Morgan Stanley, the space economy will be worth $1.1 trillion; Bank of America estimates $2.7 trillion.\n\nAs of now, these numbers are notional; the private sector is still trying to decipher what it can do in space that it cannot on Earth \u2014 or that millions of people will pay for.\n\nSays Diamandis, \"I am focused on, 'Can you build a business that makes money in space?'\"\n\nGo deeper:\n\nEditor's note: This deep dive was first published in October of 2018."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Secretary of State Pompeo. Photo: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBackground: President Trump's decision to withdraw from the JCPOA last year has created one of the thorniest points of transatlantic division. The EU continues to support the agreement, and many Western Europeans view the conference as an uncomfortable dilemma between sticking to the EU's commitment and taking part in a summit that explicitly excludes Iran.\n\nComplicating matters, France, Germany, and the U.K. have a new point of leverage ahead of the talks: the launch of a mechanism that would circumvent U.S. sanctions and allow for trade with Iran.\n\nFor Poland, this will be a chance to play a hosting role on a key international issue, and to further strengthen a growing alliance with the U.S. While Warsaw has so far remained within the EU consensus on the JCPOA, it has also been receptive to U.S. concerns over Iran's ballistic missile program and support for terrorist organizations.\n\nReality check: For the summit to be a conducive forum for the U.S., Arab states, Israel and the EU to begin to work out their differences, it will require careful diplomacy, wide consultations with U.S. allies, and the perception that Washington can act as an honest broker. So far, quite a few key players remain unconvinced, with several of the foreign ministers of big EU countries still waiting until the last moment to decide on their participation.\n\nWhat to watch: The big challenges to Middle Eastern stability \u2014 Syria, Iran, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \u2014 require, at the very least, agreement between the U.S. and its allies in both the Middle East and Europe. If the Warsaw conference is seen as a predominantly anti-Iranian summit, it will only exacerbate transatlantic divisions, leaving the U.S. with fewer allies in the Middle East, and Poland with a political price to pay within the EU.\n\nMichal Baranowski is the director of the German Marshall Fund\u2019s Warsaw office."

But then trouble started.\n\nThe Israeli ministry of defense is responsible for giving licenses for such deals. It was notified at a late stage and refused to approve the deal over concerns about giving sensitive technology to the UAE and because of U.S. reservations about the deal.\n\nWhen the deal was cancelled the UAE government, especially its de facto ruler Mohammed Bin Zayed (MBZ), was furious.\n\nDan Shapiro, who was the Middle East director at the National Security Council at the time, told me MBZ felt betrayed by the Israelis.\n\nFormer U.S. and Israeli officials told me the failed deal, combined with the assassination of a Hamas operative in Dubai, created a deep crisis between Israel and the UAE which lasted from 2010 to 2012.\n\nShapiro told me the National Security Council staff and the U.S. intelligence community were talking to both parties in order to understand what each side wanted or was willing to do to end the crisis.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Background: In the wake of natural disasters, there have been many missed opportunities where federal dollars have gone to restoring, rather than rethinking, poorly designed infrastructure. PG&E\u2019s history of constantly replacing hundreds of residential electricity transformers that fail during heat waves instead of installing new technology is a case in point. This started to change with the October 2018 Disaster Recovery Reform Act, which allocates 6% of disaster funds to improve resilience, not just to replace destroyed facilities.\n\nMoving forward, the GND could serve as a roadmap for ensuring federal dollars get spent wisely and fairly. Spending on resiliency and decarbonization could overlap via new technologies, as New York, Hawaii and other states are investigating.\n\nInstead of spending $12 billion on sea walls to protect every critical refining facility on the Gulf Coast, a portion of that money could be diverted to construct electric charging infrastructure or landfill gas programs for alternative fuel vehicles.\n\nThe Pentagon and Congress could rethink how to secure U.S. military bases threatened by climate change in ways that align with the GND. Ditto for the Pentagon\u2019s research and development programs on future fuels, logistics and automation.\n\nRestoring wetlands, mangroves and green space is also a cost-effective way to reduce climate-related damage.\n\nGND legislation could also facilitate private-sector tie-ins for federal green infrastructure investment with green bonds and investment vehicles.\n\nWhat to watch: As politicians stake out their response to the GND, look for some legislators to tie in GND themes to programs that must be funded anyway or address multiple goals at once, like employment, energy innovation and decarbonization, especially in rust-belt regions. This proved a successful formula for governors the 2018 midterms, and will likely reappear in the 2020 election cycle.\n\nAmy Myers Jaffe is the David M. Rubenstein Senior Fellow for Energy and the Environment and director of the program on energy security and climate change at the Council on Foreign Relations."

Yes.\n\nAfter accounting for frontloading to get out in front of the tariffs early in the year, the rate of tariffed goods exported from China slowed, a new report from the Institute of International Finance shows, and will likely continue to slow without a resolution.\n\nChina's reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods are slowing American exporters' sales, too.\n\nBut because the U.S. imports more from China than it exports there, tariffs should continue to lessen the trade deficit.\n\nAre they helping American businesses? No.\n\nRemember, U.S. companies that import Chinese goods pay the tariffs. When the full slate of tariffs went into effect in October, tariff collections topped $5 billion, the highest amount ever recorded. The amount of tariffs paid by these American companies has doubled since May, including an increase of more than 30% from August to October.\n\nCompanies as varied as truck manufacturer Cummins, equipment maker Caterpillar, chipmaker Nvidia and washing machine manufacturer Whirlpool have all separately issued lower 2019 guidance citing the tariffs as a direct cause.\n\nAre businesses moving back to the U.S.? No.\n\nCNNBusiness reported in November that a recent survey by 2 American chambers of commerce in China showed a third of the companies surveyed were looking to leave China because of the trade war. However, only 6% said they were considering moving back to the U.S.\n\nHave they hurt China? Sort of.\n\nIIF's analysis of 7,000 individual products subject to new tariffs shows that there has been a measurable slowdown in purchases from both nations. However, both Chinese and American firms are largely finding substitutes or eating the price increases instead of passing them on to consumers, IIF economists tell Axios.\n\nWhile economic metrics have fallen, along with the country's stock market, the pullback has been in line with expectations for the country's move from an export- to service-driven economy.\n\nWho is benefiting? India, Brazil, Cambodia and other countries who can offer substitute products and locations.\n\nIndia's exports to China from June-November 2018 increased by 32% and rose 12% to the U.S.\n\nBrazil, the world's second largest soybean producer, more than doubled its shipments to China, the world's largest soybean importer in October, while China imported just 66,955 tons of American soybeans that month, compared to 1.33 million tons a year earlier.\n\nGo deeper:"

Meanwhile, state-of-the-art clubface design means that even off-center mishits can travel absurd distances. The ball: Since the early 1900s, pros used balls covered in a rubber called balata. Then, in 2000, Titleist introduced the Pro V1, a urethane-covered ball that traveled farther. By 2001, not a single winner of any pro tournament used a balata ball. Golf had changed forever.\n\nThe big picture: Golfers will only continue getting more athletic and club regulations are already in place (and updated frequently). That leaves the ball as the primary factor at the center of the distance debate.\n\nIdeas gaining traction: Reducing the ball's maximum velocity (Jack Nicklaus has suggested a 20% reduction), outlawing certain materials and changing construction methods and dimple patterns.\n\nReducing the ball's maximum velocity (Jack Nicklaus has suggested a 20% reduction), outlawing certain materials and changing construction methods and dimple patterns. \"The loudest calls are not for a blanket rollback but a bifurcation of the rules, similar to baseball's.

More strategically-placed bunkers, thicker rough, different fairway heights \u2014 anything that might make pros second-guess pulling out the driver.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\n\"Imagine baseball not being able to have games at Wrigley Field or Fenway Park.

    "text": "\"We often talk about automation in terms of which jobs will be lost. It's just as important, if not more important, to think about which places will be hit.\"\n\n\u2014 Roy Bahat, head of the venture fund Bloomberg Beta\n\nThe backstory: The last wave of technological disruption \u2014 the IT revolution of the 1980s \u2014 created new jobs, but the bulk of the job and wage gains were on the high and low ends of the labor market. Scores of middle-wage, middle-skill jobs in manufacturing, largely in the middle of the country, were automated away or sent abroad.\n\nNow, the new wave of automation and AI is projected to hit high- and low-paying jobs in addition to middle-income jobs, says Marina Gorbis, executive director of the Institute for the Future.\n\nis projected to hit high- and low-paying jobs in addition to middle-income jobs, says Marina Gorbis, executive director of the Institute for the Future. The next crop of vulnerable jobs \u2014 which include middle-wage occupations like trucking and administrative office work as well as lower-wage jobs like waiting tables and farming \u2014 are scattered all over the country, but the highest concentration is once again in the heartland, per a new report from the Brookings Institution.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nA quarter of all jobs across the U.S. have high chance of being wiped out by automation.\n\nacross the U.S. have high chance of being wiped out by automation. The five states with the highest share of at-risk jobs are Indiana (29%), Kentucky (29%), South Dakota (28%), Arkansas (28%), and Iowa (28%) \u2014 all of which went for President Trump in 2016.\n\nof at-risk jobs are Indiana (29%), Kentucky (29%), South Dakota (28%), Arkansas (28%), and Iowa (28%) \u2014 all of which went for President Trump in 2016. Compare that to the bottom five: New York (20%), Maryland (20%), Massachusetts (21%), Connecticut (22%) and New Mexico (22%), all of which went for Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut the extent of the hit to middle America is even clearer when zooming in to the county level.\n\nFor example, in Jerauld County, South Dakota, 53% of jobs are hanging in the balance.\n\nin Jerauld County, South Dakota, 53% of jobs are hanging in the balance. 48% of jobs are vulnerable in Scott County, Miss.; 48% in Dakota County, Neb.; and 46% in Colfax County, Neb.\n\nWhy it's happening: Automation is best suited for jobs that are repetitive and predictable \u2014 like factory work. Now, in the AI age, machines may encroach even on lower-wage jobs that require uniquely human skills, like taking care of the elderly or waiting tables.\n\nWhat's next: To absorb the coming disruption, the government and corporations will have to take charge of reskilling and upskilling huge swaths of displaced workers.\n\n\"The big challenge we're looking at in the next few years is not mass unemployment but mass redeployment.\"\n\n\u2014 Michael Chui, McKinsey Global Institute\n\nThe bottom line: The cost of reskilling the 1.4 million people who are displaced will be close to $34 billion, according to the World Economic Forum."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The legislation: New York's newly passed law allows abortion when there is \"an absence of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient\u2019s life or health\" after the 24th week of pregnancy.\n\nAnd Virginia's proposed law, which failed to make it out of committee in the statehouse, would have eliminated some of the state's restrictions on late-term abortion, including reducing the numbers of doctors needed to sign off on such a procedure from three to one.\n\nThe controversy: Virginia Del. Kathy Tran, a sponsor of her state's bill, answered affirmatively during a state legislative session when she was asked by a Republican lawmaker if it would allow an abortion while a woman was in labor.\n\nWhen asked by radio station WTOP last week about Tran's statement, Northam, who is a trained pediatric neurologist, said abortions may be \"done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\u2019s not viable. So in this particular example, if a mother\u2019s in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\"\n\nWhat they're saying: Both Tran and Northam's comments were condemned by Republicans as \"infanticide,\" prompting backlash from top Republicans, including Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, and clarifications from the Virginia lawmakers.\n\nNortham, via his spokesperson: \"Attempts to extrapolate these comments otherwise is in bad faith and underscores exactly why the governor believes physicians and women, not legislators, should make these difficult and deeply personal medical decisions.\"\n\nvia his spokesperson: \"Attempts to extrapolate these comments otherwise is in bad faith and underscores exactly why the governor believes physicians and women, not legislators, should make these difficult and deeply personal medical decisions.\" Tran: \"I should have said: 'Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.'\"\n\n\"I should have said: 'Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.'\" Trump: \"Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion, high taxes, Open Borders and Crime!\"\n\n\"Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion, high taxes, Open Borders and Crime!\" Pence: \"This shameless embrace of a culture of death is startling to every American who cherishes life.\"\n\n\"This shameless embrace of a culture of death is startling to every American who cherishes life.\" Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.): \"In just a few years pro-abortion zealots went from 'safe, legal, and rare' to 'keep the newborns comfortable while the doctor debates infanticide.'\"\n\nThe facts: According to the CDC, only about 1% of abortions take place after 21 weeks.\n\nAbortion rates among U.S. women in all age groups dropped sharply to a decade low from 2006 to 2015 \u2014 and nearly 90% of abortions performed in 2015 were within a woman's first 13 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Barbara Levy, the vice president of health policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said, \"The phrase 'late-term abortion,' is medically inaccurate and has no clinical meaning.\"\n\nJennifer Conti, a fellow with the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health, also told CNN: \"In obstetrics, we don't divide pregnancies into terms. 'Late term' is an invention of anti-abortion extremists to confuse, mislead and increase stigma.\"\n\nThe bottom line, via the New York Times: \"[A]mong conservatives, the White House's outrage was also greeted as a clear and shrewd political strategy \u2014 to rally Republicans with an eye toward the 2020 presidential election, and to close ranks around Mr. Trump, embattled though he may be, as their unequivocal leader.\"\n\n\"It's going to come into play, quite frankly, in the elections next year. We're not going to let it go away,\" Carol Tobias, the president of the National Right to Life Committee, told the Times.\n\nGo deeper: U.S. abortion rates dropped to record low between 2006 and 2015"

It would be great for the so-called 'Carbon Footprint' to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military - even if no other country would do the same.

Photo: Horacio Villalobos/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nBackground: Angola\u2019s economy is heavily reliant on oil, which accounts for approximately 80% of government revenue. The 2014 oil price drop caused Angola\u2019s GDP growth to contract from 5% in 2013 to 2.6% in 2016. As a result, inflation skyrocketed, foreign investment halted, and the Angolan banking sector was crippled. Unsuccessful economic reform attempts led public debt to double, and President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos to step down in September 2017, after ruling Angola for 38 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s new: Dos Santos' successor, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, campaigned on a reform agenda that included fighting the corruption that had grown rampant under dos Santos and rebuilding the country\u2019s economy.\n\nIn addition to cleaning the ranks of the Angolan government, Louren\u00e7o launched the Macroeconomic Stabilization Program (MSP) centering three main interventions: fiscal consolidation, improvements to the business environment, and monetary policy.\n\nThe program has already led to significant progress, including a new law that allows international investors to invest in Angola without a local partner (previously a requirement) and the revocation of a pegged-exchange rate, which seeks to eliminate the difference between official exchange and black-market rates.\n\nLouren\u00e7o has also established policies for the monetization of natural gases and the creation of an independent regulator to manage oil and gas concessions, previously handled by state-owned Sonangol.\n\nIn December, Sonangol secured a $2 billion loan from the China Development Bank to build a refinery in Lobito to reduce Angolan reliance on imported fuels.\n\nThat same month, the IMF approved a three-year, $3.7 billion credit for Angola to support its private sector\u2013led diversification efforts and return to fiscal sustainability.\n\nThe bottom line: Reforms appear to be alleviating Angola's economic ills, with the World Bank estimating increased GDP growth of 2.9% in 2019. As the economic climate in Angola continues to improve, so too will opportunities for foreign investment \u2014 not only in oil and gas, but in growing sectors like tourism and agriculture as well.\n\nAubrey Hruby is a senior fellow in the Atlantic Council's Africa Center."

Both retail behemoths are using their massive customer bases and troves of shopper data to develop private products that can dominate the market."

China\u2019s DiDi also launched in 2012 and now serves some 550 million users in 400 cities.\n\nWhere it stands: Even though none of these companies is near profitable, they are getting hockey-stick valuations. Uber lost some $4.5 billion in 2017 and its IPO filing suggest a valuation of $120 billion. Lyft lost $600 million and its IPO is expected to fetch $15 billion. Their investments in autonomous mobility have been seen as critical to profitability.\n\nThe catch: Simply replacing ride-hailing cars with robotaxis will not fix the supply-demand mismatch, which could be economically disastrous if ride-hailing businesses own their fleets (currently, they don\u2019t lose money when vehicles are empty because they only pay drivers when a passenger is in the car).\n\nThen there are the capital costs of self-driving fleets, which Bloomberg has estimated as an initial outlay of $306 billion.\n\nWhat's needed: Moving more people with fewer vehicles and collecting more fares per trip (as in pooled rides, for example) could smooth the road to profitability.\n\nRide-hailing companies may also opt to lower upfront spending by outsourcing vehicle ownership and management to firms like Keolis or Transdev \u2014 as city transit agencies often do \u2014 and turn to companies like Bestmile, door2door and Routematch to optimize their matching of supply and demand.\n\nThe bottom line: Even in an autonomous world, someone needs to own, maintain and manage fleets of those expensive vehicles.\n\nRaphael Gindrat is co-founder and CEO of Bestmile, which has developed a fleet-management platform."

It's in political turmoil, with no plan in place for how to marshal and distribute the money among a population of just 780,000 people. The exploration and production deal, with ExxonMobil, is one of the most one-sided in frontier oil, heavily favoring the company. That makes Guyana rife for future political discontent and local demands for renegotiation.\n\n\"There is no way the explosion of money will be managed properly,\" says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of energy security at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"Here you take this poverty-stricken country and make them Qatar in three years.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Since 2016, Exxon has made a dozen discoveries in Guyana that now total more than 5 billion barrels of recoverable reserves. This is enormous \u2014 for perspective, the industry calls a 1-billion-barrel field a \"supergiant.\"\n\nExxon did not respond to requests for comment. But it plans to begin producing 120,000 barrels a day next year, and to bump that up six times to 750,000 by 2025.\n\nAt $60 a barrel, and a roughly 50-50 split of profits with Exxon, Guyana could receive a bonanza of more than $5 billion a year in revenue.\n\nroughly 50-50 split of profits with Exxon, Guyana could receive a bonanza of more than $5 billion a year in revenue.

Its share price is down 16% over the last year, amid questions whether it can still deliver industry-leading profit through thick and thin, as it once did.\n\nGuyana, and the super-fast delivery of production by next year, shows that the company still has what it takes.\n\nThe bottom line: For Guyana itself, there is less certainty. Insanally said the reaction in Guyana runs the gamut: \"There are people who are excited, people who are apprehensive, and people who think oil should be avoided as a curse altogether.\""

Scientists are desperately trying to determine its fate.\n\nThwaites acts as a gateway to vast quantities of inland ice that rest on bedrock well below sea level.\n\nIf ocean waters were to access that inland ice, it could all melt, raising sea levels by at least 10 feet.\n\nGeologist Richard Alley of Penn State University, who was not involved in the new study, called Thwaites a \"geometric accident\" that could lead to \"large and rapid\" ice loss if ice cliff instability that has happened elsewhere occurs there.\n\n\"Cliff retreat is not some strange and unexpected physical process; it is happening now in some places, has happened in the past, and is expected wherever sufficiently high temperatures occur in [the] ocean or air around ice flowing into the ocean.\"\n\n\u2014 Alley told Axios via email\n\nDetails: The study reports the ebb and flow of salty, dense and relatively warm ocean waters had taken a gigantic bite out of the base of Thwaites, leaving a gap between the glacial floor and the bedrock below. Its dimensions are staggering.\n\nThe gap is 2.5 miles wide and 6 miles long, about 1,100 feet high and once contained about 14 billion tons of ice that have melted in the past few years.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"What we are seeing with high resolution data is the ocean eating away large portions of the ice, taking big bites at a time instead of eroding slowly,\" UC Irvine's Rignot, a co-author of the new study, told Axios.\n\nA second study on West Antarctic glaciers including Thwaites was published on Wednesday in Nature, scrutinizing the alarming findings of another study published in 2016. That study showed that marine-terminating glaciers become inherently unstable when their calving front forms tall cliffs, upwards of 330 feet tall.\n\nThis marine ice-cliff instability causes such glaciers to rapidly break apart.\n\nObservations of this physical process in Greenland's outlet glaciers have lent credence to this hypothesis.\n\nThe catch: The new research uses statistical techniques to find that past episodes of rapid sea level rise could've happened without this ice cliff instability.\n\nThe study suggests sea level rise will be lower than the numbers the 2016 study put forward, projecting only a 5% chance that the Antarctic contribution to sea-level rise will top 15 inches by 2100.\n\n\"Our study demonstrates that the jury\u2019s still out on marine ice-cliff instability,\" study lead author Tamsin Edwards, a geographer at Kings College in London, told Axios via email.\n\nRob DeConto of U-Mass Amherst, who co-authored the 2016 study, said the new study is useful but does not rule out the more alarming possibilities. \"I don't really see ice fracture as an optional process that can be excluded from ice sheet models,\" DeConto told Axios. \"Ice that flows into the ocean essentially always ends in a cliff regardless of the setting or spatial scale.\"\n\nRichard Alley, a geoscientist at Penn State University who was not involved in either of the new studies, told Axios that marine ice-cliff instability poses a grave danger.\n\nThe bottom line: More work is needed for scientists to confidently winnow down the forecast range of sea-level rise.

Since the last report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2014, sea level rise estimates have increased, but uncertainties remain high.\n\nThe new study, by a group of researchers from New Zealand, Canada, Germany and the U.K., is one of the first to pair a climate model with an ice sheet model \u2014 fed with the latest observational data on ice loss \u2014 to see how ice melt might alter the planet's climate.\n\nIt finds that the influences may be profound.\n\nThe threat: If the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets melt quickly and significantly enough, they could pour enough cold, relatively light freshwater into adjacent areas of the ocean to disrupt global ocean circulation, the study finds.\n\nIn particular, the study adds to the growing concern in the scientific community about a slowdown in a current known as the Atlantic-Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC.\n\nThis current is also referred to as a global conveyor belt or global thermohaline circulation, carrying heat and oxygen from the bottom of the world to the far north, and back again.\n\nThere are clear signs that part of this current is already slowing down, due to freshwater inputs from Greenland.\n\nThe new study says this could lessen the heat transported to Europe and may make weather more variable in the northeastern U.S., among many other areas. Worse yet, in the Antarctic, adding freshwater to the surface ocean would serve to reduce the amount of mixing between ocean layers, the study says.\n\nThis would trap salty and warm water well below a film of cool, freshwater on the surface.\n\nSuch warm, salty waters are melting marine-terminating glaciers in West Antarctica by eating away at their floating ice shelves and infiltrating the ice bed in areas where the bedrock is below sea level.\n\nWhat they're not saying: The study assumes that the ocean is not playing a large role in melting Greenland's glaciers, which is at odds with observations, according to Eric Rignot, a professor of Earth system science at UC Irvine, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nRignot says Greenland will melt faster and more extensively than the study's models show.\n\nWhat they're saying: Luke Trusel, a study coauthor and geology professor at Rowan University, told Axios that melting ice sheets will have effects far beyond sea level rise.\n\n\"Ice sheets aren't passive bodies of ice, they're dynamic, interactive components of the Earth system. They change in response to climate, and climate then responds to their change.\"\n\n\u2014 Luke Trusel, Rowan University\n\n\"'Melting ice sheets don't just cause sea level rise. They also disrupt the climate system, by dumping a lot of cold freshwater into the ocean,\" says study coauthor Kaitlin Naughten of the British Antarctic Survey, in an email to Axios. \"This affects deep ocean circulation, surface ocean currents, and weather patterns across the globe.\"\n\nGo deeper:"

Plus, their blood tests showed much lower antibodies to the strep bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, or GAS) in their blood, study author Shane Crotty tells Axios.\n\nThey also identified two variations in genes associated with RT.\n\n\"That is relevant for clinical practice as well as interesting from an infection biology perspective. Their results indicate that some children are genetically more prone to get recurrent GAS tonsillitis, and they shed light on both the genes and the biological mechanisms involved,\" says Georgia Institute of Technology's Kristofer Wollein Waldetoft, who was not part of this study.\n\n\"The study does suggest something is different about the immune response of children labelled as having recurrent tonsillitis, and further study might clarify the exact components of this immune response that would then guide streptococcal vaccine development,\" Children's National Health Systems' Bernhard L. Wiedermann, who was not part of this study, tells Axios.\n\nYes, but: Wiedermann points out \"the study lacks sufficient detail about the children\u2019s clinical data [like precision of strep diagnostics]. Plus, the number of children studied is very small, making it difficult to generalize these findings to children in the U.S. or elsewhere.\"\n\nWhat's next: Crotty, who's a professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology and at UC San Diego, agrees that this small study is a first step."

    "text": "GDPR, which turns 1 in May, applies to any company doing business with Europe. Many registrars, the authorities who dole out domains (names like \"axios.com\"), have responded by simply not providing data to WHOIS.\n\nThis is a feature, not a bug. Before GDPR took effect, ICANN, the governing body for internet domain names, and several researchers told the EU that this was going to be a problem. But EU legislators chose not to fix it.\n\n\"When investigators interacted with the EU, the EU took the position, 'Our job is to make the law, your job is to interpret it,'\" said Tim Chen, CEO of DomainTools, a cybersecurity firm originally known for simplifying access to tools like WHOIS.\n\nThe impact: Online investigators use WHOIS information for more than just contacting a website's owner.\n\nCross-referencing WHOIS data is a good way to find broader criminal activity and prevent attacks. The emails used to register one site used in a phishing campaign can be used to find other sites run by the same party.\n\nThe same technique can be used to find sites co-owned by someone hosting terrorist propaganda or a website used to control or distribute malware.\n\nBut it's not just cybercrime. CINTOC (the Center on Illicit Networks and Transnational Organized Crime) is a charitable group that uses WHOIS to fight organized crime in vulnerable populations, including human trafficking and natural resource and wildlife crimes.\n\n\"Criminals have web presences. I can use that information to go to a criminal's bank and get financial details,\" said Kathleen Miles, CINTOC director of analysis. \"But when GDPR went through, we lost that connection. We lost it in Africa. We lost it in Europe. We lost it in a lot of the United States as well.\"\n\nBecause the EU is the only jurisdiction with a law that applies to WHOIS, Chen fears ICANN, which is currently updating its WHOIS guidelines, will have nothing to counterbalance GDPR's strictures.\n\nThe answer, according to a coalition that includes DomainTools, CINTOC and others, is for the U.S. to pass its own law requiring that websites designed to interact with U.S. citizens participate in WHOIS.\n\nThat group, called the Coalition for a Secure and Transparent Internet (CSTI), is currently meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill about their ideas and is drafting model legislation.\n\nCSTI also includes trade associations that protect commercial interests, like legitimate online pharmacies who need WHOIS to thwart phony competitors, and the MPAA and RIAA, entertainment industry groups that use WHOIS as a tool against piracy sites.\n\nBy the numbers: A survey conducted by two cybersecurity industry groups showed 80% of investigators who used WHOIS before GDPR began were unable to find an equally useful replacement.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a problem,\" said Chen. \"Now we have data to show we were right.\"\n\nThe bottom line: Regulating privacy is a complex balancing act. In this case, an important piece of internet infrastructure has become collateral damage to the GDPR, and eyes are on the U.S. for a fix.\n\nGo deeper: EU data law may not have caused the expected sketchy website boom\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported a quotation by Tim Chen of DomainTools about the EU's stance toward investigators."

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Wednesday that Venezuela's newly declared Interim President Juan Guaid\u00f3 will name a new board for U.S.-based oil company Citgo, which is owned by PDVSA. Citgo is weighing the possibility of bankruptcy and other contingency plans.\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro has steadfastly held that he is the rightful president of Venezuela and shows no signs of conceding to demands from the U.S.\n\nIf Maduro is able to retain power, Fitch warns, \"the prospects of reforms to stabilize the economy and end hyperinflation are likely to be diminished, at least in the near term.\"\n\n\"The military's position will be key to the country's political future and there is the potential for a protracted stalemate.\"\n\n\"Even in the case of a political transition, a debt restructuring is likely to be a lengthy process. A political transition will be complex and likely culminate in elections.\"\n\nWhat's next? Guaid\u00f3's economic plan includes seeking financial aid from multilateral organizations, bilateral loans, restructuring Venezuela's debt and bringing private investment back into the country's oil sector. He has also called for eliminating currency controls and privatizing state assets.\n\n\"PDVSA would need to be restructured from the ground up and incentives put in place for private investment,\" Fitch continued. \"Institutional capacity, rule of law and political stability will be key after years of weakening government institutions.\"\n\nOn the bright side: \"Should a successful political transition combined with economic stabilization reforms be implemented,\" Fitch analysts said, \"Venezuela would have significant potential.\""

    "text": "Details: In 2017, the FDA approved the Impella RP device, which helps pump blood in the right side of the heart and is made by Abiomed. Small studies showed 73% of patients who got the pump were still alive within a month. However:\n\nThe combined sample size was 60 patients, and trials were not randomized.\n\nHalf of the patients still encountered \"major bleeding.\"\n\nThe trials did not account for \"patient perspectives,\" such as whether patients were in pain.\n\nDriving the news: The FDA required Abiomed, which has $780 million in annual sales, to track patients who received the device. The results aren't good.\n\nThe survival rate has dropped precipitously \u2014 just 4 of 23 patients (17%) who got the Impella RP were alive within a month.\n\nSince 2015, there have been 21 adverse events linked to the Impella RP, including 3 deaths, according to federal data analyzed by Madris Tomes, a former FDA regulator who founded the software firm Device Events.\n\nHer analysis, shared with Axios, indicated 10 of those adverse events occurred in 2018.\n\nYes, but: The FDA and Abiomed both said patients in the post-approval study were a lot sicker than people who were in the original studies \u2014 making it unclear whether the heart device had hurt or helped. The FDA and Abiomed also developed a checklist to help doctors determine which patients are best suited for the device.\n\nIf patients were critically ill or already close to death, using the heart pump would be like \"throwing a Hail Mary,\" and doesn't demonstrate whether the patient would have benefited from the device, said Robert Yeh, an interventional cardiologist in Boston who has used the Impella.\n\nThe big picture: Devices often make it to market without a lot of data proving their safety or effectiveness, and post-market studies don't necessarily show that either.\n\n\"We don't have great randomized trials ... for many of the devices like Impella. As a result, we are left to a data-free zone,\" said Yeh, who has received money from heart device makers.\n\nGo deeper: The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published a series on medical devices that explained how devices have a lower bar for clinical safety and effectiveness than drugs.\n\nEditor's note: This piece was corrected to show that there were 21 Impella RP adverse events, including 3 deaths (not 23 adverse events with 5 deaths)."

As a result, the rich are getting richer and the less fortunate are being left behind.\n\nThe big picture: Regardless of where the blame lies \u2014 whether it's with StockX, sneaker flippers or capitalism, itself \u2014 the outcome is the same: \"A culture lives and dies with the passion it inspires in its participants, and the passion is draining from the most devoted,\" writes Taylor.\n\nThe other side: Williams has a more positive view of the situation:\n\n\"Why am I gonna be mad at a kid for making money off this? ... Sneakers are the new brick of cocaine or pound of weed, and now instead of having to flip some weed and maybe get locked up for it, they can go get a couple pairs of Jordans and be set for a while after the flip.\"\n\nThe bottom line: Courtesy of our very own sneaker-head, Mike Sykes: StockX is both a gift and a curse.

    "text": "The most valuable companies in the world \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon \u2014 mostly stayed in their own lanes as they grew into giants. But now they\u2019re increasingly clashing as their growing ambitions bump into one another.\n\nIf you understand where these giants clash and where they find common ground, you can begin to grasp how they are shaping our world.\n\nDriving the news: Apple was furious when it learned Facebook was abusing rules governing internal apps and quickly kicked the company out of the program, breaking Facebook's ability to test new apps and use internal iPhone apps.\n\nWhen it became clear Google was doing the same thing, Apple was in a bind. Facebook and Apple have few business ties. But Apple gets billions of dollars per year from Google in exchange for making it the default search engine on iPhones and Mac \u2014 an arrangement that Apple CEO Tim Cook has had to defend while promoting the company's strong pro-privacy stance.\n\nIn the end, Apple briefly banned Google, too \u2014 then quickly lifted both sentences.\n\nIt's not clear how long Facebook's ban might have lasted if Google hadn't joined it in the penalty box.\n\nThe big picture: Once upon a time, Amazon was largely a retail store, Apple sold hardware, Google was a search engine, and Facebook was an online social network.\n\nNone of the companies is confined by those definitions any more. They spill over into one another's territory even as they depend on each other to greater and lesser degrees.\n\nFacebook and Amazon, for example, both distribute their consumer apps through the Google Play and Apple app stores.\n\nGoogle, Facebook and Apple all rely to some degree on their products being sold through Amazon, despite each also having tensions with the retail giant.\n\nGoogle and Amazon had vastly different origins but are increasingly rivals.\n\nThey compete in cloud computing, advertising and other areas.\n\nAmazon is also one of the few companies, outside of China, that has been able to release Android-based devices using its own, rather than Google's, app store.\n\nThe two companies are now warring in the automated assistant/smart speaker arena.\n\nThe tension led Google to pull YouTube support from some Amazon devices and sparked a fierce battle over which Google devices get sold on Amazon's virtual shelves.\n\nAmazon and Apple have fought but are finding more common ground.\n\nLike Google, Apple has squabbled with Amazon over access to digital and physical retail space.\n\nToday, however, Amazon's Prime Video is showing up on Apple TV.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is stocking more of Apple's products again.\n\nGoogle and Facebook together control the lion's share of the online ad business.\n\nTheir competition has long been masked by the scale of the market's growth.\n\nAs Facebook faces scandal after privacy scandal, Google has tried, with some success, to keep its head down, although critics point out it has even more data on consumers than Facebook.\n\nFacebook and Amazon have the least interplay among the tech giants.\n\nThe social network and retail giant have relatively few obvious business ties and competitive conflicts.\n\nFacebook apps are available for Amazon devices, and Amazon sells the Oculus VR headset.\n\nHistory lesson: These relationships have never stood still.\n\nApple and Google, for example, were once so close that Google CEO Eric Schmidt was on Apple's board of directors. Then, after Google introduced Android, the relationship chilled dramatically: Schmidt left the board and a patent war broke out.\n\nAt one time Apple built a connection to Facebook directly into the iPhone operating system. These days, the companies' CEOs are more likely to trade pot shots over privacy and business models than to work together.\n\nGoogle tried several times to challenge Facebook's dominance of social networking head on, but even its biggest effort, Google Plus, was a flop.\n\nThe bottom line: Tension is likely to outweigh cooperation, especially as each of the four companies seeks to convince regulators that the others are the ones in need of reining in."

That's up from the 19 million products in about 6.9 million households reported in March.\n\nNeither Apple, Amazon or Alphabet break out unit sales for smart speakers.\n\nQuick take: Spence tells Axios that while \"macroeconomic conditions can certainly impact consumer demand through business cycles,\" the 16-year-old company has survived economic downturns."

(Current taxis are in use about 50% of the time.)\n\nEven if robotaxis had substantially higher utilization rates, the cost of providing remote oversight by humans must be factored in.\n\nThe only way for robotaxis to be cost competitive with older cars is if the remote operators are paid well below minimum wage, the authors said.\n\nConsumer subsidies will be needed to realize the life-saving benefits of AVs, they conclude.\n\nThat's likely to be a hard pill to swallow politically, but they point out that taxpayers already foot the bill for $18 billion of the $242 billion in road crash-related expenditures in the U.S. each year (based on 2010 figures).\n\nThe bottom line: Self-driving cars need to be affordable to serve those who need them most, and to keep carmakers' strategies afloat.\n\nGo deeper: Here come the robotaxis"

    "title": "The Green New Deal resolution is here",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The big picture: The non-binding resolution envisions a massively expanded federal role in emissions-cutting and economic intervention that takes its cues from World War II and New Deal-era programs.\n\nNPR posted a copy online here.\n\nDrill down: Some of the resolution's top-line goals include...\n\nAchieving net-zero U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through a \"fair and just transition for all communities and workers\" while creating millions of jobs.\n\nDecarbonizing all the major segments of the economy \u2014 power, manufacturing, buildings, transportation and more.\n\nHuge investments in climate-friendly infrastructure.\n\nProtections for indigenous people, communities of color, the poor and others under the heading of \"frontline and vulnerable communities.\"\n\nA goal of universal health care and jobs guarantees.\n\nWhat to watch: Ocasio-Cortez and Markey are holding a press conference on Thursday and will unveil the list of resolution's backers, so it'll be interesting to see how many of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls currently in Congress choose to sign on.\n\nAxios has already learned that co-sponsors will include Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who are both in the race. The Washington Post now reports that Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren are also co-sponsors.\n\nSeveral other candidates have broadly endorsed the concept of the Green New Deal.\n\nAs the Washington Post's Jeff Stein points out, the resolution's arrival means that White House hopefuls will now be asked about something more concrete.\n\nHow it works: The many broad concepts in the resolution include \"meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\"\n\nIt calls for energy efficiency in \"all existing buildings\" and new buildings, too, as well as cutting emissions from transportation as much as technologically possible.\n\nThe intrigue: That phrasing seems to leave the door open to technologies that some activists oppose (such as fossil fuels with carbon capture and nuclear energy), but doesn't name-check any of them, though Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff has broadly said that the goal is a transition from fossil fuels.\n\nThe big question: There's no specific projected cost for what would be massive federal investments under the resolution.\n\nThe plan broadly calls for grants, public banks and other public financing. It also highlights federal investments in \"new clean and renewable energy technologies and industries.\"\n\nWhat they're not saying: The plan is silent on whether it would impose a carbon tax. Some Green New Deal advocates have said a tax could be part of the policy \u2014 but don't see it as a central pillar.\n\nWhat's next: The resolution is basically a political messaging document, so look for Green New Deal advocates to put more meat on its bones with legislation and papers in the coming months.\n\nA bill based on the resolution would have zero chance of becoming law now \u2014 and a steep uphill climb in the foreseeable future, even if Democrats gain more power in Washington.\n\nBut it lays down a marker that could push Democrats toward embracing aggressive climate policies to promote through 2020 and beyond.\n\nGo deeper:\n\nAlexi McCammond contributed to this reporting.\n\nEditor's note: This post is being updated as new information comes in."

As Axios' Jonathan Swan reported at the time, Sasse asked the Justice Department in December to investigate its treatment of Epstein, after a Miami Herald expos\u00e9 late last year uncovered details of his sweetheart deal."

However, the overall picture is growing starker with each passing year. Nine of the 10 warmest years on record since reliable data began in 1880 have occurred since 2005.

Most likely, they will take several tacks:\n\nStepping up attacks on the rule of law. Duterte seems increasingly enraged at his critics and has increased pressure on independent media and other checks on his government. Orban has tried to further subjugate the courts to his rule.

For nearly all autocratic-leaning populists, compromise is anathema and holding their political base critical.\n\nWhat to watch: Although these leaders operate in different political systems, their responses have much in common, and might offer clues about the Trump presidency\u2019s next two years. Back in Washington, expect few moves toward compromise, new salvos fired at U.S. institutions, and \u2014 as evident in the State of the Union \u2014 a dogged willingness to push the most controversial policies, like the border wall, even as the public tires of such ideas.\n\nJoshua Kurlantzick is senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations."

Its six corridors were easy to announce as concepts, but they have been incredibly difficult to build and coordinate in practice. Many BRI maps are more fiction than reality at this point.\n\nThe upside is that China and countries participating in the BRI can still make prevention and early detection of unwanted flows, especially health threats, a bigger priority. They could share more information about where projects are being planned, more deeply integrate health and environmental experts in the planning process, and work with the World Health Organization to improve early detection systems.\n\nThe bottom line: The economic benefits of greater connectivity are well-documented: Countries that have more connections to global flows grow by up to 40% more than less-connected countries.

The fate of either party\u2019s proposal will influence not only the trajectory of India\u2019s development, but also the global popularity of the idea, which is touted as the antidote to both poverty and technology-driven unemployment.\n\nBackground: Basic income proposals have proliferated in India amid widespread rural distress and growing despair about welfare programs long plagued by corruption and inefficiency.\n\nSupporters argue that direct cash payments to bank accounts will better reach beneficiaries, eliminate middlemen and streamline public finances.\n\nCritics worry about underinvestment in core public services, the Indian state\u2019s limited capacity to distribute large-scale transfers and the political difficulty of rolling back existing programs.\n\nDetails: Successfully establishing a targeted basic income will involve a historic reorganization of India\u2019s welfare state. Voters will weigh each plan's transfer size and frequency, eligibility criteria, and implementation relative to existing public programs.\n\nThe Modi administration will provide 120 million small agricultural households with an annual transfer of $84.

The INC's proposal is more ambitious, potentially reaching 300 million poor Indians. It would first establish a national minimum-income level and then transfer to each individual the difference between their income and that threshold. But this could present challenges for the Indian state, as administrative delays are frequent even among programs with fixed payments and clearly identifiable populations.\n\nThe bottom line: With unemployment at a 45-year high, and more than half of all farming households in debt, there is a growing political consensus that direct cash support would eradicate poverty faster than traditional welfare.

Kathy Tran, a sponsor of her state's bill, answered affirmatively during a state legislative session when she was asked by a Republican lawmaker if it would allow an abortion while a woman was in labor.\n\nWhen asked by radio station WTOP last week about Tran's statement, Northam, who is a trained pediatric neurologist, said abortions may be \"done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\u2019s not viable. So in this particular example, if a mother\u2019s in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Spotify announced Wednesday that it acquired podcast production company Gimlet Media and short-form podcasting app Anchor. The announcement came in conjunction with its 2018 Q4 earnings release, and acquisition terms were not disclosed though Recode reported a price tag of more than $200 million for Gimlet Media last week.\n\nWhy it matters: Spotify made its name as an online music streaming service, but has long supported other audio content \u2014 like podcasts \u2014 as well. These acquisitions should help bolster its capabilities to produce high-end content in-house, as well as provide better tools to creators to give it an edge over competitors like Apple. Spotify also disclosed it's budgeting $400-500 million on more podcast-related acquisitions in 2019.\n\nGo deeper: Check out Axios' Pro Rata Podcast, featuring Dan Primack"

That's the gist of the Nunes memo. The FBI said it had \"grave concerns\" about the memo's accuracy, and the Democratic response to the Nunes memo said the FBI had other reasons to suspect Page was helping Russian intelligence.\n\nThe FBI said it had \"grave concerns\" about the memo's accuracy, and the Democratic response to the Nunes memo said the FBI had other reasons to suspect Page was helping Russian intelligence. This \"collusion\" theory has also been spread on cable news. Sean Hannity has charged that Hillary Clinton \"bought and paid for\" the dossier, and talk show host Mark Levin told Hannity that Clinton \"paid for a warrant.\"\n\nThe bottom line: WashPo concluded there was no evidence that Clinton was either involved in Steele's work or worked with those Russian sources, and gave Nunes \"four Pinocchios.\" It's also in dispute that the dossier led directly to the surveillance of Page.\n\nWhat to watch: This theory will remain stalled out unless there are new developments that tie Clinton to the dossier more directly than we've seen, or any new evidence that the surveillance of Page would not have happened without the dossier.\n\n2) The Clinton Foundation\n\nIn this case, \"collusion\" means the foundation allegedly took money from Russian interests or their allies in exchange for Clinton's actions as secretary of state. The Uranium One deal \u2014 which gave Russia a financial stake in uranium production \u2014 is part of this list, but not the only example. (Here's a good rundown by National Review.)\n\nThe bottom line: This is a better example of an issue that would be getting more attention if Clinton had won. News organizations were already sniffing around during the campaign.\n\nBut it's better understood as potentially shady ethics and possible conflicts of interest, rather than the kind of \"collusion\" where a U.S. candidate and a foreign government were working together toward a common goal.\n\nand possible conflicts of interest, rather than the kind of \"collusion\" where a U.S. candidate and a foreign government were working together toward a common goal. And the Uranium One deal \u2014 another frequent Hannity topic \u2014 depends on a chain of connections that may not hold up under thorough investigation, since the deal was approved by nine government agencies and there's no evidence that Clinton knew about it, as Shepard Smith of Fox News has pointed out.\n\nWhat to watch: The FBI has reopened an investigation into the Clinton Foundation donations, so there will be another round of coverage whenever it releases its results. But the attention will only last if there's evidence that Clinton took official actions based on those donations.\n\nGo deeper:\n\nThe big questions surrounding the Trump-Russia dossier\n\nFacts Matter: Background on the U.S.-Russia uranium deal"

    "text": "Driving the news: Researchers at Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence have developed an AI program that can play both sides of Pictionary, a game in which one player draws a picture to represent a word or phrase for the other player to guess.\n\nThe big picture: Pictionary only seems straightforward. Like so many tasks that come naturally to children, it's a challenge for even the most advanced AI.\n\nPictionary only seems straightforward. Like so many tasks that come naturally to children, it's a challenge for even the most advanced AI. That's because it requires a grasp of nebulous concepts that are common sense to humans, but that no one has figured out how to easily teach computers.\n\na grasp of nebulous concepts that are common sense to humans, but that no one has figured out how to easily teach computers. Try the game here.\n\nIt's impressively good, but doesn't quite feel like a grandmaster yet. But if the Allen researchers can make the leap from where they are now to mastering common sense, they will have accomplished a lot. It is hard to define precisely, but it's an underestimated and central human quality, essential for communication.\n\nAn important point: It's also a key stepping stone to machine intelligence that matches or surpasses human capabilities.\n\nWhat they did: The Allen researchers' AI watched humans play 100,000 games. Meanwhile, it was also taught how to find words that have characteristics in common \u2014 like bread, fruit, and food. Listen to Oren Etzioni, Allen's CEO:\n\n\"Whenever the AI is taking a concept or idea that doesn\u2019t have a corresponding icon, it\u2019s forced to use its learned common-sense knowledge to figure out how a combination of icons can be used to effectively communicate the concept to a person. The space of possible icon combinations is in the trillions, but AllenAI learns how to do it quite well.\"\n\nI had a couple of experts play the game:\n\nStefaan Verhulst, who researches human\u2013computer interaction at New York University, told me that the AI reasons its way to a guess like a human would. That's something that would be useful, say, where a computer is missing important information and has to fill in the blanks, he said.\n\nwho researches human\u2013computer interaction at New York University, told me that the AI reasons its way to a guess like a human would. That's something that would be useful, say, where a computer is missing important information and has to fill in the blanks, he said. But, but, but: Dileep George, co-founder of the AI company Vicarious, said the player is still far from exhibiting genuine common sense. He likened it to the auto-complete feature on smartphones \u2014 a system that can guess what a user intends to type, but doesn't have a deep understanding of the world.\n\nWatching the computer tells us something about people, too. Since the AI trained by watching humans play, it has absorbed some human biases.\n\nIn one game, I was assigned the phrase \"couple buying a car.\" I drew two men, a dollar bill, and a car, but the system couldn't guess the phrase. I added a wedding ring between the men, but it still didn't understand.\n\nI was assigned the phrase \"couple buying a car.\" I drew two men, a dollar bill, and a car, but the system couldn't guess the phrase.

When I changed one of the men to a women, the AI immediately guessed correctly.\n\none of the men to a women, the AI immediately guessed correctly. This type of mistake \u2014 where AI reflects the narrow point of view of the humans it learns from \u2014 is a common problem. When AI systems are in charge of hiring, doling out loans, or evaluating parole applications, the danger of creeping bias is far greater.\n\nMy thought bubble: The AI is better at guessing than drawing. If a player asks for a new drawing when he or she can't immediately guess the phrase, the AI can get stuck."

Photo: Tony Karumba/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhy it matters: Cobalt, which the U.S. considers \u201cvital\u201d to national security and economic prosperity, is an essential component for many large-scale energy storage systems and electric vehicle batteries.\n\nWhere it stands: Cobalt shortages are already expected by the early 2020s because of rapid demand for energy storage technology, which would drive up battery costs unless alternative chemistries are developed. Exacerbating the challenge for the U.S., the Trump administration also imposed tariffs on cobalt as part of its broader trade war with China, the world\u2019s leading producer of refined cobalt and a leading supplier of U.S. cobalt imports.\n\nBackground: Even before December\u2019s election, concerns over resource nationalism in the DRC were growing.\n\nRecognizing cobalt\u2019s increasing importance in the global clean-energy sector, Joseph Kabila, Tshisekedi\u2019s predecessor, signed a new mining law in June 2018 setting the royalty rate on cobalt extraction at 3.5%, a 75% increase.\n\nThen, in December, he issued a presidential decree declaring cobalt a \u201cstrategic\u201d mineral resource, nearly tripling the royalties once more to 10%, a level likely to discourage further investment.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Tshisekedi will now follow through on the decree, abandon it while leaving the new mining law in place, or reform or revoke the law altogether. Though he purportedly criticized the law on the campaign trail as \u201canti-investment,\u201d Tshisekedi also said in a recent speech that he wants mineral rents to increase from 10% to 45% of total government receipts.\n\nWhat to watch: The coming months will reveal whether Tshisekedi breaks from Kabila\u2019s policies. Regardless of the administration's decision, renewed political violence could upset global supply by disrupting the country\u2019s considerable production.\n\nSagatom Saha is an independent international energy policy analyst.

    "text": "Between 2007 and 2017, cancer deaths increased from 7.6 million to 9.6 million globally \u2014 but the vast majority of that increase was in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nThe big picture: In wealthy nations, lower smoking rates, personalized medicine, and novel treatments like immunotherapy are reducing cancer rates and improving survival, even among aging populations. The opposite is true in poorer nations, which saw 80% of the increase, especially in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWhat's happening: Population growth and aging are fueling a rise in cancers and noncommunicable diseases in poor countries, which are ill-prepared to handle them.\n\nIn Bangladesh, for example, the median age increased from 19 to 26 between 1990 and 2015, even as the population grew nearly 50%. As a result, Bangladesh gained 38 million more adults between the ages of 25 and 64.\n\nWhere it stands: Such dramatic demographic changes are accelerating a shift from the infectious and nutritional diseases that mostly affect children to cancer and the other noncommunicable diseases that mostly afflict adults. Treating cancers requires more health infrastructure like clinics, labs and hospitals, and skilled workforces to make accurate diagnoses and perform radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery.\n\nYes, but: That infrastructure is expensive, far beyond most countries\u2019 health budgets. All 48 governments in sub-Saharan Africa together spent less on health in 2014 ($67 billion) than the government of Australia ($68 billion). Many developing countries cannot keep up with the pace and scale of the health changes in their populations.\n\nThe bottom line: Much of the progress being made on cancer is not reaching poor countries. International investment would be needed to improve their health infrastructure, but in the meantime, efforts to increase tobacco controls and vaccinations that prevent cervical cancer could help to slow the global rise of cancer.\n\nThomas J.

At one Los Angeles hospital, it's $146. At another L.A. hospital just a few miles away, it's $383.

On the same day, its central bank, led by technocrat Nicolas Dujovne, raised benchmark interest rates to a stupefying 60%. (Interest rates had been as low as 22.75% just 4 months earlier.)\n\nThe Argentine peso fell that day to nearly 40 pesos per dollar, its lowest level on record and has not bounced back.\n\nOn the other side: Turkey as Goofus has defied economic experts and raised its interest rates only once since the lira fell to the weakest level in its history. The country hiked rates 6.25% to bring its policy rate to 24%.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan replaced the country's market-favored economic team when he won re-election in July. His loyalists, including a handpicked central bank head and his son-in-law, the finance and treasury minister (previously two separate positions), continue to oversee economic policy, rejecting calls for IMF intervention.\n\nThe results: The lira has strengthened more than 20% from its Aug. 28 level. Argentina's peso has fallen more than 15%.\n\nTurkey's annual inflation rate also has fallen, topping out in October at 25%, while Argentina's climbed to 47% in December.\n\nThe bottom line: \"I'm puzzled because I don\u2019t think anything has really changed in Turkey,\" Win Thin, head of global currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, tells Axios. \"Part of it I think is just that quest for yield, though I'm not sure why people would pick Turkey over Argentina.

It's about the future! For instance, one thing that's not modeled is how OPEC and other producers could engage in more strategic market interventions to prop up prices.\n\nThe bottom line: \"Because of the global nature of oil markets and the scale of U.S. oil production, the oil effects of the shale revolution [on the climate] are likely to be substantially larger than the natural gas effects moving forward, and not in a good way,\" Raimi tells Axios.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "text": "Local differences: If steps are not taken to lessen the rate of warming from climate change, counties in the South and lower Midwest \u2014 which on average tend to already be poorer and warmer \u2014 may lose as much as 20% of their income and may experience higher mortality rates. However, areas of the Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes region and New England \u2014 which on average tend to be wealthier and cooler \u2014 could benefit economically from the change and see lower mortality rates.\n\nA climate impact map by county is available here.\n\nQuote \"The poorest 10% of counties stand to lose over 10% of their county GDP, while many richer counties will see climate-driven boosts.\" \u2014 study author James Rising of UC Berkeley.\n\nDire warning: The researchers predict mortality will increase by 5.4 deaths per 100,000 people for every one degree Celsius rise in temperature. \"We show there are going to be as many additional deaths from climate change as there are car crashes, and possibly more. Of the sectors we looked at, the greatest costs by far to society are going to come from those additional deaths,\" Rising told Axios. But it would vary by region: in cold northern counties, warming reduces mortality whereas in southern ones it could rise.\n\nNationwide, for every one degree Celsius temperature rise, the study predicts:\n\nGross domestic product will drop 1.2%\n\nAgriculture average yields will decline by 9%\n\nElectricity demand will rise by 5.3%\n\nTotal hours of labor supplied will drop \u2014 by 0.11% for low-risk workers (work mostly indoors) and 0.53% for high-risk workers (exposed to outdoor temperatures).\n\nViolent crime will rise by roughly 0.88% nationally. Property crime (which tends to be lower in cold weather) will increase with warming but doesn't change once it reaches hot levels of temperature.\n\nCoastal damage will be distributed unequally: acute impacts could be felt in eastern coastal states with low-lying cities. The rise of Middle Sea Levels alone raises expected economic damage to South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida in particular.\n\nOutside perspective: One of the study authors said that unmitigated climate change may result in the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in U.S. history. In response, Stanford University's Marshall Burke told Axios:\n\n\"Poor counties in the U.S. will be harder hit, mainly because they are already hot. Whether we should think of climate change as a \"transfer\" of wealth is less clear to me, though, and it is also less clear that even if we want to use \"transfer\" in the way they are using it, that this would be the biggest transfer in U.S. history. For instance, I think it's correct that the differential growth in incomes between the poorest 20% of U.S. household and the richest 1% has been a lot bigger over the last 20 years than the effects they find here.\"\n\nWhat they did: The team used historical records of temperature effects on different sectors and 116 climate projections to price the real-world costs of higher temperatures, changing rainfall, rising seas, and intensifying hurricanes to 6 key economic factors: agriculture yield, crime rates, health, energy demand, labor supply, and coastal damage. The projections across all U.S. counties and a range of possible future climates are for four blocks of time between 2020 and the end of the 21st century that are compared to historical data from the period from 1989 to 2001.\n\n\"For the longest time when we talked about climate change it has been at the global level. One of the challenges is that it is hard to translate global stats to a local level,\" says UC Santa Barbara's Kyle Meng. \"What's important about this work is that it put a lot of effort into summarizing the literature so we are able to actually tell what impacts will look like at particular locations in the U.S.\"\n\nLimitations: The study doesn't account for technological adaptations that might mitigate the effects or the impact of migration on the population.\n\nAdded value: The team developed the Spatial Empirical Adaptive Global- to-Local Assessment System (SEAGLAS), which will be able to take in research across multiple fields and analyze in near-real time. \"They've created a platform that researchers can update continuously so we can get real-time updates of our understanding of climate change, not just discrete ones every time a study is published,\" says Meng, who has collaborated with the team in the past but wasn't involved in the current study.\n\nWhat's missing: \"The main worry that I have \u2014 and this is clearly mentioned in the paper \u2014 is that they are missing some important sectors because impact estimates do not exist for these sectors. Morbidity in particular is probably the most important one, and this could mean they are substantially understating overall impacts,\" Burke added."

    "text": "President Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un at their summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018. Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhy it matters: Trump\u2019s summit could be doomed not by Kim\u2019s mercurial personality but by its impossible objective. Pyongyang may now be too close to its decades-long goal \u2014 fielding an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can strike the U.S. with a nuclear warhead \u2014 for any carrot or stick to change its course.\n\nWhere it stands: North Korea has demonstrated that it possesses both nuclear weapons and an ICBM with sufficient range to strike any target on the U.S. mainland. It has not yet unveiled a delivery vehicle that can survive atmospheric re-entry before detonating, but protracted and inconclusive negotiations with the U.S could provide time to overcome any remaining challenges.\n\nSimply by agreeing to meet, Kim has neutralized Trump's threats last year to strike his nuclear and ballistic missile facilities. As a bonus, he has garnered international legitimacy while dividing the U.S. from South Korea.\n\nBetween the lines: The failure of four U.S. administrations to stop this threat stems from an assumption that Pyongyang is motivated by a search for security.\n\nYet the regime has not faced a significant threat since war ended in 1953, other than in response to its unilateral aggression. Instead, it seeks a war-fighting capability to dominate the South and even the region. And there is little evidence North Korea faces economic difficulties crippling enough to compel it to relinquish its nuclear achievements.\n\nThe worst misconception has been to see an ally in China, which has facilitated the threat's growth by ensuring the regime\u2019s security from attack and undermining any sanctions that threatened its economy. China also benefits from Washington's floundering on the world stage while its public appeals for help from Beijing go unanswered.\n\nThe bottom line: It may be too late to prevent North Korea from arming itself with the capacity to destroy U.S. cities. Should it test a prototype, the resulting crisis could spark yet another round of escalating threats and U.S. warnings of military action, to be deflated by a new North Korean proposal to negotiate. More brinkmanship and frenzied alarm, all on Pyongyang\u2019s timetable, remain the most likely outcomes.\n\nDoug Seay is a former senior staff member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee."

    "text": "El Salvador's President-elect Nayib Bukele and his wife, Gabriela Rodriguez de Bukele, in San Salvador, Feb. 3. Photo: Alfredo Zuniga/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nWhy it matters: El Salvador is a longtime ally and free-trade partner of the U.S., but recent relations have been tense owing to the outgoing government's close ties with Venezuela and its decision last August to drop diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in favor of China. Moreover, El Salvador is 1 of 3 countries, along with Guatemala and Honduras, that together make up Central America's Northern Triangle, which has been a chief source of migrants to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, prompting the ire of the Trump administration.\n\nDetails: While Bukele had led his chief rivals in polls \u2014 businessman Carlos Calleja of the conservative ARENA party and former Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez of the FMLN Party \u2014 his haul of nearly 54% of the first-round votes avoids a runoff that would have occurred on March 10.\n\nVoters were disenchanted by the failure of leaders from ARENA and FMLN to curb crime and corruption over the past 25 years, which created an opening for Bukele to emerge as a fresh, new face.\n\nDuring the campaign, Bukele called Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro a \"dictator\" and criticized renewed ties with China, but did not make any major proposals around migration. All this suggests that he may take a more cooperative stance toward Washington.\n\nWhat to watch: El Salvador's population of 6.3 million has been beset in recent years by high crime, stagnant growth and corruption scandals that have shaken faith in government. Bukele leaned heavily on his strong social media presence, including 1.4 million Facebook followers, coupled with tough rhetoric on fighting corruption to win a historic victory. But his campaign was light on details, and it remains to be seen how he will put his governing plans into practice.\n\nDaniel P.

This means that for 24 hours, the temperature never dipped below that level.\n\n\"Both the scale and longevity of this persistent heat is unprecedented,\" the BOM stated. For example, the mean daily temperature for the country remained above the 1961-to-1990 average every day between Dec. 16, 2018 and at least Jan. 24, 2019, according to the BOM.\n\nPort Augusta, in South Australia, reached 121.1\u00b0F (49.5 \u00b0C) on Jan. 24, a record for the site and the highest temperature recorded anywhere in Australia since 2013.\n\nIn Canberra, the country's capital, the high temperature reached or exceeded 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) for four straight days in mid-January.\n\nThe long-lasting heat and dry conditions have sparked wildfires and killed dozens of horses, camels and other animals.\n\nWildfires associated with the heat wave and dry conditions have burned hundreds of thousands of acres, particularly in Tasmania.\n\nBetween the lines: While detailed attribution studies have yet to be carried out on this ongoing event, the odds of extreme heat events have increased dramatically in recent years due to human-caused global warming.\n\nFor example, a study published in 2017 found that climate change has already increased the odds of record-breaking heat across more than 80% of the surface area of the globe for which reliable observations were available. That includes Australia.\n\nGo deeper:"

Photo: Joe Raedle via Getty Images\n\nCommitment to defend representative democracy in the hemisphere has been a central part of regional diplomacy since 2001, when the 34 OAS members signed the 2001 Democratic Charter. But by any measure, the international community\u2019s decision to act last week was a bold move, led at least rhetorically by the U.S., with President Trump twice calling Guaid\u00f3, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo presenting the case to the UN Security Council, and Vice President Mike Pence meeting with the Carlos Vecchio, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s ambassador to the U.S.\n\nYes, but: For the U.S. and the Trump administration, the move also has electoral ramifications. Since Trump's inauguration, the White House has partially outsourced its Latin America policy to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) through Pence.\n\nFrom Trump\u2019s June 2017 announcement in Miami that he would partially roll back Obama's diplomatic opening to Cuba to National Security Advisor John Bolton's November 2018 speech (again in Miami) denouncing what he called the \"Troika of Tyranny\" (Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela), the ramped-up rhetoric for many in the Latin American diaspora community was electoral red meat.\n\nThe emphasis is based in no small part on the White House's disproven belief that hard-line Cuban Americans flipped Florida for Trump in 2016 and will play a key role in 2020.\n\nThe bottom line: The electoral misperception and narrow ideological band of advisors do not inherently render the recent moves by the White House to recognize Guaid\u00f3 and then impose oil sanctions on the Maduro government wrong or ill advised. The question now is how far the policy\u2019s main boosters \u2014 Rubio and other Florida politicians such as Sen.

    "text": "Driving the news: After a decade of stasis, some lawmakers, think tanks and advocacy groups are beginning to push policies with various prices per ton of carbon dioxide emissions, as well as different uses for the money.\n\nOne proposal pushed by oil companies and former GOP politicians, which starts at $40 a ton of carbon dioxide emitted, would raise $200 billion a year. A $20 per ton tax would raise more than $1 trillion over about a decade.\n\nPutting aside conservative opposition to creating any new taxes, divisions are emerging over how to use carbon-tax revenue, like sending it back to consumers or investing in renewable energy.\n\nThis tension gets at the heart of the challenge of addressing climate change: Make fossil fuels more expensive without hitting pocketbooks too much and/or make cleaner energy technologies cheaper.\n\n\u201cFighting about that \u2014 what to do with the money raised from a carbon tax \u2014 is the hardest thing to overcome in Congress.\u201d\n\n\u2014 McKie Campbell, former Republican staff director, Senate energy committee\n\nAmong the public, the most popular use of money raised from a carbon tax is to restore the environment, according to a recent poll by the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute and the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nMore than two-thirds of respondents said they would support a carbon tax if money went toward those goals.\n\nThe next most popular uses of the money are renewable energy and public transportation.\n\nWhat people say they want may not be what ends up happening. Washington state voters rejected a ballot initiative last November setting an initial price of $15 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions and directing the money toward similar priorities.\n\nIt failed mainly because big oil companies poured $30 million\n\nThe most high-profile proposal at the moment, and the one that has the most support among economists, is to rebate most or all of the money back to consumers in dividend checks.\n\nThis option got less than 50% public support in the aforementioned poll.\n\nBackers of the dividend approach say this would change corporate behavior while shielding consumers from rising energy costs to avoid protests like what France experienced when it raised fuel prices.\n\nCanada will be a test case with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau running for reelection this year. His administration is rolling out a carbon tax at an initial $20 (Canadian) a ton with dividend checks in provinces that don't have their own pricing regimes.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, who just lost reelection, introduced legislation last summer creating a $24 per ton carbon tax that would have repealed the federal gasoline tax and used the money mainly to fund infrastructure.

Legislation laying out the Green New Deal, a set of vague progressive policies transforming the economy in the name of fighting climate change, could be introduced in Congress as soon as this week.\n\nThe bottom line: It's unclear if a carbon tax will be part of that legislation or a focus of the hearings, but the UN says a price on carbon emissions is central to any climate policy, and that means this cash fight is too.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "title": "Study: Millennials face greater risk of some cancers due to obesity",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Millennials are facing a much higher risk of obesity-related cancers than baby boomers did at their age, according to a study published in The Lancet Public Health Monday.\n\nWhy it matters: The steepest increases for obesity-related cancers were in the youngest age group (aged 25\u201334 years) and are a warning that steps need to be taken by this generation to get rid of excess body weight. \"The change in cancer trends among young adults is often considered as a bellwether for future disease burden,\" study author Hyuna Sung tells Axios.\n\nBackground: While scientists are not sure of the exact mechanism, there is \"quite convincing evidence\" that excess body weight increases the risks of some cancers, says Sung, principal scientist of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nSome theories behind this correlation are that excess body weight can affect inflammation and hormones, or that it's impacting the gut's microbiome.\n\nWhat they did: Using a population-based cancer registry, researchers from ACS and the National Cancer Institute examined invasive cancers in people aged 25\u201384 diagnosed between 1995\u20132014 for 30 cancers, including 12 obesity-related ones.\n\nWhat they found: Multiple obesity-related cancers increased significantly faster among the young adults (25\u201349 years) compared to older adults (50\u201384 years). \"Indeed, the younger, the faster,\" Sung says.\n\n6 of the 12 obesity-related cancers \u2014 colorectal, uterine corpus (endometrial), gallbladder, kidney, multiple myeloma and pancreatic \u2014 showed increased incidences in young adults and in successively younger birth groups in a stepwise manner.\n\nThe risk of colorectal, uterine corpus, pancreatic and gallbladder cancers in millennials is about double the rate baby boomers had at the same age, per the report.\n\nBut, for almost all (16 out of 18) of the non-obesity related cancers (exception was gastric non-cardia cancer and leukemia), cancers dropped or stabilized in successively younger generations \u2014 meaning the absolute risk of all cancers is lower for the youngest age groups. This included cancers related to HIV infections or smoking.\n\nWhy? Sung says while there are multiple factors involved, the obesity epidemic is happening because...\n\n\"[The] food environment we are living in promotes over-consumption of energy-dense, high-sugar/nutrient-poor foods that are pervasive and much more affordable and available to all.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, physical activity has been 'engineered' out of [our] lifestyle due to energy saving technologies, such as via the use of cars instead of bicycles.\"\n\nWhat's next: Three main steps need to be taken, Sung says.\n\nPeople need to adopt healthy lifestyles at younger ages. \"Early lifetime exposure matters,\" she says. Physicians need to increase obesity screening and counseling. \"Less than half of primary care physicians regularly assess for body mass index despite national screening recommendation,\" Sung says. Policymakers should broadly implement regulatory interventions like \"restrictions on advertising calorie-dense food and drinks, taxes on sugary drinks, [and] urban planning ... to promote physical activity\" through more sidewalks and bike lanes, Sung adds.\n\nGo deeper:\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The chart was corrected to show year-on-year percent increase from 1995 to 2014 (not percent increase over the time period)."

Despite league expansion and the new facilities, weaker demand has driven down ticket prices, per PwC's 2018 Sports Market Outlook.\n\nAnd sports leagues are cutting back on game time to meet young sports fans' demands for faster entertainment experiences on TV and online.\n\nThe big picture: The global esports economy was estimated to reach nearly $1 billion in 2018 and is expected to nearly double by 2021, thanks in part to the incredible success of games like Overwatch and Fortnite.\n\nTraditional teams are striking partnerships with esports teams.\n\nBrands are scrambling to sponsor esports competitions and content that's being evangelized by young athletes.\n\nMedia companies are also launching gambling shows and platforms.\n\nAnd sports betting companies are leveraging data and partnering with leagues to integrate more live and on-demand media content into their betting experiences.\n\nThe bottom line: The sports industry is booming.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Background: Divergent views on whether to negotiate have long stymied Afghanistan peace efforts. The U.S. has vacillated on talking to the Taliban, usually trying to gain a battlefield advantage beforehand. The Trump administration has run through this cycle, first increasing troops and bombing to gain a military upper hand, then last fall opting to prioritize diplomacy instead.\n\nPro-government players in Afghan politics \u2014 inside and outside government \u2014 also have disagreed on negotiating with the Taliban and what objectives to pursue. President Ashraf Ghani has bristled at the Trump administration\u2019s activism on the peace front; others are more welcoming.\n\nThe Taliban, meanwhile, has long been open to talks, but exclusively with the U.S. and about a timetable for removing U.S. troops. Only after, with its leverage increased, would the group then negotiate with other Afghans.\n\nBetween the lines: Had the U.S. waited for pro-government Afghan consensus, peace talks would not be moving forward. The U.S. has allowed the Taliban a process win by acceding to their sequencing preference, but this broke the logjam; neither side has earned substantive concessions just yet.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: The U.S. reportedly floated a troop drawdown timeline and the Taliban a pledge to prevent terrorists from using Afghan territory. However, U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has said that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, including a ceasefire and Taliban commitments to negotiate with the Afghan government over the country\u2019s political future. For the Taliban, those are tough lines to cross.\n\nWhat to watch: If Washington demands a comprehensive deal, last week\u2019s small steps could lead to a real peace agreement. But if the Taliban balks, and if other Afghan parties don\u2019t pull together, then an impatient Trump administration might exit without a deal.\n\nLaurel Miller is director of the Asia Program at the International Crisis Group and a former senior U.S. State Department official responsible for Afghanistan and Pakistan."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Why it matters: A growing, youthful population is typically a bedrock sign of vitality. In the industrial age, that's included a growing economy, greater opportunity, advancing technology, and a more comfortable retirement for older people. The turnaround on all continents except Africa means supporting an increasing number of retired people with many fewer workers, and confronts the world with two primary solutions, both of them controversial.\n\nLoosen up currently fraught politics around migration from still-growing countries.\n\nOr populate our countries with robot helpers.\n\nWhichever the case, almost no one seems prepared. People are going to have to work longer, experts say. And the U.S. requires \"major reforms\" in its programs for the elderly, says Richard Cincotta, director of the Global Political Demography Program at the Stimson Center, and formerly a lead demographer for the U.S. intelligence community. But the government \"seems to be nowhere near making the social security reforms that are needed.\"\n\nLargely because of Africa, the global population is forecast to continue rising through the century past 11 billion. But according to the United Nations, there is a 23% chance the world population will stabilize or fall by then in a phenomenon that some demographers call \u201cpeak human.\u201d\n\nDigging underneath the numbers:\n\nBy 2100, the population of the world's poorest countries will more than triple, from 954 million in 2015 to 3.2 billion.\n\nMinus immigration, the populations of the U.S., Japan and all of Europe are shrinking. By 2050, 48 countries or areas will have fewer people. Several will see a 15% decline, including Japan, the Balkans and the Baltics, and some much more.\n\nIn 2016, the fertility rate in the United States was the lowest it has ever been, according to the Centers for Disease Control. It was 1,765 births per 1,000 women of child-bearing age, below the replacement rate of 2,100.\n\nAt the same time, there will be more old people: forecasts include a spike in the number of people 80 and over.\n\nGlobal life expectancy will rise from about 70 in 2015 to 83 in 2100, according to UN figures.\n\nExcept Africa, by 2050 about a quarter of the world population will be 60 or older. At about 900 million now, their numbers will rise to about 3.2 billion in 21oo. By 2080, those 65 or older will be 29.1% of the global population \u2014 and 12.7% will be 80 or over, Eurostat said.\n\nThe most worrying figure: The world will not have sufficient working-age people to support the elderly. Currently, North America has just under four workers per retired person. Seven European countries have three, and Japan has just a bit more than two.\n\nBy 2050, seven Asian countries, 24 European and four Latin American will fall below two workers per retired person, the UN says.\n\nThis means \u201ca rising fiscal burden and slower economic growth than if the population was not aging,\u201d says Richard Jackson of the Global Aging Institute.\n\nWorthy of your time:\n\nEditor's note: This deep dive was first published in July of 2018."

New START expires by its terms in two years but can be extended by up to five years.\n\nExtension would cap Russian strategic forces until 2026, without inhibiting U.S. modernization plans, which are designed to fit within New START\u2019s limits. It would also continue the flow of valuable information on Russian strategic forces that the U.S. military gets from the treaty\u2019s verification measures.\n\nThe Russians are complying with New START, and they have expressed interest in its extension. That should be a no-brainer, but Bolton disdains arms control and President Trump has criticized the treaty as \"one-sided.\" U.S. agreement to extension is not a given.\n\nThe bottom line: If New START lapses in 2021, no treaties will constrain U.S. and Russian nuclear forces, a break from some 50 years of nuclear arms control between Washington and Moscow.

Of the 1,000 or so malls open today, around a quarter are at risk of shuttering in the next five years, per Credit Suisse's analysis.\n\nThese old structures are turning into community college campuses and doctor's offices, and even Amazon is reportedly looking at turning old Sears stores into Whole Foods outlets. Amazon did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nGo deeper: Read the Axios special report on the future of retail"

    "text": "Details: Researchers investigated the effects of the Northeast Pacific sea star wasting disease event, which hit its epidemic phase from 2013 to 2015 but continues to have major impacts. Infected sea stars suffer a gruesome fate, beginning with dermal lesions and ending in \"white piles of ossicles and disconnected limbs.\"\n\nThe impact: More than 20 species have been hit with this disease from California to British Columbia, and the predatory sunflower star has seen an 80\u2013100% decline across its approximately 1,800-mile range. The study utilized biomass data from deepwater-trawl surveys from 2004 to 2016, as well as diver surveys of shallow nearshore regions from Alaska to California.\n\nThey found that steep drop-offs in sunflower sea star populations coincided with periods of unusually high sea surface temperatures.\n\nMuch of the area affected by the sea star wasting disease was within the zone of a marine heat wave known to meteorologists and oceanographers at the \"The Blob.\" That lasted from 2014 through 2016, and has been tied to global warming.\n\nA statistical analysis conducted as part of the study found that temperature alone explains more than one-third of the variance in sunflower sea star abundance.\n\nIn other words, where and when the waters got warmer, pathogens turned deadly.\n\nThe bottom line: The study warned that continued exposure to sea star wasting disease, along with warming waters, could cause the predatory sunflower sea star to disappear completely."

    "text": "Axios, the DC media startup conceived by Politico alumni Jim VandeHei, Roy Schwartz, and Mike Allen, celebrated its second anniversary on Thursday evening with an \u201cout-of-this-world\u201d party inside the Showroom event space just off of K Street, Northwest.\n\nThe theme of the night was \u201cTo the Future\u201d\u2013produced by the company\u2019s new Axios Studios division and sponsored by Boeing \u2014 designed to get revelers to learn more about the complexities of space travel and why it matters.\n\nGuests began their evening in a Cape Canaveral-conceived holding room where the impact of space on Earth, from issues of security, diplomacy, and medicine to jobs and the environment, was highlighted (over cocktails, naturally). They were then ushered into a simulation room that was loosely based on Boeing\u2019s forthcoming CST-100 Starliner space taxi where they virtually blasted-off into the beyond, complete with vibrating seats and wall-to-wall screens.\n\nAfter a toast from Axios CEO VandeHei, the curtain was pulled back on two additional rooms. The first, modeled after the International Space Station, featured videos previously recorded from the orbiting ship itself as well as a flight simulator of the Starliner. But it was the adjoining Yayoi Kusama-esque infinity room that was the clear favorite of the party, which transported visitors into various locations throughout deep space, such as Mars, the moon, and NASA\u2019s planned Lunar Orbiting Platform Gateway.\n\nLast night\u2019s party capped another banner year for Axios. Since it first launched on the eve of President Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017, the company has grown from 35 to 144 people, 3 newsletters to 18, and even added a podcast and HBO series to its content portfolio. Schwartz told Vanity Fair earlier this week that the company pulled in $25 million in 2018, just $56,000 short of breaking even for the year. And that doesn\u2019t even factor in the $20 million second round of funding the company just raised, which hasn\u2019t been touched yet.\n\nThe sky really does seem to be the limit for Axios in year three."

I cherish the good working relations and personal friendship with you. I enjoy our meetings and phone calls in which we could talk about anything. It falls to us to work together and accomplish things meaningful for the people of our two countries and the world at large.\"\n\nMy thought bubble: Of course the Chinese want another Trump-Xi meeting. They know they can not trust any agreement that is not made directly with the U.S. president, and they believe that if they can get a face-to-face meeting with Trump, they will probably end up with a more favorable deal for China.\n\nAs I wrote in last week's newsletter, this will continue to be a grind, but I still believe Xi is very motivated to make a deal as the trade war is one more risk he does not want right now.\n\nMore importantly, I hear he is very concerned about the push from some U.S. officials towards \"decoupling\" and so views a deal as a way to blunt those forces even as the U.S.-China competition heats up across multiple dimensions.\n\nThe big question: When they meet, will Xi make a last-minute request to release Meng Wanzhou and settle the Huawei indictments with a fine? It worked for Xi in the ZTE debacle.\n\nGo deeper:"

The study utilized biomass data from deepwater-trawl surveys from 2004 to 2016, as well as diver surveys of shallow nearshore regions from Alaska to California.\n\nThey found that steep drop-offs in sunflower sea star populations coincided with periods of unusually high sea surface temperatures.\n\nMuch of the area affected by the sea star wasting disease was within the zone of a marine heat wave known to meteorologists and oceanographers at the \"The Blob.\" That lasted from 2014 through 2016, and has been tied to global warming.\n\nA statistical analysis conducted as part of the study found that temperature alone explains more than one-third of the variance in sunflower sea star abundance.\n\nIn other words, where and when the waters got warmer, pathogens turned deadly.\n\nThe bottom line: The study warned that continued exposure to sea star wasting disease, along with warming waters, could cause the predatory sunflower sea star to disappear completely."

Patients would pay less at the pharmacy \u2014 which is good news for seniors who take a lot of expensive drugs.\n\nThe trade-off is that Part D premiums would increase, which in turn increases the government's costs.\n\nHHS expects the savings from lower out-of-pocket costs to exceed the increase in premiums.\n\nPolitically, the pharmaceutical industry would be a winner here, too: Pointing the finger at PBMs is a big part of its strategy to stave off tougher controls on its own prices.\n\nIn the long term, HHS is hoping this will change the pharmaceutical industry's pricing practices.\n\nFor example, drug companies will sometimes agree to steep rebates in exchange for PBMs giving their drug preferred treatment over a competitor.\n\nWithout the rebate structure in place, the hope is that those types of deals simply won\u2019t be possible, and pricing negotiations will center more heavily around drugs\u2019 sticker prices.\n\nThe bottom line: This is a major shakeup in the way we pay for drugs.

    "title": "How Arctic warming may have blasted us with the polar vortex",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The details: The main questions revolve around how Arctic climate change is altering the major circulation patterns in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nNot only are melting sea ice and warming oceans causing more heat and moisture to escape into the atmosphere in the Far North, but increasingly, mild and wet air masses from lower latitudes are intruding into the Arctic as well.\n\nThese invasions are made possible by disappearing sea ice, since open ocean allows air masses to have higher temperatures and humidity than they may have had in the past.\n\nAnd Arctic climate change is happening more than twice as fast as climate change in the rest of the world, thanks to a process known as Arctic amplification, which refers to positive feedbacks in the Arctic climate system.\n\nFor example, when sea ice melts, it exposes darker ocean water to incoming sunlight, which warms the water and then the air, melting more ice, and so on.\n\nFollowing the Las Vegas-like adage of \"What happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic,\" both of these dynamics may be changing weather patterns far outside the Arctic.\n\nThere are many studies showing statistical correlations between long-term climate change, sea ice loss in parts of the Arctic, and changes to the polar vortex.\n\nScientists are now trying to nail down the physical cause-and-effect mechanisms behind these links.\n\nSome researchers are more sold on this than others.\n\nWhat they're saying: Judah Cohen, director of seasonal forecasting at AER, a Verisk company, argues that less sea ice in the Barents and Kara Seas \u2014 a region between Finland and Russia \u2014 tends to strengthen a high-pressure area across northwestern Eurasia.\n\nAnother part of the chain reaction, of sorts, is increasing Siberian snow cover in the fall, which tends to favor low pressure in East Asia and the North Pacific. Both of these trends can alter the airflow in the upper atmosphere and knock the polar vortex off kilter, Cohen says.\n\nCohen's studies show that polar vortex disruptions may be happening more frequently, and are behind an observed increase in winter cold spells in Eurasia. They're also tied to increased late winter storminess in the Northeast U.S., he's found.\n\nMichael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, says climate models don't properly capture some of the key jet stream processes driving extreme weather events such as polar vortex disruptions.\n\n\"I would say that this particular debate is about where the debate about detectability of global warming was back in the early 1990's \u2014 honest scientists can legitimately differ based on reasonable interpretations of the evidence to date.\"\n\n\u2014 Michael Mann, Penn State University\n\nDim Comou, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, says computer models do show a link between low sea ice in the Barents and Kara Seas and more frequent weak polar vortex states, but they underestimate the strength of this tie-in.\n\nThe bottom line: Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center and an early proponent of the idea that rapid Arctic warming is leading to more extreme weather events, calls the link between warming and polar vortex disruptions \"complicated and still controversial.\"\n\nStill, she says, \"Evidence is piling up that disruptions of the stratospheric polar vortex are happening more often and global warming is a player.\"\n\nGo deeper:"

    "text": "Background: The Trump administration hopes its economic strategy of squeezing Iran and its allies, which kicked into high gear last November, will allow it to renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal and limit that country\u2019s regional sphere of influence. In Lebanon, however, this remains unlikely owing to Hezbollah\u2019s increasing ability to hide behind legitimate state institutions and benefit from their resources.\n\nIn an apparent effort to blunt the impact of recently enacted U.S. sanctions on its finances, Hezbollah also secured a \u201cservice ministry\u201d for the first time. Its control over Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Health, with an annual budget exceeding $469 million, could help ease the group\u2019s financial pinch by allowing it to provide patronage at government expense.\n\nReality check: If Trump intends to aggressively pursue Hezbollah\u2019s pocketbook, he will need to make hard decisions that could imperil Lebanon\u2019s fragile political and financial stability, reversing a policy that prioritized containing the fallout from the war in Syria. This would entail scaling back military cooperation that the Pentagon deems important for the war against the Islamic State, or ISIS, and al-Qaeda, ending humanitarian assistance meant to alleviate the burden of hosting millions of Syrian refugees, and slapping sanctions against a good portion of Lebanon\u2019s political elite for enabling Hezbollah.\n\nThe bottom line: If near-term stability in an otherwise turbulent region remains paramount, then the solution to the U.S.' Hezbollah problem will have to wait for a potential understanding with Iran.\n\nFiras Maksad is the director of Arabia Foundation, a Washington think tank.

If they do so routinely, on many topics, they imperil the nation, and their position.\u201d\n\nP.S.

European economic efforts: The harder the continent tries to effectively preserve some of the deal's economic benefits, the likelier Iran is to stick to it.\n\nThe bottom line: By establishing the SPV, the EU has put some time onto the third clock. But the others are still ticking, and the fate of the deal remains precarious.\n\nRobert Malley is president and CEO of the International Crisis Group."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Lest there be any ambiguity on that last point, it was just last August that Facebook was forced to pull a similar app after Apple said it violated rules on data collection.\n\nWhy it matters: Apple is a key distributor of Facebook's apps and sole arbiter of what is allowed inside its App Store. If Apple were to ban Facebook's apps, the company wouldn't have an alternative means to get its apps on iOS devices and would have to rely solely on a mobile web browser to reach its users.\n\nThe big question: It's unclear just what Facebook was thinking \u2014 it won't say whether it thought that it was somehow complying with Apple's rules.\n\nWhat is clear is that when Apple did learn about the app, it was hopping mad. The company spent several hours getting a handle on the situation Tuesday night before ultimately deciding to revoke Facebook's enterprise credentials.\n\nApple's move had the effect of limiting a wide range of other efforts within Facebook, including breaking test versions of new and existing apps as well as internal tools. Facebook says that it is working to resolve the issue \u2014 but again, that's really up to Apple.\n\nYes, but: Facebook wasn't alone in flouting Apple's rules, which may prove a boon to the social network as it works through the crisis. It turns out Google was doing almost the same thing.\n\nGoogle, though, apologized and withdrew its app immediately. Plus, it hadn't had a similar app already rejected like Facebook.\n\nSo far, it seems to have escaped any immediate punishment.\n\nBy the numbers: The number of affected users also differs.\n\nFacebook said fewer than 150,000 people used the Facebook Research app in the time it was available.\n\nGoogle's Screenwise app has been around since at least 2014, but has been installed on fewer than 10,000 devices, according to a source.\n\nBetween the lines: Apple doesn't really know how many other companies may have employed similar techniques.\n\nBy design, Apple doesn't approve or know the details of the apps being deployed using enterprise certificates.\n\nThat allows companies to build and deploy apps containing proprietary information, intended for internal use only.\n\nMeanwhile: Aside from the issue with Apple, Facebook was also taking a risk in collecting so much data, and especially from teens.\n\nFacebook notes that it was upfront about the data it was collecting, compensating users and getting parental consent where needed.\n\nEven still, it was grabbing a ton of data \u2014 including reportedly asking users to upload their Amazon purchases.\n\nThe bottom line: The saga of Facebook Research will be yet another point for those who believe Facebook will gobble up all the data it can unless it is reined in through regulation."

Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Sarah Ladislaw summed things up in a tweet yesterday...\n\n\"Just wanted to point out that we are living in a scenario where the U.S. is sanctioning Venezuelan crude oil exports (effectively) and Iranian oil exports, OPEC is cutting, Alberta is curtailing, and oil price today is still around $60/54 (brent/WTI).\"\n\nThe intrigue: I chatted with Ladislaw about why this is happening, when it really should be a cocktail for very high prices right now.\n\n\"We are in a time where there is a lot of market intervention for geopolitical reasons and there is little to no geopolitical risk in the price right now,\" she tells me.\n\n\"It's hard to move prices when the prevailing sentiment is that markets are very well supplied in a number of different directions, and there is an economic malaise around expectations for oil demand growth,\" Ladislaw adds.\n\nYes, the sanctions are sending Gulf Coast refiners who use heavy Venezuelan oil searching for replacement barrels and that will affect pricing for specific grades. Venezuela is an important supplier, as the chart above shows.\n\nBut, overall, the market is absorbing the news for now.\n\nWhere it stands: U.S. production, already at record levels, continues to rise and is now approaching 12 million barrels per day. Ladislaw notes that it has consistently been beating expectations.\n\nVenezuelan production has been cratering for a while, so that's somewhat baked into the cake.\n\nBut she points out that the landscape has changed in other ways that also temper the friction, such as: \"We have already done Iran sanctions once before. There is a little bit of muscle memory in the market for dealing with an environment in which you have to find alternatives for Iranian barrels.\"\n\nThe latest: Via Reuters, \"Oil prices steadied after two days of gains on Thursday, as lower-than-expected U.S. fuel stock rises and U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan output boosted investor confidence but U.S.-China trade tensions weighed on sentiment.\"\n\nGo deeper: Unpacking Trump's Venezuelan oil move"

The ad has no sound and disappears as soon soon as the user hits play again.\n\nBetween the lines: Hulu says Coca-Cola and Charmin have signed on as its beta partners for the launch.\n\nWhile those are expected advertisers for this format (users usually pause shows to grab a snack or use the restroom), Hulu head of ad platforms Jeremy Helfand says the format could work for many advertisers, so long as the ads are contextually relevant.\n\nHelfand says nearly 80% of Hulu content is now watched in the living room, up from 70% a few years ago. A pause ad is suited for large-screen viewing, where presumably users are passively consuming content for a longer period of time.\n\nThe big picture: The effort comes amid an industry-wide push to be more innovative around advertising. Most networks and TV providers are beginning to use data and tech to target more personalized ads. AT&T is also testing a similar pause ad function.\n\nThe TV industry has recently become more motivated to change its old-school way of delivering ads because consumers are largely rejecting ad-supported programming, instead opting to purchase ad-free subscription services like Netflix.\n\nHulu thinks that if it can serve people better, more relevant ads, users will be open to ad-supported programming. As of now, the majority of its users actually subscribe to Hulu's ad supported tier.\n\nThe bottom line: While TV consumption has changed the way viewers consume content, the reality is that TV advertising hasn't yet caught up with the times."

    "text": "That's why Kamala Harris' comment this week about doing away with private health insurance, as part of a Medicare for All plan, exposes the danger for Democrats if they don't convince people who like their private coverage that they have something better to offer.\n\nThe big picture: As the chart shows, the share of the non-elderly population with employer coverage fell between 1999 and 2010. But it\u2019s actually been rising in recent years, especially between 2013 and 2017, the last year for which we have data from the National Health Interview Survey.\n\nBoth a stronger economy and the ACA\u2019s individual and employer mandates are likely reasons for the increase.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\nThe increase means that 156 million people were covered by employer-based insurance in 2017.\n\nthat 156 million people were covered by employer-based insurance in 2017. That makes it by far the single largest form of coverage, followed by Medicaid at 74 million.\n\nBetween the lines: The size of this group is a reminder of the biggest challenge for Medicare for All: it can't be too disruptive of the health coverage people already have.\n\nIn our polling, national health plans that allow people to keep their private employer coverage if they choose to are more popular than plans that would be mandatory for everyone as some Medicare for All plans are.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that the big problem for these 156 million people isn't getting to universal coverage \u2014 it\u2019s their deductibles and drug prices and premiums and surprise medical bills. Whether they are Trump voters in Indiana or longtime Democrats in California, they are looking for help paying their medical bills, not big ideas they cannot connect to their everyday problems.\n\nThe bottom line: The 2020 presidential candidates would do well not to forget that the employer market is where the largest share of Americans are experiencing problems with health care costs. And as debate about Medicare for All heats up, advocates will have to deal with the love-hate relationship 156 million workers have with their employer-based coverage."

    "title": "The lessons of Norway's rapid electric vehicle adoption",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Background: Because renewable energy already accounts for an 98% of its electricity mix, Norway has tried to decarbonize further by focusing on other sectors, including road transportation, which produces about 17% of the country's carbon emissions.\n\nEfforts started in the '90s with incentives for zero-emission vehicles in the form of tax breaks, parking-related subsidies, access to public transport lanes, toll roads, and ferries. EVs started to make greater inroads into the Norwegian market in 2012\u20132013, when larger EVs with longer driving ranges were introduced, thereby addressing consumers\u2019 range-anxiety concerns. The introduction of Tesla\u2019s Model S in particular switched things to a different gear.\n\nA key enabler was Norway\u2019s very high standard taxes for ICEVs, ranging from approximately 20% to 40% depending on the weight of the car and estimated emissions. The various subsidies stacked together along with this avoided tax chipped away at the incremental cost of an EV compared to a conventional ICEV.\n\nThe development of a public charging infrastructure further allayed the range anxiety of consumers.\n\nThe bottom line: The Norwegian experience with EVs seems to indicate four key takeaways: EVs become the preferred choice of most consumers once they try them; range anxiety can be addressed; the electricity grid was able to absorb the additional demand for electricity in the short run; and perhaps most important, temporary subsidies and incentives can kickstart the adoption of new green technology.\n\nMagnus Korpaas is a professor at Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

Any slowing of this momentum \u2014 especially at the hands of Democrats \u2014 could hammer him politically.\n\nYes, but: Feinstein\u2019s office told Axios that the WSJ editorial is \u201criddled with errors,\u201d and specifically debunked the claim that Feinstein and Harris are demanding Trump \u201cdump\u201d 40-year-old nominee Patrick Bumatay for political reasons.\n\n\u201cIn fact, he was never mentioned by the White House before he was nominated and has no judicial experience,\u201d Feinstein\u2019s press secretary Ashley Schapitl told Axios.\n\nSchapitl also emailed Axios four letters that Feinstein and Harris sent to the White House (one to the president, one to former White House Counsel Don McGahn and two to Cipollone) about coordinating their efforts to fulfill California judicial vacancies. Two of the letters noted that the senators were looking to reach an agreement \u201csimilar to the one that the White House struck with [Illinois] Senators Durbin and Duckworth \u2026 in that case each party selected one candidate from the other party\u2019s list for the Circuit to fill two vacancies.\u201d\n\nFeinstein also mentioned in an October statement that she had met with McGahn in 2017 to discuss the court\u2019s previous vacancies, but said the White House chose to move forward with certain nominees without consulting her.\n\nThe bottom line: Consulting with senators about judicial vacancies in their states is not a new practice, and it's a courtesy that even the Trump administration has previously extended. But given the divisiveness of modern day politics and the politicization of filling the courts, conservatives are increasingly looking at any coordination between the White House and Democrats as politically dangerous.\n\nUpdate: Trump names judicial nominees to California\u2019s Ninth Circuit Court following pressure from conservatives."

The company also reassured investors that it had \"sufficient cash on hand\" for a bond payment due in March.\n\nDetails: Tesla said strong sales were offset by cheaper Model S and Model X vehicles in China, as well as the lower-priced version of the Model 3. Additionally, the company expects between 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019, which would constitute a 65% increase from last year."

On average, it says, more than 2 billion people use one of its services every day.\n\nWhat they're saying: Facebook now has 7 million advertisers across its services, David Fischer, VP of advertising and global operations, told Axios. \"If we can drive a return, they stick with us and invest more with us as time goes by,\" he said.\n\n\"As we think about our priorities of ensuring safety and security of our platform, while at same time growing our community and business, I think this quarter demonstrates that we can do both, and that remains a key priority in 2019.\"\n\nKey statistic: Fischer says that 66% of the core Facebook app users are daily active users.\n\n\"People have hypothesized over time, as we continue to grow our user base ... that it's likely that you\u2019ll get less engagement. So the fact that we actually see that daily active as percentage of monthly active remain high and fairly steady, we think, means that people are having positive experiences on our platform and that's what keeps them coming back.\"\n\nThe takeaway: While user growth was strong, just about matching estimates, average revenue per user was up much higher than expected, proving that Facebook has improved its ability to monetize users.\n\nThe big picture: Facebook had some of its worst scandals last quarter, including a major data breach, a scandal involving the seizure of many revealing documents by the U.K. Parliament, and the revelations of two independent reports commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee that found that the Russian efforts to interfere in U.S. elections using Facebook were much greater than was initially understood."

Here's what the NWS forecast office in Des Moines stated on Tuesday:\n\n\"THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE LIFE-THREATENING COLD AIR!!! This is the coldest air many of us will have ever experienced. This is not a case of 'meh, it's Iowa during winter and this cold happens.'

The last time it was this cold was in 1996.\n\nDes Moines, Iowa, set a daily record low with a temperature of minus 20\u00b0F, and a wind chill far colder than that. At 8 am in Iowa, wind chills were as low as minus 58\u00b0F, which is sufficient to cause frostbite in just minutes.\n\nChicago saw a wind chill of minus 52\u00b0F and a low of minus 23\u00b0F, which was the city's 5th-lowest temperature on record and the coldest reading since 1985. The low on Thursday morning may be even colder, and could make a run at the city's all-time record of minus 27\u00b0F.\n\nChicago's all-time record for the coldest daytime high temperature is likely to be tied or broken, with temperatures only climbing to minus 11\u00b0F.

In addition, at least 5 deaths have been reported so far, though that number is expected to increase.\n\nThe climate context: This extreme weather event comes courtesy of a lobe of the polar vortex, which has swirled its way southward, out of the high Arctic, to strafe the Midwest and Northeast with a taste of the winter weather normally felt in far northern Canada.\n\nAnd we're going to be seeing more of these, although they may not be quite so severe. Even though we think of climate change as rising global temperatures, recent studies show that it could cause more frequent southward polar vortex incursions too \u2014 because as it melts Arctic sea ice, it alters the exchange of heat and moisture between the ocean and atmosphere in the far north.\n\nrecent studies show that it could cause more frequent southward polar vortex incursions too \u2014 because as it melts Arctic sea ice, it alters the exchange of heat and moisture between the ocean and atmosphere in the far north.

Late Tuesday night, Facebook defended the program, which dates back to 2016, but said it was discontinuing it for iOS users.\n\n\"Despite early reports, there was nothing 'secret' about this; it was literally called the Facebook Research App. It wasn't 'spying' as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate. Finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms.\"\n\n\u2014 Facebook spokesperson\n\nThe Apple conflict: Facebook's program, according to TechCrunch, used an apparently rewritten version of the Onavo software that Facebook pulled from the App Store last year after Apple said it violated its policies.\n\nFacebook had the users install the software as an \"enterprise profile,\" a setting typically reserved for letting big companies privately test and deploy their in-house software.\n\nApple responded this morning by revoking Facebook's enterprise license and said: \"We designed our Enterprise Developer Program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization. Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple.\"\n\nFacebook is likely to argue that its research project is little different from the kind of tracking Nielsen has done for decades of TV viewing patterns, or Comscore's tallying of web usage. But those services didn't end up with the kind of total access to people's lives that Facebook is getting via their phones.\n\nThe price of data: By offering $20 a month to users who installed the software, Facebook at least acknowledged that people's data has monetary value. Instead of one penny for a teen's thoughts, Facebook is offering 2,000. That sum is unlikely to be enough to stem the tide of renewed cries of protest and calls for regulation this incident will release.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nBloomberg's Sarah Frier: \"$20 a month doesn't seem like a lot to give up that much data, but I guess the rest of FB users give them a lot for free!\"\n\nThe Verge's Casey Newton: \"The Facebook Research story is a real 'ask forgiveness, not permission' moment for a company that has already been asking for a lot of forgiveness.\"\n\nSoFi comms VP Jim Prosser: \"Only way this looks worse is if they had compensated the teens with Juul pods.\"\n\nWhat's next: Facebook reports earnings this afternoon, and executives are sure to be grilled over this and other privacy issues."

There are one or two powers that Trump could use that are related to military construction.\n\nThose emergency construction powers have only been used twice: by George H.W.

Those orders aren't listed in the graphic because they were just amendments to earlier emergency declarations.\n\nThe backstory: Over the past 40 years, the National Emergencies Act has become a common tool for U.S. presidents to quickly enact foreign sanctions, especially when their views conflict with Congress. Of the 58 national emergencies in the data, 44 have been foreign sanctions.\n\nSome examples:\n\nDuring the Iran hostage crisis , Jimmy Carter declared an emergency that's still active today, freezing Iranian government assets held within the U.S.\n\n, Jimmy Carter declared an emergency that's still active today, freezing Iranian government assets held within the U.S. Bill Clinton targeted the assets of individual drug traffickers and those who assisted them in Colombia.\n\ntargeted the assets of individual drug traffickers and those who assisted them in Colombia.

Autonomous vehicles could add $800 billion to the U.S. economy by 2050 and create jobs that may, over time, replace those lost by truck drivers, according to Securing America's Future Energy.\n\nWhere it stands: Active safety technology in today's cars warns of unseen dangers, guides drivers back on course and helps them brake in emergencies. And studies show these systems are making us safer:\n\nLane departure warnings and blind spot detection systems cut the rate of sideswipe crashes and injuries by double-digit rates.\n\nRear-end crashes go down 39% with automatic braking systems.\n\nUnfortunately, those safety benefits are offset by a rise in distracted driving, which is why the quest toward fully autonomous cars continues.\n\nGo deeper:"

The appropriation of sensitive technology is part of China\u2019s long-term plans to dominate sophisticated technology sectors and displace existing leaders in the U.S., Europe and Japan.\n\nU.S. authorities have also long suspected that Huawei equipment could be used for espionage purposes, spurring them to launch a global campaign to persuade like-minded allies to prohibit deployment of 5G networks, the next generation of telecommunications equipment.\n\nHidden sales to Iran, as alleged in yesterday\u2019s indictments, reinforce the United States\u2019 case that Huawei cannot be trusted with building the new networks and that its technology aids and abets authoritarian regimes in deploying the tools of repression.\n\nWhat to watch: After Meng was detained in Vancouver, the Chinese reopened a settled case against an alleged Canadian drug smuggler and imposed the death sentence. Until Meng's case is settled, we should not be surprised to see other moves against U.S. and Canadian citizens. We will also find out this week if the trade negotiations founder because of Chinese ire over the Huawei charges.\n\nThomas J. Duesterberg is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute."

Because many parents simply don't have the time to prepare every meal for their babies, those wanting something fresh are open to upstart organic food brands that will do it for them.\n\nAngela Sutherland is co-founder of Yumi, a California-based organic baby food startup that markets direct to consumers. Sutherland sends overnight shipments of freshly made baby foods to its clientele weekly.\n\nIn 2017, Sutherland and her partner raised $4.1 million in venture capital. Since then, she tells Axios, they have shipped about half a million jars of mixtures like banana with kale and black beans; kiwi combined with coconut milk, quinoa and banana; and standard spinach.\n\nThey are around $5 a jar, more or less double the cost of processed brands, depending on the type.\n\nThe business has grown by 30% month after month, Sutherland says, and has built a fanatical base of \"megafans.\"\n\nSutherland says that big retailers have begun to circle the company in hopes of a distribution deal. \"It shows how much retailers want brands with connection to a fan base,\" she says.\n\nKimberly Greenberger, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, agreed. To differentiate their merchandise from competitors, brick-and-mortar retailers today are looking to secure exclusive products. \"The more exclusive and proprietary, the more the retailer can capture that consumer demand,\" she says.\n\n\"Something like baby food, where there is a monopoly or a duopoly \u2014 anything that disrupts that duopoly with a natural label will disrupt the market,\" Barbara Denham, chief economist at Reis, an analytics firm owned by Moody's, tells Axios.\n\nYumi is fulfilling two current market fads \u2014 making organic foods and shipping them to customers' doorsteps. The business is subscriber-based, and it tries to be highly customized, arriving in a box with a card listing nutritional studies validating a particular mixture of ingredients, Sutherland says.\n\n\"Now we ship to New York and the tri-state area. We are rolling out nationally this year,\" says Sutherland, a former investment banker. \"We didn't realize how fast the business could grow.\""

Some have expressed skepticism that Kushner \u2014 a New York liberal with no background in immigration policy or politics \u2014 could succeed where so many of his predecessors have failed.\n\nTea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, who met with the president and other conservative leaders last Wednesday, told Axios: \u201cBorder security and immigration reform are much more complex issues than criminal justice reform. \u2026 It would be wise [for the White House] to be in touch with the president\u2019s base as any such legislative deal is being created. Many of the strongest parts of the president\u2019s base do not want amnesty, and the president\u2019s promise to secure the border is what drew those voters to him from early in his campaign.\u201d\n\n(The White House has, however, been meeting with conservative movement leaders \u2014 including Martin \u2014 who regard themselves as representatives of the base. Vice President Pence attended the meeting with Martin last week.)\n\nDaniel Garza, president of the Koch network\u2019s LIBRE Initiative and a supporter of Kushner\u2019s approach, attended a separate White House meeting with Hispanic leaders. Garza said Kushner used a quote he presumably gathered from his ongoing efforts to bring peace to the Middle East. \u201cAt one point during the meeting, Jared quoted [former Israeli President] Shimon Peres and said something along the lines of \u2018You don\u2019t arrive at peace by meeting with just friends,\u2019\u201d Garza said.\n\nBetween the lines: Two senior White House officials told Axios they are stunned that Kushner thinks he could be the mediator who solves one of the most intractable problems in American politics for the past 20 years: immigration reform. One senior White House official told Axios that Kushner's success in criminal justice reform has no bearing whatsoever on his ability to succeed on immigration.\n\n\u201cHe convinced Democrats to support something they already agreed with,\" the senior official told Axios.\n\nSupporters of Kushner point out that if he didn't persuade Trump to move from a harsh law-and-order candidate to being open to \u2014 and ultimately supportive of \u2014 criminal justice reform, then the effort would have died.\n\nThe other side: Two other senior White House officials familiar with Kushner\u2019s plans told Axios that the president asked Kushner to join with Vice President Mike Pence and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to negotiate immigration on behalf of the White House. One of those officials said Kushner has almost exclusively been talking to Republicans to figure out what they want out of a reform package. His planning sessions are \u201cabout defining what we\u2019re for, not what we\u2019re against.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now [Kushner is] just trying to understand the Republican position so that we can take all those views to the president and he can make an informed decision,\u201d the same official said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is more of a long-term policy process, not a resolution for the shutdown,\u201d the official added. \u201cAnd amnesty was not discussed at any of these meetings. This is really about how do we reform our broken immigration system.\u201d\n\nAs Axios has reported, Kushner relayed to White House officials an idea from Republican Sen. James Lankford: Give a path to green cards for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and who are currently protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Axios: \"The President asked us to take a team approach, with the VP taking the lead. That team has done fantastic work and we are all pulling the same direction to carry out the President\u2019s strong border agenda. The negotiation is far from over, and at this stage, there\u2019s no way to know what that legislation will ultimately look like. Whatever the outcome, though, you can be sure the the President will protect the American people.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to include a quote from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney."

    "text": "It is tempting to paint the competing factions backing Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and newly declared President Juan Guaido as East vs. West or socialist vs. capitalist, but the real delineation is about the money.\n\nOn one side: Most of the official bonds, around $65 billion worth issued by Venezuela and state oil company PdVSA, are held by investors in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Almost all of those bonds have been in default since November 2017.\n\nInvestors in North America and Europe are largely still holding the bonds. The odds of them being paid increase greatly if Maduro is replaced as president by someone who will seek help from the IMF and look to issue debt again on global credit markets. None of that can happen until an agreement is made with bondholders.\n\n(This situation played out perfectly for investors when Mauricio Macri was elected president of Argentina and settled almost immediately with that nation's creditors on terms that were very favorable.)\n\nThe other side: China and Russia have enjoyed an off-the-books arrangement with Venezuela wherein the nation with the world's largest proven oil reserves ships them crude in exchange for discounted payment of outstanding debts and fresh cash.\n\nMaduro also has signed over portions of the country's oil industry to China and sold discounted oil to Cuba, likely in exchange for that country's armed forces protection.\n\nTurkey for some time has been supplying products for food packets to Venezuelan officials. Venezuela also ships gold to Turkey and the 2 countries recently announced joint ventures for gold and coal exploration.\n\nU.S. officials allege Venezuela has been sidestepping sanctions and sending gold to Iran in exchange for cash and debt relief.\n\nThese agreements would be in question under a new president who was backed by the U.S., Europe and the IMF. Iran and Russia also benefit from Venezuela's greatly reduced oil-production capacity, which props up crude prices.\n\nCloser to home: Latin America's 2 major country alliances \u2014 Mercosur, which includes Venezuela but does not recognize Maduro, and Allianza Pacifico \u2014 have denounced Venezuela for years. Maduro's assault on democracy threatened international trade agreements and 3 million displaced Venezuelan emigrants have spilled into neighboring countries causing economic and political strain.\n\nBolivia's president Evo Morales and Mexico's Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador have stood with Maduro but also against a long tradition of U.S. intervention in Latin America.\n\nThe bottom line: Venezuela previously funded itself through debt financing and oil sales, but as the cost for Maduro to stay in power rose \u2014 with higher bond payments and more security \u2014 and he ran low on U.S. dollars he looked for partners who would take alternative payments. Those partners are now invested in him holding power, while defaulted creditors are invested in his removal."

While Trump has intimated that he might use Meng as a bargaining chip (a likely unconstitutional offer that may have jeopardized the extradition), the DOJ has distanced itself from the White House's trade negotiations. There's a much more mundane explanation for the timing: Among U.S. allies, Canada is one of the toughest to obtain an extradition from, and it takes about this much time to go through the Canadian process, said Chris Ott, a former prosecutor with the DOJ's National Security Division and current partner at Davis Wright Tremaine.\n\nWhile the administration largely believes a new trade agreement can stop China from skirting trade rules and reverse some of the long-term damage to U.S. interests, the DOJ penalties are more than just a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations.\n\nThe threat of arrest may be devastating for Huawei and, while it likely won't end suspicions of Chinese companies' participation in government mandated espionage campaigns, it will dramatically raise the business cost of doing so.\n\n\"It may not be safe for Huawei executives to travel to extradition countries,\" said Ott. \"It's hard to run an international business that way.

This is the coldest air many of us will have ever experienced. This is not a case of \"meh, it's Iowa during winter and this cold happens.\" These are record-breaking cold air temperatures, with wind chill values not seen in the 21st century in Iowa.\"\n\n\u2014 NWS Des Moines office\n\nThere's also this comparison used by the NWS forecast office in the Twin Cities: In Minneapolis on Wednesday and Thursday, wind chills will be colder than conditions at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station (where it's summer, but wind chills will still be minus 30\u00b0F).\n\nThe Twin Cities office is forecasting a record low of about minus 30\u00b0F, with a wind chill of between minus 50\u00b0F and minus 65\u00b0F on Wednesday morning. Temperatures there could remain below zero for nearly 80 straight hours.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, wind chills will range between minus 50\u00b0F to minus 65\u00b0F across parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois and Michigan, which could cause frostbite on exposed skin to occur in as little as 5 minutes, the Weather Service warned.\n\nAlready, International Falls, Minnesota, known as the nation's \"icebox,\" saw its temperature plummet to minus 46\u00b0F on Sunday, which tied for the 5th-lowest temperature it has ever recorded.\n\nThis will be the coldest air to affect the Midwest and Ohio Valley in a generation, and in some cases, ever. In Minneapolis, this will be the coldest weather since at least 1996.\n\nIn Chicago, no one under the age of 25 has experienced such cold weather, as the last such outbreak was Jan. 18\u201320, 1994. \"If there's a day where one needs to demonstrate cold weather safety to the max, it is Wednesday,\" the NWS in Chicago tweeted Tuesday.\n\nFresh snow cover deposited just ahead of the cold is aggravating the situation, since the bright snowpack reflects incoming sunlight rather than letting it be absorbed by the surface.\n\nBackground: The stratospheric polar vortex \u2014 which is a giant swirl of low pressure surrounded by powerful winds blowing counterclockwise at upper levels of the polar atmosphere \u2014 was knocked askew in early January, increasing the odds of cold outbreaks in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nWhen the polar vortex is strong, it tends to keep the coldest air bottled up in the far north.\n\nHowever, when it weakens or wobbles, it can draw frigid air south. It's as if the Northern Hemisphere's freezer door has been flung wide open.\n\nThe climate context: The globe as a whole is still much warmer than normal, and scientists say the cold snap in parts of the U.S. in no way invalidates the overwhelming scientific evidence showing global average temperatures are increasing due to the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIn fact, studies published in the past several years show that polar vortex disruptions may be more likely as the Earth warms and sea ice in the Arctic melts, though this is an active area of research.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Driving the news: Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency Jan. 25 after multi-county cases caused a \"public disaster.\" There were 36 cases reported on Monday.\n\nThe nearby city of Portland, Oregon, is also concerned, as there have been dozens of possible exposure locations, ranging from a Portland Trail Blazers game to a children's museum.\n\nIn 2018, there were 349 cases reported in 26 states and D.C., including outbreaks in New York and New Jersey where many were unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities.\n\nSeveral of these outbreaks (defined as 3 or more cases) are continuing into 2019, including in NYC and Rockland County, New York.\n\nPublic health officials are concerned the pro-vaccination message isn't getting through, they tell Axios.\n\n\"When we see outbreaks of measles like this one, it\u2019s a reminder to parents that many diseases rarely seen in the United States can affect their unvaccinated children. In some cases, children with measles may go on to develop serious complications, like pneumonia.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nancy Messonnier, director, CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases\n\n\"There's incorrect information about the safety of the MMR vaccine and its association with autism, which is 100% false. ... This is one of the most highly contagious diseases out there, but it's balanced against one of the most effective vaccines out there, [which is] 97% effective.\"\n\n\u2014 Anthony Fauci, director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n\nBetween the lines: Some of the main factors behind the anti-vaxxer movement are disbelief that measles is such a bad disease, anti-government sentiment, a misguided sense that the vaccine can be harmful, and lack of accessibility.\n\n1. Disbelief in its seriousness.\n\n\"This is a very dangerous situation, and I don't think people fully appreciate how difficult and dangerous it is,\" Fauci says.\n\nPre-vaccine, measles was the cause of deafness, encephalitis or death for some children. People have forgotten how they \"were clamoring\" for a vaccine, he adds.\n\n2. Anti-government and fear.\n\n\"Anti-vaccinism often goes hand in hand with suspicion of experts, government and Big Pharma and with conspiracy theories and skepticism about science generally,\" Helen Bedford, children's health professor at the University College London, tells Axios.\n\nPart of this is due to fear the vaccine causes autism. This fear spiked when a small 1998 study linked the measles vaccine and autism (a study later found fraudulent and retracted), Fauci says.\n\nFor instance, Ukraine's current large outbreak (already 8,500 in 2019) is mainly due to unsubstantiated fears over safety, Bedford says.\n\n3. Social media optimization.\n\n\"[Anti-vaxxers'] voice is loud and they have powerful influencers such as celebrities who attract media coverage. Messages can also spread in seconds around the world via social media (perhaps even faster than measles can spread!),\" Bedford says.\n\n4. Accessibility issues.\n\n\"Overall, it is factors such as difficulties accessing services that play an important role in under-immunization, as a result of large families, poverty [and] social disadvantage,\" Bedford adds.\n\nWhat's next: Fauci says evidence-based science must be consistently promoted by clinicians and public health officials. Bedford agrees, \"Science has demonstrated repeatedly that vaccines are highly effective and very safe. We don\u2019t say this loudly or frequently enough!\"\n\nGo deeper:"

The filing marks a significant milestone for corporations being forced to reckon with the consequences of climate change.\n\nThe backdrop: The company said it planned to file for bankruptcy protection earlier this month. Over the last few weeks, it maintained that the filing was necessary despite being cleared of fault for the 2017 Tubbs wildfire, which would lower potential liability costs. It also faced threats of a proxy battle from major shareholder BlueMountain Capital Management and a $4 billion proposal from a consortium of investors to help the company remain solvent. PG&E asked the court for access to the $5 billion debtor-in-possession financing to keep up services throughout the bankruptcy process."

And, on Wednesday, the NCSC published a long blog post explaining how they secure the U.K.'s telecom networks while clearly not ruling out Huawei for 5G...\n\nHow Huawei (and other vendors) are used in the UK\u2019s 5G build out will be determined by the government's telecoms supply chain review, which is gathering evidence at the moment and will report to ministers in spring. That review is the only policy vehicle for making decisions on how future telecoms networks in the UK will be built and run, in line with strong security principles.\n\nGermany has also not ruled out Huawei, according to the Wall Street Journal...\n\nThe German government is leaning toward letting Huawei Technologies Co. participate in building the nation\u2019s high-speed internet infrastructure despite U.S. warnings about the risks posed by the Chinese tech giant, according to senior German officials.\n\nIndia doesn't seem to be swayed by U.S. arguments either, per WSJ...\n\nPolicy makers and telecommunications firms here are so far largely unpersuaded by U.S. warnings ... according to more than a dozen government officials and industry executives. Many argue that any such risk is outweighed by Huawei\u2019s cut-rate prices and technological prowess...\n\nWhile India\u2019s 5G development is still in its infancy, the heft of the Indian market means the direction the South Asian country takes could make or break U.S. efforts to thwart Chinese influence in other nations that have yet to choose a side, analysts say. For years, many officials assumed India would stay in the U.S. corner given its own longtime rivalry with China.\n\nWhy it matters: The U.S. is expending significant effort and prestige to block Huawei from 5G networks but so far looks to be less than successful. The U.K., New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the U.S. make up the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence sharing alliance.\n\nMy thought bubble: Will the U.S. really stop sharing information with any of the members who have Huawei gear in their networks?

There are urban pockets with high concentrations of low-wage service jobs \u2014 and Vegas is atop that list.\n\nThe root of the danger in Las Vegas is the dominance of one industry: casinos.\n\n\"That's a blessing and a curse,\" says Jeffrey Brown, a researcher at the Bertelsmann Foundation and co-author of a new report on the future of work in Las Vegas.\n\nIt's a blessing because casinos buoy the city's economy; it's a curse because when they begin automating away jobs, workers will have little to fall back on.\n\nThe bottom line: Casinos are already installing fancy gaming machines and new equipment that allows blackjack dealers to accommodate dozens of gamers, where until now they have been able to deal only to a handful. Their hotels are targets for robotization, too, with automated check-in, room service, housekeeping and even robotic bartenders."

The move will likely make an impression across Asia, which is currently undergoing the last bouts of coal expansion.\n\nYes, but: Germany is nonetheless well behind the 2030 deadline set by the IPCC. Its timeline has also been criticized for being too slow; the U.K., the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, now regularly runs for days at a time without any coal power.\n\nWhile NGOs in Germany's commission welcomed the decision, they have vowed to push for the earliest possible deadline and to limit the compensation provided to coal plant owners, which they view as a dangerous precedent that could slow future closures.\n\nWhat to watch: The commission's successful negotiations are promising, but the findings must still be translated into law. This will require an act of parliament, setting up a crucial phase in the German energy transition that will play out in the months to come.\n\nJustin Guay directs global climate strategy at the Sunrise Project and advises the ClimateWorks Foundation."

The NWS is forecasting 59 straight hours in the Twin Cities with a wind chill at or below minus 20\u00b0F.\n\nAlready, International Falls, Minn., known as the nation's \"icebox,\" saw its temperature plummet to minus-46 on Sunday, which tied for the fifth-lowest temperature it has ever recorded.\n\nA storm associated with the push of Arctic air deposited a fresh snowpack across the Great Lakes region on Monday, and this increases the chances of record cold readings since snow-covered ground is more efficient at reflecting solar radiation back into the atmosphere.\n\nIf Chicago\u2019s high temperature remains below minus 11\u00b0F on Wednesday, it would be the city's coldest afternoon high temperature on record. In fact, the city could see temperatures remain below 0\u00b0F for at least 60 or more hours straight, a rarity even for such a cold location.\n\nAbout 200 million people in the U.S. will see temperatures dip below freezing during the coming week, based on model projections.\n\nThe background: The stratospheric polar vortex \u2014 which is a whirl of low pressure at upper levels of the atmosphere over the pole \u2014 was knocked askew in early January, increasing the odds of cold outbreaks in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nWhen the polar vortex is strong, it tends to keep the coldest air bottled up in the far north.\n\nHowever, when it weakens or wobbles, it can send frigid air spilling south, as if Mother Nature left the freezer door open.\n\nThe climate context: The globe as a whole is still much warmer than normal, and scientists say the cold snap in parts of the U.S. in no way invalidates the overwhelming scientific evidence showing global average temperatures are increasing due to the burning of fossil fuels for energy.\n\nIn fact, studies published in the past several years show that polar vortex disruptions may be more likely as the Earth warms and sea ice in the Arctic melts, though this is an active area of research.\n\n\"I have argued less sea ice, especially in the Barents-Kara Seas, favors a ridge of high pressure across northwest Eurasia,\" Judah Cohen, director of seasonal forecasting at AER, a Verisk company, told Axios in an email. A chain of events, Cohen says, then connects the effects of newly open ocean with events high in the atmosphere.\n\nGo deeper:"

    "text": "What to watch:\n\n1. After past talks between the two sides, the Taliban has often walked back initial reports on progress, and some of its recent public statements have already struck a less optimistic tone than those of U.S. negotiators. Until Taliban messaging becomes more positive, expectations of a deal should be kept in check.\n\n2. The Afghan government is understandably unhappy for being left out of the conversation thus far, so Washington will have to accommodate it if these fledgling efforts toward peace are to grow more promising. Will the U.S. insist on guarantees that the Taliban honors Afghanistan\u2019s constitution and doesn\u2019t try to undercut hard-earned women\u2019s rights? And above all, will the U.S. hold off on any troop withdrawal plan until there are clear assurances that the Taliban is committed to declaring a cease-fire and launching talks with Kabul?\n\nThe bottom line: The Taliban has plenty of leverage and it\u2019s negotiating from a position of strength. If it doesn't like where things are going, its leaders can easily back out, undercutting the encouraging progress made in the last few days.\n\nMichael Kugelman is deputy director and senior associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center."

    "text": "The latest: National Security Adviser John Bolton made the announcement in the White House briefing room on Monday afternoon alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin:\n\n\"We have continued to expose the corruption of Maduro and his cronies, and today's action ensures they can no longer loot the assets of the Venezuelan people. We expect... that today's measure totals $7 billion in assets blocked today plus over $11 billion in lost export proceeds over the next year. We also today call on the Venezuelan military and security forces to accept the peaceful democratic and constitutional transfer of power.\"\n\nBetween the lines: More than 20 countries have followed the U.S. in recognizing Guaid\u00f3 as interim president, due to his status as the highest-ranking official to have won a free election. Maduro has portrayed the situation as a U.S. effort to intervene in Venezuela. There had been concerns that sanctioning Venezuela's oil exports would both strengthen that argument, and deepen the economic crisis.\n\nThe economic impact, per the AP:\n\n\"Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. have declined steadily over the years. ... Still, Venezuela has consistently been the third- or fourth-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States, and any disruption of imports could be costly for refiners. In 2017, the most recent year that data were available, Venezuela accounted for about 6% of U.S. crude imports.\"\n\n\"Venezuela is very reliant on the U.S. for its oil revenue. The country sends 41% of its oil exports to the U.S. Critically, U.S. refiners are among the few customers that pay cash to Venezuela for its oil. That's because Venezuela's oil shipments to China and Russia are usually taken as repayment for billions of dollars in debts.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, who has taken a hawkish stance on Venezuela and played a key role in the Trump administration's policy, said: \"The Maduro crime family has used PDVSA to buy and keep the support of many military leaders. The oil belongs to the Venezuelan people, and therefore the money PDVSA earns from its export will now be returned to the people through their legitimate constitutional government.\u201d\n\nWhat to watch: Bolton reiterated today that military force is possible, saying: \"The president has made it very clear on this matter that all options are on the table.\" He also said the U.S. is \"now as prepared as we can be\" to protect diplomats in Caracas. The State Department has moved some personnel out of the country, but not complied with Maduro's demand that they all leave the country.\n\nGo deeper: Trump mused about \"military option\" in Venezuela with Graham"

Broad perceptions of political risk blind investors to opportunities in Africa, which hosts half of the world's fastest-growing economies. Over the next five years, 20 African economies are expected to grow at 5% or higher, outpacing the 3.6% rate for the world economy.\n\nMoreover, political dysfunction has become a global trend. The U.S. just grappled with its longest government shutdown in history, while in the U.K. Theresa May has faced two no-confidence votes in Parliament, impeding her ability to pass her Brexit plan.\n\nThe bottom line: Perceptions of risk in African markets need to be better calibrated to global realities and cross-border uncertainties. Many African countries \u2014 such as Ethiopia, which is expected to grow by 8.5% this year, and Guinea, which is expected to grow by nearly 6% \u2014 remain promising places to do business and will continue to attract savvy investors with a nuanced approach to risk assessment.\n\nPaulo Gomes is the founder of Constelor Investment, an investment management firm, and a co-founder of New African Capital Partners."

    "title": "Facebook's plan: One messaging service to rule them all",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Driving the news: As the New York Times' Mike Isaac reported, and Facebook confirmed to Axios, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has decided to integrate the back-end infrastructures of Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger so that users of all three can directly message one another. The plan is still early and exploratory, according to Facebook.\n\nWhat it means for Facebook's business\n\nReorganizing the codebases for Facebook's messaging services so that they are essentially one application with three different interfaces could make it much harder for a court or regulator to order a breakup of Facebook's properties, as some critics are proposing.\n\nIn its antitrust case 20 years ago, Microsoft famously argued that even though its web browser was originally a separate application, the browser's code had become too deeply entwined with the Windows operating system to remove.\n\nMicrosoft famously argued that even though its web browser was originally a separate application, the browser's code had become too deeply entwined with the Windows operating system to remove. Microsoft lost that argument, but Facebook's lawyers and developers may be able to learn from its predecessor's mistakes.\n\nFacebook's integration plan is all about improving interoperability among its own \"family of apps.\" But regulators and many users will also want to know whether Facebook's changes will help, or hinder, the messaging services' ability to communicate with users on competing services.\n\nApple runs its own vast text-messaging universe (iMessage), and the mobile phone carriers run another. Messages can easily cross those systems, but Facebook's messaging remains a world apart.\n\nFacebook may be weighing a more open approach, streamlined by this integration plan \u2014 but such a move would be out of keeping with its past behavior.\n\nZuckerberg's plan would also bolster Facebook's utility for its business customers, per Axios' Sara Fischer:\n\nMillions of companies around the world use Facebook\u2019s messaging tools as a business-to-business communications platform between vendors and consumers.\n\nFacebook has heard from many businesses that it\u2019s difficult to effectively operate all of its messaging services simultaneously.\n\nWhat it means for privacy on Facebook\n\nZuckerberg has decided that all of the services should protect users' messages with end-to-end encryption by default, currently offered only on WhatsApp, according to the Times report.\n\nEncryption can be a boon to users fearful of surveillance or who want to protect their personal data from commercial abuse.\n\nNo details are known of Facebook's plans, so it's impossible to say whether they will ultimately enhance user privacy or end up sparking new data scandals.\n\nBut Facebook's controversies over sharing user data have left a residue of mistrust in parts of the public and with some legislators, who will be less likely to give it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nSen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) responded to the news with a statement: \"We cannot allow platform integration to become privacy disintegration.\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.): \"Once again, Mark Zuckerberg appears eager to breach his commitments in favor of consolidating control over people and their data.\"\n\nWhat it means for Facebook users\n\nWhen Facebook acquired Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014), it said it would keep both services running separately under their original leadership. But the founders of both companies departed last year.\n\nGiven Facebook's mission \u2014 \"build community and bring the world closer together\" \u2014 it makes sense that Zuckerberg would look at three separate messaging products and want to unite them.\n\nYes, but: People's lives are tangled up in these apps in complex ways. Instagram and WhatsApp evolved as separate products with their own unique features and user behavior patterns.\n\nWhatsApp let users sign up for accounts with nothing more than a phone number, but Facebook is committed to users' having a single \"real-world\" identity.\n\nInstagram has become a petri dish for memes, \"influencers\" and other epiphenomena of visual online culture.\n\nMany users of Instagram and WhatsApp don't realize they're on Facebook-owned turf. Linking the services will tie their public images to Facebook's, which has taken a beating, Axios' Ina Fried notes.\n\nTreating these vast digital realms as interchangeable reservoirs of users may leave a bad taste for many, but that's not likely to slow Zuckerberg down.\n\nFacebook has a record of rearchitecting the social landscape for its own needs without users having a say.\n\nThe social network sparked its most famous user rebellion back in 2006, when it first introduced the Newsfeed.\n\nThe protests died out; the Newsfeed is the very heart of today's Facebook.\n\nThe bottom line: Facebook has always aimed to define and map the \"social graph\" of humanity. It was only a matter of time before Instagram and WhatsApp users were added to that graph."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "\u201cWhile the theory of having some collaboration and compromise across the board is always good, it\u2019s particularly important when the progress is measured in decades. One of the unique challenges of the energy and climate debate is that no meaningful decision gets made unless people have some confidence in at least a decade of consistent policy.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jason Grumet, president, Bipartisan Policy Center\n\nDriving the news: After an absence of nearly a decade, two big climate and energy policies are emerging in the Washington debate. The Green New Deal represents the progressive flank of the Democratic Party, but it has no Republican support. The other, a carbon tax, is bipartisan and reflects controversial compromise.\n\nBy the numbers: While America\u2019s political discourse has gotten more partisan in recent years, actual laws passed by Congress have not, according to forthcoming research described to Axios by James Curry, political scientist at the University of Utah, and Frances Lee, politics professor at the University of Maryland.\n\nSince 1985, majority parties controlling Congress have passed just 12 laws getting largely what they wanted on big policy priorities over the opposition of most members of the minority party and the minority party's top leaders.\n\nThat\u2019s less than 5% of all the majority-party policy priorities considered in more than 30 years.\n\nOf the 12 that have passed by rolling the minority party, two have been high profile and more recent, making it perhaps seem more common when it actually isn\u2019t: the Affordable Care Act of 2010, which Democrats pushed through with no GOP support, and the 2017 tax overhaul law, which got no Democratic votes.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have been chipping away at the health care law since it passed, eroding its effectiveness.\n\nExamples of bipartisan bills include two comprehensive energy bills in 2005 and 2007 and a 2015 spending bill that featured policies with big repercussions for energy and climate: lifting the 40-year-old ban on oil exports and extending wind and solar tax credits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to pass anything that\u2019s partisan. It\u2019s not happening more than it used to. It\u2019s something that needs to be understood by activists.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Frances Lee, University of Maryland professor\n\nEnter the Green New Deal, which features numerous lofty energy initiatives like a goal of 100% renewable electricity within 10 years (up from 17%), and other big non-energy policies, including a federal jobs guarantee and universal health care. More policy details are expected within the next week or so.\n\nDozens of congressional Democrats, including several presidential contenders, have expressed support for the idea. But no Republicans have, and even some more centrist Democrats have expressed concerns about it.\n\nBackers of this proposal, including The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led group pushing the policy along with Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, say the plan has to be done in one fell swoop, not piecemeal, given the urgency of climate change.\n\nMeanwhile, a carbon tax where the proceeds go back to consumers in the form of a dividend check is gaining support in pockets across the political spectrum. Bipartisan legislation was just introduced in the House, while some oil companies are beginning to fund a similar effort.\n\nTo varying degrees, these proposals preempt other climate regulations, and in at least one instance provide a legal shield for oil companies facing certain kinds of lawsuits.\n\nThese two aspects, which are drawing ire from environmentalists, reflect what the backers say is essential compromise to get legislation passed.\n\nFlashback: In 2009, when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House, backers of comprehensive climate legislation failed to get support from enough Democrats, let alone any Republicans. It passed the House but died in the Senate. Most elected Republicans have ignored or dismissed climate change since then, but that\u2019s slowly starting to change.\n\n\u201cJust look at how volatile, partisan and harsh the political environment in the legislative branch has become since the era of trying to do things with just one party,\u201d said Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida, who is the only Republican co-sponsoring the carbon tax bill introduced last week.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: As bipartisanship inches back to life in some corners on Capitol Hill, don\u2019t expect it to make a grand comeback until at least after 2020. Getting beyond partisanship is unlikely in what is shaping up to be a record-setting polarizing presidential election."

This can result in higher emergency room rates across the board.\n\nDetails: A Yale study last year, analyzing data from a large insurer, found that when one of the two largest ER staffing firms, EmCare, entered a hospital, total payments to the insurer increased by 122%.\n\nThe second firm, TeamHealth, used the threat of leaving a network to get 68% higher in-network rates. Overall, ER doctors' in-network rates were 266% of what Medicare pays, which is higher than most other specialists.\n\nThese higher-than-average rates are \"not an insignificant part of health system costs, and thus [increase] premiums,\" said Loren Adler of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy.\n\nHospitals can also benefit. \"If these docs want to bill [out-of-network], they have to compensate the hospital for the reputational cost of allowing surprise billing at their facility,\" Adler said.\n\nFor example, after EmCare entered a hospital, facility payments increased by 11%, the Yale study found.\n\nYes, but: \u201cThis is a specific niche of providers who have found this unethical, narrow wedge in the system where they can make significant amounts of money off the backs of patients,\" said Yale's Zach Cooper, an author of the study.\n\n\u2014 Bob Herman contributed to this report."

(We expect the Trump administration will target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's oil and offshore wealth in the coming weeks and try to divert that wealth to the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, whom Trump recognized last week as the interim president of Venezuela.)\n\nthat the Trump administration is planning to invade Venezuela, and my conversations with senior administration officials signal that the coming pressures to accelerate regime change are diplomatic and economic. (We expect the Trump administration will target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's oil and offshore wealth in the coming weeks and try to divert that wealth to the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, whom Trump recognized last week as the interim president of Venezuela.) But that doesn't mean we should ignore Trump's private comments to Graham, because he's pointedly made clear that \"all options\" remain on the table and this isn't the first time Trump has mentioned military intervention in Venezuela. He's wanted to move aggressively against the Maduro regime since his first year as president. In the summer of 2017 Trump alarmed Venezuela with talk of a \"military option.\" Trump's aides at the time talked him out of the idea.\n\nThe big picture: The Trump administration's approach to foreign policy has quietly but fundamentally changed. Gone are those who often fiercely disagreed with Trump's instincts: Jim Mattis, Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn and, at times, H.R. McMaster. Trump's new senior team \u2014 John Bolton, Mike Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan \u2014 backs his instincts on almost every issue. (Though, again, there are no signs they are pushing him towards a military action in Venezuela.)\n\nWe saw the new speed in Trump's foreign policy with his swift withdrawal from the Iran deal after Bolton took over as national security adviser, following months of slow-walking from Tillerson, Mattis and McMaster.\n\nAnd while it's still unclear how quickly Trump will withdraw U.S. troops from Syria \u2014 and to what extent a skeletal U.S. presence may remain \u2014 neither Bolton nor Pompeo treated the withdrawal as thered-line that Mattis considered it.\n\nVenezuela is another case study of the new speed of Trump's foreign policy. It's hard to say how the previous national security team would've reacted to January's events in Venezuela, but there were more voices of caution when the internal Venezuela debate raged in the first year of Trump's presidency.\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2017, according to senior administration officials, the National Security Council worked with the State Department and the Pentagon to develop an \"escalatory roadmap\" to game out how the White House should react each time Nicol\u00e1s Maduro committed a new atrocity.\n\nAccording to a former senior official who was intimately involved, Maduro quickly crossed all the roadmap's red lines: His regime killed protesters, arrested opposition leaders and stripped the parliament of its legislative powers. By the logic of the roadmap \u2014 which the president approved \u2014 they ought to have imposed an oil embargo against Venezuela, according to the official.\n\nBut Gary Cohn, Trump's then-White House economic adviser, and Tillerson argued strongly against this, with Cohn saying it would roil markets, raise gas prices and exacerbate Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian crisis. The result: no oil embargo.\n\nThe bottom line: Stymied at home, Trump is now moving faster than ever on foreign policy. Few, if any, in the White House believe Trump will accomplish much domestically in this Congress. But on foreign policy and national security \u2014 where he is most powerful \u2014 there are scant obstacles between what he wants and what he does.\n\nGo deeper:"

Wind chills on Wednesday morning in parts of Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota are likely to approach the minus 50s\u00b0F to minus 60s\u00b0F.

    "text": "Around 11 am, a senior White House official told me the internal planning was \"too fluid\" to report anything that would definitively still be true by 1:30 pm, when Trump was scheduled to make his announcement.\n\nIn short: Trump saw a Republican Senate poised to abandon him. Better to cave on his own terms, and in his own words, than watch both parties hang him out to dry.\n\n\"I can tell you exactly what happened,\u201d one Republican senator texted me. \u201cThe mood at Senate Republican lunch on Thursday resembled what the mood must've been on the Union lines at 4 pm at First Bull Run. I'm amazed only six [Republicans] voted for Schumer's bill. The message from that lunch by VP, Shahira [Knight] and Mitch [McConnell] to POTUS was, it's over. They'll be 70 votes within 48 hours.\"\n\nWhite House officials told me they knew their momentum was fading.\n\nBehind the scenes: By the day of the vote \u2014 Thursday \u2014 Jared Kushner and the White House team had an accurate whip count and knew their proposal would go down, but colleagues were still stunned that Kushner was ever optimistic about Trump's offer of short-term relief for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for wall funding.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, McConnell and Trump had two important phone calls. In one mid-afternoon call, McConnell told Trump that Schumer had bluntly rejected Trump's \"down-payment\" idea for the wall. In that conversation, Trump still sounded resolute about not reopening the government, two sources familiar with the conversation told me.\n\nBut by the two leaders\u2019 second call, around 7 pm, Trump seemed to have decided he would end the shutdown.\n\nBetween the two calls, there were Oval Office meetings involving Mike Pence, Mulvaney and Kushner. They gave the president several options, and he realized there was no easy way out of his self-imposed mess. That evening, he vacillated between reopening the government with a clean funding bill and declaring a national emergency.\n\nThe bottom line: What happened was predictable, and it's exactly what McConnell told Trump would happen. In a December conversation, before the shutdown, McConnell warned Trump that shutdowns never end well and never provide more leverage to their instigators, according to a source briefed on the conversation.\n\nThroughout their phone calls over the past four weeks, Trump would sometimes say to McConnell: \"I know this isn't your favorite thing, Mitch.\"\n\nGo deeper:"

    "text": "Graham laughed. \"And I said, 'I don't want to invade everybody, I only want to use the military when our national security interests are threatened.'\"\n\n\"Trump's really hawkish\" on Venezuela, the hawkish Graham added in a phone interview on Sunday afternoon, adding that Trump was even more hawkish than he was on Venezuela.\n\nTo be clear: There are no signs that the Trump administration is planning to invade Venezuela, and my conversations with senior administration officials signal that the coming pressures to accelerate regime change are diplomatic and economic. (We expect the Trump administration will target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's oil and offshore wealth in the coming weeks and try to divert that wealth to the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, whom Trump recognized last week as the interim president of Venezuela.)\n\nthat the Trump administration is planning to invade Venezuela, and my conversations with senior administration officials signal that the coming pressures to accelerate regime change are diplomatic and economic. (We expect the Trump administration will target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's oil and offshore wealth in the coming weeks and try to divert that wealth to the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, whom Trump recognized last week as the interim president of Venezuela.) But that doesn't mean we should ignore Trump's private comments to Graham, because he's pointedly made clear that \"all options\" remain on the table and this isn't the first time Trump has mentioned military intervention in Venezuela. He's wanted to move aggressively against the Maduro regime since his first year as president. In the summer of 2017 Trump alarmed Venezuela with talk of a \"military option.\" Trump's aides at the time talked him out of the idea.\n\nThe big picture: The Trump administration's approach to foreign policy has quietly but fundamentally changed. Gone are those who often fiercely disagreed with Trump's instincts: Jim Mattis, Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn and, at times, H.R. McMaster. Trump's new senior team \u2014 John Bolton, Mike Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan \u2014 backs his instincts on almost every issue. (Though, again, there are no signs they are pushing him towards a military action in Venezuela.)\n\nWe saw the new speed in Trump's foreign policy with his swift withdrawal from the Iran deal after Bolton took over as national security adviser, following months of slow-walking from Tillerson, Mattis and McMaster.\n\nAnd while it's still unclear how quickly Trump will withdraw U.S. troops from Syria \u2014 and to what extent a skeletal U.S. presence may remain \u2014 neither Bolton nor Pompeo treated the withdrawal as thered-line that Mattis considered it.\n\nVenezuela is another case study of the new speed of Trump's foreign policy. It's hard to say how the previous national security team would've reacted to January's events in Venezuela, but there were more voices of caution when the internal Venezuela debate raged in the first year of Trump's presidency.\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2017, according to senior administration officials, the National Security Council worked with the State Department and the Pentagon to develop an \"escalatory roadmap\" to game out how the White House should react each time Nicol\u00e1s Maduro committed a new atrocity.\n\nAccording to a former senior official who was intimately involved, Maduro quickly crossed all the roadmap's red lines: His regime killed protesters, arrested opposition leaders and stripped the parliament of its legislative powers. By the logic of the roadmap \u2014 which the president approved \u2014 they ought to have imposed an oil embargo against Venezuela, according to the official.\n\nBut Gary Cohn, Trump's then-White House economic adviser, and Tillerson argued strongly against this, with Cohn saying it would roil markets, raise gas prices and exacerbate Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian crisis. The result: no oil embargo.\n\nThe bottom line: Stymied at home, Trump is now moving faster than ever on foreign policy. Few, if any, in the White House believe Trump will accomplish much domestically in this Congress. But on foreign policy and national security \u2014 where he is most powerful \u2014 there are scant obstacles between what he wants and what he does.\n\nGo deeper:"

(Among those assets: Citgo, the giant oil refiner.) Venezuela has an enormous and fractious range of creditors , including not only bondholders but also sovereigns (Russia and China are the two big ones), as well as corporations that have won international arbitration proceedings against the country.\n\n, including not only bondholders but also sovereigns (Russia and China are the two big ones), as well as corporations that have won international arbitration proceedings against the country. All of those creditors have been waiting for the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro regime to come to an end. At that point they will start laying claim to Venezuela's assets, which ultimately include some 300 billion barrels in oil reserves. That's the largest store of oil in the world.\n\nIf the fight over Venezuela's debts were to be halted for a few years, that would give the Guaid\u00f3 regime, working with the IMF, time to get the domestic economy back on its feet. The debts racked up by the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro administrations will have to be dealt with at some point, but given the scale of Venezuela's humanitarian disaster, court fights in New York should not dominate Guaid\u00f3's priorities.\n\nThe solution to the debt problem is presented in an important paper by Lee Buchheit and Mitu Gulati. Buchheit, the doyen of sovereign debt restructurings, explains that the U.S. government can unilaterally call an effective standstill to court proceedings by declaring Venezuelan assets temporarily immune from attachment by U.S. courts.\n\nThe Obama administration did exactly that for Iraq in 2011, 2012 and 2013. All it took was an executive order from President Obama.\n\nin 2011, 2012 and 2013. All it took was an executive order from President Obama. Obama's executive order was a matter of national security. Today, the U.S. foreign-policy and national-security apparatus is focused on the Americas. Trump says that he \"will continue to use the full weight of United States economic and diplomatic power\" in Venezuela.\n\nThe bottom line: It is extremely rare for the U.S. government to prevent established legal mechanisms from running their natural course. But it can be done and has been done in the past. If Trump were to sign an executive order preventing creditors from attaching Venezuela's assets, that would be by far the greatest gift he could bequeath a fledgling Guaid\u00f3 administration.\n\nGo deeper:"

Mike Lee (Utah), Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin.\n\nReporters who attend the event agree not to identify donors without their permission.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: Koch, a Kansas industrialist whose last name became synonymous with right-wing political giving during the last administration, told donors at a Saturday night reception that the network had been successful in part because it had \"learned how to unite with people across the whole spectrum of viewpoints, different ideas, including those who have been adversaries in the past.\"\n\n\"This attitude of holding against others who have different beliefs is tearing our country apart,\" Koch said.\n\nAn evening event focused on the problem of political polarization featured Lee and Charles Koch's son Chase, viewed as a rising star in the network.\n\nEarlier in the day, officials said that they remained interested in many of the network\u2019s long-term policy goals, including aiding DREAMers and criminal justice reform.\n\nBut they declined to offer specific targets or plans. \"As we look at the broad work uniting different coalitions, we recognize it\u2019s a lot of work, and we\u2019re going to have to identify those opportunities as they come along,\" said James Davis, a spokesperson for the network.\n\nKoch network chief Brian Hooks said that it was \"in a position to take the next big step forward in our evolution,\" which in some cases would \"mean some pretty big changes\" to its approach.\n\nThe big picture: The changes come as the Koch groups, which vary from political to philanthropic, sometimes find themselves out of step with Trump on issues like trade.\n\nThe group didn't back Trump as a candidate in 2016, and it will do the same in 2020, according to the Washington Post. It will continue to be involved in races for other federal offices.\n\nSome of the network's donors, who for years funded a crusade against liberal policies like the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, reportedly wish it would back the president.\n\nDavis said that the Indian Wells event had record attendance this year, including 643 donors in total and 181 first-time contributors.\n\nYes, but: The network's plans for bipartisanship may face other headwinds.\n\nAlthough the groups have partnered with left-leaning organizations on issues like criminal justice and tech policy, many liberals have long pointed to the Koch operation as a negative example of money in politics.\n\nGo deeper: Koch network reportedly plans to stay out of 2020 presidential race"

A poorly redacted document filed by Manafort's attorneys this month shows that he allegedly lied\u2014 among other things \u2014 about sharing 2016 polling data with suspected Russian intelligence operative Konstantin Kilimnik. Manafort appeared in court at the same time as another Trump associate, Roger Stone, who was indicted by the Mueller investigation early Friday morning."

As trade conflict with China increased, Chinese energy imports from the U.S. fell to nearly zero at the end of 2018, which affected the U.S. tanker shipping industry and oil producers. Even if the trade war threat diminishes, it will be difficult to recoup lost market share in the face of competition from Russia and elsewhere.\n\nBy escalating the tit-for-tat trade war, President Trump has worked against America\u2019s energy interests, leaving domestic energy firms to struggle with a glut of oil and gas at home.\n\nWhat to watch: A high-level meeting between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been scheduled for Jan. 30\u201331. These talks are critical to avoiding the imposition of additional U.S. tariffs on March 1.\n\nThe bottom line: As the Trump administration looks ahead to the high-level negotiations, its team will need to focus on advancing a new bilateral agreement. Settling this bilateral trade dispute would also enhance the Trump administration's policy of energy dominance and benefit U.S. oil and gas producers that need the Chinese market to absorb excess domestic energy production.\n\nRichard D.

The Zeynabiyoun is an all-Pakistani militia group recruited from abroad and within Iran. Both militias were formally organized and announced several years into the Syrian War.\n\nIn addition to being deemed \"martyrs,\" members of the Fatemiyoun and Zeynabiyoun killed in action receive the same honorific that Iran\u2019s IRGC receive if killed in Syria: \"defender of the shrine,\" a reference to the Islamic Republic\u2019s sectarian religious mission.\n\nFamilies of fallen Fatemiyoun and Zeynabiyoun members have also received special attention from Iran's supreme leader and commander-in-chief, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe big picture: In an ongoing evolution of its use of proxy forces, Iran is marshaling zealous and disaffected Shiites from South Asia to fight for its larger ideological and strategic goals in Syria. While Tehran has traditionally relied on Arab Shiites to engage in terror attacks or subvert governments, the Fatemiyoun and Zeynabiyoun are serving a different purpose \u2014 helping Iran support the allied Syrian government.\n\nThe bottom line: Washington is continuing to rely on coercive economic measures as its chief policy tool against Tehran. Some in the administration framed the designation as but one move in the larger \"maximum pressure\" campaign. But given that the vast array of Iran-linked Shiite militias in Iraq have not yet been targeted, the move also signals that, at least for now, the \"pushback\" against militias is limited.\n\nBehnam Ben Taleblu is a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies"

The seminar lasted 4 days, a duration that is a clear sign of the intensity of concerns.\n\nWhy it matters: Xi's ability to convene and chair this meeting should be seen a sign of his strength in the party, not weakness.
