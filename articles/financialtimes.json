    "authors": [],
    "text": "Copenhagen startup Airtame cites a report that 10 per cent of time in meetings can be swallowed up by tech issues. In my experience, it\u2019s more; the anguished fiddling with leads as the host company tries to make it possible for visitors to show their presentation on a TV screen has replaced the vintage school scenario of the befuddled teacher trying to make the overhead projector work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I reviewed Airtame\u2019s first product, a dongle like a Google Chromecast that plugs into a meeting-room TV and enables anyone on (almost) any portable device to \u201cthrow\u201d sound and vision onto the screen. It was effective, but setup and functionality were tricky. Well, Airtame shipped 120,000 units, it says, to organisations ranging from businesses and schools to sports teams, artists and a 12th-century church. And now it has a substantially improved model, Airtame 2, which has greatly boosted functionality. It\u2019s easier to set up and more stable, and these great Danes have cleverly added a way for screens that aren\u2019t in use to double as digital signage. This is such a good product I\u2019m intrigued to see what Airtame 3 is like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFE92"

    "authors": [

    ],
    "text": "No Brexit!\n\nWelcome to Westminster and the heart of British politics. We're on the march to put Brexit back to the British people in a second referendum. Hundreds of thousands of people have turned up.\n\nBut what are the folks on this march actually trying to achieve? Because with just a few weeks to go until the UK is set to leave the EU, there's still not enough support in that place over there, the House of Commons, for MPs to change their mind. So let's go and find out what these people are hoping to achieve.\n\nExcuse me, ladies, sorry to bother you. I'm a journalist from the Financial Times. I just wanted to ask why you've come on the vote today and what you're hoping to achieve?\n\nBecause I want peace, friendship, and co-operation.\n\nWe all want those things. What's that got to do the people's vote?\n\nBecause we get it by belonging to the EU.\n\nAnd how do you think we're actually going to get that referendum, as we're due to leave in a couple of weeks anyway?\n\nWell, we'll get it by people force. And that's why we're out here today.\n\nSo you think you can change the minds of MPs?\n\nWe hope so.\n\nThey've not listened so far.\n\nNo, but they are beginning to consider other options.\n\nI want it for the future of my grandchildren.\n\nWhat do we want?\n\nRevoke!\n\nWhen do we want it?\n\nNow!\n\nNo Brexit!\n\nNo Brexit!\n\nRevoke Article 50!\n\nActually, I'd rather like them to revoke Article 50.\n\nDo you think that's going to happen though?\n\nI'm quietly confident. Quietly confident and optimistic.\n\nEven though MPs...\n\nBecause if not, it's too depressing to contemplate.\n\nTo stop Brexit.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, simple as that. We don't want Brexit to happen. The whole of the vote was based on lies. Now we know what... we've got better picture. I mean, where do you start, the government's doing a dreadful, dreadful job. Jeremy Corbyn is shit. The people need to have their voices heard. It's as simple as that.\n\nDo you think people knew what they were voting for in 2016?\n\nNo, they didn't. No, they didn't. It was too binary, it was too binary. We didn't know...\n\nBut another vote would be binary as well.\n\nYes, but we know what we're voting for this time. We vote on Theresa May's dreadful idea, or we vote to remain, or we vote for another one.\n\nKeep the Front out!\n\nThe last referendum three years ago is not representative of the views today.\n\nHow so?\n\nBecause it's been a long time. Voters have changed, opinions have changed as the facts have come available. And I think that we need another chance to say what we feel.\n\nWhat do we want?\n\nRevoke!\n\nWhen do we want it!\n\nNow!\n\nHey, hey, hey, Theresa May, we demand a final say!\n\nThe march has stopped in front of Downing Street right here. And as you can see, the protesters are trying to send a message to the prime minister.\n\nWe're really angry at the mess Mrs May's making of this as well. And this is about the last straw.\n\nIt was always going to be difficult, though. You can't necessarily blame her for it all. Do you not think?\n\nNo, no, not entirely her. Her party and the government as well.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut they've made a pretty terrible batch of it.\n\nBut how are you actually going to get that referendum, because we're due to leave in a few weeks.\n\nYep.\n\nWell, hopefully, in parliament in the few days ahead. I mean, we can't go on as we are. It's ridiculous.\n\nI think it's the last avenue left to us to show that everything is broken, and that our parliament is broken, and that we just really need a better way.\n\nHow confident are you of getting that second vote, because we're due to leave in a couple of weeks?\n\nDon't know, but we're here. That's all we can do.\n\nHow are you hoping to persuade the folks over there, who don't seem very willing for a second referendum?\n\nIt's a difficult thing. All we can do is apply public pressure and show that it is not a one-way street. And that people do care about this and people very strongly want to remain. Bollocks to Brexit!\n\nOne of the ironies of Brexit is the UK's never really had a strong Europhile moment. And it has emerged just at the point where we're about to leave the EU. It's clear from the folks that I've spoken to on the people's vote march that they don't quite have a plan to make sure we do have a second referendum. But they want to have their voices heard. The big question for British politics, now, is all this the beginning of something or the end of it?"

Some of the best things to buy here are textiles \u2013 shawls, block-printed fabrics and made-to-measure clothing. Kashmir Loom, stocked at Jaipur Modern, produces excellent Kani work \u2013 an amazing weave pattern. The other great resource is Andraab, specialists in super-fine wool and cashmere shawls. For a more hippie vibe, try Anokhi. It specialises in hand-printed fabrics, and has a little caf\u00e9 which does delicious fresh pomegranate juice. And in the Narain Niwas Palace hotel \u2013 I live in the gatehouse \u2013 you\u2019ll find Hot Pink, a boutique that Gem Palace founder Munnu Kasliwaand I started years ago, and is now run by his son; it stocks clothing by Indian designer Pero, children\u2019s things, bags, scarves and block-printed shirts. Andraab, Hotel Narain Niwas Palace, Narayan Singh Road, Rambagh (+91141-257 0110; andraab.com). Anokhi, C 11, KK Square, Prithviraj Road, C Scheme, Ashok Nagar (+91141-400 7245; anokhi.com). Hot Pink, Hotel Narain Niwas Palace, Narayan Singh Road, Rambagh (+91141-256 8932; hotpinkindia.com). Jaipur Modern, 51 Sardar Patel Marg, Panch Batti, Dhuleshwar Garden (+91141-411 2000; jaipurmodern.com).\n\nIdli is one of the best shops for home decor \u2013 painted tables, printed fabrics inspired by chinoiserie \u2013 all designed by Thierry Journo. Anantaya is another; it\u2019s also in the garden of the Narain Niwas Palace, and sells handmade papers and oil lamps \u2013 and it\u2019s co-run by a Tom Dixon collaborator, so the aesthetic is lovely. Real antiques are scarce; there just aren\u2019t many historic rugs, gems or ceramics left. One exception is Saroj Art & Antiques, with its great selection of old photographs, Raja Ravi Varma prints, textiles and china. Anantaya, Hotel Narain Niwas Palace, Narayan Singh Road, Rambagh (+91931-489 4104; anantayadecor.com). Idli, Hotel Narain Niwas Palace, Narayan Singh Road, Rambagh (+91141-257 0400; idlidesign.com). Saroj Art & Antiques, A-2 Tilak Marg, Nandnam Apartments, C Scheme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJaipur markets are especially vibrant: the Johari Bazaar in the old city is a must. You\u2019ll find a little lane devoted entirely to weddings, while just opposite, the kitchen bazaar has all things stainless steel: art, doorknobs, tiffin boxes \u2013 it\u2019s a very fun atmosphere. The main market is also a great place to see traditional chikan work \u2013 white-on-white embroidery. And the Tripolia Bazaar is a wonderful sight in the early morning, when women sit out and make the ritual marigold necklaces. The Kitchen at Jaipur Modern, which is a great spot for quinoa or a pizza, also sells beautiful handicrafts, so you can shop after you\u2019ve eaten. The Kitchen at Jaipur Modern, 51 Sardar Patel Marg, Panch Batti, Dhuleshwar Garden (+91141-411 2000; jaipurmodern.com).\n\nThe Gem Palace is a must-see: the showroom is full of heirloom pieces from the royal family and precious stones. In general, if you aren\u2019t in the business, it\u2019s difficult to buy rare stones, so stick to reputable experts. And go for classic Indian jewellery: flat-cut diamonds set in Jaipur enamel and 24ct gold, or Navaratna, the \u201cnine gems\u201d. These can be anything from a simple bracelet to an opulent, incredibly expensive necklace. The Gem Palace, 348 MI Road (+91982-934 0722; munnuthegempalace.com).\n\nPeople often ask about buying saris, which I think are difficult to carry off as a foreigner \u2013 Indian women hold themselves very straight \u2013 but I do highly recommend Rajasthani skirts embellished with gold embroidery for an evening out. One of the best places for them is Sattva Sarees, where I bought a skirt made from a 1940s-style ikat that is a hit in Paris whenever I wear it. Rasa is another, for printed silk tops and dresses; its quilts, a speciality of Jaipur, are magnificent. Rasa, Jaipur S-55, Ashok Marg, C Scheme, Ashok Nagar (+91141-403 8584; rasajaipur.com).

    "title": "Brexit: why Theresa May now sees no-deal as second-best option",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Theresa May sat alone while European leaders decided the timing of Britain's departure from the European Union. Here with me is Robert Shrimsley to explain what looks like a decidedly dicey deal. Robert, when is Britain going to leave?\n\nIt's still very much up in the air, Lionel. The European Union has given Britain two new dates for departure. The first is April the 12th, if Theresa May cannot get her deal through, possibly next week. And the second is May 22, if she does get her deal through. And that's the amount of time it needs to put the mechanics in place.\n\nSo we're still very, very much up in the air. We were hurtling towards the cliff edge a couple of days ago.\n\nThat's crashing out.\n\nYes.\n\nWith no-deal.\n\nYou know, we were eight days from the cliff edge with no-deal looking a serious possibility. No-deal is still definitely an option. But the date has pushed back a little bit.\n\nSo we've got a couple more weeks. But at the moment, of course, this is a very fluid situation. But Mrs May's deal looks, it's against the odds, isn't it, of passage?\n\nIt's very hard to see, as things stand, how she gets this deal through. It's an amazing reversal in the last seven days of her position. Seven days ago, she had a strategy. And the strategy was to squeeze her own Brexit hardliners and say, look, it's running away from us. If you don't vote for my deal, we're going to get a soft Brexit or a delay. And that was beginning to work. They were beginning to crack.\n\nIn the space of a couple of days at the beginning of this week, she has flipped her strategy on its head, if indeed she still has a strategy. She's now appeasing her hardliners and essentially trying to frighten the rest of parliament into backing her deal for fear of a no-deal exit.\n\nAnd should we blame the Speaker, John Bercow, for citing a 1604 precedent, whereby you can't just keep coming back with the same deal for approval in the House of Commons?\n\nI think there were four decisive steps to the way Theresa May turned. And that was one of them.\n\nThe week before, MPs had failed yet again to seize control of the parliamentary timetable. And she looked at them and thought, you guys are never going to get your act together on an alternative deal. The next day, nearly 200 of her own MPs voted against an extension of Article 50.\n\nThen John Bercow's ruling came up, stopped her from putting the meaningful vote again before the European summit. And then finally, her own cabinet turned on her and said, we cannot support a long delay. And the chief whip advised her clearly that the party would be broken if she tried to force through a long delay. And I think Theresa May has essentially changed position. She now believes that a no-deal Brexit is the second best option after her own deal.\n\nSo let's just assume that her deal is voted down, obviously, speculation. Does she then have to resign?\n\nIt's very difficult to see how she can stay on, and indeed, why she would want to. Because she has said she does not want to oversee a long delay. And the only alternative to a long delay, if her deal falls, is no deal. I think she might be prepared to carry that through.\n\nBut what will happen in parliament is that MPs are going to give themselves the chance to vote on alternative options. The staying in the single market, the so-called Norway option, permanent customs union, second referendum, all the other options. If one of those were to get a majority in parliament, and it has to be said, MPs have proved very inept at solidifying...\n\nAnd there isn't a cross-party movement either.\n\nIf one of them were to get a majority, I think, and her policy's been voted down, it's very hard to see how she can stay on or why she would want to.\n\nAnd what happens then? Does the deputy prime minister step in? Or do we have to have a leadership election?\n\nNo. I mean, the Conservatives, unlike the Labour party, don't have an official deputy. So although David Lidington is often referred to as the de facto deputy, it's de facto, not de jure. And the way it works is that she would say she was resigning as prime minister but would stay on as prime minister until such time as the Conservatives choose another leader. So she would be unfettered but also without any power. It would be very, very messy.\n\nThe one thing that could happen, I suppose, is that parliament votes to attach the future direction to her deal. In the political declaration they say, we now want that to say it's Norway, or it's permanent customs union, and then we'll vote through your deal. Or it could say, we'll vote through your deal if we can attach a referendum to it. So at that point, she might think it was worth just staying on a bit longer to take it over the line. But it's very, very messy, very difficult.\n\nAnd finally, the other point is that it's very hard to see how a government not committed to a policy of this importance could then legislate it through. The Tories don't believe in the Norway option, so how could they actually take that through? You could well then be heading for an election.\n\nSo Robert, I'm going to put you on the spot. It's not a football question. Are we likely to have an early election, general election?\n\nI think the odds of an election sometime this year are going up all of the time. Most paths lead to an election. The only one that I think doesn't is if MPs solidify around her deal, which, as we've said, does not look very likely at the moment.\n\nRobert Shrimsley, thank you very much."

      "The Chart Doctor"
    ],
    "text": "It always pays to be aware of a chart\u2019s limitations, even useful ones. Take the iconic yield curve, a chart that shows the yields of government bonds of varying maturities. Analysts use the shape of the curve to gauge market expectations. It might even help predict recessions.\n\nBut with yields changing on a daily basis, showing how the curve evolves over time is not easy. That is because the conventional chart type for showing time series, a line chart, uses the horizontal axis to show time running from left to right. On the yield curve, that axis is occupied by each bond\u2019s maturity date.\n\nInstead, analysts often chart the \u201cspread\u201d \u2014 the percentage point difference between two bonds (typically 2-year and 10-year). This produces a useful summary of the cyclical peaks and troughs of market expectations and how they might relate to recessions, but it also throws away a lot of information from the underlying yield curve.\n\nFor example, we can no longer see what the actual yields are \u2014 have they been high or low? \u2014 and there is always the risk that the particular spread chosen might not be representative of the shape of the entire curve. And how much does the curve change on a daily basis anyway?\n\nIn 2015, Gregor Aisch and Amanda Cox of the New York Times addressed this problem by rendering the yield curve in 3D. It is a great interactive graphic that shows the yield curve in a new light.\n\nAnimation is another approach worth investigating \u2014 after all, using time itself to represent time seems logical. A rapid daily animation of the yield curve shows a month\u2019s worth of data in half a second, a year in around six seconds. Tiny daily oscillations in the curve are now visible alongside more significant monthly and annual movement.\n\nOne problem with animation is that, with data changing so fast, it becomes difficult to remember key moments in the yield curve\u2019s progression. Adding \u201cmemory lines\u201d with text annotations of the curve\u2019s \u201cpeak inversions\u201d allows us to directly compare the yield curve at different points in time.\n\nExtending the animation, to show how the yield curve has changed on a daily basis since 1979 to the present day, results in a video just over three minutes long. It is compelling, but over such a duration, almost eerily silent.\n\nOf course, we could choose to add a Hans Rosling-style commentary \u2014 but could we use the data itself to produce a soundtrack?\n\nThe process of turning spreadsheets into sound is known as data sonification, the aural equivalent of data visualisation. And it might just be the next big thing in data presentation.\n\nWith our animation, the first challenge is to map the bond yields (the y-axis of the chart) to musical pitches.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to think in terms of orthodox musical scales (\u201crecession in C minor\u201d, \u201cthe great bear run in F# major\u201d), our \u201cmusic\u201d ideally needs to preserve equal spacing between pitch in the same way as tick marks preserve distance on the chart\u2019s y-axis. The more unusual whole tone scale \u2014 beloved of Debussy \u2014 ensures that our data will be proportionally spaced in pitch. The scale was also used last year by Berliner Morgenpost to sonify SDP party polling data.\n\nMapping a whole tone scale over four octaves gives 24 evenly-spaced notes with which we can sonify the yield curve data.\n\nNext up is the challenge of how to arrange the notes. In musical terms, the yield curve visually resembles an arpeggio \u2014 a sequence of notes in which one is played after the other, rather than a chord, where all the notes are played simultaneously.\n\nWith the yield curve arpeggiating, regular, flat and inverted shapes are represented by ascending, flat and descending sequences of musical notes.\n\nPlaying each day of data as an arpeggio would require us to slow down the animation dramatically to identify individual notes. Instead, we can trigger an arpeggio sequence every 30 days while maintaining the same rapid rate of animation for the visual. The monotony of barely-changing daily tones is replaced by much greater melodic movement.\n\nFor orchestration, a marimba\u2019s pitch range is perfect for our four octave scale \u2014 though one of the advantages of controlling sound in the digital domain through data is that it gives the option of unlimited remixes.\n\nA bass drum synchronised to the month and vocal samples that \u201csing\u201d the year allow us to track the changing yield curve over time. A repeating delay on the vocal sample repeats quarterly to indicate progress through the year. The relative level of yields (high/low), the shape of the yield curve (regular/flat/inverted), and the progress of time become encoded in sonic form.\n\nAdding a sound effect to denote our \u201cpeak inversion\u201d annotations provides a final join between the visual and aural worlds, completing our transformation of the yield curve.\n\nSonification has tremendous potential to not only support and reinforce visuals, but to take data to new audiences.\n\nChancey Fleet is assistive technology co-ordinator at New York\u2019s Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library. She has a particular interest in accessible technology and how it can bring data into the everyday life of those who, like herself, cannot directly see data visualisations.\n\nWatching Ms Fleet listen to the yield curve and sketch its shape on her tactile drawing tablet provides a tantalising glimpse of what sonification might be able to do for blind or visually impaired users.\n\nShe immediately suggests an improvement: a \u201csonic legend\u201d to provide a primer on interpreting the data. And while sensible audio defaults are a good starting point, sonification is something users should be able to personalise.\n\nBut, overall, she considers the experimental yield-curve music to be a promising approach that allows her to parse information from a complex time series of over 100,000 data points.\n\nI sonified the yield curve by writing code and using specialist music software. But for this technique to truly take off into the everyday, it needs to be publicly accessible. A new open source tool funded by Google\u2019s Digital News Initiative promises to do just that.\n\nTo coincide with New York Open Data 2019 week, NYC-based Datavized has released TwoTone, an interactive tool for making music with data. The company has already explored virtual and augmented reality, but according to co-founder Hugh McGrory, the first mass adoption of immersive data storytellingwill be in audio \u201cbecause the barrier to entry is zero \u2014 everybody already has a pair of headphones\u201d.\n\nAccording to Mr McGrory, pre-release testing of TwoTone saw everything from \u201cmillennials chair dancing to music made from spreadsheets\u201d, to intense interest from cyber security outfits keen to listen to data in real time.\n\nSome might be inclined to dismiss sonification as a novelty, but a new generation of screenless devices with voice interfaces, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa, marks the end of silent interaction with computers. It is perhaps naive to think that data will continue to just be seen and not heard.\n\nThe tools behind the musical yield curve\n\nHistorical yield curve data are freely available from the US Treasury. The data animation was created using the open source data visualisation library D3.js, with WebMidi.js generating simultaneous MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) note messages. Apple\u2019s Logic Pro X was used for sound generation."

    "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of the average metropolitan millennial. You\u2019re moving ahead in your career, getting closer to the day you\u2019ll finally own your own home and perhaps considering whether to start a pension or investment Isa.\n\nYou might think you\u2019ve got to the stage where you need the services of an independent financial adviser (IFA) \u2014 but would they take on a client like you?\n\nAll too often, the answer is no. As many young professionals can attest, we simply don\u2019t have enough money \u2014 yet \u2014 to make it worth the industry\u2019s while.\n\nIt is possible to argue that my generation is in greater need of financial advice than those before us. We have to contend with the shadow of student debt, a collapse in home ownership and higher levels of self-employment as wages stutter.\n\nYet call up an IFA, and your youthful voice will be interpreted as the sound of a client with very little money and very few assets. Unless you have a high salary, large inheritance or are at the outset of a potentially lucrative career, it\u2019s unlikely the adviser will be able to make money out of you. Even if they did take you on, it\u2019s equally unlikely that you would be able to afford their fees.\n\nHelp is at hand. There is a crop of new, digitally delivered services attempting to bridge the \u201cadvice gap\u201d \u2014 and some of these ideas are so innovative, slick and affordable, they might cause the traditional advice profession to fear for its future.\n\nBridging the advice gap\n\nAs the author of the Young Money blog, I was recently invited by Nucleus, a digital platform used by 800 IFAs, to travel around the UK to speak to different firms and see if we could bridge the generational divide.\n\nStarting in the City of London, it didn\u2019t begin well. I kept hearing that millennials were spending too much and saving too little, and that financial advice for most young people \u2014 bar the Kylie Jenners of this world \u2014 was a complete non-starter.\n\nWe might not have millions now \u2014 but surely some advisers might be prepared to take us on as clients?\n\nAfter working for 15 years, David Gibson, a 34-year-old physiotherapist, has his own home and some spare cash to invest. But he doesn\u2019t know what to do with it, despite extensive online research.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know who to trust long term for financial advice,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I would really like is someone to look at my overall individual circumstances and say \u2018this is what you should do\u2019.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Financial Conduct Authority, only 6 per cent of 18-34-year-olds took financial advice in 2017. A separate study by Schroders found that in the same year, half of all IFAs turned away clients with less than \u00a350,000 to invest.\n\nCarefree youngsters have never been a core market for the UK\u2019s \u00a34.5bn financial advice industry, whose bread and butter is the complex business of investments, estate planning and pensions.\n\nA huge regulatory shake-up of the way the advice industry can charge for its services is partly to blame. Six years ago, regulators outlawed commission-driven sales of seemingly \u201cfree\u201d products.\n\nThe hope was that advisers would move away from their traditional charging model. Most now take a percentage cut of assets under management \u2014 known in the industry as the ad valorem model \u2014 even though only 6 per cent of people say they want to pay this way, according to research by advisory firm Drewberry. This model immediately makes younger, asset-light clients a less appealing prospect.\n\nLike most people of her age group, Anna Dawson, a self-employed casting director, has never sought financial advice. The 28-year-old rents in Edinburgh and relocated from London to save for her first home on her own, a process she describes as \u201cslow and hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have never thought about [financial advice] because I can\u2019t afford it. If I don\u2019t work in a month, savings have to be put towards rent.\u201d\n\nHer experience underlines the challenge that financial advisers will face in finding their \u201cnext generation\u201d of clients.\n\nBuying a home and settling down might have been our parents\u2019 triggers for seeking financial advice but rising house prices and changing lifestyles mean our generation is pressing the pause button \u2014 sometimes indefinitely.\n\nWith more young people working in the \u201cgig economy\u201d, irregular incomes from freelance working play havoc with our ability to save regularly into pensions and Isas. The extent of our problems means financial decisions are often easier to ignore. A recent BuzzFeed article about \u201cerrand paralysis\u201d went viral, highlighting a very millennial aversion to workaday tasks, especially if they\u2019re IRL (in real life).\n\nBut there are digitally driven services out there that not only want our business, but think they can convince millennials that saving and investing is not as anxiety-inducing as they may fear.\n\nRobo solutions\n\nAs a young, unmarried millennial, managing most of my life and finances online, I find my biggest financial priorities are meeting freelance deadlines and keeping alive my new money plant from B&Q (ominously, the last one did not survive for long). With the amount of digital fintech services available today, the need to find an old-fashioned adviser does not seem pressing.\n\nThe millennium ushered in an online finance boom. DIY investing platforms brought money management to the masses, though you needed serious chutzpah to invest successfully on your own.\n\nThe next level is investing using a smartphone and \u201crobo advice\u201d, which, bizarrely, involves neither robots nor advice (as you and I understand it, anyway). Online digital wealth managers such as Nutmeg and Moneyfarm will invite wannabe investors to submit their investment time horizon and feelings about risk, suggesting the best ready-made investment fund for them. Sometimes, \u00a31 is all you need to get started.\n\nThis approach is a boon for overwhelmed millennials who just want to get invested and get on with their lives. It\u2019s why the Moneybox app has been a game changer. It deploys Richard Thaler\u2019s Nobel Prize-winning \u201cnudge theory\u201d to round up the digital spare change from investors\u2019 purchases \u2014 meaning the cost of a \u00a32.90 coffee can be rounded up to \u00a33, and the 10p difference invested in a portfolio of eye-catching stocks including Apple and Disney.\n\nThe investment algorithms are the \u201crobots\u201d, but at a basic level, the \u201cadvice\u201d they provide is which of their funds best suits your self-diagnosis. The FCA last year warned that there was \u201cscope for a mis-selling scandal\u201d if poorly-designed robo-advice models put people into unsuitable funds, or gave guidance masquerading as advice.\n\nThis is a very important difference. An IFA can give you what\u2019s called whole-of-market financial advice \u2014 meaning they can advise you on many different potential investments and recommend one that\u2019s best for your individual circumstances.\n\nA strictly regulated sector, you can\u2019t claim to offer financial advice unless you pass strict exams, meet certain criteria and have the necessary permission. It\u2019s one reason why the old Money Advice Service had to be rebranded recently as the Money and Pensions Service, such was the uproar among IFAs. And the regulatory burden helps explain why whole-of-market financial advice is so costly.\n\nEven if we could afford it, would the old-fashioned model be right for us?\n\nMax Rofagha: '[Young people] tend to have fairly similar, rather straightforward financial set-ups'\n\nFinimize, a financial information app, was founded by 31-year-old Max Rofagha in the belief that most millennials don\u2019t need financial advice. Young people, he says, \u201ctend to have fairly similar, rather straightforward financial set-ups. Most haven\u2019t bought a house yet, most aren\u2019t married or divorced yet: their situation is simpler than somebody who is older.\u201d\n\nStarved of financial education but drowning in online resources, most millennials just need a push in the right direction, Mr Rofagha believes. To this end, Finimize sends cheeky, emoji-packed emails every day to more than 300,000 subscribers, explaining what\u2019s going on in world markets in a way that\u2019s engaging and fun. A typical subject line \u2014 \u201cHow do you spell recession?\u201d Currently free, Finimize could, in time, become a paid subscription service.\n\nFinimize threatens what Mr Rofagha calls the \u201cinformation asymmetry\u201d that has sustained the financial advice industry for decades \u2014 namely, that financial matters are so complex you must pay a middleman to explain them to you. However, he also reckons young people will outgrow the mysterious \u201cblack box\u201d of robo advice.\n\n\u201cThe financial industry has been clinging to this model of complexity and opacity,\u201d he says. \u201cMillennials want to have a clear understanding of what\u2019s happening with their money.\u201d\n\nThis is why Finimize articles provide links to an array of investment options. Sure, robo advisers are on there \u2014 but so are cryptocurrency platforms such as eToro and stock-trading apps such as Freetrade. In fact, ultra-risky cryptocurrency is very popular, dominating the league table of users\u2019 reviews, despite Bitcoin\u2019s price plunging by about 80 per cent in the past year.\n\nIs there a danger that by making their own financial choices, younger investors are taking on too much risk?\n\nLast week, FT Money reported on the rising interest in crowdfunding by young investors, even though very few businesses have ever returned cash to investors.\n\nHayley Ard, a 32-year-old manager at King's College London\u2019s Entrepreneurship Institute and a Finimize user, drew on what she learnt from Finimize\u2019s investment packs and ended up buying an Innovative Finance Isa.\n\nShe chose peer-to-peer lender RateSetter, which is currently offering a 4 per cent return and a bonus of \u00a3150 for customers who keep \u00a310,000 or more invested for one year.\n\nShe says: \u201cA lot of people are priced out of financial advice unless it is a big decision. There are so many options now that democratise information.\u201d\n\nWhile her choice isn\u2019t without risk \u2014 peer-to-peer lending isn\u2019t covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and returns can be affected by borrower defaults \u2014 she\u2019s satisfied that she doesn\u2019t need financial advice. For now.\n\nAdvice, please\n\nNevertheless, some young investors still want a greater level of support with financial decisions. One brave online app \u2014 Multiply \u2014 is determined to provide free financial advice targeting young, self-employed professionals with an average income of \u00a339,000. Wait \u2014 how is this even possible?\n\nFor now, Multiply only offers \u201cguidance\u201d, but is hopeful it will soon be able to provide \u201cpersonalised and regulated\u201d financial advice later this year, FCA permitting.\n\nVivek Madlani, its co-founder, says Multiply is a lecture-free zone. \u201cYoung people are fed up with being branded irresponsible,\u201d he says. \u201cOur users are saving for goals and looking to the future to start families. They don\u2019t want to be slapped down for how much they\u2019re spending on flat whites or Asos.\n\n\u201cThey want advice to be non-judgmental, tailored to income, earnings and lifestyle. And they want it in a monthly rhythm, rather than getting a traditional financial plan which gets checked maybe once a year.\u201d\n\nVivek Madlani: 'Young people...don\u2019t want to be slapped down for how much they\u2019re spending on flat whites or Asos' \u00a9 Multiply\n\nThe traditional advisory profession will be watching Multiply\u2019s progress with a degree of nervousness. But it is not the only financial firm to see potential in the youth advice market.\n\nOne wealth management firm has set up an intriguing offshoot \u2014 run by young people, for young people.\n\nNeon Financial Planning has a slick website showcasing a range of fixed-fee services including a free financial health check, financial coaching at \u00a3100 for half an hour and access to a \u201cMoney Info\u201d app at \u00a340 a month. A full financial review costs \u00a3750.\n\nAll of these are clearly labelled as generic guidance, while \u201cregulated personal recommendations\u201d on investments or pensions are typically charged at 0.3 per cent of the sum invested, but will be spelt out in pounds.\n\n\u201cTraditional IFAs are 50-plus men, a lot of their clients are 50-plus. That is going to end at some point,\u201d says Neon\u2019s co-founder Jon Page. \u201cThe way these businesses are set up means younger people are not profitable to them, and don\u2019t look like a business opportunity. But I think they are. A lot of generational wealth is coming down to these people and somebody has to look after them.\u201d\n\nKeep it in the family\n\nTraditional financial advice is unaffordable for most young people. But unless the advice profession adapts to our growing digital demands, it could also become irrelevant.\n\nMr Page may be right to play the long game. Over the next 30 years, millennials will inherit an estimated \u00a35.5tn from baby-boomers, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research.\n\nEven if their parents\u2019 money is looked after by a 50-something in a suit, there is no guarantee that millennials will prolong their custom.\n\nResearch by Kings Court Trust shows a quarter of inheritance beneficiaries are already walking away from their parents\u2019 or grandparents\u2019 IFAs, typically taking \u00a3288,000 with them. Reasons given range from distance \u2014 both physical and personal \u2014 to a growing confidence that younger people can manage money for themselves.\n\nPimfa, the association for personal investment management and financial advice, has been looking into how it can \u201cforge long-term relationships with future inheritors, wealth builders and auto-enrollees\u201d \u2014 namely the 4.4m millennials who are now saving automatically into workplace pensions.\n\nKey recommendations include talking to existing clients about their family\u2019s needs, allowing younger clients to invest lower amounts, with \u201cclearly defined products and prices\u201d and finding new ways to dispense nuggets of financial wisdom \u2014 both online and at events.\n\nSheena Gillett at Pimfa says its research forum found that young people are still big fans of \u201chuman interaction and relationship-building\u201d \u2014 something Mr Page agrees with.\n\n\u201cPeople still value the human touch,\u201d he agrees. \u201cGoing on a financial website, answering a few automated questions, getting your card debited \u2014 it can be a bit scary.\u201d\n\nEven the robo advisers recognise that, once in a while, it\u2019s good to talk. Nutmeg now offers a personalised service, including a 15-minute phone call, for \u00a3350. A step-up from guidance, this is known as \u201crestricted advice\u201d as the conversation is strictly limited to Nutmeg\u2019s own products and portfolios. However, IFAs should note Nutmeg\u2019s \u201cwoke\u201d credentials \u2014 it\u2019s the first UK wealth manager to provide environmental, social and governance scores for all 10 of its ready-made portfolios.\n\nLisa Caplan, Nutmeg\u2019s head of financial advice, says: \u201cIf we find that investing isn\u2019t right for you \u2014 for example, if you have debts that you should pay off \u2014 we will advise you to do that without charge.\u201d\n\nScalable Capital also offers a free initial consultation over the phone, charging \u00a3200 for restricted advice on its range of investments.\n\nMeanwhile, new Canadian import Wealthsimple says it offers the same level of restricted advice as Nutmeg and Scalable over the phone or email \u2014 only for free. Could this be a sign of things to come?\n\nOn my trip around the UK, I met a lot of friendly and professional advisers who were willing to help the younger generation. But the sticking points are cost, convenience and time. The solution looks to be a clever combination of apps, investment platforms and a sympathetic ear once in a while. Although some advice on keeping money plants alive wouldn\u2019t go amiss."

    "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nWomen are a growing segment of watch buyers, yet dated ideas about what female consumers want mean they remain a woefully underserved market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely changed \u2014 the stereotypical idea that men buy watches for women is dead,\u201d says John Guy, luxury analyst at Mainfirst Bank in London, who adds that women account for nearly a third of Swiss luxury watch sales.\n\nCartier\u2019s quartz model of a 1904 men\u2019s wristwatch, made for Brazilian aviator pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont, was this year reissued in steel and gold, but this time elegantly thinner with an interchangeable steel or leather wristband.\n\nThe Santos-Dumont is among a new generation of unisex watches issued by brands in response to the rising spending power of women, and their desire for larger dials, more automatic timepieces and fashion collaborations.\n\n\u201cPerceptions of femininity and masculinity are evolving, conventions are moving, while women\u2019s wealth is growing worldwide,\u201d says Arnaud Carrez, marketing director at Cartier International. The Richemont-owned brand derives around half of its watch sales from women, Mr Carrez says, far ahead of the industry norm.\n\nA women\u2019s watch was dainty and small . . . The reality is that\u2019s not what today\u2019s woman is looking for\n\nThe rise over recent years in the number of women buying watches for themselves has not only helped the industry better understand what women want \u2014 but has also given them a strong incentive to do so.\n\n\u201cYou see a Rolex 39mm or 40mm watch on a woman\u2019s wrist, [and] you see IWC, Vacheron Constantin and Patek adapt to that,\u201d Mr Guy says. Cartier still focuses largely on feminine watches, he adds: \u201cNew iterations of the Santos line, with varying colours of dials and sizes, cater to that \u2018unisexification\u2019, but overall there is a long way to go.\u201d\n\nTaking women more seriously as consumers may also offer some low-hanging fruit to a male-dominated industry grappling with the disruption brought by ecommerce, smartwatches and uncertainty about economic growth in China, one of the biggest luxury watch consumer markets.\n\nWomen account for more than 40 per cent of sales at Watches of Switzerland, the UK\u2019s largest retailer of Swiss watches, says chief executive officer Brian Duffy.\n\nHe says women\u2019s growing spending power was being overlooked. \u201cHistorically they weren\u2019t getting what they were looking for because there was this traditional approach \u2014 a women\u2019s watch was dainty and small [with] a bigger emphasis on quartz. The reality is that\u2019s not what today\u2019s woman is looking for,\u201d Mr Duffy says. \u201cThe industry is progressively responding and I\u2019m sure what we see in [the Baselworld watch fair] will confirm that.\u201d\n\nPatek Philippe's Twenty-4 automatic\n\nThe opportunity is big. Mr Duffy says average prices for women\u2019s watches have increased 30 per cent over the past six years, versus 20 per cent for men, as women shift towards automatics over quartz. Patek Philippe, for instance, launched its Twenty-4 automatic last year \u2014 a sporty, round, self-winding mechanical watch that was previously offered only in quartz.\n\nLondon-based Italian jeweller Carolina Bucci describes her frustration in finding a watch that reflected her tastes. \u201cEverything had diamonds, it was either steel or had diamonds and smaller dials, which isn\u2019t what I wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat was presented for women was an after-thought because it\u2019s a man\u2019s world . . . we shrink the [watches], put some diamonds [on] and we\u2019re supposed to be happy.\u201d\n\nCoverage of her wearing a 1980s vintage Audemars Piguet Royal Oak 36mm men\u2019s watch in yellow gold caught the attention of the brand\u2019s chief executive, Fran\u00e7ois-Henry Bennahmias. He asked her: \u201cWhy are you wearing an old men\u2019s watch? What\u2019s wrong with our feminine watches?\u201d she recalls. \u201cI said, stop making them pink, sprinkling diamonds, making them smaller \u2014 it\u2019s crazy and it doesn\u2019t do it for me.\u201d\n\nAudemar Piguet's Royal Oak with Florentine finish\n\nHe challenged her to reimagine the Royal Oak in 2013. She gave the case a Florentine finish of faceted dents. The initial 600 pieces released in 2016 were a \u201chuge success\u201d, Ms Bucci says. Late last year the brand and Ms Bucci launched a \u00a347,800 frosted yellow-gold edition with a mirror dial.\n\nWomen account for 35 per cent of sales by value at Audemars Piguet, versus 25 per cent a few years ago. \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to change this drastically since we have a limited production,\u201d Mr Bennahmias says. \u201cBut we intend to improve the way we communicate with women and integrate them into our strategy.\u201d\n\nOthers believe this approach does not go far enough. Watchmakers reissuing their iconic models are \u201cboring people to death\u201d, believes Maximilian B\u00fcsser, a former executive of rare timepieces at Jaeger-LeCoultre and Harry Winston.\n\n\u201cBrands take so few risks, they\u2019re not making the next icons for the next generation,\u201d says the Swiss designer and founder of watchmaker MB&F.\n\nMB&F's dome-shaped mechanical watch\n\nTwo of his brand\u2019s biggest collectors are women, he says, who each own around 15 pieces. MB&F is launching its first women\u2019s watch, a dome-shaped mechanical timepiece with an exposed movement.\n\nReginald Brack, luxury industry analyst at NPD Group, a data provider, notes a trend in the $1.9bn US women\u2019s watch market of brands varying their ranges by size rather than gender. \u201cI see brands going more the gender-neutral route.\u201d\n\nHe, and many others, believe that when the smartest brands finally stop carving up their collections by gender, \u201cthey will attract a whole other audience\u201d."

    "text": "Hi, I'm Alan Smith, Data visualisation editor at the Financial Times. I've just finished an experimental project at the FT to both visualise and sonify the historical yield curve - a large dataset of over 100,000 data points. I've filmed a step-by-step walkthrough of the project. And the end product, a combined animated data visualisation and sonification of four decades of the US yield curve, is available on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoQBWcNw6IU . My full article is on the FT, website: ft.com/music-from-data\n\nMy work has also coincided with the the release of a new open source tool funded by Google* that allows users to make music from spreadsheets. So - is data sonification ready to be the next big thing in data presentation? Can it bring data to new audiences such as including the blind/visually impaired, podcast listeners, and those accessing the web via screenless devices with voice interfaces. Or is it a simple novelty? Ask me anything!\n\nTwoTone app funded by Google (https://app.twotone.io/)\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/pmafgrjd94n21.jpg"

    "text": "A stuttering start to the year for exports of Swiss watches has put brands on alert, stoking fears that a slowing Chinese economy and political instability in Europe may choke sales growth in the coming months.\n\nWhile the first half of 2018 saw strong growth in Swiss watch exports \u2014 up 10.6 per cent on the previous year, according to industry data \u2014 this slowed dramatically in the second half. By January 2019, exports by value were up just 0.2 per cent year on year.\n\nThis has sparked concern that a cooling-off in China, a disruptive Brexit, protests in France and political tensions in Italy and Spain could weigh on consumer demand for luxury goods.\n\nThe sector faces longer-term challenges around identity and relevance, too. As Swiss watch houses adopt an omnichannel approach to forge more direct relationships with discerning consumers, so too must flagship watch and jewellery fairs such as Baselworld \u2014 which takes place in the Swiss city of Basel this week \u2014 rethink how they serve their audience.\n\nBaselworld, which is 102 years old, and attracts 100,000 visitors over six days, has been forced to reinvent itself after several years of falling exhibitor numbers \u2014 culminating in the event\u2019s largest brand, Swatch Group, announcing last summer that it was quitting the show.\n\nStores are being more cautious with their order books\n\nExhibitors had long criticised what they perceived to be the organiser\u2019s arrogance and reluctance to seek brands\u2019 input. Market-watchers also say the relevance of trade fairs is fading in a digital era with more direct relationships between brands and consumers.\n\nBaselworld\u2019s owner MCH Group \u2014 which also runs motor fairs and ArtBasel among others \u2014 last year appointed Michel Loris-Melikoff as managing director of the event, with a brief to transform it for the digital age, review costs and improve dialogue in a bid to stop further exhibitors quitting.\n\nThis year\u2019s show marks the chrysalis stage of the event\u2019s planned transformation, with much of its vision for 2020 set to be unveiled over the coming days.\n\nAs well as turning the fair into what he calls an \u201cexperience platform\u201d for retailers, influencers and collectors, Mr Loris-Melikoff says he is open to the idea of taking the show on the road, mirroring the format of MCH stablemate ArtBasel, which has a presence in other cities including Miami and Buenos Aires. \u201cIt could make sense to use this strong presence in Miami, but of course it could also be in other cities,\u201d he tells the Financial Times.\n\nThe bigger question for watchmakers is whether the fortunes of their largest consumer markets are also likely to change.\n\nMainland China \u2014 the third-largest export market for watches behind Hong Kong and the US \u2014 imported $1.7bn worth in 2018, up 11.7 per cent on the previous year. Yet it reported its slowest economic growth for three decades last year, at 6.6 per cent. This is due in part to the ongoing trade war with the US, which has dented business and consumer sentiment.\n\nThe weak renminbi and Chinese government initiatives to drive up domestic consumption through tax cuts have also meant more Chinese would-be tourists are buying at home, which could sting retail demand across tourist destinations worldwide. Stores are being \u201cmore cautious with their order books\u201d, says Thomas Chauvet, a luxury goods equity analyst at Citi. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of pullback from watch retailers.\u201d\n\nThe effects are starting to be felt at big luxury groups. Swatch Group, which owns Omega, Tissot and the entry-level Swatch brand, blamed lower-than-expected growth in 2018 on a \u201cdownturn in demand\u201d in Asia, as well as France\u2019s gilets jaunes protests. Chief executive Nick Hayek told a press conference last week that tourism in France remained \u201champered\u201d going into 2019, and that the group\u2019s sales there are \u201cstill in the red\u201d compared with this time last year.\n\nSwatch is slightly more exposed than its peers to competition from smartwatches and cheaper watches made in China, as its low and mid-priced ranges account for about a quarter of its revenues, Mr Chauvet notes. Its share price is down about 25 per cent year on year.\n\nRichemont, which owns Vacheron Constantin and Cartier, was similarly forced to close stores in Paris for several weekends in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the unrest, damaging its sales in Europe. Its share price is currently down about 14 per cent in the past year.\n\nAlthough luxury group LVMH also had to close some French stores and has a large exposure to China, it has fared much better, in part due to the performance of its luxury goods beyond watches. The owner of Louis Vuitton, Bulgari and Tag Heuer reported record results in January, with net profits up 18 per cent to \u20ac6.35bn. \u201cThe market sees the glass as half empty. We see it as half full,\u201d Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive, said at the time.\n\nThe industry\u2019s renewed momentum in the US and Japan \u2014 where Swiss watch exports were up 9.1 per cent and 28.8 per cent year on year, respectively, in January \u2014 is cause for cheer. The growth goes some way to offsetting the gloomier outlook in Europe, where sales have softened in France, Italy and Spain as political uncertainty weighs on consumer sentiment and tourism.\n\nThe fall in sterling after the Brexit referendum initially was good news for domestic watch retailers, as tourists flocked to the UK to take advantage of the cheap pound. But a chaotic Brexit could see this trend reverse, warns Karine Szegedi, head of luxury at Deloitte Private, a division of the global consultancy: \u201cObviously if prices go up because of taxes and duties in the UK then there will be a direct impact.\u201d\n\nLast month, Britain signed a trade deal with Switzerland \u2014 its biggest since the Brexit vote in 2016. The UK trade department said the so-called trade continuity agreement would mean \u201cprecious stones and metals exporters could avoid up to \u00a34m\u201d in tariffs.\n\nStill, in the event of a disorderly Brexit, new layers of customs checks risk a logjam at Britain\u2019s border. Indeed, a peak in UK watch imports in January suggest distributors are \u201cstockpiling\u201d inventory ahead of possible disruption, observes Mr Chauvet.\n\nAt Baselworld, the mood is one of cautious optimism yet some remain sceptical about its chances of success.\n\nGianluca Maina, chief marketing officer at Geneva-based jewellery maison De Grisogono \u2014 which pulled out of Baselworld this year \u2014 says the way business is done is changing.\n\nHe commends Baselworld\u2019s efforts to improve exhibitors\u2019 experience, but brands like his are seeing the value of running smaller, targeted events. For De Grisogono, that means aligning product launches more closely to the fashion calendar."

    "authors": [
      "Produced Tom Hannen. Charts John Burn-Murdoch"
    ],
    "text": "You're looking at a bar chart race showing which cities had the largest populations at any time over history. We're going to start the race at 1500 A.D. In the early 1500s most people lived in the east, either the east of Europe and North Africa, or the east of the world itself in India and China-- two countries that would be a regular occurring feature as we get on.\n\nAs that century went on, Beijing went from being the largest city in the world to being encroached upon by Istanbul, which then took the lead around 1600. India and China again dominating here, but note how Paris, London, and Naples joined the ranks as other major European cities.\n\nAs the 1600s continue, note Tokyo rising up there into 2nd place. At this stage, Western Europe, India, and China are dominant but things are about to change. In the later 1700s the Industrial Revolution took hold. London, who is already among the top 3 cities in the world, but just wait to see what happens next. Keep an eye on that horizontal axis over the next few seconds.\n\nLondon here is still under a million people. But as the 18th century turned into the 19th, it shot forward over a million. Look at that axis stretching out as London soars up hitting two million before 1850, and then racing on towards 3. All other cities pretty much left in the dust now.\n\nAnother thing to watch now is the North American cities come along. That continent was barely populated at the start of our time period. As we move into the 20th century, we have three North American cities and almost all the rest of European. But watch for our old friend Tokyo shooting up to the rankings again.\n\nAfter the 2nd World War, Tokyo's population is around 10 million. But look at that now. It's doubled to 20 million within only about another 20 years, and then soon hits 30. The thing to note in the last 30 years of the period is those European cities in North American cities falling out of the ranks, and it's the emerging markets dominating with Asia, India, and Latin America.\n\nThe eagle eyed among you may have noted one city vanish, dropping from 2nd to third in the top 10, right out of this series altogether. That was in 1565 when the Indian city of Vijayanagara was conquered in a military conquest and then procedurally burned to the ground over a period of months. Pretty much nothing was left, and today only ruins survive.\n\nI'm, John Burn-Murdoch and I make data visualisations at the Financial Times. This chart was made using JavaScript, using the coding platform Observable. All the data I used to make the chart, and the code to create your own, can be found at the link on screen. But let me know on Twitter if you have any comments or questions about this video itself, or if you've made anything similar using the data."

    "text": "I started off in radio. From there I moved in to television. I went to MTV. What was really interesting for me was when I started at MTV not only was I one of the only working class people there, I was, to begin with, the only person of colour...only woman of colour there.\n\nI'd from a TV background, so I use fashion analogies. But I look at gender as almost wearing a coat that's just a bit too tight. And it's just slightly uncomfortable. You just know that there's a coat that's a little bit more comfortable, that would fit easier in terms of how you are treated. Racism, I would say, is coming into a room in a jacket that is seen as the completely wrong colour. There's nothing wrong with the jacket. You like it. You think it's great. But everybody else reacts in such a hostile way to that jacket that you're wearing.\n\nIs that literally how you feel?\n\nYes. And it feels very differently. That's why, for me, it's really important to have an intersectual conversation. Because the way I'm treated as a woman is very different to the way I'm treated because I'm black. They feel very different. And you know which form of discrimination you're experiencing because of the way it feels.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I think it's really important to make sure that others also understand that.\n\nYou would know more about this than me in that you've been studying gender and reporting on gender for such a long time. And I think what's interesting about the #MeToo movement - and I'd love to hear your opinion on it, too - is, of course, it's a moment of reckoning in that women are making sure that their voices are heard. They are expressing painful emotions that have been suppressed for so long. And I think that, you know, like with any shift - if you look at the civil rights movement - it was similar in the sense that when we started really calling out this level of injustice, racial injustice, it was a real reckoning.\n\nIt seems to me we've had this huge cultural shift.\n\nYes, which is great.\n\nWhich has been terrific.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut when it comes to actual real economic, financial, and political change...\n\nWhat is that? So I spent some time with Alan Smith, your data visualisation editor. And I was shocked by the data that he showed me.\n\nAlan, hello.\n\nHi, June. Nice to see you.\n\nNice to see you. So Alan, you are our man in the know when it comes to data.\n\nSo on this axis here, we're going to show what is the gap. So in the middle means there's no pay gap at all between men and women. In this direction is when you're paying men more. So at this level, you're paying men 50 per cent more than women.\n\nThat would be women being paid 50 per cent more. But what the data has shown us is that actually over three-quarters of companies that did report paid men more than women.\n\nWow.\n\nSo these are all the companies that are reporting a pay gap in favour of men.\n\nOh, my goodness.\n\nAnd you can see that that's a sizeable number.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo it's a big proportion. And what really completes this graphic, obviously, is do you want to see the companies that are paying women more, June?\n\nYes.\n\nThere they are. So there is a gap.\n\nThere is a huge difference.\n\nAnd what we're really looking at in this chart is just the lack of symmetry.\n\nYeah. And even the ones where we're getting to the 50 per cent mark, that's still worrying.\n\nThat's a big gap.\n\nThat's a huge gap.\n\nThat's a big gap.\n\nWe spoke with... I spoke with Ann Pickering from Telef\u00f3nica, 02. They have just managed, I think as of last year, their board is 50/50, which is wonderful. But that was something that she said was not easy. She literally had to be very clear with her executive search firms to say, do not send me a list that does not have 50 per cent women, 50 per cent men. And, wait for this. Some of them recused themselves.\n\nSo I found myself as the other...\n\nYes.\n\nI was the only woman in the room. And much as my male colleagues were a delight, I, metaphorically, I lost my voice. So that's when I realised how important diversity was. The penny dropped for me at that point. So when the opportunity arose to recruit additional people to the exec team, I would only work with a search firm that would be happy recruiting a 50/50 gender balance shortlist.\n\nRight, so you stipulated that.\n\nI stipulated that. You would be surprised, June, at the number of search firms who were uncomfortable with that request. So we didn't tend to work with them going forward. So for me, it's all about creating a level playing field. And I don't believe in quotas.\n\nOK.\n\nSo 50/50 gender balance shortlist, and then we chose the best person, who happened to be female. So it really does bring diversity of thinking. Yeah, we're all very different. So much better quality of debate in the board room, much broader range of views. Fantastic to have four role models for the women in our business. And I make sure that they get out there and they talk to our female colleagues. That's really, really important.\n\nWe filmed the roundtable with six key business leaders. And they all had different views on how you actually create change, and how you make sure that it's long lasting. And it was interesting, because Helena Morrissey doesn't believe in quotas even though the 30% Club kind of is a quota system, isn't it? That's kind of the whole point of it. But she doesn't believe in quotas, whereas Shriti Vadera and Karen Blackett believe that you need to have some sort of clear metric. You need to know what it is that you're working towards.\n\nI think the easier task, dare I say it, is women on boards.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nI think the more difficult one is senior women at the executive level...\n\nExecutive level, yeah.\n\n...rather than at the non-executive level, which by the way, is the source of the pay gap.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nThe representation of that. And I think that I worry a little bit that the exclusive issue of a focus on board level has actually also taken women out of executive positions into going portfolio possibly a little earlier. And I think we really need to focus on women and being at the executive...\n\nAt the executive level.\n\nSenior executive level.\n\nAnd also on the executive committees, as well, which is key. Yeah.\n\nThe executive committees. Not just the CEO or the finance writer who might be on the board...\n\nYeah.\n\n...but in the levels below. Because that's the talent pipeline. That's the future.\n\nYeah.\n\nIn our office, something that we we're always talking about is too much male energy.\n\nAnd so we have a sort of male energy measure in our office. And that's because we've made sure that the teams are equalised and that thing. But we try to make sure that all the teams that are working never become one gender. That's something that we've been watching, that actually when teams start to aggregate into the same gender, even when there's diversity in it, it starts to produce a certain kind of culture. And it actually affects the entire mood of the entire office.\n\nIt does.\n\nSomething that's been really important to us is how the micro team actually are organised and starts to dissolve that. Because then that kind of bonding agendas start to become much more soft.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd they don't just become male orientated or male interest only. They become soft and they become shared. And then that starts to have an effect. Because then when you start to see that kind of different team leaders winning there's a kind of idea that it's not about that one thing. You know? And it's something... we can tell with my leadership team when we've hit the male energy...\n\n...metre. We're like, what just happened? OK. Can somebody do the numbers? Oh, my god. We have more men in the office than women.\n\nDo you think there's a fine line between role model and exceptionalism?\n\nIt's a tough one.\n\nBecause, you know, I always sort of say...\n\nThat's a great point.\n\n...that we'll know that we've kind of really got to success when there are as many mediocre...\n\nCorrect.\n\n...women in charge of companies as there are mediocre men.\n\nThat's great.\n\n-- in charge of companies. Because it's so easy, isn't it?\n\nTotally agree.\n\nI just wrote something about this.\n\nBecause it's interesting, around International Women's Day in particular, I often do start to feel slightly exhausted. Because one is constantly being bombarded with all of these stories about these magnificent women, who are indeed magnificent.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it reinforces the idea that to get ahead, you have to be so much nicer, better, brilliant, more generous, more ethical, more everything.\n\nEverything.\n\nAnd it's exhausting.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nWho wants to keep thinking about this?\n\nYes.\n\nYou just want to get on with it.\n\nYeah. And you want to be mediocre.\n\nWell...\n\nIf it's okay for the man to be mediocre, why can't we be mediocre, too, now and again?\n\nThat is exactly what I said. You know, we must fight for the right to be as useless as anybody else.\n\nAnd this is the way that true equality lasts.\n\nParental leave, let's look at parental leave. How we look at parental leave, in the first place. In the roundtable this came up a lot. And a lot of the mothers on the panel talked about their problems that they had had in their career.\n\nAnd I think one of the most significant things we've done in 02 is run a career returners' programme.\n\nHow does that work?\n\nSo we brought women back into the workplace who've been out typically between two and 10 years, primarily having family, bringing them back on a 12-week course. And it's just all about giving them the opportunity to develop their self-confidence. You know, I can remember, it was many years ago, June, when I had my children. But you're off for months. And you really forget about the world of work. So giving women the opportunity to come back as part of a cohort, so they all join at the same time. Giving them a mentor, giving them a coach, and allowing them to come back into the workforce around about 12 weeks to develop their self-confidence.\n\nWhen we started Net-a-Porter, the first, I would say, 10 employees were actually dominant with male. Because we had IT, accounting, CFO. That's kind of natural at this stage. Quickly, we started to get more and more females in the company, because it's a female company. The audience is female. My reason was, OK, having two people to employ a woman or male... most of the employees were young. So you deal with finding talent. And when you find talent, you want to keep it. That talent, female, has to go on maternity leave. And it's a huge challenge for a young company when you find the talent, to actually find a replacement of that talent.\n\nAnd after 10 years, we were like, 3,500 employees. 2,500 were women. Out of these 2,500 women, you always have 50, 60 pregnant women. And actually, that kind of maternity hub we had at the company was actually a great way for us to find new talents. When you grow a company, number one, the woman being pregnant, most of the time that's 95 per cent Of the time what's coming back to the company. So effectively, you don't lose your talent. But more importantly, we had this hub of replacements who were there to support for three month, four months. We test them, and actually they were, for us, an amazing skill we had. They could be like, one... to replace someone in the accounting department. Actually, she would go into the magazine department.\n\nWow.\n\nSo effectively, that created amazing assets.\n\nIt became a training programme, almost.\n\nTotally. And actually, that' season for me, it really changed my vision on actually hiring young women. It is actually an amazing asset.\n\nYes. It is.\n\nI always talk about me loudly. So I'm a single mum to an 8-year old boy.\n\nWho is fabulous.\n\nThank you. I was promoted to be CEO of an operating company 10 months after having him.\n\nWow. What was that like?\n\nLook. I'm not going to lie. It was something I'd always wanted. But, my god, I was thinking, how am I going to do this? But I set my stall out. So I had conversations with my boss. I had conversations with clients about I am going to be more productive than I ever have been. I'm just going to work in a different way. And I think, again, it's about that conversation of normalising this.\n\nAnd how have you designed how you work? Because I think this is really important, particularly for women in the world of work, women who are mothers.\n\nYeah.\n\nUntil we get to the place where men are treated the same in terms of paternity, this is something we really have to look at for women. How did you design that?\n\nI talk about work-life blend rather than work-life balance. Because work is life and life is work. And you've got to know how to blend the two. And I am fortunate that I can have some help with childcare. I'm out of the office by 6 o'clock.\n\nOn the dot.\n\nI'm out of the office and I'm gone. And there will be a blackout window between 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock where I'm all focused on my son. And then after 8 o'clock I will answer emails. But I think the point about leaving loudly was, look, I am putting my spikes on and Lycra to compete in my son's sports race.\n\nAnd, I literally--\n\nYou're competitive.\n\nVery.\n\nIncredibly. And I will say what I'm doing. Because I think when you try and not talk about it and you try and hide it, it becomes something like a guilty secret. And it shouldn't be. It's part of your life.\n\nSpeaking of progression, one thing that we are really looking at a lot is promotion and searching out for the right candidates, and just thinking more broadly about that across industries. This whole idea of building up a pipeline is something that I know people spend a lot of time thinking about. And to me, it just seems like a no brainer. I mean, of course you have to have a strong\n\nOf course.\n\n...of women.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou can really start to paint this picture that there is something happening to decelerate the careers of women.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I'm going to, again, look at the proportion of women. Firstly, what we asked these organisations to report on is by their kind of seniority. So if we look at the junior staff in these same organisations that we looked at just a minute ago...\n\nBefore, yeah.\n\n...actually, junior levels are far more likely to be occupied by women.\n\nYup.\n\nBut then as you progress through the company's organisational structures, at middle management there's already a shift.\n\nShift. It's...\n\nIt's male dominated.\n\n...straight away. So there's some... because often when you look at people that report and work in this space, often they say it's the middle area is where the problem happens, in that women don't progress from the middle to the sort of C-suite. But actually, your data suggest it's actually happening here before we even get to the middle level.\n\nYeah. There is clearly something happening that's changing the gender structure between junior and middle levels. And, of course, you can guess. If I'd ask you to point on the screen where do you think the senior level customer is going to be...\n\n...you know, there's no surprise.\n\nNo surprise.\n\nAll the way over there in the corner.\n\nAll the way over there.\n\nAnd so I think what we're sort of seeing here is, again, just more reinforcement that there are some... you know, the data's great showing us the symptoms, if you like, of what's going on.\n\nBut I think this is really important. Because up until now, sort of the general thinking has been that women get stuck at the middle level. And so for companies wanting to address this problem, they're looking at the wrong place for the problem. This is suggesting we need to start much earlier...\n\nThat's right.\n\n...in the company pipeline.\n\nAnd so setting out things like the management of expectation for career pathways right from those junior levels, incredibly important. Now how companies react to this has been extremely interesting to watch. Because I think with the first wave of gender pay gap reporting, there was a suspicion that lot of companies were waiting until the very last moment to report their pay gap data, so that it would get lost in an avalanche of similarly bad pay gaps.\n\nSo many of them. We're not so bad. Look at them.\n\nBut there were a few companies that took an exception to that approach. One of them was easyJet, which did report a very big gender pay gap.\n\nRight.\n\nBut it reported it early on...\n\nYes.\n\n...and made a very big announcement, which was...\n\nAnnouncement that they were going to address it.\n\nWell, they effectively said, a lot of our pilots who are well-paid are male. And we're going to introduce a new recruitment programme...\n\nFor women.\n\n...specifically for recruiting female pilots. And so they took what could have been interpreted as a very negative press story about having a wide pay gap...\n\nAnd came up with a solution straight away.\n\nAnd turned up into something that I think generated far more positivity for them. We've taken a big look at specifically, finance. And I think finance is one where you look at how does that compare to the pay gap, overall. So we've still got the same axis here on this chart.\n\nYup.\n\nStill looking at the pay gap.\n\nYeah.\n\nThis time, we're going to look at the percentage of companies...\n\nThat are paying men more.\n\n..in the sector. Because they're all obviously different size industries, and so on. Now this line shows us the chart that we were really just looking at, which is all companies. okay? So that's that asymmetrical shape that we were just looking at. In finance, there's far fewer companies with no pay gap.\n\nWith no pay gap.\n\nThe proportion of companies with no pay gap is much smaller.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd if you look at the proportion of companies that are paying men more, that's what that looks like within finance.\n\nAnd what about paying women more?\n\nWell, you're going to have to get your magnifying glass out, because there's only a very few. And none of these... none of these companies here are actually what you would call big finance companies. It really is important to know with this data what you can and can't do. So, for example, we don't know how many employees there are in any of these companies, other than the fact...\n\nThat there's at least 250.\n\n...that there's at least 250. And they can report, companies, how many employees they have in an overall band. But it's not comprehensive enough. Some of our colleagues here have linked this data to other data on the size of companies. And what that reveals is actually about nine in 10 women will work for a company that pays men more. That's the figure.\n\nIs that just for finance, so that's across the board?\n\nThat's across the board, overall.\n\nNine in 10?\n\nNine in 10. So it's really interesting, this. Because...\n\nWhen you put it like that, it's even worse than it seems.\n\nBecause when we sort of around the figure off, we're sort of saying 14 per cent, whatever the current figure is at the moment. But actually when you put it like that, it just sounds terrible. Nine in 10.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo without question, the majority of women in this country will work for a business that pays men more.\n\nAbsolutely. Without doubt. And this is the first time that we've really been able to say that based on an extensive data set that gives us a snapshot of that.\n\nThat's a reality.\n\nWe need more women in finance.\n\nYes.\n\nOr more diversity in finance.\n\nYes.\n\nDiversity in finance is the issue. Diversity in finance.\n\nI think that finance is a big issue.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that tech and fintech...\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nAnd I feel really bad about this. Because it's almost like, these are the start-ups. Fintech is the kind of blank sheet. You don't have to have a history of unconscious bias, or anything else. And then you have technology companies that are worse.\n\nWorse.\n\nWorse, much worse.\n\nBut there's an interesting point here, a kind of paradox, which I don't really understand. You could not find a business, around this table or more broadly, that wouldn't agree with the proposition, what's your greatest asset in your business?\n\nPeople.\n\nMy people.\n\nYour people, right? So how much reporting of your people characteristics goes on? Not very much. I mean, it shouldn't have taken the government to come in with legislation to require that to be disclosed.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, it's quite hard to price what you can't manage, or what you can't measure.\n\nAnd what you can't measure. Yeah.\n\nI think there's a lot further we can go. You're starting with gender, which has been a great start, through ethnicity, and more broadly...\n\nAnd disability, and across the board.\n\nAnd then you've got a vehicle for investors to be able to shine a spotlight on these things.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd indeed, regulators. And absolutely, that needs to be thought about and reported and recorded, not just to your regulator, but to your investor.\n\nWhich is why I was saying at the start , the important thing is linking that measurement at the team levels into performance at the team levels. Because at the end, they're measuring their performance. Because that's the thing they're interested in. They've got to find the linkage at that level.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think investors were very slow off the mark around flexing their muscle, as it were. And partly because they felt self-conscious that actually, they didn't look particularly diverse, themselves. And now I think we've overcome that. And certainly, Legal & General has been right out there in front. And we've now got, within the 30% Club, an investor group of almost 30 institutional houses and over \u00a310tn of money. That's a lot of money. We do get together and when companies are really dragging their feet, or just even ignoring us completely.\n\nI think it's been really interesting, just to look for example here in the UK, at the pay gap legislation. For example, where for the first time... is really quite groundbreaking. And I think a lot of people in Britain don't realise how people around the rest of the world are quite amazed by this. The companies...\n\nAnd we're the only country doing it properly, actually.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so companies, for the first time, have to actually report their pay gap. So that was really exciting last year. But then this year, it's so interesting. In the last few weeks we've had... the BBC did this really interesting analysis. I'm sure you saw it, actually.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nFour out of 10 companies actually had a wider pay gap.\n\nPay gap.\n\nNot really where we were expecting to go.\n\nNo.\n\nAnd then it seems as though the sanctions that people thought were going to be imposed on companies that...\n\nWeren't.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo companies have been able to report figures that make no mathematical sense. And they haven't really been abiding by the guidelines, and nothing's happened. So that, to me, is a kind of a microcosm in a way of where we seem to be in a lot of areas.\n\nYes. And I think that's actually part of what needs to happen next with the women's movement, particularly in the workplace, which is I think we have to get really clear about what it is that we want and what it is that we expect. And then demand it in a really strategic way, and a systematic way.\n\nBecause when it is happening in isolation, when we're doing this in silos, you don't really have that sort of systemic change that you need for this to be something that's long lasting. And that's got to be the next phase of it. Otherwise, all it is we're complaining, we're shouting, but we're not actually forcing change. We're speaking truth to power, but we're not changing the power dynamic.\n\nRight, right, right. June, you spent the last couple of months working on this diversity series. What's been the big takeaway?\n\nNumber one, just how beneficial it is for the bottom line, and that actually companies need to see this as a way of future proofing their businesses. And then the second part is, it's just the right thing to do. Yes, it's a smart thing to do. But it's also the right thing to do. And I think what I've been most energised by is the way that, in the last couple of years, I've seen a sort of a willingness, at least an openness where people are actually open to at least having the conversation. And I think that, in itself, is a shift."

    "text": "I started off in radio. From there I moved in to television. I went to MTV. What was really interesting for me was when I started at MTV not only was I one of the only working class people there, I was, to begin with, the only person of colour...only woman of colour there.\n\nI'd from a TV background, so I use fashion analogies. But I look at gender as almost wearing a coat that's just a bit too tight. And it's just slightly uncomfortable. You just know that there's a coat that's a little bit more comfortable, that would fit easier in terms of how you are treated. Racism, I would say, is coming into a room in a jacket that is seen as the completely wrong colour. There's nothing wrong with the jacket. You like it. You think it's great. But everybody else reacts in such a hostile way to that jacket that you're wearing.\n\nIs that literally how you feel?\n\nYes. And it feels very differently. That's why, for me, it's really important to have an intersectual conversation. Because the way I'm treated as a woman is very different to the way I'm treated because I'm black. They feel very different. And you know which form of discrimination you're experiencing because of the way it feels.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I think it's really important to make sure that others also understand that.\n\nYou would know more about this than me in that you've been studying gender and reporting on gender for such a long time. And I think what's interesting about the #MeToo movement - and I'd love to hear your opinion on it, too - is, of course, it's a moment of reckoning in that women are making sure that their voices are heard. They are expressing painful emotions that have been suppressed for so long. And I think that, you know, like with any shift - if you look at the civil rights movement - it was similar in the sense that when we started really calling out this level of injustice, racial injustice, it was a real reckoning.\n\nIt seems to me we've had this huge cultural shift.\n\nYes, which is great.\n\nWhich has been terrific.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut when it comes to actual real economic, financial, and political change...\n\nWhat is that? So I spent some time with Alan Smith, your data visualisation editor. And I was shocked by the data that he showed me.\n\nAlan, hello.\n\nHi, June. Nice to see you.\n\nNice to see you. So Alan, you are our man in the know when it comes to data.\n\nSo on this axis here, we're going to show what is the gap. So in the middle means there's no pay gap at all between men and women. In this direction is when you're paying men more. So at this level, you're paying men 50 per cent more than women.\n\nThat would be women being paid 50 per cent more. But what the data has shown us is that actually over three-quarters of companies that did report paid men more than women.\n\nWow.\n\nSo these are all the companies that are reporting a pay gap in favour of men.\n\nOh, my goodness.\n\nAnd you can see that that's a sizeable number.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo it's a big proportion. And what really completes this graphic, obviously, is do you want to see the companies that are paying women more, June?\n\nYes.\n\nThere they are. So there is a gap.\n\nThere is a huge difference.\n\nAnd what we're really looking at in this chart is just the lack of symmetry.\n\nYeah. And even the ones where we're getting to the 50 per cent mark, that's still worrying.\n\nThat's a big gap.\n\nThat's a huge gap.\n\nThat's a big gap.\n\nWe spoke with... I spoke with Ann Pickering from Telef\u00f3nica, 02. They have just managed, I think as of last year, their board is 50/50, which is wonderful. But that was something that she said was not easy. She literally had to be very clear with her executive search firms to say, do not send me a list that does not have 50 per cent women, 50 per cent men. And, wait for this. Some of them recused themselves.\n\nSo I found myself as the other...\n\nYes.\n\nI was the only woman in the room. And much as my male colleagues were a delight, I, metaphorically, I lost my voice. So that's when I realised how important diversity was. The penny dropped for me at that point. So when the opportunity arose to recruit additional people to the exec team, I would only work with a search firm that would be happy recruiting a 50/50 gender balance shortlist.\n\nRight, so you stipulated that.\n\nI stipulated that. You would be surprised, June, at the number of search firms who were uncomfortable with that request. So we didn't tend to work with them going forward. So for me, it's all about creating a level playing field. And I don't believe in quotas.\n\nOK.\n\nSo 50/50 gender balance shortlist, and then we chose the best person, who happened to be female. So it really does bring diversity of thinking. Yeah, we're all very different. So much better quality of debate in the board room, much broader range of views. Fantastic to have four role models for the women in our business. And I make sure that they get out there and they talk to our female colleagues. That's really, really important.\n\nWe filmed the roundtable with six key business leaders. And they all had different views on how you actually create change, and how you make sure that it's long lasting. And it was interesting, because Helena Morrissey doesn't believe in quotas even though the 30% Club kind of is a quota system, isn't it? That's kind of the whole point of it. But she doesn't believe in quotas, whereas Shriti Vadera and Karen Blackett believe that you need to have some sort of clear metric. You need to know what it is that you're working towards.\n\nI think the easier task, dare I say it, is women on boards.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nI think the more difficult one is senior women at the executive level...\n\nExecutive level, yeah.\n\n...rather than at the non-executive level, which by the way, is the source of the pay gap.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nThe representation of that. And I think that I worry a little bit that the exclusive issue of a focus on board level has actually also taken women out of executive positions into going portfolio possibly a little earlier. And I think we really need to focus on women and being at the executive...\n\nAt the executive level.\n\nSenior executive level.\n\nAnd also on the executive committees, as well, which is key. Yeah.\n\nThe executive committees. Not just the CEO or the finance writer who might be on the board...\n\nYeah.\n\n...but in the levels below. Because that's the talent pipeline. That's the future.\n\nYeah.\n\nIn our office, something that we we're always talking about is too much male energy.\n\nAnd so we have a sort of male energy measure in our office. And that's because we've made sure that the teams are equalised and that thing. But we try to make sure that all the teams that are working never become one gender. That's something that we've been watching, that actually when teams start to aggregate into the same gender, even when there's diversity in it, it starts to produce a certain kind of culture. And it actually affects the entire mood of the entire office.\n\nIt does.\n\nSomething that's been really important to us is how the micro team actually are organised and starts to dissolve that. Because then that kind of bonding agendas start to become much more soft.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd they don't just become male orientated or male interest only. They become soft and they become shared. And then that starts to have an effect. Because then when you start to see that kind of different team leaders winning there's a kind of idea that it's not about that one thing. You know? And it's something... we can tell with my leadership team when we've hit the male energy...\n\n...metre. We're like, what just happened? OK. Can somebody do the numbers? Oh, my god. We have more men in the office than women.\n\nDo you think there's a fine line between role model and exceptionalism?\n\nIt's a tough one.\n\nBecause, you know, I always sort of say...\n\nThat's a great point.\n\n...that we'll know that we've kind of really got to success when there are as many mediocre...\n\nCorrect.\n\n...women in charge of companies as there are mediocre men.\n\nThat's great.\n\n-- in charge of companies. Because it's so easy, isn't it?\n\nTotally agree.\n\nI just wrote something about this.\n\nBecause it's interesting, around International Women's Day in particular, I often do start to feel slightly exhausted. Because one is constantly being bombarded with all of these stories about these magnificent women, who are indeed magnificent.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it reinforces the idea that to get ahead, you have to be so much nicer, better, brilliant, more generous, more ethical, more everything.\n\nEverything.\n\nAnd it's exhausting.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nWho wants to keep thinking about this?\n\nYes.\n\nYou just want to get on with it.\n\nYeah. And you want to be mediocre.\n\nWell...\n\nIf it's okay for the man to be mediocre, why can't we be mediocre, too, now and again?\n\nThat is exactly what I said. You know, we must fight for the right to be as useless as anybody else.\n\nAnd this is the way that true equality lasts.\n\nParental leave, let's look at parental leave. How we look at parental leave, in the first place. In the roundtable this came up a lot. And a lot of the mothers on the panel talked about their problems that they had had in their career.\n\nAnd I think one of the most significant things we've done in 02 is run a career returners' programme.\n\nHow does that work?\n\nSo we brought women back into the workplace who've been out typically between two and 10 years, primarily having family, bringing them back on a 12-week course. And it's just all about giving them the opportunity to develop their self-confidence. You know, I can remember, it was many years ago, June, when I had my children. But you're off for months. And you really forget about the world of work. So giving women the opportunity to come back as part of a cohort, so they all join at the same time. Giving them a mentor, giving them a coach, and allowing them to come back into the workforce around about 12 weeks to develop their self-confidence.\n\nWhen we started Net-a-Porter, the first, I would say, 10 employees were actually dominant with male. Because we had IT, accounting, CFO. That's kind of natural at this stage. Quickly, we started to get more and more females in the company, because it's a female company. The audience is female. My reason was, OK, having two people to employ a woman or male... most of the employees were young. So you deal with finding talent. And when you find talent, you want to keep it. That talent, female, has to go on maternity leave. And it's a huge challenge for a young company when you find the talent, to actually find a replacement of that talent.\n\nAnd after 10 years, we were like, 3,500 employees. 2,500 were women. Out of these 2,500 women, you always have 50, 60 pregnant women. And actually, that kind of maternity hub we had at the company was actually a great way for us to find new talents. When you grow a company, number one, the woman being pregnant, most of the time that's 95 per cent Of the time what's coming back to the company. So effectively, you don't lose your talent. But more importantly, we had this hub of replacements who were there to support for three month, four months. We test them, and actually they were, for us, an amazing skill we had. They could be like, one... to replace someone in the accounting department. Actually, she would go into the magazine department.\n\nWow.\n\nSo effectively, that created amazing assets.\n\nIt became a training programme, almost.\n\nTotally. And actually, that' season for me, it really changed my vision on actually hiring young women. It is actually an amazing asset.\n\nYes. It is.\n\nI always talk about me loudly. So I'm a single mum to an 8-year old boy.\n\nWho is fabulous.\n\nThank you. I was promoted to be CEO of an operating company 10 months after having him.\n\nWow. What was that like?\n\nLook. I'm not going to lie. It was something I'd always wanted. But, my god, I was thinking, how am I going to do this? But I set my stall out. So I had conversations with my boss. I had conversations with clients about I am going to be more productive than I ever have been. I'm just going to work in a different way. And I think, again, it's about that conversation of normalising this.\n\nAnd how have you designed how you work? Because I think this is really important, particularly for women in the world of work, women who are mothers.\n\nYeah.\n\nUntil we get to the place where men are treated the same in terms of paternity, this is something we really have to look at for women. How did you design that?\n\nI talk about work-life blend rather than work-life balance. Because work is life and life is work. And you've got to know how to blend the two. And I am fortunate that I can have some help with childcare. I'm out of the office by 6 o'clock.\n\nOn the dot.\n\nI'm out of the office and I'm gone. And there will be a blackout window between 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock where I'm all focused on my son. And then after 8 o'clock I will answer emails. But I think the point about leaving loudly was, look, I am putting my spikes on and Lycra to compete in my son's sports race.\n\nAnd, I literally--\n\nYou're competitive.\n\nVery.\n\nIncredibly. And I will say what I'm doing. Because I think when you try and not talk about it and you try and hide it, it becomes something like a guilty secret. And it shouldn't be. It's part of your life.\n\nSpeaking of progression, one thing that we are really looking at a lot is promotion and searching out for the right candidates, and just thinking more broadly about that across industries. This whole idea of building up a pipeline is something that I know people spend a lot of time thinking about. And to me, it just seems like a no brainer. I mean, of course you have to have a strong\n\nOf course.\n\n...of women.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou can really start to paint this picture that there is something happening to decelerate the careers of women.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I'm going to, again, look at the proportion of women. Firstly, what we asked these organisations to report on is by their kind of seniority. So if we look at the junior staff in these same organisations that we looked at just a minute ago...\n\nBefore, yeah.\n\n...actually, junior levels are far more likely to be occupied by women.\n\nYup.\n\nBut then as you progress through the company's organisational structures, at middle management there's already a shift.\n\nShift. It's...\n\nIt's male dominated.\n\n...straight away. So there's some... because often when you look at people that report and work in this space, often they say it's the middle area is where the problem happens, in that women don't progress from the middle to the sort of C-suite. But actually, your data suggest it's actually happening here before we even get to the middle level.\n\nYeah. There is clearly something happening that's changing the gender structure between junior and middle levels. And, of course, you can guess. If I'd ask you to point on the screen where do you think the senior level customer is going to be...\n\n...you know, there's no surprise.\n\nNo surprise.\n\nAll the way over there in the corner.\n\nAll the way over there.\n\nAnd so I think what we're sort of seeing here is, again, just more reinforcement that there are some... you know, the data's great showing us the symptoms, if you like, of what's going on.\n\nBut I think this is really important. Because up until now, sort of the general thinking has been that women get stuck at the middle level. And so for companies wanting to address this problem, they're looking at the wrong place for the problem. This is suggesting we need to start much earlier...\n\nThat's right.\n\n...in the company pipeline.\n\nAnd so setting out things like the management of expectation for career pathways right from those junior levels, incredibly important. Now how companies react to this has been extremely interesting to watch. Because I think with the first wave of gender pay gap reporting, there was a suspicion that lot of companies were waiting until the very last moment to report their pay gap data, so that it would get lost in an avalanche of similarly bad pay gaps.\n\nSo many of them. We're not so bad. Look at them.\n\nBut there were a few companies that took an exception to that approach. One of them was easyJet, which did report a very big gender pay gap.\n\nRight.\n\nBut it reported it early on...\n\nYes.\n\n...and made a very big announcement, which was...\n\nAnnouncement that they were going to address it.\n\nWell, they effectively said, a lot of our pilots who are well-paid are male. And we're going to introduce a new recruitment programme...\n\nFor women.\n\n...specifically for recruiting female pilots. And so they took what could have been interpreted as a very negative press story about having a wide pay gap...\n\nAnd came up with a solution straight away.\n\nAnd turned up into something that I think generated far more positivity for them. We've taken a big look at specifically, finance. And I think finance is one where you look at how does that compare to the pay gap, overall. So we've still got the same axis here on this chart.\n\nYup.\n\nStill looking at the pay gap.\n\nYeah.\n\nThis time, we're going to look at the percentage of companies...\n\nThat are paying men more.\n\n..in the sector. Because they're all obviously different size industries, and so on. Now this line shows us the chart that we were really just looking at, which is all companies. okay? So that's that asymmetrical shape that we were just looking at. In finance, there's far fewer companies with no pay gap.\n\nWith no pay gap.\n\nThe proportion of companies with no pay gap is much smaller.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd if you look at the proportion of companies that are paying men more, that's what that looks like within finance.\n\nAnd what about paying women more?\n\nWell, you're going to have to get your magnifying glass out, because there's only a very few. And none of these... none of these companies here are actually what you would call big finance companies. It really is important to know with this data what you can and can't do. So, for example, we don't know how many employees there are in any of these companies, other than the fact...\n\nThat there's at least 250.\n\n...that there's at least 250. And they can report, companies, how many employees they have in an overall band. But it's not comprehensive enough. Some of our colleagues here have linked this data to other data on the size of companies. And what that reveals is actually about nine in 10 women will work for a company that pays men more. That's the figure.\n\nIs that just for finance, so that's across the board?\n\nThat's across the board, overall.\n\nNine in 10?\n\nNine in 10. So it's really interesting, this. Because...\n\nWhen you put it like that, it's even worse than it seems.\n\nBecause when we sort of around the figure off, we're sort of saying 14 per cent, whatever the current figure is at the moment. But actually when you put it like that, it just sounds terrible. Nine in 10.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo without question, the majority of women in this country will work for a business that pays men more.\n\nAbsolutely. Without doubt. And this is the first time that we've really been able to say that based on an extensive data set that gives us a snapshot of that.\n\nThat's a reality.\n\nWe need more women in finance.\n\nYes.\n\nOr more diversity in finance.\n\nYes.\n\nDiversity in finance is the issue. Diversity in finance.\n\nI think that finance is a big issue.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that tech and fintech...\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nAnd I feel really bad about this. Because it's almost like, these are the start-ups. Fintech is the kind of blank sheet. You don't have to have a history of unconscious bias, or anything else. And then you have technology companies that are worse.\n\nWorse.\n\nWorse, much worse.\n\nBut there's an interesting point here, a kind of paradox, which I don't really understand. You could not find a business, around this table or more broadly, that wouldn't agree with the proposition, what's your greatest asset in your business?\n\nPeople.\n\nMy people.\n\nYour people, right? So how much reporting of your people characteristics goes on? Not very much. I mean, it shouldn't have taken the government to come in with legislation to require that to be disclosed.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, it's quite hard to price what you can't manage, or what you can't measure.\n\nAnd what you can't measure. Yeah.\n\nI think there's a lot further we can go. You're starting with gender, which has been a great start, through ethnicity, and more broadly...\n\nAnd disability, and across the board.\n\nAnd then you've got a vehicle for investors to be able to shine a spotlight on these things.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd indeed, regulators. And absolutely, that needs to be thought about and reported and recorded, not just to your regulator, but to your investor.\n\nWhich is why I was saying at the start , the important thing is linking that measurement at the team levels into performance at the team levels. Because at the end, they're measuring their performance. Because that's the thing they're interested in. They've got to find the linkage at that level.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think investors were very slow off the mark around flexing their muscle, as it were. And partly because they felt self-conscious that actually, they didn't look particularly diverse, themselves. And now I think we've overcome that. And certainly, Legal & General has been right out there in front. And we've now got, within the 30% Club, an investor group of almost 30 institutional houses and over \u00a310tn of money. That's a lot of money. We do get together and when companies are really dragging their feet, or just even ignoring us completely.\n\nI think it's been really interesting, just to look for example here in the UK, at the pay gap legislation. For example, where for the first time... is really quite groundbreaking. And I think a lot of people in Britain don't realise how people around the rest of the world are quite amazed by this. The companies...\n\nAnd we're the only country doing it properly, actually.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so companies, for the first time, have to actually report their pay gap. So that was really exciting last year. But then this year, it's so interesting. In the last few weeks we've had... the BBC did this really interesting analysis. I'm sure you saw it, actually.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nFour out of 10 companies actually had a wider pay gap.\n\nPay gap.\n\nNot really where we were expecting to go.\n\nNo.\n\nAnd then it seems as though the sanctions that people thought were going to be imposed on companies that...\n\nWeren't.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo companies have been able to report figures that make no mathematical sense. And they haven't really been abiding by the guidelines, and nothing's happened. So that, to me, is a kind of a microcosm in a way of where we seem to be in a lot of areas.\n\nYes. And I think that's actually part of what needs to happen next with the women's movement, particularly in the workplace, which is I think we have to get really clear about what it is that we want and what it is that we expect. And then demand it in a really strategic way, and a systematic way.\n\nBecause when it is happening in isolation, when we're doing this in silos, you don't really have that sort of systemic change that you need for this to be something that's long lasting. And that's got to be the next phase of it. Otherwise, all it is we're complaining, we're shouting, but we're not actually forcing change. We're speaking truth to power, but we're not changing the power dynamic.\n\nRight, right, right. June, you spent the last couple of months working on this diversity series. What's been the big takeaway?\n\nNumber one, just how beneficial it is for the bottom line, and that actually companies need to see this as a way of future proofing their businesses. And then the second part is, it's just the right thing to do. Yes, it's a smart thing to do. But it's also the right thing to do. And I think what I've been most energised by is the way that, in the last couple of years, I've seen a sort of a willingness, at least an openness where people are actually open to at least having the conversation. And I think that, in itself, is a shift."

    "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of the average metropolitan millennial. You\u2019re moving ahead in your career, getting closer to the day you\u2019ll finally own your own home and perhaps considering whether to start a pension or investment Isa.\n\nYou might think you\u2019ve got to the stage where you need the services of an independent financial adviser (IFA) \u2014 but would they take on a client like you?\n\nAll too often, the answer is no. As many young professionals can attest, we simply don\u2019t have enough money \u2014 yet \u2014 to make it worth the industry\u2019s while.\n\nIt is possible to argue that my generation is in greater need of financial advice than those before us. We have to contend with the shadow of student debt, a collapse in home ownership and higher levels of self-employment as wages stutter.\n\nYet call up an IFA, and your youthful voice will be interpreted as the sound of a client with very little money and very few assets. Unless you have a high salary, large inheritance or are at the outset of a potentially lucrative career, it\u2019s unlikely the adviser will be able to make money out of you. Even if they did take you on, it\u2019s equally unlikely that you would be able to afford their fees.\n\nHelp is at hand. There is a crop of new, digitally delivered services attempting to bridge the \u201cadvice gap\u201d \u2014 and some of these ideas are so innovative, slick and affordable, they might cause the traditional advice profession to fear for its future.\n\nBridging the advice gap\n\nAs the author of the Young Money blog, I was recently invited by Nucleus, a digital platform used by 800 IFAs, to travel around the UK to speak to different firms and see if we could bridge the generational divide.\n\nStarting in the City of London, it didn\u2019t begin well. I kept hearing that millennials were spending too much and saving too little, and that financial advice for most young people \u2014 bar the Kylie Jenners of this world \u2014 was a complete non-starter.\n\nWe might not have millions now \u2014 but surely some advisers might be prepared to take us on as clients?\n\nAfter working for 15 years, David Gibson, a 34-year-old physiotherapist, has his own home and some spare cash to invest. But he doesn\u2019t know what to do with it, despite extensive online research.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know who to trust long term for financial advice,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I would really like is someone to look at my overall individual circumstances and say \u2018this is what you should do\u2019.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Financial Conduct Authority, only 6 per cent of 18-34-year-olds took financial advice in 2017. A separate study by Schroders found that in the same year, half of all IFAs turned away clients with less than \u00a350,000 to invest.\n\nCarefree youngsters have never been a core market for the UK\u2019s \u00a34.5bn financial advice industry, whose bread and butter is the complex business of investments, estate planning and pensions.\n\nA huge regulatory shake-up of the way the advice industry can charge for its services is partly to blame. Six years ago, regulators outlawed commission-driven sales of seemingly \u201cfree\u201d products.\n\nThe hope was that advisers would move away from their traditional charging model. Most now take a percentage cut of assets under management \u2014 known in the industry as the ad valorem model \u2014 even though only 6 per cent of people say they want to pay this way, according to research by advisory firm Drewberry. This model immediately makes younger, asset-light clients a less appealing prospect.\n\nLike most people of her age group, Anna Dawson, a self-employed casting director, has never sought financial advice. The 28-year-old rents in Edinburgh and relocated from London to save for her first home on her own, a process she describes as \u201cslow and hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have never thought about [financial advice] because I can\u2019t afford it. If I don\u2019t work in a month, savings have to be put towards rent.\u201d\n\nHer experience underlines the challenge that financial advisers will face in finding their \u201cnext generation\u201d of clients.\n\nBuying a home and settling down might have been our parents\u2019 triggers for seeking financial advice but rising house prices and changing lifestyles mean our generation is pressing the pause button \u2014 sometimes indefinitely.\n\nWith more young people working in the \u201cgig economy\u201d, irregular incomes from freelance working play havoc with our ability to save regularly into pensions and Isas. The extent of our problems means financial decisions are often easier to ignore. A recent BuzzFeed article about \u201cerrand paralysis\u201d went viral, highlighting a very millennial aversion to workaday tasks, especially if they\u2019re IRL (in real life).\n\nBut there are digitally driven services out there that not only want our business, but think they can convince millennials that saving and investing is not as anxiety-inducing as they may fear.\n\nRobo solutions\n\nAs a young, unmarried millennial, managing most of my life and finances online, I find my biggest financial priorities are meeting freelance deadlines and keeping alive my new money plant from B&Q (ominously, the last one did not survive for long). With the amount of digital fintech services available today, the need to find an old-fashioned adviser does not seem pressing.\n\nThe millennium ushered in an online finance boom. DIY investing platforms brought money management to the masses, though you needed serious chutzpah to invest successfully on your own.\n\nThe next level is investing using a smartphone and \u201crobo advice\u201d, which, bizarrely, involves neither robots nor advice (as you and I understand it, anyway). Online digital wealth managers such as Nutmeg and Moneyfarm will invite wannabe investors to submit their investment time horizon and feelings about risk, suggesting the best ready-made investment fund for them. Sometimes, \u00a31 is all you need to get started.\n\nThis approach is a boon for overwhelmed millennials who just want to get invested and get on with their lives. It\u2019s why the Moneybox app has been a game changer. It deploys Richard Thaler\u2019s Nobel Prize-winning \u201cnudge theory\u201d to round up the digital spare change from investors\u2019 purchases \u2014 meaning the cost of a \u00a32.90 coffee can be rounded up to \u00a33, and the 10p difference invested in a portfolio of eye-catching stocks including Apple and Disney.\n\nThe investment algorithms are the \u201crobots\u201d, but at a basic level, the \u201cadvice\u201d they provide is which of their funds best suits your self-diagnosis. The FCA last year warned that there was \u201cscope for a mis-selling scandal\u201d if poorly-designed robo-advice models put people into unsuitable funds, or gave guidance masquerading as advice.\n\nThis is a very important difference. An IFA can give you what\u2019s called whole-of-market financial advice \u2014 meaning they can advise you on many different potential investments and recommend one that\u2019s best for your individual circumstances.\n\nA strictly regulated sector, you can\u2019t claim to offer financial advice unless you pass strict exams, meet certain criteria and have the necessary permission. It\u2019s one reason why the old Money Advice Service had to be rebranded recently as the Money and Pensions Service, such was the uproar among IFAs. And the regulatory burden helps explain why whole-of-market financial advice is so costly.\n\nEven if we could afford it, would the old-fashioned model be right for us?\n\nMax Rofagha: '[Young people] tend to have fairly similar, rather straightforward financial set-ups'\n\nFinimize, a financial information app, was founded by 31-year-old Max Rofagha in the belief that most millennials don\u2019t need financial advice. Young people, he says, \u201ctend to have fairly similar, rather straightforward financial set-ups. Most haven\u2019t bought a house yet, most aren\u2019t married or divorced yet: their situation is simpler than somebody who is older.\u201d\n\nStarved of financial education but drowning in online resources, most millennials just need a push in the right direction, Mr Rofagha believes. To this end, Finimize sends cheeky, emoji-packed emails every day to more than 300,000 subscribers, explaining what\u2019s going on in world markets in a way that\u2019s engaging and fun. A typical subject line \u2014 \u201cHow do you spell recession?\u201d Currently free, Finimize could, in time, become a paid subscription service.\n\nFinimize threatens what Mr Rofagha calls the \u201cinformation asymmetry\u201d that has sustained the financial advice industry for decades \u2014 namely, that financial matters are so complex you must pay a middleman to explain them to you. However, he also reckons young people will outgrow the mysterious \u201cblack box\u201d of robo advice.\n\n\u201cThe financial industry has been clinging to this model of complexity and opacity,\u201d he says. \u201cMillennials want to have a clear understanding of what\u2019s happening with their money.\u201d\n\nThis is why Finimize articles provide links to an array of investment options. Sure, robo advisers are on there \u2014 but so are cryptocurrency platforms such as eToro and stock-trading apps such as Freetrade. In fact, ultra-risky cryptocurrency is very popular, dominating the league table of users\u2019 reviews, despite Bitcoin\u2019s price plunging by about 80 per cent in the past year.\n\nIs there a danger that by making their own financial choices, younger investors are taking on too much risk?\n\nLast week, FT Money reported on the rising interest in crowdfunding by young investors, even though very few businesses have ever returned cash to investors.\n\nHayley Ard, a 32-year-old manager at King's College London\u2019s Entrepreneurship Institute and a Finimize user, drew on what she learnt from Finimize\u2019s investment packs and ended up buying an Innovative Finance Isa.\n\nShe chose peer-to-peer lender RateSetter, which is currently offering a 4 per cent return and a bonus of \u00a3150 for customers who keep \u00a310,000 or more invested for one year.\n\nShe says: \u201cA lot of people are priced out of financial advice unless it is a big decision. There are so many options now that democratise information.\u201d\n\nWhile her choice isn\u2019t without risk \u2014 peer-to-peer lending isn\u2019t covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and returns can be affected by borrower defaults \u2014 she\u2019s satisfied that she doesn\u2019t need financial advice. For now.\n\nAdvice, please\n\nNevertheless, some young investors still want a greater level of support with financial decisions. One brave online app \u2014 Multiply \u2014 is determined to provide free financial advice targeting young, self-employed professionals with an average income of \u00a339,000. Wait \u2014 how is this even possible?\n\nFor now, Multiply only offers \u201cguidance\u201d, but is hopeful it will soon be able to provide \u201cpersonalised and regulated\u201d financial advice later this year, FCA permitting.\n\nVivek Madlani, its co-founder, says Multiply is a lecture-free zone. \u201cYoung people are fed up with being branded irresponsible,\u201d he says. \u201cOur users are saving for goals and looking to the future to start families. They don\u2019t want to be slapped down for how much they\u2019re spending on flat whites or Asos.\n\n\u201cThey want advice to be non-judgmental, tailored to income, earnings and lifestyle. And they want it in a monthly rhythm, rather than getting a traditional financial plan which gets checked maybe once a year.\u201d\n\nVivek Madlani: 'Young people...don\u2019t want to be slapped down for how much they\u2019re spending on flat whites or Asos' \u00a9 Multiply\n\nThe traditional advisory profession will be watching Multiply\u2019s progress with a degree of nervousness. But it is not the only financial firm to see potential in the youth advice market.\n\nOne wealth management firm has set up an intriguing offshoot \u2014 run by young people, for young people.\n\nNeon Financial Planning has a slick website showcasing a range of fixed-fee services including a free financial health check, financial coaching at \u00a3100 for half an hour and access to a \u201cMoney Info\u201d app at \u00a340 a month. A full financial review costs \u00a3750.\n\nAll of these are clearly labelled as generic guidance, while \u201cregulated personal recommendations\u201d on investments or pensions are typically charged at 0.3 per cent of the sum invested, but will be spelt out in pounds.\n\n\u201cTraditional IFAs are 50-plus men, a lot of their clients are 50-plus. That is going to end at some point,\u201d says Neon\u2019s co-founder Jon Page. \u201cThe way these businesses are set up means younger people are not profitable to them, and don\u2019t look like a business opportunity. But I think they are. A lot of generational wealth is coming down to these people and somebody has to look after them.\u201d\n\nKeep it in the family\n\nTraditional financial advice is unaffordable for most young people. But unless the advice profession adapts to our growing digital demands, it could also become irrelevant.\n\nMr Page may be right to play the long game. Over the next 30 years, millennials will inherit an estimated \u00a35.5tn from baby-boomers, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research.\n\nEven if their parents\u2019 money is looked after by a 50-something in a suit, there is no guarantee that millennials will prolong their custom.\n\nResearch by Kings Court Trust shows a quarter of inheritance beneficiaries are already walking away from their parents\u2019 or grandparents\u2019 IFAs, typically taking \u00a3288,000 with them. Reasons given range from distance \u2014 both physical and personal \u2014 to a growing confidence that younger people can manage money for themselves.\n\nPimfa, the association for personal investment management and financial advice, has been looking into how it can \u201cforge long-term relationships with future inheritors, wealth builders and auto-enrollees\u201d \u2014 namely the 4.4m millennials who are now saving automatically into workplace pensions.\n\nKey recommendations include talking to existing clients about their family\u2019s needs, allowing younger clients to invest lower amounts, with \u201cclearly defined products and prices\u201d and finding new ways to dispense nuggets of financial wisdom \u2014 both online and at events.\n\nSheena Gillett at Pimfa says its research forum found that young people are still big fans of \u201chuman interaction and relationship-building\u201d \u2014 something Mr Page agrees with.\n\n\u201cPeople still value the human touch,\u201d he agrees. \u201cGoing on a financial website, answering a few automated questions, getting your card debited \u2014 it can be a bit scary.\u201d\n\nEven the robo advisers recognise that, once in a while, it\u2019s good to talk. Nutmeg now offers a personalised service, including a 15-minute phone call, for \u00a3350. A step-up from guidance, this is known as \u201crestricted advice\u201d as the conversation is strictly limited to Nutmeg\u2019s own products and portfolios. However, IFAs should note Nutmeg\u2019s \u201cwoke\u201d credentials \u2014 it\u2019s the first UK wealth manager to provide environmental, social and governance scores for all 10 of its ready-made portfolios.\n\nLisa Caplan, Nutmeg\u2019s head of financial advice, says: \u201cIf we find that investing isn\u2019t right for you \u2014 for example, if you have debts that you should pay off \u2014 we will advise you to do that without charge.\u201d\n\nScalable Capital also offers a free initial consultation over the phone, charging \u00a3200 for restricted advice on its range of investments.\n\nMeanwhile, new Canadian import Wealthsimple says it offers the same level of restricted advice as Nutmeg and Scalable over the phone or email \u2014 only for free. Could this be a sign of things to come?\n\nOn my trip around the UK, I met a lot of friendly and professional advisers who were willing to help the younger generation. But the sticking points are cost, convenience and time. The solution looks to be a clever combination of apps, investment platforms and a sympathetic ear once in a while. Although some advice on keeping money plants alive wouldn\u2019t go amiss."

    "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nIn Plato\u2019s version of Gyges, the Lydian shepherd has a magic ring of invisibility which gives him the wherewithal to seduce the queen, kill the king and take over. As greasy pole climbing goes, it\u2019s an effective approach, but could be judged inappropriate by today\u2019s demanding behaviour standards.\n\nChildren\u2019s literature usually encourages more positive behaviours around invisibility. But in both cases, invisibility is voluntary.\n\nWomen\u2019s invisibility, scrutinised via a deluge of grim statistics in Caroline Criado-Perez\u2019s recently published book Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men, increases as we age.\n\nI am 62, and I have been ceasing to exist for a decade or so. The process is so discreet that I barely notice most of the time but, a couple of nights ago in a south London bar, I had a jarring reminder of my non-existence.\n\nThe barman \u2014 or rather, mixologist hiding beneath a vast beard \u2014 appeared to have selective blindness in favour of the millennials at his bar. Shaking and twirling an Old Fashioned (gin is dead) he served three people who materialised after me. Was my money not good enough? Or did he think I was someone\u2019s mother? My smiles, coughs and \u201chellos\u201d got nowhere.\n\nSo how does an older woman command attention without risking jail or ridicule? I riffle through an imaginary Rolodex of role models who grew old without vanishing.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, the 85-year-old US Supreme Court Justice, has nailed it. Hollywood certainly seems to think so. Aside from a gruelling day job, she took time out to call Trump a \u201cfaker\u201d which demonstrates eloquent restraint. She has also stood down various cancers on top of meting out justice by the shovel load.\n\nAnd how about 85-year-old philanthropist Dame Steve Shirley? She is still highly visible. So it\u2019s just a matter of starting a software company and giving away \u00a367m. I\u2019m working on it.\n\nBunny Mellon, the Listerine heiress, gave away oodles of money too. In the last few years before her death in 2014, aged 103, the widow of the philanthropist and art collector Paul continued to run her estate by broadcasting instructions from her chauffeur-driven car. Hot and cold running staff are such a boon.\n\nHer powerful model for ageing was eased along by a close friendship with Jackie O, and her elegantly understated design brio. Her clothes and hats looked as if they were timeless classics from French couture houses. Many were. Others were Mellon\u2019s own creations. This highly noticeable woman revealed her secret in 1969 when she announced: \u201cNothing should be noticed.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s fine when you have the resources to command just about anything including, presumably, your very own caravan of mixologists. For those of us still failing to catch beardy boy\u2019s attention, \u201cNothing should be noticed\u201d is not a useful motto.\n\nSo how about a more flashy exemplar? The late novelist Dame Barbara Cartland was highly visible thanks to her large hats, floaty pink dresses and fluttering false black eye lashes.\n\nIt is easy to mock Cartland for her appearance alone, and many did, but she also had some decent connections, a huge following on both sides of the Atlantic, and a penchant for coming up with catchy quotes such as: \u201cAfter 40 a woman has to choose between losing her figure or her face. My advice is to keep your face, and stay sitting down.\u201d\n\nI tried that. It hasn\u2019t worked.\n\nAnd actually, Cartland didn\u2019t sit down much other than when she was churning out romantic novels \u2014 723 of which have been translated into 38 languages. That helped to secure visibility and an income to live almost as opulently as some of her heroes and heroines until just shy of her century.\n\nBack in the 1990s, I interviewed Cartland at her grand house north of London. Sitting beside her on the sofa I turned on my tape recorder. And she turned on hers, pulled up her skirts and commanded me to admire her thighs, which had \u201cbeen transformed by a special skin cream\u201d. Without having seen her thighs before the alleged treatment, I was not in a position to comment \u2014 but she was then in her 90s, and her thighs seemed to be in keeping.\n\nCartland\u2019s books and her campaigns gave her purpose however bonkers some of them seemed\n\nInterview over, we climbed the massive central staircase to her bedroom to inspect a bouquet of flowers before returning downstairs for high tea of the scale normally reserved for shooting parties. Cartland managed to gad about without stairlifts or sticks. Just force majeure.\n\nHer pink excess bordered on the alarming, but I would rather turn into a sort of mobile lampshade a la Cartland than give in to vanishing beige dullness as featured in models advertising stair lifts and walk-in baths that fall out of certain magazines.\n\nCartland\u2019s books and her campaigns \u2014 from advice on the health benefits of honey, to being chaste before marriage and old age pensioner rights \u2014 gave her purpose however bonkers some of them seemed. Her books also earned her vast amounts of money, which is usually an excellent means of guaranteeing courtesy and attention.\n\nSo, the next time I agree to a meeting someone in a groovy bar, I will bling up, stick \u00a350 notes all over my person and wander casually across to the Bandholz beardy boy and see if he has overcome his selective myopia.\n\nJane Owen is an author and FT Weekend\u2019s former deputy editor.

    "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nThe future of Oxfam, one of the UK\u2019s most venerable philanthropic institutions, remains in the balance following the revelations last year of sexual misconduct by its aid workers in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.\n\nSalacious details of Oxfam aid workers using prostitutes in Haiti were made worse when it emerged that the charity had been aware of the misconduct by 2011 but failed to acknowledge it publicly, allowing the country director responsible, Roland van Hauwermeiren, to resign and go on to work for other charities.\n\nRebuilding the organisation\u2019s reputation and restoring public trust in its work as it awaits the findings of an independent investigation by the Charity Commission is the challenge facing Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah, Oxfam\u2019s new chief executive, who described the Haiti scandal as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Oxfam of tomorrow is going to be unrecognisable,\u201d vowed Mr Sriskandarajah, who took over in January.\n\n\u201cPeople are so busy saving lives or responding to emergencies, that I think they ended up not paying sufficient attention to the behaviours or cultures that were driving some of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be doing good around the world while colleagues are causing harm along the way.\u201d\n\nComing in the wake of the #MeToo movement, the Haiti revelations caused outrage among Oxfam\u2019s donors and the general public. Mr Sriskandarajah\u2019s predecessor, Mark Goldring, further fuelled criticism when he told the Guardian newspaper that the reaction had been \u201cout of proportion\u201d.\n\nThis was followed by allegations of sexual harassment at Save the Children, sending a shockwave through the entire voluntary sector. Parliament\u2019s international development select committee described the aid sector\u2019s response to sexual offences by charity workers as \u201ccomplacency verging on complicity\u201d. Donations slumped.\n\nRoland van Hauwermeiren, Oxfam director for Haiti, went on to work for other charities after the charity had been made aware of the misconduct\n\nMr Sriskandarajah, a former civil society activist, was appointed because he would \u201cask the difficult questions and work well with colleagues across the Oxfam confederation to come up with the answers\u201d, according to Caroline Thomson, Oxfam\u2019s chair, who described him as a \u201cbrilliant strategic thinker with a record of delivery\u201d.\n\nHe previously worked at Civicus, a Johannesburg-based global alliance of civil society organisations that works to strengthen citizen action. Before that he was director-general of the Royal Commonwealth Society and has been deputy director of the left-leaning think-tank the Institute for Public Policy Research. He is also a trustee of Comic Relief.\n\nOxfam is currently the subject of two investigations \u2014 an internal one into sexual misconduct, accountability and culture change, as well as the one by the Charity Commission. Until the latter reports, the charity will not bid for UK government contracts.\n\nThe impact on the organisation\u2019s funding could be severe. Institutional donors provided \u00a3209m of Oxfam GB\u2019s \u00a3427m income in the 2017-18 financial year; around \u00a322m came from the UK government. When its last annual report was published late last year, Oxfam said it was unable to quantify the impact of the scandal on individuals\u2019 donations but 7,000 supporters stopped giving in the immediate aftermath, and Mr Sriskandarajah says \u00a314m of income has been lost.\n\nThe charity has shed 120 jobs \u2014 from a UK workforce of 1,150 \u2014 in response to the drop in funding, but now believes donations have stabilised, albeit at a lower level than before. Mr Sriskandarajah himself will earn \u00a310,000 a year less than Mr Goldring, at \u00a3120,000.\n\nA latrine project led by Oxfam in Port-au-Prince, Haiti \u00a9 Jonathan Torgovnik/Getty Images\n\nMr Sriskandarajah believes important steps have already been taken to address the failures of leadership and culture that led to the wrongdoing in Haiti.\n\n\u201cThe care and approach being taken to how we deal with safeguarding will be a step change,\u201d he said. \u201cJust in the last year every single member of staff has gone through training on safeguarding.\u201d\n\nThe charity is following a 10-point action plan, which includes strengthening internal processes, and strengthening its \u201cfocus on gender justice externally\u201d. Mr Sriskandarajah believes there is a genuine appetite for reform within the organisation.\n\n\u201cPeople are working tirelessly to try to get things right, because it goes to the heart of our mission . . . Every colleague I\u2019ve spoken to internally sees the need for change, not just in terms of the internal culture, but also about how we do programmes, how we deploy globally.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that Oxfam was implementing organisational change before the scandal broke, with a new international model under which Oxfam affiliates work together under a single management structure in each country, rather than having a number of different country directors.\n\nBut critics say changes are needed across the entire sector. In July British MPs argued that aid charities should be subject to a new ombudsman to end years of \u201cabject failure\u201d in tackling sexual abuse.\n\nMr Sriskandarajah said he believes a global system for vetting aid workers, which is currently being trialled, is necessary, despite fears that such a register would be overly bureaucratic.\n\n\u201cWe have to get much more serious. If ever there was a platform and a moment to reimagine, repurpose, this is it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the sector must better manage the endemic power imbalance between aid donors and recipients, which was undoubtedly a factor in Haiti.\n\nIn 2017 he wrote a blog asking whether the charity sector was at \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d, and argued that the \u201ccorporatisation\u201d of big charities had set business \u201cfree to pursue private good almost at all costs\u201d.\n\nHe now says that no charity \u201chas the right to exist indefinitely\u201d, but believes the world needs a \u201cstrong, independent, vocal\u201d civil society more than ever, and that Oxfam\u2019s record of providing humanitarian relief whilst also challenging policy justifies its future.\n\nHe is aware of the difficult task ahead and admits that he had to \u201cthink twice\u201d before deciding to join Oxfam, but a friend\u2019s comment swayed his decision.\n\n\u201cHe said something that haunted me for the next few days . . . [that] real leaders run into the fire and not away from the fire.\u201d"

    "text": "It always pays to be aware of a chart\u2019s limitations, even useful ones. Take the iconic yield curve, a chart that shows the yields of government bonds of varying maturities. Analysts use the shape of the curve to gauge market expectations. It might even help predict recessions.\n\nBut with yields changing on a daily basis, showing how the curve evolves over time is not easy. That is because the conventional chart type for showing time series, a line chart, uses the horizontal axis to show time running from left to right. On the yield curve, that axis is occupied by each bond\u2019s maturity date.\n\nInstead, analysts often chart the \u201cspread\u201d \u2014 the percentage point difference between two bonds (typically 2-year and 10-year). This produces a useful summary of the cyclical peaks and troughs of market expectations and how they might relate to recessions, but it also throws away a lot of information from the underlying yield curve.\n\nFor example, we can no longer see what the actual yields are \u2014 have they been high or low? \u2014 and there is always the risk that the particular spread chosen might not be representative of the shape of the entire curve. And how much does the curve change on a daily basis anyway?\n\nIn 2015, Gregor Aisch and Amanda Cox of the New York Times addressed this problem by rendering the yield curve in 3D. It is a great interactive graphic that shows the yield curve in a new light.\n\nAnimation is another approach worth investigating \u2014 after all, using time itself to represent time seems logical. A rapid daily animation of the yield curve shows a month\u2019s worth of data in half a second, a year in around six seconds. Tiny daily oscillations in the curve are now visible alongside more significant monthly and annual movement.\n\nOne problem with animation is that, with data changing so fast, it becomes difficult to remember key moments in the yield curve\u2019s progression. Adding \u201cmemory lines\u201d with text annotations of the curve\u2019s \u201cpeak inversions\u201d allows us to directly compare the yield curve at different points in time.\n\nExtending the animation, to show how the yield curve has changed on a daily basis since 1979 to the present day, results in a video just over three minutes long. It is compelling, but over such a duration, almost eerily silent.\n\nOf course, we could choose to add a Hans Rosling-style commentary \u2014 but could we use the data itself to produce a soundtrack?\n\nThe process of turning spreadsheets into sound is known as data sonification, the aural equivalent of data visualisation. And it might just be the next big thing in data presentation.\n\nWith our animation, the first challenge is to map the bond yields (the y-axis of the chart) to musical pitches.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to think in terms of orthodox musical scales (\u201crecession in C minor\u201d, \u201cthe great bear run in F# major\u201d), our \u201cmusic\u201d ideally needs to preserve equal spacing between pitch in the same way as tick marks preserve distance on the chart\u2019s y-axis. The more unusual whole tone scale \u2014 beloved of Debussy \u2014 ensures that our data will be proportionally spaced in pitch. The scale was also used last year by Berliner Morgenpost to sonify SDP party polling data.\n\nMapping a whole tone scale over four octaves gives 24 evenly-spaced notes with which we can sonify the yield curve data.\n\nNext up is the challenge of how to arrange the notes. In musical terms, the yield curve visually resembles an arpeggio \u2014 a sequence of notes in which one is played after the other, rather than a chord, where all the notes are played simultaneously.\n\nWith the yield curve arpeggiating, regular, flat and inverted shapes are represented by ascending, flat and descending sequences of musical notes.\n\nPlaying each day of data as an arpeggio would require us to slow down the animation dramatically to identify individual notes. Instead, we can trigger an arpeggio sequence every 30 days while maintaining the same rapid rate of animation for the visual. The monotony of barely-changing daily tones is replaced by much greater melodic movement.\n\nFor orchestration, a marimba\u2019s pitch range is perfect for our four octave scale \u2014 though one of the advantages of controlling sound in the digital domain through data is that it gives the option of unlimited remixes.\n\nA bass drum synchronised to the month and vocal samples that \u201csing\u201d the year allow us to track the changing yield curve over time. A repeating delay on the vocal sample repeats quarterly to indicate progress through the year. The relative level of yields (high/low), the shape of the yield curve (regular/flat/inverted), and the progress of time become encoded in sonic form.\n\nAdding a sound effect to denote our \u201cpeak inversion\u201d annotations provides a final join between the visual and aural worlds, completing our transformation of the yield curve.\n\nSonification has tremendous potential to not only support and reinforce visuals, but to take data to new audiences.\n\nChancey Fleet is assistive technology co-ordinator at New York\u2019s Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library. She has a particular interest in accessible technology and how it can bring data into the everyday life of those who, like herself, cannot directly see data visualisations.\n\nWatching Ms Fleet listen to the yield curve and sketch its shape on her tactile drawing tablet provides a tantalising glimpse of what sonification might be able to do for blind or visually impaired users.\n\nShe immediately suggests an improvement: a \u201csonic legend\u201d to provide a primer on interpreting the data. And while sensible audio defaults are a good starting point, sonification is something users should be able to personalise.\n\nBut, overall, she considers the experimental yield-curve music to be a promising approach that allows her to parse information from a complex time series of over 100,000 data points.\n\nI sonified the yield curve by writing code and using specialist music software. But for this technique to truly take off into the everyday, it needs to be publicly accessible. A new open source tool funded by Google\u2019s Digital News Initiative promises to do just that.\n\nTo coincide with New York Open Data 2019 week, NYC-based Datavized has released TwoTone, an interactive tool for making music with data. The company has already explored virtual and augmented reality, but according to co-founder Hugh McGrory, the first mass adoption of immersive data storytellingwill be in audio \u201cbecause the barrier to entry is zero \u2014 everybody already has a pair of headphones\u201d.\n\nAccording to Mr McGrory, pre-release testing of TwoTone saw everything from \u201cmillennials chair dancing to music made from spreadsheets\u201d, to intense interest from cyber security outfits keen to listen to data in real time.\n\nSome might be inclined to dismiss sonification as a novelty, but a new generation of screenless devices with voice interfaces, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa, marks the end of silent interaction with computers. It is perhaps naive to think that data will continue to just be seen and not heard.\n\nThe tools behind the musical yield curve\n\nHistorical yield curve data are freely available from the US Treasury. The data animation was created using the open source data visualisation library D3.js, with WebMidi.js generating simultaneous MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) note messages. Apple\u2019s Logic Pro X was used for sound generation."

    "text": "Inventing the world wide web might be considered a remarkable enough achievement for one lifetime. But Sir Tim Berners-Lee has another burning ambition: to reinvent it.\n\nThirty years ago, Sir Tim designed much of the architecture for our information age, ensuring that the web was open, free and accessible to everyone. The creation of this user-friendly interface with the internet has led to an astonishing explosion of communication and creativity, changing our world in incalculable ways. Some 4bn people now enjoy near-instant access to more information than their grandparents could ever have imagined.\n\nBut in more recent years the web has taken a dark turn as corporate, state and criminal interests have sought to exploit its radical openness. Our information age, which still promises so much, has been disfigured by the emergence of surveillance capitalism, electoral manipulation and cyber crime.\n\nSir Tim has grown increasingly distressed at how his invention has turned into an \u201cengine of inequity and division\u201d, as he describes it. Fixing this emergent \u201canti-human\u201d phenomenon has become the urgent priority of his life as the remaining unconnected people in the world today and future generations come online over the next few decades.\n\n\u201cWe did create all kinds of wonderful things on the web. But looking back at the past few years, we have realised that there has been a lot of dysfunction in society,\u201d says Sir Tim, in an interview down a crackly line from Australia. \u201cPeople are being manipulated to vote against their own best interests. The foundations of democracy are threatened.\u201d\n\nThe critical question confronting all our societies is whether the web\u2019s flaws are a temporary bug that can be fixed or a permanent feature that can, at best, be contained. Ever the computer geek, Sir Tim is convinced there is a technological solution. His purpose is now to fix the bug and build a more respectful and powerful web that answers to our real human needs.\n\nWorld Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee takes part in an event marking the 30 years of World Wide Web \u00a9 FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images Sir Tim Berners-Lee at Cern, where he developed what would become the world wide web \u00a9 Cern\n\nSince 2015, Sir Tim has been working with a small team of computer scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to design a new data platform called Solid (the name is derived from \u201csocial linked data\u201d). Last year, he announced the launch of Inrupt, a for-profit company intended to put Solid into operation.\n\nThousands of developers across 26 countries are experimenting with 50,000 Solid personal online data stores (PODs). The company is also collaborating with some bigger partners, including an Indian telecoms company and the UK\u2019s National Health Service, to explore how Solid could be configured at scale.\n\nTo that end, Inrupt is aiming to complete a multimillion-dollar fundraising by the end of March, enabling it to launch a user product by the end of the year. In tech jargon, Solid is aiming to \u201cre-decentralise\u201d the web, returning ownership of data to the users who generate it and empowering them to give consent to others to access it.\n\nWe know how to fire rockets into the sky. We should be able to build constructive social networks\n\n\u201cSolid solves a few problems at once because it is a paradigm shift,\u201d says Sir Tim. \u201cBut if you had to pick one it would be: giving people complete control of their data.\u201d\n\nThe challenges of scaling Solid are daunting, to say the least. Companies and governments have strong vested interests in maintaining the current data ecosystem; billions of users have built their lives around free and convenient services; and the technological and financial demands of launching an alternative platform are immense.\n\nBut friends say the 63-year-old computer scientist has been energised by his latest mission. \u201cIt is rocket science. It is tricky. Things can blow up on you,\u201d says Sir Tim. \u201cBut we know how to fire rockets into the sky. We should be able to build constructive social networks.\u201d\n\nThe computer used at CERN by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee to devise the World Wide Web \u00a9 SSPL via Getty Images\n\nGiven what has happened over the past three decades, the origins of the web now seem a long time ago and far, far away. Back in 1989, Sir Tim was working in Switzerland as a software engineer at Cern, the world\u2019s largest particle physics laboratory. Bashing away on his NeXT computer, he devised an online information space in which documents could be identified by uniform resource locators (URLs) and connected by hypertext links, enabling easy navigation between pages.\n\nIn his book Weaving The Web, he compared the effort needed to launch the web with that required to race a bobsleigh: everyone had to push hard for a seemingly long time, but once the bobsleigh built up momentum, everyone could jump on board and enjoy the ride.\n\nThe critical accelerant for the web\u2019s development was Sir Tim\u2019s selfless decision not to patent his invention, probably passing up the opportunity to earn billions of dollars in the process but keeping cyberspace open and non-proprietary. In the words of the science writer James Gleick, the web was \u201cThe Patent That Never Was.\u201d\n\nAs a result, cyberspace has grown at mesmerising speed. There are now almost 4.2bn internet users around the world, accessing close to 2bn websites, according to the latest ever-changing data from internetlivestats.com.\n\nSome people say we are turning the web on its head. But we like to think we are turning it the right way up\n\nIan Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford and co-author of Age of Discovery, argues that the mass adoption of the web can only be compared to the invention of the printing press in 15th-century Europe and its revolutionary effect on communication. The arrival of the web has opened a new era of information abundance, cheap distribution, radical variety and wide participation, he argues, that is comparable to a new Renaissance.\n\n\u201cThe web has been a huge net positive for humanity. It has been as revolutionary as the Gutenberg press in transforming the way that ideas are shaped and shared,\u201d says Goldin. \u201cI cannot think of another technology over the past 30 years that has changed so much for so many so quickly.\u201d\n\nA tweet from Sir Tim Berners-Lee is displayed during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games \u00a9 Philippe Petit/Paris Match via Getty Images\n\nThe widespread adoption of the printing press in Europe and the mass diffusion of ideas helped transform one of the most backward regions of the planet into its leading centre of innovation. \u201cThis is now happening at a much, much bigger scale with the web, enabling people from all corners of the planet to learn from each other,\u201d says Goldin. \u201cHip-hop dancers in Harlem can now learn moves from hip-hop dancers in Shanghai.\u201d\n\nBut communication revolutions enable bad ideas to spread just as quickly as good. \u201cThe Gutenberg press led to the explosion of genius, but it also led to 200 years of religious wars and gave voice to Savonarola,\u201d says Goldin, describing the publicity-savvy Florentine firebrand as a \u201c15th-century Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nInrupt\u2019s ambition is to maximise the upsides of the web while minimising its downsides.\n\nJohn Bruce, Inrupt\u2019s chief executive, argues that the Solid platform will create tangible benefits for all three of the web\u2019s biggest constituencies: its users, service providers and developers.\n\nUsers, he says, will enjoy greater privacy and functionality by integrating all their digital services more securely on their devices. Service providers can concentrate on what they do well, such as selling shoes, rather than worrying about things they do badly, such as managing data. And developers will be able to design apps for the direct benefit of users, rather than the tech companies and advertisers that stand behind them.\n\n\u201cSolid is hugely liberating for all of us, which is why it is so significant for the web,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cSome people say we are turning the web on its head. But we like to think we are turning it the right way up. Inrupt is not just encouraging this new ecosystem but leading it.\u201d\n\nSir Tim says the Solid team are laying down new architectural rules about how things can operate online. \u201cFor the moment, it is a team of people with a vision making a very co-ordinated effort to do things in an extremely deliberate way so that we make sure this thing does behave like we want it to and it has the impact it promises,\u201d he says.\n\nIf Inrupt can get things right, Sir Tim believes Solid could help unleash an exciting new wave of innovation as developers benefit from the freer flow of valuable data. \u201cIf you pay a developer to make trusted apps, or you use open-source apps that are not going to advertise to you, or ambush you, or distract you, then you trust them more and you will give them access to a lot more data,\u201d he says.\n\nOne problem Solid solves is giving people complete control of their data\n\n\u201cI think we will be able to use very powerful apps that have access to all our data. We will be able to share anything we want with anybody. I can share my hospital records with my doctor, I can share my photos with my cousin.\u201d\n\nThe odds would appear to be stacked against Sir Tim and the Solid team. First, they are betting against complacency, assuming that users care enough to pay for trusted apps and spend time managing their own data settings. Second, they are betting against deeply entrenched interests that did not exist when the web was first created.\n\n\u201cIt may be possible to create a clean web,\u201d says one digital expert. \u201cBut there are too many powerful and corrupt state and corporate interests intent on keeping it dirty.\u201d\n\nIf Sir Tim really does succeed in revolutionising mass communication for a second time, his latest accomplishment may yet be considered almost as significant as his first. One adjective best describes Sir Tim\u2019s ambition: bold."

    "text": "For one night only, Financial Times journalists will bring unforgettable stories to life. Welcome to FT On Stage.\n\n\u201cThese live stories told by FT journalists transport the audience. Instead of turning the pages of your favourite newspaper, you go to the show\u201d\n\nRobert Shrimsley, editorial director and UK political commentator, Financial Times\n\nIn collaboration with Live Magazine, the FT has curated an evening of storytelling performed by an all-editorial cast, from well-known columnists, like Simon Kuper and Roula Khalaf, to our tech expert and futurist, our resident money spinner, life and arts correspondents - and even an award-winning data visualisation reporter.\n\nThey will share true tales of secrets and lies, the rise and fall of oligarchs, decisive moments that changed everything, as well as stories about high street shopping, Oxford rivalries, power lunches and a tragic friendship.\n\nFeaturing a mix of original reporting and commentary, live music and multimedia, this event is a chance to experience poignant and humorous tales in a unique theatrical setting.\n\nDoors open at 6pm for welcome drinks, the performance will begin at 7pm (running time: 90 minutes, no interval).\n\nThe Financial Times is one of the world\u2019s leading business news organisations, recognised internationally for its authority, integrity and accuracy. The FT has a record paying readership of 985,000, three-quarters of which are digital subscriptions. It is part of Nikkei Inc., which provides a broad range of information, news and services for the global business community.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs there a minimum age requirement to attend?\n\n18+ to attend. ID will be required for under 30s ticket holders.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we allowed to take photos or film the event?\n\nStrictly no photography or filming inside the auditorium.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there wheelchair access?\n\nYes, please email onstage@ft.com for accessible booking.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I have to print my ticket?\n\nYou can either print your ticket out to bring along, or show it on arrival through the Evenbrite app on your smartphone.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the nearest station?\n\nBarbican (Metropolitan, Circle and Hammersmith & City lines)\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "After two years of tortuous negotiations, Theresa May\u2019s strategy for taking the UK out of the EU lies in ruins. From the moment the stentorian attorney-general, Geoffrey Cox, pronounced that late legal changes won by the prime minister did not remove the risk of the UK being \u201ctrapped\u201d in the so-called Irish backstop hated by Eurosceptics, her withdrawal agreement was headed for another crushing Commons defeat. The priority now must be to avoid chaos \u2014 chaos in parliament that could be exploited by extremists of left and right, and the chaos of a no-deal exit. MPs must stabilise the political situation and create the space for a Brexit rethink.\n\nIn other circumstances, a second humiliating loss on the government\u2019s flagship policy would end in a prime ministerial resignation. Mrs May must bear most of the blame for the failure to secure a parliamentary majority. Her negotiating strategy was muddled and contradictory, and she continually put narrow party interests ahead of those of the nation. This premier, who prides herself on being no \u201cquitter\u201d, seems determined to try to soldier on. If she succeeds, against all odds, she must pursue a new strategy.\n\nThis means ending the fantasy of bringing her deal to parliament a third time. EU officials have made clear there will be no further concessions on the backstop aimed at avoiding a hard border in Ireland. Mrs May should instead allow parliament to take control. She must work to promote and facilitate exactly the kind of cross-party co-operation in the national interest that she has so far stubbornly resisted.\n\nAs a first step, MPs must vote on Wednesday to remove the risk of a catastrophic no-deal departure from the EU on March 29. Such an exit would do huge damage to UK jobs, prosperity and security. Bringing supply lines to a standstill, it could lead to shortages of foodstuffs and even medicines. It would destroy international trust in Britain when it most needs to forge new relationships.\n\nThere should be no prevarication here. Letting Britain crash out of the EU \u2014 as the Brexit ultras advocate \u2014 is not fulfilling the result of the 2016 referendum. This is not what most Leave voters thought they were backing. Failure to remove this risk would be a dereliction of parliamentarians\u2019 duty to exercise their judgment in the best interests of the citizens they represent.\n\nJoin the Europe Talks project The Financial Times is collaborating with 16 news organisations for an experiment called Europe Talks, where we connect thousands of Europeans for face-to-face conversations across borders. Would you like to be involved? Click here to find out more.\n\nMPs\u2019 second priority is to vote on Thursday to seek from the EU an extension of the Article 50 withdrawal process. This needs to be longer than three months. It should allow time for a new approach to Brexit that tests MPs\u2019 appetite for other forms of withdrawal. Indicative votes should be held on \u201csofter\u201d options including a permanent customs union with the EU \u2014 which this newspaper has supported \u2014 or a \u201cNorway-plus\u201d option of remaining in the single market and a customs union.\n\nIf no option can garner the support of a majority of MPs, the Financial Times has advocated returning the issue to the British people in another referendum. Voters could be presented with a choice between Mrs May\u2019s deal \u2014 the only negotiated Brexit option that currently exists \u2014 or remaining in the EU. MPs might favour a general election. But with Britain\u2019s two biggest political parties both riven over Brexit, an election would resolve little.\n\nA new referendum would be divisive, but it would offer voters this time a real choice, instead of the illusory Brexit they were sold in 2016. A majority does not yet appear to exist in parliament for this route, either. Yet if MPs cannot unite around an alternative Brexit, they might start to see a new plebiscite as the only way out of the impasse."

    "text": "I started off in radio. From there I moved in to television. I went to MTV. What was really interesting for me was when I started at MTV not only was I one of the only working class people there, I was, to begin with, the only person of colour...only woman of colour there.\n\nI'd from a TV background, so I use fashion analogies. But I look at gender as almost wearing a coat that's just a bit too tight. And it's just slightly uncomfortable. You just know that there's a coat that's a little bit more comfortable, that would fit easier in terms of how you are treated. Racism, I would say, is coming into a room in a jacket that is seen as the completely wrong colour. There's nothing wrong with the jacket. You like it. You think it's great. But everybody else reacts in such a hostile way to that jacket that you're wearing.\n\nIs that literally how you feel?\n\nYes. And it feels very differently. That's why, for me, it's really important to have an intersectual conversation. Because the way I'm treated as a woman is very different to the way I'm treated because I'm black. They feel very different. And you know which form of discrimination you're experiencing because of the way it feels.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I think it's really important to make sure that others also understand that.\n\nYou would know more about this than me in that you've been studying gender and reporting on gender for such a long time. And I think what's interesting about the #MeToo movement - and I'd love to hear your opinion on it, too - is, of course, it's a moment of reckoning in that women are making sure that their voices are heard. They are expressing painful emotions that have been suppressed for so long. And I think that, you know, like with any shift - if you look at the civil rights movement - it was similar in the sense that when we started really calling out this level of injustice, racial injustice, it was a real reckoning.\n\nIt seems to me we've had this huge cultural shift.\n\nYes, which is great.\n\nWhich has been terrific.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut when it comes to actual real economic, financial, and political change...\n\nWhat is that? So I spent some time with Alan Smith, your data visualisation editor. And I was shocked by the data that he showed me.\n\nAlan, hello.\n\nHi, June. Nice to see you.\n\nNice to see you. So Alan, you are our man in the know when it comes to data.\n\nSo on this axis here, we're going to show what is the gap. So in the middle means there's no pay gap at all between men and women. In this direction is when you're paying men more. So at this level, you're paying men 50 per cent more than women.\n\nThat would be women being paid 50 per cent more. But what the data has shown us is that actually over three-quarters of companies that did report paid men more than women.\n\nWow.\n\nSo these are all the companies that are reporting a pay gap in favour of men.\n\nOh, my goodness.\n\nAnd you can see that that's a sizeable number.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo it's a big proportion. And what really completes this graphic, obviously, is do you want to see the companies that are paying women more, June?\n\nYes.\n\nThere they are. So there is a gap.\n\nThere is a huge difference.\n\nAnd what we're really looking at in this chart is just the lack of symmetry.\n\nYeah. And even the ones where we're getting to the 50 per cent mark, that's still worrying.\n\nThat's a big gap.\n\nThat's a huge gap.\n\nThat's a big gap.\n\nWe spoke with... I spoke with Ann Pickering from Telef\u00f3nica, 02. They have just managed, I think as of last year, their board is 50/50, which is wonderful. But that was something that she said was not easy. She literally had to be very clear with her executive search firms to say, do not send me a list that does not have 50 per cent women, 50 per cent men. And, wait for this. Some of them recused themselves.\n\nSo I found myself as the other...\n\nYes.\n\nI was the only woman in the room. And much as my male colleagues were a delight, I, metaphorically, I lost my voice. So that's when I realised how important diversity was. The penny dropped for me at that point. So when the opportunity arose to recruit additional people to the exec team, I would only work with a search firm that would be happy recruiting a 50/50 gender balance shortlist.\n\nRight, so you stipulated that.\n\nI stipulated that. You would be surprised, June, at the number of search firms who were uncomfortable with that request. So we didn't tend to work with them going forward. So for me, it's all about creating a level playing field. And I don't believe in quotas.\n\nOK.\n\nSo 50/50 gender balance shortlist, and then we chose the best person, who happened to be female. So it really does bring diversity of thinking. Yeah, we're all very different. So much better quality of debate in the board room, much broader range of views. Fantastic to have four role models for the women in our business. And I make sure that they get out there and they talk to our female colleagues. That's really, really important.\n\nWe filmed the roundtable with six key business leaders. And they all had different views on how you actually create change, and how you make sure that it's long lasting. And it was interesting, because Helena Morrissey doesn't believe in quotas even though the 30% Club kind of is a quota system, isn't it? That's kind of the whole point of it. But she doesn't believe in quotas, whereas Shriti Vadera and Karen Blackett believe that you need to have some sort of clear metric. You need to know what it is that you're working towards.\n\nI think the easier task, dare I say it, is women on boards.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nI think the more difficult one is senior women at the executive level...\n\nExecutive level, yeah.\n\n...rather than at the non-executive level, which by the way, is the source of the pay gap.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nThe representation of that. And I think that I worry a little bit that the exclusive issue of a focus on board level has actually also taken women out of executive positions into going portfolio possibly a little earlier. And I think we really need to focus on women and being at the executive...\n\nAt the executive level.\n\nSenior executive level.\n\nAnd also on the executive committees, as well, which is key. Yeah.\n\nThe executive committees. Not just the CEO or the finance writer who might be on the board...\n\nYeah.\n\n...but in the levels below. Because that's the talent pipeline. That's the future.\n\nYeah.\n\nIn our office, something that we we're always talking about is too much male energy.\n\nAnd so we have a sort of male energy measure in our office. And that's because we've made sure that the teams are equalised and that thing. But we try to make sure that all the teams that are working never become one gender. That's something that we've been watching, that actually when teams start to aggregate into the same gender, even when there's diversity in it, it starts to produce a certain kind of culture. And it actually affects the entire mood of the entire office.\n\nIt does.\n\nSomething that's been really important to us is how the micro team actually are organised and starts to dissolve that. Because then that kind of bonding agendas start to become much more soft.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd they don't just become male orientated or male interest only. They become soft and they become shared. And then that starts to have an effect. Because then when you start to see that kind of different team leaders winning there's a kind of idea that it's not about that one thing. You know? And it's something... we can tell with my leadership team when we've hit the male energy...\n\n...metre. We're like, what just happened? OK. Can somebody do the numbers? Oh, my god. We have more men in the office than women.\n\nDo you think there's a fine line between role model and exceptionalism?\n\nIt's a tough one.\n\nBecause, you know, I always sort of say...\n\nThat's a great point.\n\n...that we'll know that we've kind of really got to success when there are as many mediocre...\n\nCorrect.\n\n...women in charge of companies as there are mediocre men.\n\nThat's great.\n\n-- in charge of companies. Because it's so easy, isn't it?\n\nTotally agree.\n\nI just wrote something about this.\n\nBecause it's interesting, around International Women's Day in particular, I often do start to feel slightly exhausted. Because one is constantly being bombarded with all of these stories about these magnificent women, who are indeed magnificent.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it reinforces the idea that to get ahead, you have to be so much nicer, better, brilliant, more generous, more ethical, more everything.\n\nEverything.\n\nAnd it's exhausting.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nWho wants to keep thinking about this?\n\nYes.\n\nYou just want to get on with it.\n\nYeah. And you want to be mediocre.\n\nWell...\n\nIf it's okay for the man to be mediocre, why can't we be mediocre, too, now and again?\n\nThat is exactly what I said. You know, we must fight for the right to be as useless as anybody else.\n\nAnd this is the way that true equality lasts.\n\nParental leave, let's look at parental leave. How we look at parental leave, in the first place. In the roundtable this came up a lot. And a lot of the mothers on the panel talked about their problems that they had had in their career.\n\nAnd I think one of the most significant things we've done in 02 is run a career returners' programme.\n\nHow does that work?\n\nSo we brought women back into the workplace who've been out typically between two and 10 years, primarily having family, bringing them back on a 12-week course. And it's just all about giving them the opportunity to develop their self-confidence. You know, I can remember, it was many years ago, June, when I had my children. But you're off for months. And you really forget about the world of work. So giving women the opportunity to come back as part of a cohort, so they all join at the same time. Giving them a mentor, giving them a coach, and allowing them to come back into the workforce around about 12 weeks to develop their self-confidence.\n\nWhen we started Net-a-Porter, the first, I would say, 10 employees were actually dominant with male. Because we had IT, accounting, CFO. That's kind of natural at this stage. Quickly, we started to get more and more females in the company, because it's a female company. The audience is female. My reason was, OK, having two people to employ a woman or male... most of the employees were young. So you deal with finding talent. And when you find talent, you want to keep it. That talent, female, has to go on maternity leave. And it's a huge challenge for a young company when you find the talent, to actually find a replacement of that talent.\n\nAnd after 10 years, we were like, 3,500 employees. 2,500 were women. Out of these 2,500 women, you always have 50, 60 pregnant women. And actually, that kind of maternity hub we had at the company was actually a great way for us to find new talents. When you grow a company, number one, the woman being pregnant, most of the time that's 95 per cent Of the time what's coming back to the company. So effectively, you don't lose your talent. But more importantly, we had this hub of replacements who were there to support for three month, four months. We test them, and actually they were, for us, an amazing skill we had. They could be like, one... to replace someone in the accounting department. Actually, she would go into the magazine department.\n\nWow.\n\nSo effectively, that created amazing assets.\n\nIt became a training programme, almost.\n\nTotally. And actually, that' season for me, it really changed my vision on actually hiring young women. It is actually an amazing asset.\n\nYes. It is.\n\nI always talk about me loudly. So I'm a single mum to an 8-year old boy.\n\nWho is fabulous.\n\nThank you. I was promoted to be CEO of an operating company 10 months after having him.\n\nWow. What was that like?\n\nLook. I'm not going to lie. It was something I'd always wanted. But, my god, I was thinking, how am I going to do this? But I set my stall out. So I had conversations with my boss. I had conversations with clients about I am going to be more productive than I ever have been. I'm just going to work in a different way. And I think, again, it's about that conversation of normalising this.\n\nAnd how have you designed how you work? Because I think this is really important, particularly for women in the world of work, women who are mothers.\n\nYeah.\n\nUntil we get to the place where men are treated the same in terms of paternity, this is something we really have to look at for women. How did you design that?\n\nI talk about work-life blend rather than work-life balance. Because work is life and life is work. And you've got to know how to blend the two. And I am fortunate that I can have some help with childcare. I'm out of the office by 6 o'clock.\n\nOn the dot.\n\nI'm out of the office and I'm gone. And there will be a blackout window between 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock where I'm all focused on my son. And then after 8 o'clock I will answer emails. But I think the point about leaving loudly was, look, I am putting my spikes on and Lycra to compete in my son's sports race.\n\nAnd, I literally--\n\nYou're competitive.\n\nVery.\n\nIncredibly. And I will say what I'm doing. Because I think when you try and not talk about it and you try and hide it, it becomes something like a guilty secret. And it shouldn't be. It's part of your life.\n\nSpeaking of progression, one thing that we are really looking at a lot is promotion and searching out for the right candidates, and just thinking more broadly about that across industries. This whole idea of building up a pipeline is something that I know people spend a lot of time thinking about. And to me, it just seems like a no brainer. I mean, of course you have to have a strong\n\nOf course.\n\n...of women.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou can really start to paint this picture that there is something happening to decelerate the careers of women.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I'm going to, again, look at the proportion of women. Firstly, what we asked these organisations to report on is by their kind of seniority. So if we look at the junior staff in these same organisations that we looked at just a minute ago...\n\nBefore, yeah.\n\n...actually, junior levels are far more likely to be occupied by women.\n\nYup.\n\nBut then as you progress through the company's organisational structures, at middle management there's already a shift.\n\nShift. It's...\n\nIt's male dominated.\n\n...straight away. So there's some... because often when you look at people that report and work in this space, often they say it's the middle area is where the problem happens, in that women don't progress from the middle to the sort of C-suite. But actually, your data suggest it's actually happening here before we even get to the middle level.\n\nYeah. There is clearly something happening that's changing the gender structure between junior and middle levels. And, of course, you can guess. If I'd ask you to point on the screen where do you think the senior level customer is going to be...\n\n...you know, there's no surprise.\n\nNo surprise.\n\nAll the way over there in the corner.\n\nAll the way over there.\n\nAnd so I think what we're sort of seeing here is, again, just more reinforcement that there are some... you know, the data's great showing us the symptoms, if you like, of what's going on.\n\nBut I think this is really important. Because up until now, sort of the general thinking has been that women get stuck at the middle level. And so for companies wanting to address this problem, they're looking at the wrong place for the problem. This is suggesting we need to start much earlier...\n\nThat's right.\n\n...in the company pipeline.\n\nAnd so setting out things like the management of expectation for career pathways right from those junior levels, incredibly important. Now how companies react to this has been extremely interesting to watch. Because I think with the first wave of gender pay gap reporting, there was a suspicion that lot of companies were waiting until the very last moment to report their pay gap data, so that it would get lost in an avalanche of similarly bad pay gaps.\n\nSo many of them. We're not so bad. Look at them.\n\nBut there were a few companies that took an exception to that approach. One of them was easyJet, which did report a very big gender pay gap.\n\nRight.\n\nBut it reported it early on...\n\nYes.\n\n...and made a very big announcement, which was...\n\nAnnouncement that they were going to address it.\n\nWell, they effectively said, a lot of our pilots who are well-paid are male. And we're going to introduce a new recruitment programme...\n\nFor women.\n\n...specifically for recruiting female pilots. And so they took what could have been interpreted as a very negative press story about having a wide pay gap...\n\nAnd came up with a solution straight away.\n\nAnd turned up into something that I think generated far more positivity for them. We've taken a big look at specifically, finance. And I think finance is one where you look at how does that compare to the pay gap, overall. So we've still got the same axis here on this chart.\n\nYup.\n\nStill looking at the pay gap.\n\nYeah.\n\nThis time, we're going to look at the percentage of companies...\n\nThat are paying men more.\n\n..in the sector. Because they're all obviously different size industries, and so on. Now this line shows us the chart that we were really just looking at, which is all companies. okay? So that's that asymmetrical shape that we were just looking at. In finance, there's far fewer companies with no pay gap.\n\nWith no pay gap.\n\nThe proportion of companies with no pay gap is much smaller.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd if you look at the proportion of companies that are paying men more, that's what that looks like within finance.\n\nAnd what about paying women more?\n\nWell, you're going to have to get your magnifying glass out, because there's only a very few. And none of these... none of these companies here are actually what you would call big finance companies. It really is important to know with this data what you can and can't do. So, for example, we don't know how many employees there are in any of these companies, other than the fact...\n\nThat there's at least 250.\n\n...that there's at least 250. And they can report, companies, how many employees they have in an overall band. But it's not comprehensive enough. Some of our colleagues here have linked this data to other data on the size of companies. And what that reveals is actually about nine in 10 women will work for a company that pays men more. That's the figure.\n\nIs that just for finance, so that's across the board?\n\nThat's across the board, overall.\n\nNine in 10?\n\nNine in 10. So it's really interesting, this. Because...\n\nWhen you put it like that, it's even worse than it seems.\n\nBecause when we sort of around the figure off, we're sort of saying 14 per cent, whatever the current figure is at the moment. But actually when you put it like that, it just sounds terrible. Nine in 10.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo without question, the majority of women in this country will work for a business that pays men more.\n\nAbsolutely. Without doubt. And this is the first time that we've really been able to say that based on an extensive data set that gives us a snapshot of that.\n\nThat's a reality.\n\nWe need more women in finance.\n\nYes.\n\nOr more diversity in finance.\n\nYes.\n\nDiversity in finance is the issue. Diversity in finance.\n\nI think that finance is a big issue.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that tech and fintech...\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nAnd I feel really bad about this. Because it's almost like, these are the start-ups. Fintech is the kind of blank sheet. You don't have to have a history of unconscious bias, or anything else. And then you have technology companies that are worse.\n\nWorse.\n\nWorse, much worse.\n\nBut there's an interesting point here, a kind of paradox, which I don't really understand. You could not find a business, around this table or more broadly, that wouldn't agree with the proposition, what's your greatest asset in your business?\n\nPeople.\n\nMy people.\n\nYour people, right? So how much reporting of your people characteristics goes on? Not very much. I mean, it shouldn't have taken the government to come in with legislation to require that to be disclosed.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, it's quite hard to price what you can't manage, or what you can't measure.\n\nAnd what you can't measure. Yeah.\n\nI think there's a lot further we can go. You're starting with gender, which has been a great start, through ethnicity, and more broadly...\n\nAnd disability, and across the board.\n\nAnd then you've got a vehicle for investors to be able to shine a spotlight on these things.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd indeed, regulators. And absolutely, that needs to be thought about and reported and recorded, not just to your regulator, but to your investor.\n\nWhich is why I was saying at the start , the important thing is linking that measurement at the team levels into performance at the team levels. Because at the end, they're measuring their performance. Because that's the thing they're interested in. They've got to find the linkage at that level.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think investors were very slow off the mark around flexing their muscle, as it were. And partly because they felt self-conscious that actually, they didn't look particularly diverse, themselves. And now I think we've overcome that. And certainly, Legal & General has been right out there in front. And we've now got, within the 30% Club, an investor group of almost 30 institutional houses and over \u00a310tn of money. That's a lot of money. We do get together and when companies are really dragging their feet, or just even ignoring us completely.\n\nI think it's been really interesting, just to look for example here in the UK, at the pay gap legislation. For example, where for the first time... is really quite groundbreaking. And I think a lot of people in Britain don't realise how people around the rest of the world are quite amazed by this. The companies...\n\nAnd we're the only country doing it properly, actually.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so companies, for the first time, have to actually report their pay gap. So that was really exciting last year. But then this year, it's so interesting. In the last few weeks we've had... the BBC did this really interesting analysis. I'm sure you saw it, actually.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nFour out of 10 companies actually had a wider pay gap.\n\nPay gap.\n\nNot really where we were expecting to go.\n\nNo.\n\nAnd then it seems as though the sanctions that people thought were going to be imposed on companies that...\n\nWeren't.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo companies have been able to report figures that make no mathematical sense. And they haven't really been abiding by the guidelines, and nothing's happened. So that, to me, is a kind of a microcosm in a way of where we seem to be in a lot of areas.\n\nYes. And I think that's actually part of what needs to happen next with the women's movement, particularly in the workplace, which is I think we have to get really clear about what it is that we want and what it is that we expect. And then demand it in a really strategic way, and a systematic way.\n\nBecause when it is happening in isolation, when we're doing this in silos, you don't really have that sort of systemic change that you need for this to be something that's long lasting. And that's got to be the next phase of it. Otherwise, all it is we're complaining, we're shouting, but we're not actually forcing change. We're speaking truth to power, but we're not changing the power dynamic.\n\nRight, right, right. June, you spent the last couple of months working on this diversity series. What's been the big takeaway?\n\nNumber one, just how beneficial it is for the bottom line, and that actually companies need to see this as a way of future proofing their businesses. And then the second part is, it's just the right thing to do. Yes, it's a smart thing to do. But it's also the right thing to do. And I think what I've been most energised by is the way that, in the last couple of years, I've seen a sort of a willingness, at least an openness where people are actually open to at least having the conversation. And I think that, in itself, is a shift."

Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nFrom dining out or grabbing street food, to who cooks most at home or reaches for the takeaway delivery menu, the data gives intriguing tasters of eating habits around the world.\n\nIn the US, the average amount households spend weekly on eating out now exceeds their bill for food bought to eat at home.\n\nEating out often is common in some Asian countries, with a quarter of the population in Hong Kong and Taiwan doing so at least once a day. As the second slide shows, up to half of people in other Asian countries head for the street food stands.\n\nBack in the home, Indians and Ukrainians spend more than 13 hours a week in the kitchen \u2014 while the British and Americans take less than half that time.\n\nFinally, in the land of haute cuisine and esteemed home cooking, the French show a continuing disdain for the takeaway. More than 40 per cent never order takeout food, and more than 90 per cent do so less than twice a week."

    "text": "When Margaret McCabe gave birth to a daughter, she knew something had to change. She was exasperated by the gender discrimination she faced as a commercial barrister, and wanted to make the world a more equitable place for her child. \u201cI thought that by the time she grew up, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But it\u2019s still a problem,\u201d she says.\n\nMs McCabe, whose successful legal career had equipped her to deal with argument, negotiation and debate, felt these skills could help to improve social mobility among at-risk youth. In 2009 she founded a charity called Debate Mate to teach debating skills in under-resourced schools in London with her now-grown daughter, Scarlett. Drawing on her experience campaigning for the advancement of women and workplace equality, Ms McCabe decided to embed gender equality training into the foundation of Debate Mate.\n\nDebate Mate\u2019s training, heralded as \u201camazing\u201d by backer Bill Gates, has been so effective in schools that it is heading into the office. It aims to bring empowerment to the employees who need it most. Clients include Rolls-Royce, Tesco, BP, the Japanese bank Nomura and the UK government.\n\nAt its core, Ms McCabe says, it is a skills programme. Learning to communicate an idea simply and effectively builds confidence, something corporate women report to struggle with, especially as they increasingly enter industries where superiors are predominantly male.\n\nIf I could float confidence on the stock exchange, we would all be very rich\n\nMuch has been said of the \u201cconfidence gap\u201d or the difference in self-confidence between male and female employees that can have an impact on their trajectories and salaries. While women outperform men in school and are entering the workforce in record numbers, half of female managers in the UK reported self doubt about their job performance and careers. This compared with just one-third of male respondents, according the a 2011 study by the Institute of Leadership and Management.\n\nBut a confidence deficit is not the only reason why men still outpace women in the workplace. Debate Mate trains female staff to master skills such as empathetic listening and information processing that allow them to communicate more effectively. Women often struggle to get their ideas across fully before being interrupted.\n\nWomen still ask Ms McCabe about the best way to negotiate a pay rise, how to deal with professional evaluations, sexual harassment and balancing a career with children and family life. \u201cWe tend to work with younger women because they\u2019re the ones that are most interested,\u201d Ms McCabe says.\n\nNomura uses Debate Mate\u2019s corporate training for young women hoping to be chosen for the internship programme that it uses to select new employees.\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted to do was enhance our very junior workforce \u2026\u2026. so they can enter into a corporate environment that can be a bit confrontational,\u201d says Sarah Vincent, head of Emea graduate recruitment. Those who participate rapidly develop skills that help them communicate more effectively with clients.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re able to articulate their ideas and take a step back to think about what they want to say\u201d, she says, and they \u201ctend to do exceptionally well on the summer internship\u201d.\n\nConfidence is not necessarily the biggest hurdle for Debate Mate\u2019s corporate trainees. \u201cI think I\u2019m pretty confident,\u201d says Sophie, a senior adviser at law firm DLA Piper who participated in the training in 2018. \u201cFor me it\u2019s about slowing things down so I don\u2019t ramble, it\u2019s about bringing it in and channelling my nervous energy, controlling both my breath and physicality. It helped me cope when things don\u2019t go according to plan.\u201d\n\nDebate training breaks down into basic principles: listening, speaking, strategic teamwork, and dispassion. \u201cThey develop what I call a third eye, and can take a step back from the situation to figure out how to get what they want. It\u2019s what the Buddhists call dispassion,\u201d Ms McCabe says. \u201cDebaters can have a discussion, they don\u2019t lose their temper, and they can make a point.\u201d\n\nIn feedback from participants in the female corporate program, 100 per cent of women said that their ability to make a structure argument increased, and 91 per cent said that their ability to speak with confidence has increased.\n\nDebate Mate\u2019s corporate training is fun, participants say, because the programme is taught through games. In one, participants walk to one side of the room or the other, dependent on whether they agree or disagree with the premise of the topic, which could be something like, \u201cshould women make up 50 per cent of UK board seats?\u201d. Scarlett McCabe says participants must argue the opposite side of the choice they make, which helps develop empathy for opinions they do not believe in.\n\nIn a \u201cballoon\u201d game, participants are placed in an imaginary sinking hot air balloon and are assigned a celebrity they must pretend to be. They then argue why that celebrity should remain in the balloon, rather than be thrown overboard to reduce weight.\n\n\u201cPeople think you\u2019re born confident or you\u2019re not, but confidence is a skill,\u201d Scarlett McCabe says. \u201cYou can trick people into thinking you\u2019re confident. Clench your bum or clench your toes, it helps anchor and ground you, and lowers your voice. Take a deep breath before you talk so you don\u2019t start your sentence with an \u2018um\u2019.\u201d\n\nClaire Pelly of Virgin Galactic has worked with Debate Mate to provide corporate training through the professional women\u2019s organisation, BroadMinded. She says women initially find that speaking in front of a group \u201cis terrifying \u2014 they can\u2019t speak,\u201d but over the course of the training, the transformation she sees is extraordinary.\n\nMargaret McCabe laughs: \u201cIf I could float confidence on the stock exchange, we would all be very rich.\u201d"

    "text": "I started off in radio. From there I moved in to television. I went to MTV. What was really interesting for me was when I started at MTV not only was I one of the only working class people there, I was, to begin with, the only person of colour...only woman of colour there.\n\nI'd from a TV background, so I use fashion analogies. But I look at gender as almost wearing a coat that's just a bit too tight. And it's just slightly uncomfortable. You just know that there's a coat that's a little bit more comfortable, that would fit easier in terms of how you are treated. Racism, I would say, is coming into a room in a jacket that is seen as the completely wrong colour. There's nothing wrong with the jacket. You like it. You think it's great. But everybody else reacts in such a hostile way to that jacket that you're wearing.\n\nIs that literally how you feel?\n\nYes. And it feels very differently. That's why, for me, it's really important to have an intersectual conversation. Because the way I'm treated as a woman is very different to the way I'm treated because I'm black. They feel very different. And you know which form of discrimination you're experiencing because of the way it feels.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I think it's really important to make sure that others also understand that.\n\nYou would know more about this than me in that you've been studying gender and reporting on gender for such a long time. And I think what's interesting about the #MeToo movement - and I'd love to hear your opinion on it, too - is, of course, it's a moment of reckoning in that women are making sure that their voices are heard. They are expressing painful emotions that have been suppressed for so long. And I think that, you know, like with any shift - if you look at the civil rights movement - it was similar in the sense that when we started really calling out this level of injustice, racial injustice, it was a real reckoning.\n\nIt seems to me we've had this huge cultural shift.\n\nYes, which is great.\n\nWhich has been terrific.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut when it comes to actual real economic, financial, and political change...\n\nWhat is that? So I spent some time with Alan Smith, your data visualisation editor. And I was shocked by the data that he showed me.\n\nAlan, hello.\n\nHi, June. Nice to see you.\n\nNice to see you. So Alan, you are our man in the know when it comes to data.\n\nSo on this axis here, we're going to show what is the gap. So in the middle means there's no pay gap at all between men and women. In this direction is when you're paying men more. So at this level, you're paying men 50 per cent more than women.\n\nThat would be women being paid 50 per cent more. But what the data has shown us is that actually over three-quarters of companies that did report paid men more than women.\n\nWow.\n\nSo these are all the companies that are reporting a pay gap in favour of men.\n\nOh, my goodness.\n\nAnd you can see that that's a sizeable number.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo it's a big proportion. And what really completes this graphic, obviously, is do you want to see the companies that are paying women more, June?\n\nYes.\n\nThere they are. So there is a gap.\n\nThere is a huge difference.\n\nAnd what we're really looking at in this chart is just the lack of symmetry.\n\nYeah. And even the ones where we're getting to the 50 per cent mark, that's still worrying.\n\nThat's a big gap.\n\nThat's a huge gap.\n\nThat's a big gap.\n\nWe spoke with... I spoke with Ann Pickering from Telef\u00f3nica, 02. They have just managed, I think as of last year, their board is 50/50, which is wonderful. But that was something that she said was not easy. She literally had to be very clear with her executive search firms to say, do not send me a list that does not have 50 per cent women, 50 per cent men. And, wait for this. Some of them recused themselves.\n\nSo I found myself as the other...\n\nYes.\n\nI was the only woman in the room. And much as my male colleagues were a delight, I, metaphorically, I lost my voice. So that's when I realised how important diversity was. The penny dropped for me at that point. So when the opportunity arose to recruit additional people to the exec team, I would only work with a search firm that would be happy recruiting a 50/50 gender balance shortlist.\n\nRight, so you stipulated that.\n\nI stipulated that. You would be surprised, June, at the number of search firms who were uncomfortable with that request. So we didn't tend to work with them going forward. So for me, it's all about creating a level playing field. And I don't believe in quotas.\n\nOK.\n\nSo 50/50 gender balance shortlist, and then we chose the best person, who happened to be female. So it really does bring diversity of thinking. Yeah, we're all very different. So much better quality of debate in the board room, much broader range of views. Fantastic to have four role models for the women in our business. And I make sure that they get out there and they talk to our female colleagues. That's really, really important.\n\nWe filmed the roundtable with six key business leaders. And they all had different views on how you actually create change, and how you make sure that it's long lasting. And it was interesting, because Helena Morrissey doesn't believe in quotas even though the 30% Club kind of is a quota system, isn't it? That's kind of the whole point of it. But she doesn't believe in quotas, whereas Shriti Vadera and Karen Blackett believe that you need to have some sort of clear metric. You need to know what it is that you're working towards.\n\nI think the easier task, dare I say it, is women on boards.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nI think the more difficult one is senior women at the executive level...\n\nExecutive level, yeah.\n\n...rather than at the non-executive level, which by the way, is the source of the pay gap.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nThe representation of that. And I think that I worry a little bit that the exclusive issue of a focus on board level has actually also taken women out of executive positions into going portfolio possibly a little earlier. And I think we really need to focus on women and being at the executive...\n\nAt the executive level.\n\nSenior executive level.\n\nAnd also on the executive committees, as well, which is key. Yeah.\n\nThe executive committees. Not just the CEO or the finance writer who might be on the board...\n\nYeah.\n\n...but in the levels below. Because that's the talent pipeline. That's the future.\n\nYeah.\n\nIn our office, something that we we're always talking about is too much male energy.\n\nAnd so we have a sort of male energy measure in our office. And that's because we've made sure that the teams are equalised and that thing. But we try to make sure that all the teams that are working never become one gender. That's something that we've been watching, that actually when teams start to aggregate into the same gender, even when there's diversity in it, it starts to produce a certain kind of culture. And it actually affects the entire mood of the entire office.\n\nIt does.\n\nSomething that's been really important to us is how the micro team actually are organised and starts to dissolve that. Because then that kind of bonding agendas start to become much more soft.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd they don't just become male orientated or male interest only. They become soft and they become shared. And then that starts to have an effect. Because then when you start to see that kind of different team leaders winning there's a kind of idea that it's not about that one thing. You know? And it's something... we can tell with my leadership team when we've hit the male energy...\n\n...metre. We're like, what just happened? OK. Can somebody do the numbers? Oh, my god. We have more men in the office than women.\n\nDo you think there's a fine line between role model and exceptionalism?\n\nIt's a tough one.\n\nBecause, you know, I always sort of say...\n\nThat's a great point.\n\n...that we'll know that we've kind of really got to success when there are as many mediocre...\n\nCorrect.\n\n...women in charge of companies as there are mediocre men.\n\nThat's great.\n\n-- in charge of companies. Because it's so easy, isn't it?\n\nTotally agree.\n\nI just wrote something about this.\n\nBecause it's interesting, around International Women's Day in particular, I often do start to feel slightly exhausted. Because one is constantly being bombarded with all of these stories about these magnificent women, who are indeed magnificent.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it reinforces the idea that to get ahead, you have to be so much nicer, better, brilliant, more generous, more ethical, more everything.\n\nEverything.\n\nAnd it's exhausting.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nWho wants to keep thinking about this?\n\nYes.\n\nYou just want to get on with it.\n\nYeah. And you want to be mediocre.\n\nWell...\n\nIf it's okay for the man to be mediocre, why can't we be mediocre, too, now and again?\n\nThat is exactly what I said. You know, we must fight for the right to be as useless as anybody else.\n\nAnd this is the way that true equality lasts.\n\nParental leave, let's look at parental leave. How we look at parental leave, in the first place. In the roundtable this came up a lot. And a lot of the mothers on the panel talked about their problems that they had had in their career.\n\nAnd I think one of the most significant things we've done in 02 is run a career returners' programme.\n\nHow does that work?\n\nSo we brought women back into the workplace who've been out typically between two and 10 years, primarily having family, bringing them back on a 12-week course. And it's just all about giving them the opportunity to develop their self-confidence. You know, I can remember, it was many years ago, June, when I had my children. But you're off for months. And you really forget about the world of work. So giving women the opportunity to come back as part of a cohort, so they all join at the same time. Giving them a mentor, giving them a coach, and allowing them to come back into the workforce around about 12 weeks to develop their self-confidence.\n\nWhen we started Net-a-Porter, the first, I would say, 10 employees were actually dominant with male. Because we had IT, accounting, CFO. That's kind of natural at this stage. Quickly, we started to get more and more females in the company, because it's a female company. The audience is female. My reason was, OK, having two people to employ a woman or male... most of the employees were young. So you deal with finding talent. And when you find talent, you want to keep it. That talent, female, has to go on maternity leave. And it's a huge challenge for a young company when you find the talent, to actually find a replacement of that talent.\n\nAnd after 10 years, we were like, 3,500 employees. 2,500 were women. Out of these 2,500 women, you always have 50, 60 pregnant women. And actually, that kind of maternity hub we had at the company was actually a great way for us to find new talents. When you grow a company, number one, the woman being pregnant, most of the time that's 95 per cent Of the time what's coming back to the company. So effectively, you don't lose your talent. But more importantly, we had this hub of replacements who were there to support for three month, four months. We test them, and actually they were, for us, an amazing skill we had. They could be like, one... to replace someone in the accounting department. Actually, she would go into the magazine department.\n\nWow.\n\nSo effectively, that created amazing assets.\n\nIt became a training programme, almost.\n\nTotally. And actually, that' season for me, it really changed my vision on actually hiring young women. It is actually an amazing asset.\n\nYes. It is.\n\nI always talk about me loudly. So I'm a single mum to an 8-year old boy.\n\nWho is fabulous.\n\nThank you. I was promoted to be CEO of an operating company 10 months after having him.\n\nWow. What was that like?\n\nLook. I'm not going to lie. It was something I'd always wanted. But, my god, I was thinking, how am I going to do this? But I set my stall out. So I had conversations with my boss. I had conversations with clients about I am going to be more productive than I ever have been. I'm just going to work in a different way. And I think, again, it's about that conversation of normalising this.\n\nAnd how have you designed how you work? Because I think this is really important, particularly for women in the world of work, women who are mothers.\n\nYeah.\n\nUntil we get to the place where men are treated the same in terms of paternity, this is something we really have to look at for women. How did you design that?\n\nI talk about work-life blend rather than work-life balance. Because work is life and life is work. And you've got to know how to blend the two. And I am fortunate that I can have some help with childcare. I'm out of the office by 6 o'clock.\n\nOn the dot.\n\nI'm out of the office and I'm gone. And there will be a blackout window between 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock where I'm all focused on my son. And then after 8 o'clock I will answer emails. But I think the point about leaving loudly was, look, I am putting my spikes on and Lycra to compete in my son's sports race.\n\nAnd, I literally--\n\nYou're competitive.\n\nVery.\n\nIncredibly. And I will say what I'm doing. Because I think when you try and not talk about it and you try and hide it, it becomes something like a guilty secret. And it shouldn't be. It's part of your life.\n\nSpeaking of progression, one thing that we are really looking at a lot is promotion and searching out for the right candidates, and just thinking more broadly about that across industries. This whole idea of building up a pipeline is something that I know people spend a lot of time thinking about. And to me, it just seems like a no brainer. I mean, of course you have to have a strong\n\nOf course.\n\n...of women.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou can really start to paint this picture that there is something happening to decelerate the careers of women.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I'm going to, again, look at the proportion of women. Firstly, what we asked these organisations to report on is by their kind of seniority. So if we look at the junior staff in these same organisations that we looked at just a minute ago...\n\nBefore, yeah.\n\n...actually, junior levels are far more likely to be occupied by women.\n\nYup.\n\nBut then as you progress through the company's organisational structures, at middle management there's already a shift.\n\nShift. It's...\n\nIt's male dominated.\n\n...straight away. So there's some... because often when you look at people that report and work in this space, often they say it's the middle area is where the problem happens, in that women don't progress from the middle to the sort of C-suite. But actually, your data suggest it's actually happening here before we even get to the middle level.\n\nYeah. There is clearly something happening that's changing the gender structure between junior and middle levels. And, of course, you can guess. If I'd ask you to point on the screen where do you think the senior level customer is going to be...\n\n...you know, there's no surprise.\n\nNo surprise.\n\nAll the way over there in the corner.\n\nAll the way over there.\n\nAnd so I think what we're sort of seeing here is, again, just more reinforcement that there are some... you know, the data's great showing us the symptoms, if you like, of what's going on.\n\nBut I think this is really important. Because up until now, sort of the general thinking has been that women get stuck at the middle level. And so for companies wanting to address this problem, they're looking at the wrong place for the problem. This is suggesting we need to start much earlier...\n\nThat's right.\n\n...in the company pipeline.\n\nAnd so setting out things like the management of expectation for career pathways right from those junior levels, incredibly important. Now how companies react to this has been extremely interesting to watch. Because I think with the first wave of gender pay gap reporting, there was a suspicion that lot of companies were waiting until the very last moment to report their pay gap data, so that it would get lost in an avalanche of similarly bad pay gaps.\n\nSo many of them. We're not so bad. Look at them.\n\nBut there were a few companies that took an exception to that approach. One of them was easyJet, which did report a very big gender pay gap.\n\nRight.\n\nBut it reported it early on...\n\nYes.\n\n...and made a very big announcement, which was...\n\nAnnouncement that they were going to address it.\n\nWell, they effectively said, a lot of our pilots who are well-paid are male. And we're going to introduce a new recruitment programme...\n\nFor women.\n\n...specifically for recruiting female pilots. And so they took what could have been interpreted as a very negative press story about having a wide pay gap...\n\nAnd came up with a solution straight away.\n\nAnd turned up into something that I think generated far more positivity for them. We've taken a big look at specifically, finance. And I think finance is one where you look at how does that compare to the pay gap, overall. So we've still got the same axis here on this chart.\n\nYup.\n\nStill looking at the pay gap.\n\nYeah.\n\nThis time, we're going to look at the percentage of companies...\n\nThat are paying men more.\n\n..in the sector. Because they're all obviously different size industries, and so on. Now this line shows us the chart that we were really just looking at, which is all companies. okay? So that's that asymmetrical shape that we were just looking at. In finance, there's far fewer companies with no pay gap.\n\nWith no pay gap.\n\nThe proportion of companies with no pay gap is much smaller.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd if you look at the proportion of companies that are paying men more, that's what that looks like within finance.\n\nAnd what about paying women more?\n\nWell, you're going to have to get your magnifying glass out, because there's only a very few. And none of these... none of these companies here are actually what you would call big finance companies. It really is important to know with this data what you can and can't do. So, for example, we don't know how many employees there are in any of these companies, other than the fact...\n\nThat there's at least 250.\n\n...that there's at least 250. And they can report, companies, how many employees they have in an overall band. But it's not comprehensive enough. Some of our colleagues here have linked this data to other data on the size of companies. And what that reveals is actually about nine in 10 women will work for a company that pays men more. That's the figure.\n\nIs that just for finance, so that's across the board?\n\nThat's across the board, overall.\n\nNine in 10?\n\nNine in 10. So it's really interesting, this. Because...\n\nWhen you put it like that, it's even worse than it seems.\n\nBecause when we sort of around the figure off, we're sort of saying 14 per cent, whatever the current figure is at the moment. But actually when you put it like that, it just sounds terrible. Nine in 10.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo without question, the majority of women in this country will work for a business that pays men more.\n\nAbsolutely. Without doubt. And this is the first time that we've really been able to say that based on an extensive data set that gives us a snapshot of that.\n\nThat's a reality.\n\nWe need more women in finance.\n\nYes.\n\nOr more diversity in finance.\n\nYes.\n\nDiversity in finance is the issue. Diversity in finance.\n\nI think that finance is a big issue.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that tech and fintech...\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nAnd I feel really bad about this. Because it's almost like, these are the start-ups. Fintech is the kind of blank sheet. You don't have to have a history of unconscious bias, or anything else. And then you have technology companies that are worse.\n\nWorse.\n\nWorse, much worse.\n\nBut there's an interesting point here, a kind of paradox, which I don't really understand. You could not find a business, around this table or more broadly, that wouldn't agree with the proposition, what's your greatest asset in your business?\n\nPeople.\n\nMy people.\n\nYour people, right? So how much reporting of your people characteristics goes on? Not very much. I mean, it shouldn't have taken the government to come in with legislation to require that to be disclosed.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, it's quite hard to price what you can't manage, or what you can't measure.\n\nAnd what you can't measure. Yeah.\n\nI think there's a lot further we can go. You're starting with gender, which has been a great start, through ethnicity, and more broadly...\n\nAnd disability, and across the board.\n\nAnd then you've got a vehicle for investors to be able to shine a spotlight on these things.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd indeed, regulators. And absolutely, that needs to be thought about and reported and recorded, not just to your regulator, but to your investor.\n\nWhich is why I was saying at the start , the important thing is linking that measurement at the team levels into performance at the team levels. Because at the end, they're measuring their performance. Because that's the thing they're interested in. They've got to find the linkage at that level.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think investors were very slow off the mark around flexing their muscle, as it were. And partly because they felt self-conscious that actually, they didn't look particularly diverse, themselves. And now I think we've overcome that. And certainly, Legal & General has been right out there in front. And we've now got, within the 30% Club, an investor group of almost 30 institutional houses and over \u00a310tn of money. That's a lot of money. We do get together and when companies are really dragging their feet, or just even ignoring us completely.\n\nI think it's been really interesting, just to look for example here in the UK, at the pay gap legislation. For example, where for the first time... is really quite groundbreaking. And I think a lot of people in Britain don't realise how people around the rest of the world are quite amazed by this. The companies...\n\nAnd we're the only country doing it properly, actually.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so companies, for the first time, have to actually report their pay gap. So that was really exciting last year. But then this year, it's so interesting. In the last few weeks we've had... the BBC did this really interesting analysis. I'm sure you saw it, actually.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nFour out of 10 companies actually had a wider pay gap.\n\nPay gap.\n\nNot really where we were expecting to go.\n\nNo.\n\nAnd then it seems as though the sanctions that people thought were going to be imposed on companies that...\n\nWeren't.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo companies have been able to report figures that make no mathematical sense. And they haven't really been abiding by the guidelines, and nothing's happened. So that, to me, is a kind of a microcosm in a way of where we seem to be in a lot of areas.\n\nYes. And I think that's actually part of what needs to happen next with the women's movement, particularly in the workplace, which is I think we have to get really clear about what it is that we want and what it is that we expect. And then demand it in a really strategic way, and a systematic way.\n\nBecause when it is happening in isolation, when we're doing this in silos, you don't really have that sort of systemic change that you need for this to be something that's long lasting. And that's got to be the next phase of it. Otherwise, all it is we're complaining, we're shouting, but we're not actually forcing change. We're speaking truth to power, but we're not changing the power dynamic.\n\nRight, right, right. June, you spent the last couple of months working on this diversity series. What's been the big takeaway?\n\nNumber one, just how beneficial it is for the bottom line, and that actually companies need to see this as a way of future proofing their businesses. And then the second part is, it's just the right thing to do. Yes, it's a smart thing to do. But it's also the right thing to do. And I think what I've been most energised by is the way that, in the last couple of years, I've seen a sort of a willingness, at least an openness where people are actually open to at least having the conversation. And I think that, in itself, is a shift."

    "text": "Like many women, I devoured Lean In, Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s corporate feminism manifesto, during my toddler\u2019s nap time.\n\nBut one statement stopped me cold: \u201cI truly believe that the single most important career decision that a woman makes is whether she will have a life partner and who that partner is.\u201d\n\nWhen I became accidentally (albeit, at 39, happily) pregnant, I left my dream portfolio management job as a concession to my child\u2019s father, who took a dim view of babysitting while I jetted off to meet (male) chief executives and drink with (male) colleagues.\n\nMy personal circumstances are unusual: most women with graduate degrees don\u2019t have \u201coops babies\u201d. But leaving a job for a man is not. My departure coincided with a wave of female attrition in my division. When I started there were lots of women, but in the space of a few short years most of us left.\n\nMany of us did not leave because of our kids \u2014 we left because of their fathers.\n\nI take issue with a system that expects solutions to the dual-income household to come largely from within that household\n\nThe \u201cassortative maters\u201d \u2014 similar people who marry each other \u2014 left because their husbands did well. One, because her husband was appointed to a high-level position in the Obama administration; another, because she had two young children and a senior executive husband with an insane travel schedule.\n\nOthers of us left because it was the husband\u2019s \u201cturn\u201d to develop his career. One married into a family that owned a small business, and they relocated back to his roots on becoming parents. They divorced within a couple of years, leaving her a single parent stranded in a town with reduced career prospects. Similarly, after quitting my job and moving to a small town to accommodate my baby-daddy\u2019s desire to flip fixer-upper houses, I ultimately quit him too.\n\nTo sum up: we left because none of us had ended up with the \u201cunicorn\u201d husbands Ms Sandberg lauded in her book \u2014 saintly men enough like us to appreciate our ambition, but not threatened by our success. If these mythical creatures have careers, they are not \u201ctrump\u201d careers. In some sense they would be a version of 1960s-era housewives, whose misery was grimly detailed in Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique.\n\nI do not take issue with Lean In\u2019s point about the blessing of a supportive spouse \u2014 by all means, sign me up for one. But I do take issue with a system that expects solutions to the dual-income household to come largely from within that household.\n\nOur bosses were not there for the tense negotiations over travel calendars we had with our kids\u2019 fathers\n\nOur bosses were not present for the tense negotiations over scheduling and travel calendars with the fathers of our children, or for the anxious moments staring at airport displays, or for arriving home to news that the nanny is quitting \u2014 and the subsequent fight with our life partner about who doesn\u2019t travel until we find a replacement.\n\nWomen may have made tremendous progress in the workforce since The Feminine Mystique, but corporate support for their widely varying families has not kept pace. Ms Sandberg herself acknowledged this in an essay after her husband\u2019s death: \u201cSome people felt that I did not spend enough time writing about the difficulties women face when they have an unsupportive partner or no partner at all. They were right.\u201d\n\nEven my son recognises the zero-sum game too often played by working parents. He claims he is not planning to have kids, with reasoning wise beyond his seven years: \u201cBecause I\u2019ll be too busy working in my bakery.\u201d (He has decided on a career as a baker, perhaps as a defence mechanism against a mother who eschews cooking.)\n\nJoint custody: criterion for success?\n\nThanks to 50-50 custody, which blurs lines between \u201cmothers\u201d and \u201cfathers\u201d and renders traditionally gendered behaviours androgynous, my son is no stranger to the career sacrifices parents \u2014 mothers and fathers \u2014 make. And his parents are arguably among the luckier ones, professionally; the silver lining of living without one\u2019s child half the time is greater flexibility to work long hours and travel. But joint custody should surely not be a criterion for career success.\n\nOnly when companies start to think about how to address the structural impediments to career and family harmony will we be able to lay Lean In\u2019s partner directive to rest. For the sake of our grandchildren, corporate America should address these twin challenges: two-income households with kids where one income had to shrink, and single-parent homes that cannot accommodate its demands.\n\nThe writer is a bond portfolio manager at Weaver Barksdale, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School \u2014 and a veteran manager of conflicting travel and custody schedules"

Do something simple to start with.\u201d\n\nThe advice was well-meant, but Ms Belkahia and her business partner Jeremy Stoss, whom she had met at a strategy consultancy, ignored it, packed their bags and headed to Ivory Coast.\n\nThey set about persuading ret\u00adailers in the city of Abidjan to distribute their products on the fledgling online platform, Afrimarket. They tried to register the company in France only for Ms Belkahia to find that because she was foreign (Moroccan) and a student, she could not be appointed as its chairman.\n\nYet by 2017 she was part of a small delegation that accompanied French president Emmanuel Macron on an official visit to west Africa; last month she was hailed as an entrepreneurial star by French business title Challenges.\n\nMs Belkahia, now 29, was determined to prove the naysayers wrong. \u201cWhen the door is closed, you must go through the window,\u201d she says. Brimming with energy, in a smart suit and shirt, she is speaking in her offices near Montmartre, Paris. A pile of samples \u2014 toothpaste, deodorant and cleaning products \u2014 are on the table in front of her.\n\n23 Rania Belkahia\u2019s age when she co-founded Afrimarket, against the advice of more experienced entrepreneurs\n\nDemographic trends across Africa were ripe for ecommerce, says Ms Belkahia, reeling off statistics: a fast-growing middle class is expected to surge by more than half between 2020 and 2030, and mobile internet penetration is set to reach 38 per cent by 2020. Meanwhile, online retail penetration remains below 1 per cent, she says.\n\nMs Belkahia emailed Xavier Niel, one of the richest men in France and a well-known angel investor, for backing. When he did not respond she simply repeated the at\u00adtempt until she piqued his interest. Mr Niel and other angel in\u00advestors, such as Jacques-Antoine Granjon, founder of ecommerce site Veepee, invested \u20ac500,000 to fund a pilot phase for Afrimarket in Ivory Coast in 2013. A second fundraising round followed in 2015 to expand into four more west African countries.\n\nSo far, Afrimarket has raised a total of \u20ac20m from investors, and its workforce has grown to 30 employees in Paris and 180 in west Africa. Initially it offered a curated online marketplace of goods stretching from food, beauty and home appliances to building materials and even live animals.\n\nSince then Afrimarket has added two more lines. One is helping international brands to market, sell and distribute products \u2014 it recently won exclusive on\u00adline distribution for three of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s brands in French-speaking Africa. It has also launched a transport and logistics service that conducts \u201clast-mile\u201d delivery for third parties.\n\n\u20ac70 \u2014 \u20ac90 Average basket size of Afrimarket\u2019s half-million clients\n\nAfrimarket now has half a million clients who have made at least one transaction, with an average basket size of between \u20ac70 and \u20ac90. It processes an average 250,000 orders a month. The company had \u20ac30m of revenues in 2018 and plans to double that this year.\n\nMs Belkahia, who went to school in Casablanca in Morocco, before moving to France for university, says her bicultural upbringing has been an ad\u00advantage. \u201cI always had a foot in Europe and a foot in Africa. It has given me both perspectives and an understanding of Africa from on the ground.\u201d She travels to west Africa several times a month.\n\n38 Predicted mobile internet penetration across Africa by 2020\n\nShe initially trained as an engineer, \u201cwhich allows me to be very structured and straight to the point,\u201d she says. \u201cI do not trust ideas, I like to look at the data.\u201d\n\nLike many other start-ups, Afrimarket has performed a pivot. Initially the plan was to sell online products from African retailers to the African diaspora in Europe, before deciding to target a much bigger market: the emerging middle class in west Africa.\n\nRania Belkahia was determined to prove the naysayers wrong. \u201cWhen the door is closed, you must go through the window.\u201d \u00a9 Magali Delporte\n\nAnother big shift related to customer delivery. At first Afrimarket relied on other parties for logistics, which meant \u201cwe weren\u2019t able to control the end del\u00adivery\u201d, says Ms Belkahia. \u201cA customer who has a problem with their delivery is a customer lost.\u201d\n\nThe answer was to oversee the entire journey from sourcing of goods through to the last-mile delivery. That came with challenges of its own because many of Afrimarket\u2019s customers in rural areas do not have a formal address, and most pay cash on delivery.\n\n\u201cWe work with GPS location so that the customer gives us the directions that allow us to place a point on the map,\u201d Ms Belkahia says. \u201cThe moment the delivery person is at the site he tags the address of the customer and then this is recorded in our system for future deliveries.\u201d Afrimarket records data on distances, journey time and traffic volumes to develop its internal algorithms to optimise deliveries.\n\nThe moment the delivery person is at the site he tags the address of the customer\n\nAfrimarket\u2019s main competitor is Rocket Internet\u2019s much bigger online shopping platform Jumia, and Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba is also starting to make a play for the continent. But Ms Belkahia believes Afrimar\u00adket\u2019s curated marketplace and own log\u00adistics give it an advantage, and is pressing on with plans to expand into Guinea, Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania. She says: \u201cI want people to think of Africa and think \u2018we will call Afrimarket because they know Africa, they know Africans and they know how to operate there\u2019.\u201d"

    "text": "Andrea Mitchell has been a luminary of lunchtime television in America for a decade, hosting a popular MNSBC news show. No wonder: she is smart, with expertise in foreign and domestic policy, and has an attractive, warm demeanour.\n\nShe is also, at 72 years old, well past the age that many Europeans \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, Americans \u2014 would have retired.\n\nShe is not alone. Lesley Stahl is a star of US television journalism at 77. Judy Woodruff is anchor of PBS NewsHour at 72; Oprah Winfrey is a media entrepreneur at 65; Gayle King, breakfast show host, is 64, while Christiane Amanpour, another host, is 61. Maria Bartiromo and Mika Brzezinski are a more youthful 51.\n\nYes, in recent months there has been a buzz about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year old Congresswoman from New York who is shaking up leftwing politics. But it is actually Nancy Pelosi, House speaker, who dominates Democratic policymaking \u2014 and the television screens \u2014 at 78. Her fellow Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, wields huge influence at 85. Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand are campaigning to become the next Democratic presidential candidates, at the ages of 58, 54 and 52, respectively.\n\nBeyond politics, Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve chair, is a prominent face on television screens at 72.\n\nThe presence of these older female faces in the US public sphere is both striking and thrilling \u2014 at least for a 51-year-old woman, like me, who grew up in England\n\nOn one level, this should not be surprising. Women make up half the population and have a life expectancy of 81, compared with 76 for men, and America\u2019s elite circles \u2014 not just television screens \u2014 are brimming with men in their sixties, seventies and eighties, including the president, who is 72.\n\nBut on another level, the presence of these older female faces in the US public sphere is both striking and thrilling \u2014 at least it is for a 51-year-old woman, like me, who grew up in England. In my childhood, I saw only two middle-aged female faces regularly on television who commanded influence and power: Margaret Thatcher, the late prime minister, and Queen Elizabeth II. The other women on TV \u2014 or in the public eye generally \u2014 were mostly youthful newscasters or actresses.\n\nTo some extent, that remains the case in British media. Yes, there are now plenty of middle-aged women in the public sphere: in politics, just think of prime minister Theresa May, or Amber Rudd, a senior minister. But while older women have become stars with lifestyle shows, such as the cook Mary Berry, it is older men who host news shows. Emily Maitlis, host of BBC\u2019s Newsnight, is an exception \u2014 but at just 48, she is a mere kid compared with Ms Mitchell or Ms King.\n\nAlmost none has grey hair, one exception in Washington being Frenchwoman Christine Lagarde\n\nWhy? A cynic might argue that the longevity of women on US television partly reflects improvements in plastic surgery and other cosmetic enhancements. Older women in the public eye in America tend to look fabulously youthful. Almost none has grey hair, one exception in Washington being Frenchwoman Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, who sports stylish grey hair and wrinkles.\n\nAnother aspect that might explain the transatlantic difference is that while the UK elite considers it normal to retire in their early sixties, this is not the case among its US counterparts. On the contrary, in keeping with America\u2019s spirit of reinvention, it is now normal in Washington and New York for middle-aged people to relaunch themselves repeatedly in different career realms.\n\nAppearing on television at 72, in other words, reflects a wider zeitgeist.\n\nA third factor perpetuates this: demonstration effect. TV executives used to blame the lack of older women on their screens on audience taste: they would, it was said, be less popular than younger female presenters and not command the same credibility as men. There was probably some truth to that: precisely because older women were so invisible, audiences found it jarring to see them on screen.\n\nThe subliminal message, in terms of raising female ambition, is huge\n\nBut American television has shown that what seems odd in one generation can quickly become normal in another: these days the older women are not just accepted by audiences, but are very popular, too. That creates a self-reinforcing dynamic: every time a girl switches on a television, she can see visual inspiration on the screen and a message that it is entirely normal for a woman to have a voice \u2014 at any age. The subliminal message this sends, in terms of raising female ambition, is huge.\n\nThis in itself will not change the world, let alone rectify all the other gender problems. And, yes, there is still much further to go: true equality on screen would entail having plenty of women who are not obliged to look glamorous at any age \u2014 some channels still feature a preponderance of youthful blondes. But the fact that Ms Mitchell, Ms King or Ms Bartiromo are still appearing on American screens represents progress. We should cheer it \u2014 whatever our age.\n\nThe writer is US managing editor"

    "text": "As a child, Claire Valoti would sometimes help out in the family business, the Alhambra Hotel in King's Cross, London. Working alongside her parents, her tasks included scrubbing the sinks.\n\nNow, as vice-president international of Snap Inc, the parent company of disappearing-message app Snapchat, she reflects on the split between work and home. \u201cI think my upbringing has enabled me to realise that you can be quite fluid with it,\u201d she says.\n\nHer own two daughters do not come to her workplace, \u201cso you automatically have some sort of distinction. However, there isn\u2019t a \u2018mummy\u2019s working now\u2019 or \u2018mummy\u2019s not working now\u2019.\u201d\n\nSitting alongside her in Snap\u2019s London HQ in Soho is her mother Martine Valoti, who has run the Alhambra with her husband since 1980. She says that the notion of work-life balance is complicated if your place of work is your home, and you share your home with your clients \u2014 in her case, the guests of the hotel.\n\n\u201cI was working when I had to and [the children] were used to it,\u201d says Martine Valoti. \u201cThey were used to me sharing my time so I think they accepted it because that was all they knew.\u201d It is an intuitive concept: children learn about the realities of the world through the prism of their parents.\n\nI don\u2019t see a distinction between work and home. I think my upbringing has enabled me to realise that you can be quite fluid with it\n\nJill Armstrong is a researcher at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge university and author of a book, Like Mother, Like Daughter?, on how career women influence their daughters. She says that for daughters \u201cthere is a lot of walking in their mothers\u2019 footsteps\u201d. According to her research sample of British women, daughters of career mothers learn that careers are rewarding, worthwhile and the norm.\n\nDespite the tendency among women to focus on difficulties balancing working and mothering, Ms Armstrong found that all the daughters in her sample felt \u201cwell mothered\u201d. This was down to their mothers being mentally and emotionally present when they were around, as well being clear about their availability and attending key events \u2014 at school when other parents would be there, for example. She also found the daughters appreciated that their mothers \u201cencouraged independence\u201d.\n\nAlthough daughters learn that having a career is normal, a working mother may not be the most decisive factor in shaping their careers.\n\nA 2015 Harvard study of 24 countries found that being raised by an employed mother was associated with a modest 4.5 per cent increase in the daughter\u2019s likelihood of being employed, although they were 19 per cent more likely to hold supervisory roles.\n\nMs Armstrong found that maternal employment is not a predictor of career success, but having a working mother is a positive and often formative experience. As well as imparting work ethic and motivation, she also found that one-third of daughters entered the same or similar careers to their mothers, compared with the 11 per cent who followed their fathers.\n\nSusan Allen Augustin and Florence Greenaway \u00a9 Julia Sch\u00f6nst\u00e4dt We were always having conversations about general politics, about women \u2014 in the workspace and more generally in the world\n\nSusan Allen Augustin, diversity and inclusion manager at the Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic body founded by George Soros, entered a similar field to her mother. Florence Greenaway was responsible for recruiting doctors from minority groups at a hospital in Boston, in the US, when her daughter was growing up.\n\n\u201cI was in non-profits and ended up in inclusion but that wasn\u2019t intentional,\u201d says Ms Allen Augustin, who attended work events with her mother and met her medical recruits.\n\n\u201cShe was never directive in the specifics, but we were always having conversations about general politics, about women \u2014 in the workspace and more generally in the world. It was never framed as formal advice, we just had conversations about what was happening,\u201d she says.\n\nMyriam Bouzouaia has kept even more closely aligned: not only is she a vet in Tunisia like her mother, Asma Bouazza Bouzouaia, but she now works for her. As a child, she saw at first-hand the pressures of professional responsibilities. After her mother set up Clinique V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire de La Marsa, the second veterinary clinic in the coastal town of La Marsa, she would sometimes need to abandon family holidays to deal with emergency calls. Now, many other veterinary practices have opened in the area but old habits die hard.\n\n\u201cMy mother is still stressed, that hasn\u2019t changed. Something not so good is that she passed that stress on to me. But that can also be good because when we stress it is [because] we want to do our work well,\u201d says Myriam Bouzouaia, who has worked at the family practice for two and half years and says she still loses sleep the night before a big surgery.\n\nMyriam Bouzouaia and Asma Bouazza Bouzouaia \u00a9 Layli Foroudi [My mother] is still stressed, that hasn\u2019t changed. Something not so good is that she passed that stress on to me. But that can also be good\n\nWhen Claire Valoti travels for work, she tries to explain to her young daughters what she does, and the enjoyment and energy she gets from her job. But she suffers guilt. \u201cI still have an old-fashioned and traditional view about how I want to look after my home. That\u2019s not all women, that\u2019s just the way I am. I\u2019ve put myself under additional pressure \u2014 to go to work and be successful, but also make sure I\u2019m running an amazing home, that the house is always spotless and the kids are all fine.\u201d\n\nShe feels that her generation of mothers are \u201cperfectionists\u201d and under ever more pressure to make sure that their children \u201care doing everything\u201d.\n\nMs Armstrong\u2019s research found that despite having working (or career-oriented) mothers, many of the daughters planned to work part-time after having children.\n\nThey were thinking in terms of the amount of hours they would give to work and the amount of hours they would give to their children\n\nShe says: \u201cThey were thinking about it in terms of the amount of hours that they would give to work and the amount of hours that they would give to their children. It\u2019s a zero-sum game that you\u2019re never going to win.\u201d\n\nMs Greenaway says she felt little motherly guilt when raising Ms Allen Augustin because she shared the responsibility with her husband and two older children. \u201cI am from a culture where we are taught that \u2018it takes a village to raise a child\u2019 so I always had support, and when I took that specific job I said I needed flexibility because of my children,\u201d says Ms Greenaway. She has just moved to London to help look after her grandson.\n\nDespite pursuing a very different career path to her mother\u2019s, Claire Valoti says her parents\u2019 approach to running a hotel has served her well in working life. \u201cIt\u2019s their own business and you saw just how much they care about their customers,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I went into a more corporate environment, I took those values. I learnt to care more from early on.\u201d\n\nOnline peer pressure While on maternity leave, Susan Allen Augustin downloaded the Peanut app, or \u201cmommy Tinder\u201d as she calls it. Users swipe up to \u201cwave\u201d and make a mum-friend, or swipe down to decline. Ms Allen Augustin found other mothers to meet up with for coffee and conversation while their kids crawled around on a baby blanket. \u201cWith our mothers, they were for the most part in the same place [that they grew up in], near to family and close friends. It connects you back to a community that [you] don\u2019t have access to.\u201d But social bonds formed online can be positive and negative. When interviewing mothers and daughters about their careers, Jill Armstrong found the younger generation were more influenced by peers and social media than their own mothers. \u201cThere is far more information coming at you [now] than there was for the mother\u2019s generation,\u201d says Ms Armstrong, who argues that this creates pressure around \u201cthe type of mother that you\u2019re supposed to be\u201d. That includes pressure on working mothers and how they approach work \u2014 or think they should. Ms Allen Augustin says you have to know your way around online. She avoids parts of photo sharing app Instagram that might make her feel she must behave a certain way. \u201cWe have all dealt with judgmental spaces in our day-to-day interactions in the real world, so it\u2019s become a community and space of safety.\u201d"

    "text": "When Margaret McCabe gave birth to a daughter, she knew something had to change. She was exasperated by the gender discrimination she faced as a commercial barrister, and wanted to make the world a more equitable place for her child. \u201cI thought that by the time she grew up, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But it\u2019s still a problem,\u201d she says.\n\nMs McCabe, whose successful legal career had equipped her to deal with argument, negotiation and debate, felt these skills could help to improve social mobility among at-risk youth. In 2009 she founded a charity called Debate Mate to teach debating skills in under-resourced schools in London with her now-grown daughter, Scarlett. Drawing on her experience campaigning for the advancement of women and workplace equality, Ms McCabe decided to embed gender equality training into the foundation of Debate Mate.\n\nDebate Mate\u2019s training, heralded as \u201camazing\u201d by backer Bill Gates, has been so effective in schools that it is heading into the office. It aims to bring empowerment to the employees who need it most. Clients include Rolls-Royce, Tesco, BP, the Japanese bank Nomura and the UK government.\n\nAt its core, Ms McCabe says, it is a skills programme. Learning to communicate an idea simply and effectively builds confidence, something corporate women report to struggle with, especially as they increasingly enter industries where superiors are predominantly male.\n\nIf I could float confidence on the stock exchange, we would all be very rich\n\nMuch has been said of the \u201cconfidence gap\u201d or the difference in self-confidence between male and female employees that can have an impact on their trajectories and salaries. While women outperform men in school and are entering the workforce in record numbers, half of female managers in the UK reported self doubt about their job performance and careers. This compared with just one-third of male respondents, according the a 2011 study by the Institute of Leadership and Management.\n\nBut a confidence deficit is not the only reason why men still outpace women in the workplace. Debate Mate trains female staff to master skills such as empathetic listening and information processing that allow them to communicate more effectively. Women often struggle to get their ideas across fully before being interrupted.\n\nWomen still ask Ms McCabe about the best way to negotiate a pay rise, how to deal with professional evaluations, sexual harassment and balancing a career with children and family life. \u201cWe tend to work with younger women because they\u2019re the ones that are most interested,\u201d Ms McCabe says.\n\nNomura uses Debate Mate\u2019s corporate training for young women hoping to be chosen for the internship programme that it uses to select new employees.\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted to do was enhance our very junior workforce \u2026\u2026. so they can enter into a corporate environment that can be a bit confrontational,\u201d says Sarah Vincent, head of Emea graduate recruitment. Those who participate rapidly develop skills that help them communicate more effectively with clients.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re able to articulate their ideas and take a step back to think about what they want to say\u201d, she says, and they \u201ctend to do exceptionally well on the summer internship\u201d.\n\nConfidence is not necessarily the biggest hurdle for Debate Mate\u2019s corporate trainees. \u201cI think I\u2019m pretty confident,\u201d says Sophie, a senior adviser at law firm DLA Piper who participated in the training in 2018. \u201cFor me it\u2019s about slowing things down so I don\u2019t ramble, it\u2019s about bringing it in and channelling my nervous energy, controlling both my breath and physicality. It helped me cope when things don\u2019t go according to plan.\u201d\n\nDebate training breaks down into basic principles: listening, speaking, strategic teamwork, and dispassion. \u201cThey develop what I call a third eye, and can take a step back from the situation to figure out how to get what they want. It\u2019s what the Buddhists call dispassion,\u201d Ms McCabe says. \u201cDebaters can have a discussion, they don\u2019t lose their temper, and they can make a point.\u201d\n\nIn feedback from participants in the female corporate program, 100 per cent of women said that their ability to make a structure argument increased, and 91 per cent said that their ability to speak with confidence has increased.\n\nDebate Mate\u2019s corporate training is fun, participants say, because the programme is taught through games. In one, participants walk to one side of the room or the other, dependent on whether they agree or disagree with the premise of the topic, which could be something like, \u201cshould women make up 50 per cent of UK board seats?\u201d. Scarlett McCabe says participants must argue the opposite side of the choice they make, which helps develop empathy for opinions they do not believe in.\n\nIn a \u201cballoon\u201d game, participants are placed in an imaginary sinking hot air balloon and are assigned a celebrity they must pretend to be. They then argue why that celebrity should remain in the balloon, rather than be thrown overboard to reduce weight.\n\n\u201cPeople think you\u2019re born confident or you\u2019re not, but confidence is a skill,\u201d Scarlett McCabe says. \u201cYou can trick people into thinking you\u2019re confident. Clench your bum or clench your toes, it helps anchor and ground you, and lowers your voice. Take a deep breath before you talk so you don\u2019t start your sentence with an \u2018um\u2019.\u201d\n\nClaire Pelly of Virgin Galactic has worked with Debate Mate to provide corporate training through the professional women\u2019s organisation, BroadMinded. She says women initially find that speaking in front of a group \u201cis terrifying \u2014 they can\u2019t speak,\u201d but over the course of the training, the transformation she sees is extraordinary.\n\nMargaret McCabe laughs: \u201cIf I could float confidence on the stock exchange, we would all be very rich.\u201d"

    "text": "As a child, Claire Valoti would sometimes help out in the family business, the Alhambra Hotel in King's Cross, London. Working alongside her parents, her tasks included scrubbing the sinks.\n\nNow, as vice-president international of Snap Inc, the parent company of disappearing-message app Snapchat, she reflects on the split between work and home. \u201cI think my upbringing has enabled me to realise that you can be quite fluid with it,\u201d she says.\n\nHer own two daughters do not come to her workplace, \u201cso you automatically have some sort of distinction. However, there isn\u2019t a \u2018mummy\u2019s working now\u2019 or \u2018mummy\u2019s not working now\u2019.\u201d\n\nSitting alongside her in Snap\u2019s London HQ in Soho is her mother Martine Valoti, who has run the Alhambra with her husband since 1980. She says that the notion of work-life balance is complicated if your place of work is your home, and you share your home with your clients \u2014 in her case, the guests of the hotel.\n\n\u201cI was working when I had to and [the children] were used to it,\u201d says Martine Valoti. \u201cThey were used to me sharing my time so I think they accepted it because that was all they knew.\u201d It is an intuitive concept: children learn about the realities of the world through the prism of their parents.\n\nI don\u2019t see a distinction between work and home. I think my upbringing has enabled me to realise that you can be quite fluid with it\n\nJill Armstrong is a researcher at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge university and author of a book, Like Mother, Like Daughter?, on how career women influence their daughters. She says that for daughters \u201cthere is a lot of walking in their mothers\u2019 footsteps\u201d. According to her research sample of British women, daughters of career mothers learn that careers are rewarding, worthwhile and the norm.\n\nDespite the tendency among women to focus on difficulties balancing working and mothering, Ms Armstrong found that all the daughters in her sample felt \u201cwell mothered\u201d. This was down to their mothers being mentally and emotionally present when they were around, as well being clear about their availability and attending key events \u2014 at school when other parents would be there, for example. She also found the daughters appreciated that their mothers \u201cencouraged independence\u201d.\n\nAlthough daughters learn that having a career is normal, a working mother may not be the most decisive factor in shaping their careers.\n\nA 2015 Harvard study of 24 countries found that being raised by an employed mother was associated with a modest 4.5 per cent increase in the daughter\u2019s likelihood of being employed, although they were 19 per cent more likely to hold supervisory roles.\n\nMs Armstrong found that maternal employment is not a predictor of career success, but having a working mother is a positive and often formative experience. As well as imparting work ethic and motivation, she also found that one-third of daughters entered the same or similar careers to their mothers, compared with the 11 per cent who followed their fathers.\n\nSusan Allen Augustin and Florence Greenaway \u00a9 Julia Sch\u00f6nst\u00e4dt We were always having conversations about general politics, about women \u2014 in the workspace and more generally in the world\n\nSusan Allen Augustin, diversity and inclusion manager at the Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic body founded by George Soros, entered a similar field to her mother. Florence Greenaway was responsible for recruiting doctors from minority groups at a hospital in Boston, in the US, when her daughter was growing up.\n\n\u201cI was in non-profits and ended up in inclusion but that wasn\u2019t intentional,\u201d says Ms Allen Augustin, who attended work events with her mother and met her medical recruits.\n\n\u201cShe was never directive in the specifics, but we were always having conversations about general politics, about women \u2014 in the workspace and more generally in the world. It was never framed as formal advice, we just had conversations about what was happening,\u201d she says.\n\nMyriam Bouzouaia has kept even more closely aligned: not only is she a vet in Tunisia like her mother, Asma Bouazza Bouzouaia, but she now works for her. As a child, she saw at first-hand the pressures of professional responsibilities. After her mother set up Clinique V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire de La Marsa, the second veterinary clinic in the coastal town of La Marsa, she would sometimes need to abandon family holidays to deal with emergency calls. Now, many other veterinary practices have opened in the area but old habits die hard.\n\n\u201cMy mother is still stressed, that hasn\u2019t changed. Something not so good is that she passed that stress on to me. But that can also be good because when we stress it is [because] we want to do our work well,\u201d says Myriam Bouzouaia, who has worked at the family practice for two and half years and says she still loses sleep the night before a big surgery.\n\nMyriam Bouzouaia and Asma Bouazza Bouzouaia \u00a9 Layli Foroudi [My mother] is still stressed, that hasn\u2019t changed. Something not so good is that she passed that stress on to me. But that can also be good\n\nWhen Claire Valoti travels for work, she tries to explain to her young daughters what she does, and the enjoyment and energy she gets from her job. But she suffers guilt. \u201cI still have an old-fashioned and traditional view about how I want to look after my home. That\u2019s not all women, that\u2019s just the way I am. I\u2019ve put myself under additional pressure \u2014 to go to work and be successful, but also make sure I\u2019m running an amazing home, that the house is always spotless and the kids are all fine.\u201d\n\nShe feels that her generation of mothers are \u201cperfectionists\u201d and under ever more pressure to make sure that their children \u201care doing everything\u201d.\n\nMs Armstrong\u2019s research found that despite having working (or career-oriented) mothers, many of the daughters planned to work part-time after having children.\n\nThey were thinking in terms of the amount of hours they would give to work and the amount of hours they would give to their children\n\nShe says: \u201cThey were thinking about it in terms of the amount of hours that they would give to work and the amount of hours that they would give to their children. It\u2019s a zero-sum game that you\u2019re never going to win.\u201d\n\nMs Greenaway says she felt little motherly guilt when raising Ms Allen Augustin because she shared the responsibility with her husband and two older children. \u201cI am from a culture where we are taught that \u2018it takes a village to raise a child\u2019 so I always had support, and when I took that specific job I said I needed flexibility because of my children,\u201d says Ms Greenaway. She has just moved to London to help look after her grandson.\n\nDespite pursuing a very different career path to her mother\u2019s, Claire Valoti says her parents\u2019 approach to running a hotel has served her well in working life. \u201cIt\u2019s their own business and you saw just how much they care about their customers,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I went into a more corporate environment, I took those values. I learnt to care more from early on.\u201d\n\nOnline peer pressure While on maternity leave, Susan Allen Augustin downloaded the Peanut app, or \u201cmommy Tinder\u201d as she calls it. Users swipe up to \u201cwave\u201d and make a mum-friend, or swipe down to decline. Ms Allen Augustin found other mothers to meet up with for coffee and conversation while their kids crawled around on a baby blanket. \u201cWith our mothers, they were for the most part in the same place [that they grew up in], near to family and close friends. It connects you back to a community that [you] don\u2019t have access to.\u201d But social bonds formed online can be positive and negative. When interviewing mothers and daughters about their careers, Jill Armstrong found the younger generation were more influenced by peers and social media than their own mothers. \u201cThere is far more information coming at you [now] than there was for the mother\u2019s generation,\u201d says Ms Armstrong, who argues that this creates pressure around \u201cthe type of mother that you\u2019re supposed to be\u201d. That includes pressure on working mothers and how they approach work \u2014 or think they should. Ms Allen Augustin says you have to know your way around online. She avoids parts of photo sharing app Instagram that might make her feel she must behave a certain way. \u201cWe have all dealt with judgmental spaces in our day-to-day interactions in the real world, so it\u2019s become a community and space of safety.\u201d"

    "authors": [

    ],
    "text": "When Margaret McCabe gave birth to a daughter, she knew something had to change. She was exasperated by the gender discrimination she faced as a commercial barrister, and wanted to make the world a more equitable place for her child. \u201cI thought that by the time she grew up, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But it\u2019s still a problem,\u201d she says.\n\nMs McCabe, whose successful legal career had equipped her to deal with argument, negotiation and debate, felt these skills could help to improve social mobility among at-risk youth. In 2009 she founded a charity called Debate Mate to teach debating skills in under-resourced schools in London with her now-grown daughter, Scarlett. Drawing on her experience campaigning for the advancement of women and workplace equality, Ms McCabe decided to embed gender equality training into the foundation of Debate Mate.\n\nDebate Mate\u2019s training, heralded as \u201camazing\u201d by backer Bill Gates, has been so effective in schools that it is heading into the office. It aims to bring empowerment to the employees who need it most. Clients include Rolls-Royce, Tesco, BP, the Japanese bank Nomura and the UK government.\n\nAt its core, Ms McCabe says, it is a skills programme. Learning to communicate an idea simply and effectively builds confidence, something corporate women report to struggle with, especially as they increasingly enter industries where superiors are predominantly male.\n\nIf I could float confidence on the stock exchange, we would all be very rich\n\nMuch has been said of the \u201cconfidence gap\u201d or the difference in self-confidence between male and female employees that can have an impact on their trajectories and salaries. While women outperform men in school and are entering the workforce in record numbers, half of female managers in the UK reported self doubt about their job performance and careers. This compared with just one-third of male respondents, according the a 2011 study by the Institute of Leadership and Management.\n\nBut a confidence deficit is not the only reason why men still outpace women in the workplace. Debate Mate trains female staff to master skills such as empathetic listening and information processing that allow them to communicate more effectively. Women often struggle to get their ideas across fully before being interrupted.\n\nWomen still ask Ms McCabe about the best way to negotiate a pay rise, how to deal with professional evaluations, sexual harassment and balancing a career with children and family life. \u201cWe tend to work with younger women because they\u2019re the ones that are most interested,\u201d Ms McCabe says.\n\nNomura uses Debate Mate\u2019s corporate training for young women hoping to be chosen for the internship programme that it uses to select new employees.\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted to do was enhance our very junior workforce \u2026\u2026. so they can enter into a corporate environment that can be a bit confrontational,\u201d says Sarah Vincent, head of Emea graduate recruitment. Those who participate rapidly develop skills that help them communicate more effectively with clients.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re able to articulate their ideas and take a step back to think about what they want to say\u201d, she says, and they \u201ctend to do exceptionally well on the summer internship\u201d.\n\nConfidence is not necessarily the biggest hurdle for Debate Mate\u2019s corporate trainees. \u201cI think I\u2019m pretty confident,\u201d says Sophie, a senior adviser at law firm DLA Piper who participated in the training in 2018. \u201cFor me it\u2019s about slowing things down so I don\u2019t ramble, it\u2019s about bringing it in and channelling my nervous energy, controlling both my breath and physicality. It helped me cope when things don\u2019t go according to plan.\u201d\n\nDebate training breaks down into basic principles: listening, speaking, strategic teamwork, and dispassion. \u201cThey develop what I call a third eye, and can take a step back from the situation to figure out how to get what they want. It\u2019s what the Buddhists call dispassion,\u201d Ms McCabe says. \u201cDebaters can have a discussion, they don\u2019t lose their temper, and they can make a point.\u201d\n\nIn feedback from participants in the female corporate program, 100 per cent of women said that their ability to make a structure argument increased, and 91 per cent said that their ability to speak with confidence has increased.\n\nDebate Mate\u2019s corporate training is fun, participants say, because the programme is taught through games. In one, participants walk to one side of the room or the other, dependent on whether they agree or disagree with the premise of the topic, which could be something like, \u201cshould women make up 50 per cent of UK board seats?\u201d. Scarlett McCabe says participants must argue the opposite side of the choice they make, which helps develop empathy for opinions they do not believe in.\n\nIn a \u201cballoon\u201d game, participants are placed in an imaginary sinking hot air balloon and are assigned a celebrity they must pretend to be. They then argue why that celebrity should remain in the balloon, rather than be thrown overboard to reduce weight.\n\n\u201cPeople think you\u2019re born confident or you\u2019re not, but confidence is a skill,\u201d Scarlett McCabe says. \u201cYou can trick people into thinking you\u2019re confident. Clench your bum or clench your toes, it helps anchor and ground you, and lowers your voice. Take a deep breath before you talk so you don\u2019t start your sentence with an \u2018um\u2019.\u201d\n\nClaire Pelly of Virgin Galactic has worked with Debate Mate to provide corporate training through the professional women\u2019s organisation, BroadMinded. She says women initially find that speaking in front of a group \u201cis terrifying \u2014 they can\u2019t speak,\u201d but over the course of the training, the transformation she sees is extraordinary.\n\nMargaret McCabe laughs: \u201cIf I could float confidence on the stock exchange, we would all be very rich.\u201d"

    "authors": [
      "Madison Darbyshire",
      "Work"
    ],
    "text": "When Margaret McCabe gave birth to a daughter, she knew something had to change. She was exasperated by the gender discrimination she faced as a commercial barrister, and wanted to make the world a more equitable place for her child. \u201cI thought that by the time she grew up, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But it\u2019s still a problem,\u201d she says.\n\nMs McCabe, whose successful legal career had equipped her to deal with argument, negotiation and debate, felt these skills could help to improve social mobility among at-risk youth. In 2009 she founded a charity called Debate Mate to teach debating skills in under-resourced schools in London with her now-grown daughter, Scarlett. Drawing on her experience campaigning for the advancement of women and workplace equality, Ms McCabe decided to embed gender equality training into the foundation of Debate Mate.\n\nDebate Mate\u2019s training, heralded as \u201camazing\u201d by backer Bill Gates, has been so effective in schools that it is heading into the office. It aims to bring empowerment to the employees who need it most. Clients include Rolls-Royce, Tesco, BP, the Japanese bank Nomura and the UK government.\n\nAt its core, Ms McCabe says, it is a skills programme. Learning to communicate an idea simply and effectively builds confidence, something corporate women report to struggle with, especially as they increasingly enter industries where superiors are predominantly male.\n\nIf I could float confidence on the stock exchange, we would all be very rich\n\nMuch has been said of the \u201cconfidence gap\u201d or the difference in self-confidence between male and female employees that can have an impact on their trajectories and salaries. While women outperform men in school and are entering the workforce in record numbers, half of female managers in the UK reported self doubt about their job performance and careers. This compared with just one-third of male respondents, according the a 2011 study by the Institute of Leadership and Management.\n\nBut a confidence deficit is not the only reason why men still outpace women in the workplace. Debate Mate trains female staff to master skills such as empathetic listening and information processing that allow them to communicate more effectively. Women often struggle to get their ideas across fully before being interrupted.\n\nWomen still ask Ms McCabe about the best way to negotiate a pay rise, how to deal with professional evaluations, sexual harassment and balancing a career with children and family life. \u201cWe tend to work with younger women because they\u2019re the ones that are most interested,\u201d Ms McCabe says.\n\nNomura uses Debate Mate\u2019s corporate training for young women hoping to be chosen for the internship programme that it uses to select new employees.\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted to do was enhance our very junior workforce \u2026\u2026. so they can enter into a corporate environment that can be a bit confrontational,\u201d says Sarah Vincent, head of Emea graduate recruitment. Those who participate rapidly develop skills that help them communicate more effectively with clients.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re able to articulate their ideas and take a step back to think about what they want to say\u201d, she says, and they \u201ctend to do exceptionally well on the summer internship\u201d.\n\nConfidence is not necessarily the biggest hurdle for Debate Mate\u2019s corporate trainees. \u201cI think I\u2019m pretty confident,\u201d says Sophie, a senior adviser at law firm DLA Piper who participated in the training in 2018. \u201cFor me it\u2019s about slowing things down so I don\u2019t ramble, it\u2019s about bringing it in and channelling my nervous energy, controlling both my breath and physicality. It helped me cope when things don\u2019t go according to plan.\u201d\n\nDebate training breaks down into basic principles: listening, speaking, strategic teamwork, and dispassion. \u201cThey develop what I call a third eye, and can take a step back from the situation to figure out how to get what they want. It\u2019s what the Buddhists call dispassion,\u201d Ms McCabe says. \u201cDebaters can have a discussion, they don\u2019t lose their temper, and they can make a point.\u201d\n\nIn feedback from participants in the female corporate program, 100 per cent of women said that their ability to make a structure argument increased, and 91 per cent said that their ability to speak with confidence has increased.\n\nDebate Mate\u2019s corporate training is fun, participants say, because the programme is taught through games. In one, participants walk to one side of the room or the other, dependent on whether they agree or disagree with the premise of the topic, which could be something like, \u201cshould women make up 50 per cent of UK board seats?\u201d. Scarlett McCabe says participants must argue the opposite side of the choice they make, which helps develop empathy for opinions they do not believe in.\n\nIn a \u201cballoon\u201d game, participants are placed in an imaginary sinking hot air balloon and are assigned a celebrity they must pretend to be. They then argue why that celebrity should remain in the balloon, rather than be thrown overboard to reduce weight.\n\n\u201cPeople think you\u2019re born confident or you\u2019re not, but confidence is a skill,\u201d Scarlett McCabe says. \u201cYou can trick people into thinking you\u2019re confident. Clench your bum or clench your toes, it helps anchor and ground you, and lowers your voice. Take a deep breath before you talk so you don\u2019t start your sentence with an \u2018um\u2019.\u201d\n\nClaire Pelly of Virgin Galactic has worked with Debate Mate to provide corporate training through the professional women\u2019s organisation, BroadMinded. She says women initially find that speaking in front of a group \u201cis terrifying \u2014 they can\u2019t speak,\u201d but over the course of the training, the transformation she sees is extraordinary.\n\nMargaret McCabe laughs: \u201cIf I could float confidence on the stock exchange, we would all be very rich.\u201d"

    "title": "How one couple designed a modern home in historic Vancouver",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "By Elsa Court\n\nWhen Laurel Murray and her husband Jonathan Greaves left London in 2015 to move closer to Murray\u2019s family in British Columbia, they could still just about afford a home in Vancouver but knew prices were rising fast. They decided to combine family resources to buy a property where they would have space to add a second home for Murray\u2019s parents \u2014 a laneway house, as they are known.\n\nThey focused their search on the historical and artsy neighbourhood of Strathcona, minutes from Vancouver\u2019s vibrant Chinatown.\n\nThey chose a single-level, two-bedroom postwar bungalow, but it stood out amid a row of pre-1900s clapboard houses. As they say, \u201cit is the least attractive house in the neighbourhood\u201d.\n\nThe postwar bungalow stands out on a street of pre-1900s clapboard houses\n\nIt will not stay that way: they are knocking it down in late Spring and replacing it with two new homes, including a modern twist on the historical house that once stood on the lot. This reverential gesture to the neighbourhood\u2019s architectural heritage is a radical approach to modern development in historic Vancouver.\n\nBut with multigenerational living on the rise in increasingly densely populated (and expensive) western cities, theirs is also a story about finding a creative solution to combat rising costs of land and property.\n\nStrathcona is a historical neighbourhood in Vancouver\n\nHome . . . for now\n\nThe Strathcona bungalow was an estate sale (a quick liquidation of assets \u2014 for example, of a deceased person). \u201cWe were only looking at things that were run down because of cost restrictions,\u201d says 38-year-old Murray, an analyst specialising in renewable energy and climate change adaptation. She is sitting on a concrete bench (a designer piece bought for a steal on Craigslist) in the dark living room which, due to the bungalow\u2019s odd layout, is an extension of the hallway, leading to the kitchen.\n\nThe couple spent months putting their stamp on the bungalow\u2019s interiors\n\nThe property had remained unchanged since it was built in 1949. \u201cPeeling back the carpet was like going back in time,\u201d says Murray. It took the couple eight months to move in, after spending almost every weekend on do-it-yourself work, learning as they went from YouTube videos.\n\nThe history\n\nMurray and Greaves went to the City of Vancouver for preliminary guidance about renovating the property, but a planner took one look at it on Google Street View and asked: \u201cIs there anything worth salvaging here?\u201d The planner called it the \u201cgap tooth\u201d of Union Street \u2014 the street on which the bungalow stands and which is subject to a preservation order.\n\nMurray was curious how a squat postwar bungalow found itself on a row of traditional 19th-century clapboard houses. The property was also depressing the value of the houses on either side, which are both covered by the preservation order.\n\nIn the city archives she found an image of a Victorian house on the site of the bungalow. The house, in the style of others on the street, had a tall gabled roof, shiplap cladding, a generous veranda typical of the neighbourhood and intricate fretwork.\n\nThe Bazley family pictured in front of the original house in 1894\n\nAccessing the Vancouver Water Works Registry and a British Columbia business directory going back to the 1890s confirmed the original house number and enabled Murray to research the family of local blacksmith Charles Bazley, originally from New Brunswick, who had lived there until 1917. After this point, there was no entry for the property in either source, meaning it no longer existed.\n\n\u201cWe think fire is the most likely explanation,\u201d says Murray. A building permit pertaining to the current bungalow \u2014 for Marie Agustino, an Italian immigrant \u2014 showed it was probably built in 1949.\n\nThe vision\n\nWhen it became clear neither the city council nor the neighbours found any architectural merit in the bungalow, it made sense for the couple to look into building a new home.\n\n\u201cOne day we stumbled on an open house day for quite a sexy, modern property \u2014 the Cube house in the highly affluent Point Grey, Kitsilano,\u201d says Murray. There they met the minimalist house\u2019s architect, Tony Robins of AA Robins, and hired him to design their new home.\n\nA fan of Strathcona, Robins envisioned restoring the historic streetscape by replacing the bungalow with a contemporary interpretation of the original Victorian house. However, he suggested a twist to the original 1891 fa\u00e7ade by giving it an aluminium finish, similar to a MacBook laptop.\n\nEverything behind this fa\u00e7ade will be modern, and the other exterior walls will be painted black to make them recede from view and draw the eye to the metal fa\u00e7ade from the street. Robins calls it the \u201cChinatown Ghost House\u201d.\n\nAn architect\u2019s drawing of the street now\n\nA drawing showing the proposed design for the new house\n\n\u2018Sensitive densification\u2019\n\nMurray\u2019s parents, who live in a restored 1990s stucco house on Vancouver Island, want to return to the mainland to be closer to their children. The idea of building them a laneway house at the rear of the new property came from a desire to limit costs, because land is so expensive in Vancouver.\n\nMurray says people started building laneway houses \u2014 which are found on the unnamed, narrow back streets behind properties\u2019 backyards \u2014 because of a housing crisis in Canada\u2019s biggest cities. This has been caused by a shortage of land, rising prices and cities\u2019 reluctance to approve high-rise apartment developments. \u201cI call it \u2018sensitive densification\u2019,\u201d she says.\n\nA laneway (right) runs behind the back of the houses on Union Street (left)\n\nThe 1,100 sq ft laneway house, also designed by Robins, will match the four-bedroom main house with gable roofs and dark shiplap cladding, and have a generous rooftop garden with a view of the coastal mountains to the north of Vancouver.\n\nThe nitty gritty\n\nThe project met city guidelines on scale, mass and form, but Murray and Greaves, who works in the energy and clean technology sector, wanted to enlist the support of neighbours before making a formal planning application, \u201cEveryone loved it, but they were telling us, \u2018The city is never going to go for this\u2019,\u201d says Murray.\n\nAs a historic neighbourhood, Strathcona has specific, and largely immovable, design guidelines. This meant the couple had to apply for a separate development permit in addition to the usual building and demolition permits, which added cost and led to lengthy delays. The application was a gamble: if it had failed they would have lost thousands of dollars in fees.\n\nBut the biggest challenge was obtaining permission for the increase in density from one to two new homes on the same lot. \u201cWe did not have an existing historic home worth preserving and, without it, the city planners did not have the authority to [grant permission for us to] build two detached family dwellings at the necessary density,\u201d says Murray.\n\nWith neighbours\u2019 support, however, they took the case to the Board of Variance, a council-appointed body that allows for flexibility in the application of a zoning bylaw and looks beyond the guidelines to the intent behind the design. The couple\u2019s gamble paid off: the case was approved in January.\n\nThe designs for the proposed laneway house\n\nBreaking new ground\n\nMurray says the board set a precedent by granting an increase in floor area ratio under the Character Home Zoning Review, part of the heritage conservation programme designed to preserve Vancouver\u2019s historic neighbourhoods. While historic renovations are allowed up to a 95 per cent floor area ratio to the overall plot size, new builds are only allowed 75 per cent \u2014 insufficient for the planned dwellings.\n\n\u201cOur two buildings take up less than 50 per cent of the footprint of the land,\u201d says Murray, \u201cbut because they are 2.5 storeys (to match the height and mass of the other buildings on our street), they make up 92.7 per cent of the total floor surface area.\u201d The board declined to comment.\n\nThe bungalow will be demolished in late Spring\n\nConstruction should take 12 months. While building costs were as the couple expected, the city\u2019s fees and associated costs caused some worry as they were far higher than they anticipated. That said, Murray says the cost of renovating the bungalow and building a laneway house will be at least C$500,000 ($380,000) less than buying a historic Victorian home on the same street, which typically sell for C$1,750,000 ($1,325,000).\n\nMurray and Greaves are saving money by building two homes on one smaller lot. \u201cConservatively, it costs C$1.4m to buy a modest plot in Vancouver, so that means we\u2019d be spending around C$3m for the land alone,\u201d says Murray. \u201cBy building on the same lot \u2014 which has additional benefits for ageing parents \u2014 we\u2019re saving that enormous cost of land.\u201d\n\nShe has found the project challenging but rewarding. \u201cPerhaps necessity and money constraints have forced us to be more creative in our approach,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have truly fallen in love with the Strathcona community and to be able to build two liveable family homes for us and my parents is worth all the hard work.\u201d\n\nImages: Andrew Querner; City of Vancouver Archives; AA Robins; Intarsia Design"

    "text": "For his AW19 womenswear collection for Louis Vuitton, Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re rebuilt the Pompidou. At the Louvre. As you do.\n\nThe set, by Renzo Piano, the architect who conceived the Pompidou Centre with Richard Rogers in the 1970s, was a comment on the \u201cbeauty of controversy\u201d and the Louis Vuitton designer was pretty relaxed about the fact not everyone would like what they saw. The show was an Eighties medley of \u201cmuseum people, goth gangs, street dancers and fashion groups\u201d, as one might have observed from the Caf\u00e9 Beaubourg in the days before Instagram, when real life people watching was still in vogue. And it was pretty extreme \u2014 like no real people I\u2019ve ever seen. One model wore a tweed dress with a leopard-print capelet, like a fashion superhero. A pink flowery dress with a bouncy skater skirt, belted waist and a ruffle yoke might be described as \u201cSloane Ranger on acid\u201d. The women wore sensible flat shoes for getting around in \u2014 I was touched to see a late-Eighties style of lace-up with a pinched trim around the toe we dubbed \u201cpiss catchers\u201d at school \u2014 but overall the looks were fairly otherworldly. I was most taken with a crafty micro-floral cape ensemble which looked like Laura Ashley meets Marvel\u2019s villainous Loki.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWith its leather all-in-ones, chequerboard minis and romantic florals, the show was many things. Ghesqui\u00e8re described it as a celebration of \u201cself-expression\u201d. Bourgeois it was not. Nor was it conservative, or stripped back, or pared down, or any other of the buzzwords of the season. As the looks emerged, each one more eccentric than the last, I thought of the brand\u2019s many celebrity ambassadors \u2014 including the actresses Emma Stone, Alicia Vikander and Catherine Deneuve \u2014 and which styles on the runway we might see them wear in future. Perhaps Deneuve will opt for the leather ruffled ra-ra skirt or a biker-style blazer? Will we be seeing Stone in a Mondrian-style sweater with high-waisted leather trousers and a pair of pixie boots?\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nGhesqui\u00e8re seemed ready to have that discussion. Just as the Pompidou Centre was reviled when it first opened, so too was he trying to push a different point of view. \u201cI wanted to remind people that what was so controversial has, through time, and the gymnastics of the eye, become an icon of the landscape,\u201d he explained of the hi-tech exhibition space. \u201cI want fashion to be exciting, a place of discovery, to offer new shapes and be controversial. I want to do fashion that takes time to understand.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWill these ruffled dresses become an icon of the landscape? Time will tell, but Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s enthusiasm and ambition is refreshing. His collections can be confusing, sometimes difficult, but they deliver the ideas which percolate and his show is still one of the creative cauldrons from which other more commercial designers like to nab ingredients later on. It was also fun to see a designer take an already common theme and approach it in a totally different way. Eighties shoulders and statement tailoring have been massive this season, his blazers were broad and blouson through the shoulders, and his trouser shape was carrot-legged and high. Likewise with the florals \u2014 which have been another key trend. Ghesqui\u00e8re described them as \u201ccraft piece meets classic\u201d, and dedicated them to a certain type of museum woman he sees. He might have meant my mother, although I doubt she\u2019d go for these.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMost significantly, these clothes helped tell the long-held Louis Vuitton story \u2014 that today\u2019s women should be modern, always in motion and strong. They ticked all the codes of the brand, they\u2019ll take a while longer to understand. But Ghesqui\u00e8re can enjoy the privilege of belligerence. He designs clothes that the house doesn\u2019t depend on to sell. The jewel of the LVMH group, the Louis Vuitton recorded around $10bn in revenues in 2018, and the vast majority of that business was in sales of its famous monogram \u2014 the canvas bags on which the house has built its fortune.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nGhesqui\u00e8re\u2019s contribution to that cannon has been significant, and his AW19 bag offering was a far more accessible affair: a dinky clutch bag in a patchwork of fabrications, Tambrourin, an old-school satchel, and the ladylike Dauphine Mini, with its three tidy compartments, finished in different materials, including tweed. So, yes, my eye has done gymnastics, and the more I study this collection, the less bonkers it seems. But next time you\u2019re people watching in the Beaubourg, the bags will be the icons that you see.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

    "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nUniversities award degrees for life, but in an era of rapid technology change and potential job displacement \u201cone education will no longer last a lifetime,\u201d says Sebastian Thrun, the co-founder of online education company, Udacity.\n\nThe Stanford University professor, who also founded X, Google\u2019s experimental technology lab, proposes a new model where skills are acquired throughout a person\u2019s career, rather than in one go at the start.\n\nHe believes online learning is an effective way for people already in employment to acquire specialist skills they did not learn at university. The majority of the 10m people who have registered for Udacity\u2019s courses have a degree, according to Mr Thrun.\n\nHe sees a \u201chuge vacuum of people who could massively benefit from education but who are currently excluded\u201d because they cannot quit their jobs to return to full-time study.\n\nMr Thrun is not alone in his thinking. Several online learning companies that specialise in short, targeted courses have emerged over the past few years.\n\nOne example is Udemy, an online learning platform where instructors can charge students to access their courses. Founded in 2010, Udemy today has 30m students, 42,000 instructors and courses in more than 50 languages.\n\nFor students, online courses can bring an array of benefits, including a career change, promotion, pay rise or further study at university.\n\nDuring 2018, James Cuggy, 47, took a number of online courses on topics including marketing and entrepreneurship. At the time, he had a full-time job in customer services at the UK insurer Prudential, alongside working as a sales and marketing consultant for a software start-up.\n\nFor many firms, training workers is mission critical as they can\u2019t find them on the job market\n\nMr Cuggy says the online courses taught him new skills \u2014 such as how to generate new leads through social media \u2014 that have made him much more valuable to the start-up. He paid for the courses, which cost \u00a330-\u00a350 each. But many companies are willing to pay for employees to develop their expertise and knowledge in new areas, according to Leah Belsky, vice-president of enterprise at digital learning platform Coursera.\n\nIn 2016 it launched Coursera for Business, which enables organisations to pay for employees to take courses provided by the world\u2019s top universities in subjects ranging from design thinking to negotiation.\n\nCoursera then shares revenues generated by clients including L\u2019Or\u00e9al, AXA and Pfizer, with the universities that created the courses.\n\nMs Belsky says the advantage for companies is attracting and retaining talent in areas prone to skills shortages. It also helps organisations that operate in economies with high levels of employment, such as the US, where competition for talent is fierce.\n\nCoursera\u2019s courses for businesses start at $400 a year for each learner. Ms Belsky says this expense compares favourably with the cost of replacing an employee, which can be significant. \u201cFor many firms, training workers is mission critical as they can\u2019t find them on the job market,\u201d says Ms Belsky.\n\nIn 2016, aerospace company Airbus started putting staff through \u201cnanodegrees\u201d on data science. These online courses are built by Udacity in collaboration with companies to develop job-specific abilities.\n\nYou learn new skills and ways of working, and create new networks of people from other business areas\n\nData science skills, which are in short supply, are essential to Airbus, for example, as it develops its digital services, says Veronika Eckstein, the company\u2019s head of corporate governance academy.\n\n\u201cThe trainees are . . . improving decision-making, and instantly applying what they learn in the workplace,\u201d says Ms Eckstein.\n\nSilvia Mouronte Arcones, 32, is among the Airbus employees to have completed the data science nanodegree. She says the course enabled her to move from a technical engineering role into data analytics.\n\nMs Mouronte Arcones, who already has a bachelors and a masters degree in engineering, studied for around 10 hours every week for six months.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of balancing work and study is huge, but so are the benefits,\u201d she says. \u201cYou learn new skills and ways of working, and create new networks of people from other business areas.\u201d\n\nUniversities also want to provide \u201clife-long learning\u201d to reflect longer working lives and more frequent career changes among their former students. The Haas School of Business at the University of California Berkeley offers its alumni free access to some degree programme modules and webinars, for example on product management.\n\nThe idea is to entice new applications for executive education using the short courses as a try-before-you-buy taster, says Kevin Wong, the school\u2019s associate director of digital strategy.\n\nThe pressure to adjust the model has been intensified by a reduced take-up of its full-time MBA, says Mr Wong. There was a 7.5 per cent drop in applications for its 2018 on-campus MBA.\n\nSpecialist online courses are not a substitute for a degree like an MBA, notes David Lefevre, director of the Edtech Lab at London\u2019s Imperial College Business School.\n\nThey can, however, help people to top up their skills as business changes and new trends, such as artificial intelligence, emerge. \u201cOnline learning fills that skills gap,\u201d he says."

    "text": "There was a one-minute silence before the start of the AW19 Chanel show, a moment to reflect on the 36 years of service Karl Lagerfeld devoted to the fashion house. Sixty seconds in which to marvel at his sense of showmanship: in his last instructions he had staged his show in a snowy Alpine wonderland. Dubbed \u201cChalet Gardenia\u201d, it featured 12 Alpine huts with actual smoking chimneys, a mountain cyclorama and real pine trees. It was a moment to sit in wonder. And for those who really knew him, and who have been caught up in a schedule with little time for much reflection, it was a quiet moment in which to grieve.\n\nI did not know him muchly, but I\u2019ll miss him like hell. I interviewed Lagerfeld on about six occasions, most often backstage at the shows and through a scrum of reporters all scratching for his quotes. He always delivered something spicy, either making some sensational pronouncement or voicing some new subject of disdain. He was hugely entertaining. But he could be vulnerable too: he had an unexpected need for affirmation. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d he would ask in his heavy German accent of a piece of clothing or a new construction in the show. \u201cYou did? Yes, I thought it was quite good as well.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMore than anything, he hated nostalgia. He loathed nothing more than looking back. In a rare discussion around the idea of legacy, he told the critic Suzy Menkes: \u201cI hate the idea of being heavily remembered . . . I think things start with me, they end with me. After that, the garbage can . . . I couldn\u2019t care less\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWith this in mind, his last show, with its shearling snowboots, sweeping skirt lengths and Alpine flavours was a riddle. Were the motifs a final acknowledgment that the designer might indeed have had a sentimental side? Had he holidayed in Bavaria in his childhood? Was this his Magic Mountain, a fictional sanctuary of creative respite from which he might escape his inevitable demise? Was this his Rosebud moment?\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nDuring his lifetime the designer was an inveterate fabulist, some might say fibber, who would mix the facts of his biography about. He never quite confirmed his date of birth, and often obfuscated details of his childhood.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWas this all a homage to his powerful bourgeois mother, born in Munster, around whom so many Lagerfeld myths were built? Or was it a homage to Coco Chanel who conceived her famous blazer when she spied a bellboy on a holiday to Salzburg and the Alps? The full tweed coats and ski-slope knitwear here seemed to play on that era\u2019s Thirties tropes.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOr had he just conjured up a mountain, and the kind of chocolate-box vista that has a global brand identity itself? The romantic Alpine landscape is beloved by clients in all sorts of different markets, and let\u2019s not forget the next Winter Olympics will take place in Beijing in 2022. Yes, Lagerfeld was a romantic. But, he was pragmatic, and a German. And also had an extraordinary business head.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLagerfeld\u2019s last outing was a riddle with a set that offered all sorts of tantalising clues. It was emotional, without being nostalgic or sentimental. It was wintry, without being cold. Its most unlikely feature was the actress Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, who walked holding a single white flower. But that riddle was quite easily answered \u2014 she was signed last year to be an ambassador for the label.\n\nPen\u00e9lope Cruz on the Chanel catwalk \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThe designer spent more than three decades building the myth of Coco Chanel, and in the process built a $10bn brand. He was a great designer, a brilliant subject and had a genius for branding \u2014 and storytelling. Now he\u2019s gone, Paris Fashion Week will never be the same.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOn each seat there was a sketch by Lagerfeld of himself and Coco Chanel standing side by side. \u201cThe beat goes on \u2026\u201d read the inscription. And so it will. In recent days, Alain Wertheimer, chief executive of Chanel, has appointed Lagerfeld\u2019s head of studio, Virginie Viard, to be artistic director of the fashion collections while Eric Pfrunder will be artistic director of fashion image. Both have long been integral members of the Lagerfeld team. The Wertheimers want a smooth and dignified transition. The implication is that nothing here will change, the Chanel house will continue as it has done. And yet, to imagine future shows without Lagerfeld\u2019s theatrics seems inconceivable. One can only wonder for how long it might go on.\n\nIn the meantime, the brand is getting on with business, and those interlocking Cs sell on. As for all the fake snow? Today\u2019s fairytale will be tomorrow\u2019s garbage. Just as Lagerfeld would have wanted it to be.\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

    "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nIn one of Africa\u2019s fast-growing and congested cities, online business education is on the rise. Lagos Business School is among a number of universities in lower and middle-income countries that are using technology to attract students who are unable or unwilling to attend university full-time.\n\nOnline education allows people to learn at their own pace and study from wherever they are \u2014 whether on business trips, in the office or working from home to avoid wasting hours in traffic to make it to a campus.\n\nIt also allows them to connect in new ways with universities\u2019 resources. They can watch lectures live or catch up on pre-recorded sessions, and take part in discussions with classmates who are based all over the world.\n\nLagos Business School has so far focused fully-online learning on \u201copen enrolment\u201d classes, says Uchenna Uzo, its MBA director. These are short, online programmes that act as a \u201cteaser\u201d to encourage students to consider taking one of its higher-value courses.\n\n\u201cWe use online to offer highly subsidised courses to market and generate awareness of programmes for people to come on to campus,\u201d says Mr Uzo.\n\nIt\u2019s been very valuable at getting academics to think about different ways to deliver content and learning outcomes\n\nHe says the school offers these taster courses in a range of \u201chot, trendy topics\u201d such as financial inclusion and sustainability, which \u201cstudents wouldn\u2019t normally get elsewhere\u201d. The programmes typically include five to 10 web-based sessions for up to 100 participants and cost 25,000 naira ($69) each, according to Mr Uzo.\n\nThe school \u201cstill values face-to-face teaching\u201d for its degree programmes, yet there is some flexibility for busy students. Much of its part-time executive MBA programme is offered online, Mr Uzo says. Indeed, students on the school\u2019s modular MBA course mix online learning and webinars with on-campus classes.\n\nThe pattern is similar elsewhere. Piet Naud\u00e9, director of the University of Stellenbosch Business School in South Africa, says it offers some fully online courses in executive education. These tend to be for topics that are heavily fact-based like project management and managerial accounting.\n\nThe school requires attendance on campus for at least two of the modules in the executive MBA, however. As with Lagos Business School, this is because both students and faculty value in-person teaching and interaction.\n\nThe internet has the power to extend the reach of more established business schools, including many in the UK and the US, into developing markets.\n\nAngus Laing, dean of Lancaster University\u2019s Management School, says technology helped its part-time, two-year executive MBA programme attract more students \u2014 and from further afield. He says that the second cohort of students on the course at Lancaster University Ghana have recently graduated. Students on this course studied in Ghana, but also travelled to the UK and undertook some learning online.\n\nYou still need interaction with your peers and networking\n\n\u201cOne advantage of being a relatively late entrant to online is that we are developing systems for the current generation of devices from the start,\u201d says Prof Laing.\n\nThat includes a focus on mobile phones rather than desktop computers, allowing students to join discussions remotely from all manner of locations.\n\nProf Laing says technology has also forced teachers to change their approach. \u201cIt\u2019s been very valuable at getting academics to think about different ways to deliver content and learning outcomes.\u201d This has improved interactivity, engagement and feedback for students, he adds.\n\nBut technology also comes with some frustrations, notably bandwidth in west Africa. That has led Lagos Business School to offer more pre-recorded sessions that students can watch at any time, rather than only live streaming key events. It has also adjusted its timetables, scheduling online sessions for times when fewer problems with connectivity are expected, notably early mornings and Saturdays.\n\nMr Uzo cautions on the lack of guidance and regulation for online courses in Nigeria and other countries. He notes that some local and regional institutions offer digital degrees that are very cheap, but there is a risk that these will be of poor quality.\n\nIt remains difficult to provide the same level of quality without at least some attendance in person, says Mr Uzo. \u201cYou still need interaction with your peers and networking.\u201d"

    "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nWatching a hologram lecturer is an eerily realistic experience \u2014 the hologram can look you in the eye, point to you and answer your question.\n\nThe hologram might be saying the same thing as a talking head on a video screen, but it has a much stronger presence, notes David Lefevre, director of the Edtech Lab at Imperial College Business School.\n\nThe hologram works by projecting a live image of the lecturer on to a screen in front on the class. The lecturer, who must be presenting from one of the university\u2019s several studios located across the world, has a live audio feed and a screen that shows their class. This allows them to watch and listen to students, and interact with them.\n\nThe hologram lecturer changes students\u2019 responses, says Mr Lefevre. With video conferencing, students often look at their iPads or phones. \u201cBut they feel that the hologram lecturer is in the room interacting with them, and that they should pay more attention to it. The psychology is very important.\u201d\n\nHolograms are among a number of technologies that business schools are trialling to improve engagement among students who study online.\n\nThey look a bit like a combination of an iPad, a Segway and a witch\u2019s broomstick\n\nMIT Sloan School of Management in Massachusetts has experimented with robots operated remotely by students or lecturers working in different locations. Peter Hirst, senior associate dean of executive education, says: \u201cThey look a bit like a combination of an iPad, a Segway and a witch\u2019s broomstick.\u201d\n\nThe lecturer or student talks live on the iPad and controls the movement of the robot with a joystick. What makes them seem lifelike, says Mr Hirst, is the fact that they can move around the room, turn their screen \u201cheads\u201d and simulate sitting or standing.\n\nStudents rate the robot instructor experience 70 per cent as good as having someone there in person, according to Mr Hirst, whose team canvassed the views of students and lecturers who had used the technology.\n\nWhy students or lecturers choose to interact online is an important factor in how well robots are accepted, says Mr Hirst. \u201cIf a student can\u2019t travel because of mobility challenges . . . people are much more accepting than if someone is just too busy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, students tend to be grateful that remote control robotics allow them to have access to a respected expert who might be unavailable in person, rather than a local substitute.\n\nTechnical problems can be disruptive, however. \u201cIt is frustrating that in 2019 at MIT you can still lose the connection, or the picture breaks up, or the sound drops out,\u201d says Mr Hirst. Network connections can be particularly patchy with iPad robots: as they move around, they are more prone to hitting dead spots. They have even been known to get \u201cstuck\u201d in lifts.\n\nCommunicating body language is another drawback, says Mr Hirst. At the moment, the person using the robot has to initiate all movements; they are encouraged to do this regularly so people know there is a human behind the machine. \u201cIt would be great if there was just button you could push that would tell the robot to keep shuffling around,\u201d Mr Hirst says.\n\nVideo conferencing also still has a role in online business education, as seen with the WOW Room, developed by IE Business School in Madrid, Spain. This allows lecturers to see up to 48 remote students on a bank of screens and teach them as they would in-person.\n\nThis is using the technology, not just to transfer information, but to make people care\n\nThe system detects the students\u2019 expressions and gauges their level of attention and participation. When the class is finished, lecturers are given a video of the session. Below the recording, there are graphs of students\u2019 attention-levels and emotions during the class: lecturers use these to reflect on and refine their performance.\n\nBut for Mr Lefevre, this misses a key element of the classroom. \u201cThe Achilles heel is that for the lecturer it is a very realistic experience but the students only see the lecturer, not each other.\u201d\n\nThe Edtech Lab also uses machine learning and data analytics to look for patterns and predict learning outcomes.\n\nThe team found, for example, that their students mostly learn in four ways: they do all their work as soon as possible; study at regular intervals; binge-learn everything in two weeks; or have sporadic but intensive study periods.\n\n\u201cWe then found that poor [weaker-performing] students were all sporadic, but strong students were almost equally distributed across all the types,\u201d says Mr Lefevre. The team could not discourage the sporadic approach, he says, but they could warn their recruits that it often results in poor performance.\n\nIn future, MBA students may wear VR headsets to learn important skills, such as managing conflict. Technology company PA Consulting is developing VR scenarios in which leaders resolve disputes between team members.\n\n\u201cWe use actors to make simulations feel as lifelike as possible,\u201d says Nick Shackleton-Jones, director of learning innovation at PA Consulting. \u201cThe advantage of using VR is that it recreates the emotional experience, rather than merely being an academic exercise.\n\n\u201cThis is using the technology, not just to transfer information, but to make people care, which creates a much more memorable learning experience.\u201d"

    "text": "There was a one-minute silence before the start of the AW19 Chanel show, a moment to reflect on the 36 years of service Karl Lagerfeld devoted to the fashion house. Sixty seconds in which to marvel at his sense of showmanship: in his last instructions he had staged his show in a snowy Alpine wonderland. Dubbed \u201cChalet Gardenia\u201d, it featured 12 Alpine huts with actual smoking chimneys, a mountain cyclorama and real pine trees. It was a moment to sit in wonder. And for those who really knew him, and who have been caught up in a schedule with little time for much reflection, it was a quiet moment in which to grieve.\n\nI did not know him muchly, but I\u2019ll miss him like hell. I interviewed Lagerfeld on about six occasions, most often backstage at the shows and through a scrum of reporters all scratching for his quotes. He always delivered something spicy, either making some sensational pronouncement or voicing some new subject of disdain. He was hugely entertaining. But he could be vulnerable too: he had an unexpected need for affirmation. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d he would ask in his heavy German accent of a piece of clothing or a new construction in the show. \u201cYou did? Yes, I thought it was quite good as well.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMore than anything, he hated nostalgia. He loathed nothing more than looking back. In a rare discussion around the idea of legacy, he told the critic Suzy Menkes: \u201cI hate the idea of being heavily remembered . . . I think things start with me, they end with me. After that, the garbage can . . . I couldn\u2019t care less\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWith this in mind, his last show, with its shearling snowboots, sweeping skirt lengths and Alpine flavours was a riddle. Were the motifs a final acknowledgment that the designer might indeed have had a sentimental side? Had he holidayed in Bavaria in his childhood? Was this his Magic Mountain, a fictional sanctuary of creative respite from which he might escape his inevitable demise? Was this his Rosebud moment?\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nDuring his lifetime the designer was an inveterate fabulist, some might say fibber, who would mix the facts of his biography about. He never quite confirmed his date of birth, and often obfuscated details of his childhood.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWas this all a homage to his powerful bourgeois mother, born in Munster, around whom so many Lagerfeld myths were built? Or was it a homage to Coco Chanel who conceived her famous blazer when she spied a bellboy on a holiday to Salzburg and the Alps? The full tweed coats and ski-slope knitwear here seemed to play on that era\u2019s Thirties tropes.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOr had he just conjured up a mountain, and the kind of chocolate-box vista that has a global brand identity itself? The romantic Alpine landscape is beloved by clients in all sorts of different markets, and let\u2019s not forget the next Winter Olympics will take place in Beijing in 2022. Yes, Lagerfeld was a romantic. But, he was pragmatic, and a German. And also had an extraordinary business head.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLagerfeld\u2019s last outing was a riddle with a set that offered all sorts of tantalising clues. It was emotional, without being nostalgic or sentimental. It was wintry, without being cold. Its most unlikely feature was the actress Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, who walked holding a single white flower. But that riddle was quite easily answered \u2014 she was signed last year to be an ambassador for the label.\n\nPen\u00e9lope Cruz on the Chanel catwalk \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThe designer spent more than three decades building the myth of Coco Chanel, and in the process built a $10bn brand. He was a great designer, a brilliant subject and had a genius for branding \u2014 and storytelling. Now he\u2019s gone, Paris Fashion Week will never be the same.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOn each seat there was a sketch by Lagerfeld of himself and Coco Chanel standing side by side. \u201cThe beat goes on \u2026\u201d read the inscription. And so it will. In recent days, Alain Wertheimer, chief executive of Chanel, has appointed Lagerfeld\u2019s head of studio, Virginie Viard, to be artistic director of the fashion collections while Eric Pfrunder will be artistic director of fashion image. Both have long been integral members of the Lagerfeld team. The Wertheimers want a smooth and dignified transition. The implication is that nothing here will change, the Chanel house will continue as it has done. And yet, to imagine future shows without Lagerfeld\u2019s theatrics seems inconceivable. One can only wonder for how long it might go on.\n\nIn the meantime, the brand is getting on with business, and those interlocking Cs sell on. As for all the fake snow? Today\u2019s fairytale will be tomorrow\u2019s garbage. Just as Lagerfeld would have wanted it to be.\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

    "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nIt was an explosion in Kabul\u2019s Green Zone that took Farhad Zmarai\u2019s attention away from the marketing module he was studying for his MBA.\n\nWhile many students struggle with concentration, few endure the extreme distractions Mr Zmarai faced. He balanced studying in war-torn Afghanistan with work, family, poor internet connection and no financial aid.\n\nMr Zmarai was working for the World Bank when he started his course in August 2016. While Afghan culture puts a premium on technical degrees like engineering, Mr Zmarai was working for international organisations and \u201csensed the value\u201d of an MBA.\n\nMr Zmarai, who graduated in 2018, is part of the first class to complete the iMBA, launched by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nThe qualification is part of a growing trend towards digital delivery of MBAs. While many schools have programmes that blend classroom and online approaches, with the course at Urbana-Champaign, all teaching and learning takes place online.\n\nStatistics from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) show that between 2013 and 2018 there was a 69 per cent increase in the number of business schools offering online MBAs accredited by the organisation, with growth particularly focused in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nJeffrey Brown, dean at Urbana-Champaign, says: \u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly challenging, but exciting, building a new venture in a 150-year-old big, lumbering, bureaucratic institution.\u201d\n\n70% US business schools that reported a decline in applications for their two-year programmes in 2018\n\nLike other US institutions, Urbana-Champaign faced growing competition in recruiting students for its full-time MBA. Figures for 2018, compiled by the Graduate Management Admissions Council (GMAC), showed 70 per cent of US schools reported a decline in applications for their two-year programmes.\n\nCiting Urbana-Champaign\u2019s historical commitment to accessible, affordable education, Mr Brown set the fee for the entire iMBA to $22,000. He also waived the traditional GMAC exam entry requirement for students who had significant work experience.\n\nBeing online-only allowed the university to recruit students from a much wider field. It could target far more potential students, including those who did not live near good-quality alternative universities, and those from around the globe like Mr Zmarai.\n\nMr Brown also deployed a \u201cstacking\u201d approach where students can take courses online for free, and then pay if they want credits to use towards qualifications, including full degrees.\n\nUrbana-Champaign teamed up with a digital learning platform, Coursera, to deliver its iMBA. It was keen to avoid its online course being seen as second-best to its campus offering.\n\nWhile some universities have treated online education as an afterthought \u2014 simply filming existing lectures or employing more junior teaching assistants for courses \u2014 Urbana-Champaign invested in production and talent. It hired broadcast cameramen to make the films, built virtual classrooms and tapped its top professors.\n\nThe most surprising thing was the iMBA gave me the opportunity to get to know people\n\nData helps the university respond to students\u2019 needs. The school provides supplementary materials or different approaches when the data shows, for example, that students watch content multiple times or struggle in tests.\n\nSo far, Urbana-Champaign\u2019s decision seems to have paid off, with strong growth in the number of students taking the iMBA over the past three years. Some 270 of the 293 students offered a place on the iMBA in 2016 accepted. In January 2019, the school admitted another 600 students on to its iMBA, and will run a second recruitment cycle in August.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exceeded our expectations in every way,\u201d says Mr Brown. \u201cIn student satisfaction, retention, graduation, faculty perceptions \u2014 and in the amount of work required to pull it off.\u201d\n\nMr Zmarai\u2019s experience at Urbana-Champaign exceeded expectations, too. He cites an earlier distance-learning MBA that he began, but then abandoned, with a British university. \u201cIt was not even comparable,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were no videos, no lectures. They just gave us a few textbooks and assigned a tutor who was not even a professor.\u201d\n\nMr Zmarai says he did not miss out on an important lure of campus-based study while on the iMBA \u2014 personal networking. \u201cThe most surprising thing was the iMBA gave me the opportunity to get to know people through our assignment groups,\u201d he says.\n\nThe deteriorating situation in Afghanistan pushed Mr Zmarai to move to the US after completing the course. He now works as a contractor with Facebook. For him, the benefits of virtual study are becoming real."

      "Kering Sa",

    ],
    "text": "Having seen the departure of Stella McCartney, and since parting ways with Christopher Kane, the Kering group is currently focused on investing in those labels it thinks might ape the success of its power brands like Saint Laurent. Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, Kering\u2019s chairman, has made it clear he would like Alexander McQueen to be among those houses within his stable reporting more than \u20ac1bn in annual revenues. No easy feat; the brand is currently listed among several Kering fashion assets, including Balenciaga, and its revenues are estimated to be around a fifth of Saint Laurent\u2019s \u20ac1.7bn. That said, with enough investment, and the right creative momentum, it might be done. Saint Laurent was reporting revenues of only \u20ac400m in 2010.\n\nFor a long time after the premature death of the house\u2019s founder, in 2010, the brand was frozen in the image of Lee McQueen. Designer Sarah Burton has worked exhaustively in the interim to honour his legacy, and his vision, and quite brilliantly so. But with more recent collections you get the sense that she is ready to step forward with the business. And with the opening of a huge new London flagship store on Bond Street in January, and a confident chief executive, Emmanuel Gintzburger, who arrived in 2016, things are quickly moving on.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nNot so much creatively, thank goodness. The McQueen silhouette and style in which the brand was founded is still 100 per cent authentic, and Burton\u2019s AW19 collection was no different in that respect. But there seemed to be more focus on the balance in the offering. As the house that designed the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s wedding dress, and was the star of an otherworldly exhibition at first the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and then the V&A in London, the public perception is that Alexander McQueen makes magical dresses. For the Kering brand to hit its targets, it needs to pivot attention back to daywear and, more crucially, its suits.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThis collection opened with a clutch of just those items, all fabricated in heritage fabrics sourced from northern British mills. The McQueen suit is famous for its exaggerated English shoulder, and a very lean line. These suits, in charcoal grey, with drapey asymmetrical hems and feminine details, were more than fit for purpose, they were sublime. Knitwear, daywear, clothes to please the suits, the one thing lacking was a handbag or a key accessory to bank \u2014 Alexander McQueen has been living off its earnings on a platform sneaker and a skull-print scarf for far too long.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAnd what for the fantasists among us? Surely there were magical moments here? Of course, no Alexander McQueen show under Burton would be without them, and it wasn\u2019t long before the sober suiting and knitted daywear took on a very different guise. Jacket sleeves started blooming, hems peeling and one suit metamorphosed into a rose (already the motif of the season elsewhere). Burton had gone on a tour of her home country to find her inspiration, and her narrative about the beauty of northern manufacture and our once proud woollen mills (now tragically dwindled, and perhaps more so after Brexit) was brought to life quite brilliantly here.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nA shirt dress was made in buttoned layers of crisp white cotton, but its construction contained the classic detail of a gentleman\u2019s shirt. Panels of houndstooth check, in scarlet, popped from overcoats, or were twirled into decorative rosettes. A silver dress was made from what seemed like millions of sequins, but was actually embroidered in tiny fragments of loom. The last looks were pure fantasy: a black tuxedo jacket with a black corsage at the hip before falling to the floor; and a huge red silk taffeta dress, using bolts and bolts of fabric, all pleated to look like a huge bouquet of buds. It climbed up around the neck and around the shoulders to sit fan-like, and ever so regal. In Burton\u2019s hymn to British manufacturing towns, like her own Macclesfield in Cheshire, here was a queen of the north.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

    "authors": [
      "Jo Ellison",
      "Fashion Shows",
      "Balenciaga Sa"
    ],
    "text": "The Balenciaga set was a vast black box that stank of asphalt. The collection reeked of street. It was brilliant, bold and contemporary \u2014 and there wasn\u2019t a sneaker to be seen.\n\nIn a season that has been big on retro references and the allure of the bourgeoisie, Demna Gvasalia\u2019s modern take on Paris style made for a powerful statement. There was lots of sober suiting, casual outerwear and simple evening dresses, but the cuts and the couture sensibility ensured no two looks (and there were more than 100 of them) were quite the same. It was also a meditation on what is relevant in fashion, a world where the water bottle has been elevated to new luxury status, and the synthetic puffa is more valuable \u2014 and desirable \u2014 than a fur. At Balenciaga, models slung bottle bags around their bodies, and carried bags that could manage a supermarket run. \u201cI like people who like shopping,\u201d deadpanned Gvasalia of his shoppers. \u201cI depend on people shopping for my job.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nGvasalia\u2019s show dripped with clever details, while offering new takes on the basics and tailoring tricks that made you stop and stare. The shoulder, already the feature of AW19, was pinched, volumised and pinned from behind. My favourite look of the season so far? An otherwise boring sweater with a suspended band that hovered implausibly above the collar. Worn with a pair of charcoal trousers and a red polka dot tote, it hit that G-spot where function meets true fashion and makes four weeks of shows feel more worthwhile.\n\nIt was grown-up, it was polished, it was full of couture details. Balenciaga was born a couture house after all and Gvasalia doesn\u2019t shy away from that \u2014 he just keeps his cuts for the things that are important \u2014 the suiting, the parkas and those endless, epic coats.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOn its own the collection was stunning, if fractionally too long and hard to see. It also provoked all sorts of thoughts about \u201cnew luxury\u201d, and the new vogue for the bourgeois that has dictated the season\u2019s mood so far. In many ways Balenciaga\u2019s themes echoed the message of the season, where mature, slightly retro clothes have featured everywhere, from Gucci and Burberry, to Celine and Dolce & Gabbana, and designers have seemed less focused on the youth. I\u2019m not sure a single designer this month has mentioned \u201cthe millennial\u201d as a muse.\n\nAnd there\u2019s been less logomania. In recent seasons, luxury houses (and especially Balenciaga) have branded themselves like sportswear giants, such as Adidas or Nike. For AW19 things have been more subtle: there\u2019s been more focus on the clothes making than the brand name, and while there were still lots of logos at Balenciaga, they were slightly less brash and in your face. On the handbags, where a letter B was used as hardware, the branding was often blackened out.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOne hopes it reflects a changing market in which consumers are less interested in buying exorbitantly priced T-shirts and more interested in the quality of the clothes. In the era of the \u201cAmazon puffa\u201d, and at a time where consumers are increasingly focused on value, the emphasis on more \u201cluxurious\u201d clothing might read as an act of self-defence. After all, if you want someone to spend \u00a33,000 on a coat, it should at least look, and feel, smart.\n\nIt might explain also the rise of that Seventies \u201cbourgeois\u201d mood \u2014 where loafers, equestrian details and headscarves have been key. It\u2019s more sophisticated surely, but you have to wonder how the modern woman will feel about this \u201clady\u201d sensibility. When I asked Derek Blasberg, the head of fashion and beauty partnerships at YouTube, to describe the style of Silicon Valley at the moment, he answered \u201cyoga\u201d. It\u2019s hard to imagine the wellness empresses of California finishing their spin class and putting on a box-pleat skirt.\n\nNeither would I have wanted to be flaunting a Thatcher-era pussy-bow blouse on Avenue Montaigne this weekend, where the gilets jaunes were out in force, as they have now been for months. Stuck on luxury\u2019s most bougie boulevard on Saturday as huge swaths of demonstrators surrounded the car, my instinct was simply to blend in. Fashion has an almost Marie Antoinette-ish capacity for denial and escaping into fantasy when real life gets too strong. Balenciaga was one of the few brands that seemed grounded in reality. Or at least some awareness of the world around it. The coats were couture style but they came in hazard yellow.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIs fashion\u2019s preoccupation with the signifiers of the propertied classes a rallying call for custom, or a last-ditch cry for help? At Herm\u00e8s, arguably the brand to which the bourgeois woman most aspires, I asked designer Nad\u00e8ge Vanhee-Cybulski. The heritage brand has been quietly furnishing the world\u2019s wealthiest people for decades, and the padded quilted nappa leather puffas, cashmere coats and printed silk day dresses (inspired by a scarf print) she presented for AW19 were no exception.\n\nAnd yet she argues that the longevity and power of Herm\u00e8s is found in its being a \u201cdemocratic brand\u201d. The house of the astronomically expensive Birkin handbag is democratic? Come off it. \u201cFor me, Herm\u00e8s is about craftsmanship, and humanity. I\u2019m never thinking about transmitting a woman\u2019s status in society,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut on the men, and women, who are the experts in the house. I\u2019m purely focused on the skills of the atelier. The craftwork, and the detail. It\u2019s democratic, because everyone can see the beauty in the work.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCarefully modest, craft-focused and cautious with its marketing, it\u2019s ironic that Herm\u00e8s is one of the most powerful brands. Its annual revenues amount to more than \u20ac5bn, but if you want an anecdotal indicator as to just how well it\u2019s doing, have a wander around any Herm\u00e8s store. Wherever you are in the world, along with Chanel, Gucci and Louis Vuitton, it\u2019s always, always the busiest one.\n\nThat said, and as with many of Vanhee-Cybulski\u2019s collections, I could live with a little less of the house\u2019s expertise. Did those lovely scarf-print blouses really need a pleated trim along the placket, or the ruffle running from the shoulder down the sleeve? Is there a massive demand for tailored leather knickerbockers? And does she always have to show such heavy shoes? I quibble. There were many delicious things here. Such as the black leather caban jacket, with overstitching, and a moss green cashmere coat with leather trims. Quietly stylish, epically expensive and essentially bourgeois. Clothes for people who care more about the quality, and have no interest at all in sticking out.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

    "text": "As at many shows, there were many flowers at Givenchy, but these were micro florals, inspired by the designs on a porcelain vase, and engineer printed on to pleated dresses. The dresses, with their high-neck collars and mid-calf ruffly hems, looked highly feminine but never girlish. They were as pretty as can be.\n\nLike Valentino\u2019s Pierpaolo Piccioli, Givenchy\u2019s creative director Clare Waight Keller has had a stellar year. With her careful tailoring and focus on more elevated daywear she has redefined the codes of brand Givenchy and, in dressing the Duchess of Sussex, she has snagged the most visible client in the world.\n\nGivenchy \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIt was perhaps no coincidence that her \u201cWinter of Eden\u201d collection took its cue from the early Nineties, when a generation of young aristocratic models, such as Honor Fraser and Stella Tennant, started working in the business, bringing with them the bourgeois trappings of their ancestors and fusing them with the grungy flavours of the street. Having lost many of its esteemed and valued clients during the tenure of Riccardo Tisci, who gained a lot of younger customers with his more sporty point of view, Waight Keller\u2019s focus has been to reestablish the essential elegance at the core of Givenchy. She has worked on sharpening the tailoring (which is currently doing good business), and used the house\u2019s famed atelier to develop her couture-style silhouettes. \u201cIt\u2019s about clean modernity,\u201d she said of this collection. \u201cIt\u2019s less about sweatshirts, and more about the projection of a modern girl. I want to say that looking chic is beautiful, and then add some freshness in the mix.\u201d\n\nGivenchy \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThis collection came in many shapes and sizes, from the clever new curved shoulder on the blazers, to the waisted coats with broad belt fastenings, the fluid florals and the huge pink debutante sleeves like something worn by Lady Di. Denim details poked out from under blouson capes and shirts, and the leather mini-skirt, sculpted sweater gowns and cropped blazers made for pleasant little sparks of surprise.\n\nGivenchy \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIn past seasons Waight Keller\u2019s look has been more prescriptive; here were a dozen different styles. If you didn\u2019t think the micro-pleats would suit you, why not try a crystal strewn tuxedo suit for size? It had a lot of personality. And thankfully so. Waight Keller is a cautious, conscientious grafter, it was good to see her have fun and letting go.\n\nStella McCartney \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIf Givenchy gave us Winter Eden, Stella McCartney provided looks to do the weeding in. Quilted multicolour dresses in vintage fabrics, a khaki boiler suit, such as a Land Girl might wear, Hunter wellies, claiming to be the \u201cmost sustainable rubber boots ever made\u201d, and an army-style green hoodie, the collection had base notes of Northern Soul and the whiff of compost chic. Although, McCartney herself described it all as \u201cconscious couture\u201d.\n\nStella McCartney \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAlongside this upcycled, utility-based AW19 collection, McCartney was also launching a campaign, #thereshegrows, to persuade people to dedicate a tree to save the Leuser Ecosystem, an ancient forest on the island of Sumatra. But this was not the only effort to be more ecologically transparent: she had also sourced a sustainable viscose from a certified forest, and used organic cotton and eco-canvas, too. Not bad for a girl who staged her own little Brexit from the Kering group last year, and who must now fight for the planet as a force of nature on her own. She\u2019s clearly doing something quite impressive: she even got Oprah Winfrey to sit front row.\n\nStella McCartney \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

    "text": "\u201cTruth and roses have thorns about them\u201d, warned Henry David Thoreau, the essayist, poet, philosopher and naturalist wont to living in a wooden hut. Which may be true, but designers just love getting scratched.\n\nRoses represent all the dualities that fashion adores to speak of \u2014 fierceness and fragility, youth and decay, romance and repulsion \u2014 plus, you know, they look quite good on a frock. \u201cAfter women, flowers are the most divine creations,\u201d goes another quote, attributed to the late couturier Christian Dior. Which sounds like the kind of greasy charm you might lavish on a client. But as an enduring symbol of a general sense of loveliness, the rose motif serves fashion pretty well.\n\nPaco Rabanne \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThis season has been particularly bountiful, and roses have flowered on all sorts of catwalks and in every kind of guise. At Prada, they hung in wilted silk corsages. Dries Van Noten plucked \u201cimperfect\u201d specimens from his garden, shot pictures of them and turned them into prints. At Paco Rabanne, Julien Dossena used a rose print to essay \u201cold-school Hollywood\u201d on a tight satin skirt with a Roxy Music-era train.\n\nDries Van Noten \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAt the show entitled \u201cRose\u201d at Noir Kei Ninomiya, the flower made for glorious bouquets. Ninomiya, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Japanese brand Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, and under whose umbrella he still shows, had used the flower both as dressing and adornment. Working with the floral artist Azuma Makoto, each of his 32 looks included a rose headpiece with flowers so fragrant they filled the catwalk with a lovely rosy fug. Later in the collection, the flower became an actual detail on the dresses or, rather, great pink rose-strewn cocoons. As a reminder to stop and smell them, it was really rather cute.\n\nNoir\n\nNoir\n\nNoir\n\nAt Valentino, roses were the centrepiece of a recurring print throughout designer Pierpaolo Piccioli\u2019s AW19 show. Designed to represent a montage of \u201cmodern romanticism\u201d, the print was developed by Jun Takahashi, of the streetwear label Undercover, with whom Piccioli now regularly works: the pair collaborated on their menswear shows at Pitti Uomo, and an Undercover print appeared in the Valentino pre-collection, too. Alongside the roses, the print featured a Renaissance sculpture of a couple kissing, a starry constellation and lines of love poetry. The poems had been commissioned by Valentino, and the contributors included Greta Bellamacina, Yrsa Daley-Ward, Robert Montgomery and Mustafa The Poet. Here\u2019s a fragment, by Daley-Ward: \u201cRoses are always armed; that should tell you something.\u201d\n\nValentino \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWhat it told me was that this collection was a love bomb. And, with its sheer sorbet-coloured fairy dresses, goddess gowns and prints aplenty, it was about as subtle as a whack around the head. But hey, when in Rome (which is where Valentino is headquartered), it\u2019s easy to let emotions run amok. Besides, Piccioli must be feeling pretty loved up right now. He\u2019s enjoyed a near perfect year of critical acclaim, red-carpet glory (last week he whipped up another showstopper, for actress Brie Larson, in the perfect shade of Captain Marvel blue) and the general adoration of his fans. He picked up the prize for best designer at the Fashion Awards in December. That he was conveying a sense of \u201cmodern romanticism\u201d with this collection wasn\u2019t much of a surprise.\n\nValentino \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBut you can have too much of a good thing. So many roses, so much print and such an insistent theme made this courtship a little too intense at times. I craved the simpler seductions of his purer designs \u2014 such as the full-length gown in ivory, so plain it looked almost monastic, a stunning off-white trouser suit, a drapey damson dress in silk and wool cr\u00eape that looked a bit Grecian, another in crimson red. But these were parcelled out like little treats between the lover-print peacoats and appliqu\u00e9d capes.\n\nValentino \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIt\u2019s possible Piccioli could be the victim of his own success. His signature style \u2014 swooning gowns in the couture manner \u2014 has been so tremendously successful that it\u2019s also been tremendously picked up. Rare has been the catwalk this season that hasn\u2019t featured at least one dress in a saturated colour, and in the same extravagant, voluminous style. This collection suggested that he feels some pressure to move on and offer something different. That he doesn\u2019t want to get stuck in the same creative trap.\n\nValentino \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThere will always be other gardeners out there, and some will cultivate the same variants of rose. But Piccioli can rest easy: few will ever smell as sweet.\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

    "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nEurope\u2019s growth companies have big challenges ahead, from the potential disruption of Brexit to the end of the era of easy money. But this annual FT 1000 ranking \u2014 now in its third year \u2014 suggests that there are still many routes to increasing revenues at a rapid pace.\n\nThe FT 1000, compiled with Statista, lists the European companies that achieved the highest compound annual growth rate in revenue between 2014 and 2017. The hurdle to securing a place was a little higher this year: the bottom-ranked company achieved a growth rate of 37.7 per cent, compared with 34.6 per cent last year.\n\nFood delivery start-up Deliveroo has been edged off the top spot by fellow UK company Blue Motor Finance, which provides point-of-sale car finance. Meal-kit delivery service HelloFresh, which topped the 2017 ranking, is one of 91 companies that have demonstrated consistent turnover growth by making the list for three years running.\n\nThe FT 1000 continues to be dominated by the technology sector, which accounts for 149 of the businesses, and that is without counting the fintech and ecommerce categories. Again, Germany has the lion\u2019s share of company headquarters at 230, while London remains the top city, with 63 businesses based there \u2014 down from last year\u2019s 74.\n\nScroll below the interactive table for a full methodology.\n\n* Companies marked with an asterisk had less than 12 months of revenue in the 2014 financial year, but it still passed \u20ac100,000 revenue.\n\n** Companies marked with a double asterisk have been acquired since the ending of the relevant timeframe.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe FT 1000: Europe\u2019s Fastest Growing Companies is a list of the top 1000 companies in Europe that have achieved the highest percentage growth in revenues between 2014 and 2017.\n\nThe ranking of the FT 1000 was created through a complex procedure. Although the search was very extensive, the ranking does not claim to be complete, as some companies did not want to make their figures public or did not participate for other reasons.\n\nThe project was advertised online and in print, allowing all eligible companies to register via the websites created by Statista and the Financial Times. In addition, through research in company databases and other public sources Statista has identified tens of thousands of companies in Europe as potential candidates for the FT 1000 ranking. These companies were invited to participate in the competition by post, email and telephone.\n\nThe application phase ran from September 1 2018 to December 31 2018. The submitted revenue figures had to be certified by the CFO, CEO or a member of the executive committee of the company.\n\nCriteria for inclusion in the list\n\nTo be included in the list of Europe\u2019s fastest growing companies, a company had to meet the following criteria:\n\nRevenue of at least \u20ac100,000 generated in 2014 (or currency value equivalent according to the average of the actual fiscal year).\n\nRevenue of at least \u20ac1.5 million generated in 2017 (or currency value equivalent according to the average of the actual fiscal year).\n\nThe company is independent (the company is not a subsidiary or branch office of any kind).\n\nThe revenue growth between 2014 and 2017 was primarily organic (ie \u201cinternally\u201d stimulated)\n\nIf a company is listed on a stock exchange, its share price has not fallen 50% or more since 2017\n\nCompanies from these countries were eligible to participate: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.\n\nCalculation of growth rates\n\nThe calculation of company growth rates is based on the revenue figures submitted by the companies in the respective national currency. For better comparability in the ranking the revenue figures were converted into euros. The average exchange rate for the financial year indicated by the company was used for this purpose.\n\nThe compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was calculated as follows:\n\n((revenue2017 / revenue2014)^(1/3)) - 1 = CAGR\n\nThe absolute growth between 2014 and 2017 was calculated as follows:\n\n(revenue2017 / revenue2014) - 1 = Growth rate\n\nEvaluation and quality assurance\n\nAll data reported by the companies was processed and checked by Statista. Missing data entries (employee numbers, address data, etc.) were researched in detail. Companies that did not fulfill the criteria for inclusion in the ranking were deleted.\n\nThe minimum average growth rate required to be included in the ranking this year was 37.7 per cent."

    "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nOnline education is a fast-evolving market: the past few years have seen several business schools create purely online MBAs.\n\nSo it is surprising that little has changed at the top of the FT\u2019s online education ranking for 2019.\n\nWarwick Business School retains the number one slot this year for the best online MBA, partly on the strength of its faculty, but also its value for money and its graduates\u2019 career progression.\n\nThe growth in online education is reflected in the rankings with the arrival of the MBA@UNC programme, created by the University of North Carolina\u2019s Kenan-Flagler Business School, at number five on the list. This course started as recently as July 2011 and has risen quickly through the ranks.\n\nThe key factors that decide the top 10 online MBAs are the career progress of alumni, the diversity of the cohort and the quality of online delivery. The two main criteria for career progress, as for the FT\u2019s global MBA ranking, are alumni salaries three years after graduation and the percentage rise in salary.\n\nAverage salaries for the top online courses are comparable to those on the FT\u2019s ranking of full-time, campus MBAs. The average salary across all online courses on this list is $148,742. This is not far off the $189,975 average for the top 10 full-time MBAs in the 2019 global ranking.\n\nWarwick Business School\u2019s alumni salary for their online MBA is particularly strong. Its online graduates earn $214,141 on average, compared with $118,406 for its full-time MBA ranking. This is partly due to the school\u2019s strong reputation, but also because students on its online course tend to be older, have enjoyed more career progression and earn more than their full-time peers.\n\nThere is a difference in the way the percentage increase in salary is calculated. For online MBAs, we use alumni salaries on graduation as the base, as opposed to full-time MBAs, for which the pre-MBA salary is the base. Despite this, we can draw some interesting comparisons.\n\nThe big difference between online and full-time study is the salary increase. The average rise across the online courses is 32.1 per cent, compared with 119.5 per cent for the top 10 full-time MBAs in the 2019 global ranking.\n\nThis is due to student demographics. Full-time MBA students tend to be in their late 20s and at a point in their career where they enjoy rapid promotion. There is much more scope for them to increase their earnings after their MBA. Online MBA students, on the other hand, are more likely to be in their mid-30s and to switch careers after graduating. This means their salary is more likely to plateau \u2014 or even decrease \u2014 after the course.\n\nThe ranking also highlights a common misunderstanding about online MBA courses. Many people think that they attract more international students compared with full-time courses because they can be studied anywhere.\n\nThe data suggests this is incorrect. The average percentage of overseas students at the five US schools in this year\u2019s online MBA list is just 6.8 per cent. This contrasts to an average of 42.7 per cent for the seven US schools in the top 10 of the full-time MBA ranking. This suggests that in-person networking remains key for full-time MBA students.\n\nKey to the table Weighting percentages shown in brackets.\n\nFor the three gender-related criteria, schools that have 50:50 (male: female) composition receive the highest score. Salary today US$ (20): average alumni salary three years after graduation, $ PPP equivalent (see methodology).\u2020 Salary increase (10): percentage increase in alumni salary in the current job versus three years ago on graduation. \u2020 Value for money (3): calculated according to alumni\u2019s salary, fees and other costs.\u2020 Career progress (4): progression in the alumni\u2019s seniority and the size of company they now work for, versus three years ago on graduation.\u2020 Aims achieved (4): the extent to which alumni fulfilled their goals for taking an online MBA.\u2020 Careers service (4): the effectiveness of the school\u2019s careers service in terms of career counselling, personal development, networking events and recruitment, as rated by the school\u2019s alumni.\u2020 Programme delivery (5): how alumni rate the online delivery of live teaching, other teaching materials and online exams.\u2020 Online interaction (10): how alumni rate the interaction between students, teamwork and the availability of faculty.\u2020 Female faculty (3): percentage of female members of faculty. Female students (3): percentage of female students on the MBA programme. Women on board (1): percentage of female members on the school\u2019s advisory board. International faculty (4): percentage of faculty whose citizenship differs from their country of employment. International students (4): percentage of current students whose citizenship differs from the country the school is located in. International board (2): percentage of the board whose citizenship differs from the country in which the business school is situated. International mobility (5): based on alumni citizenship and the countries where they worked before their MBA, on graduation and three years after graduation.\u2020 Faculty with doctorates (5): percentage of full-time faculty with a doctoral degree. Corporate social responsibility (3): proportion of credits from core courses dedicated to CSR, ethics, social and environmental issues. FT research rank (10): calculated according to number of articles published by a school\u2019s current, full-time faculty members in 50 academic and practitioner journals between January 2016 and December 2018. Rank combines absolute number of publications, with the number weighted relative to the faculty\u2019s size. \u2020 Includes data for the class of 2015 and one or two preceding classes where available."

There are no markings on it and it is composed of elements from different models of bicycle. I wanted it to look like a shadow. Price on request; Boulevard du Temple 17, 75003 Paris (bicyclestore.fr).\n\nChristopher Jenner, conceptual designer\n\nI\u2019m very attached to my Bristol bike by Pelago. It has a Brooks leather saddle and a Dutch upright-style frame, but it\u2019s very fast \u2013 which is unusual for this design. It has just three gears and its weight is perfect for me. \u20ac675; pelagobicycles.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00d8ivind Slaatto, product designer\n\nCycling is like breathing to me; I go everywhere by bike. I have four: an Omnium Cargo that is useful for carrying heavy things to the studio; a Cannondale sports bike that is great for covering long distances; a folding Brompton; and an old one for leaving at the airport when I go overseas. Brompton, from \u00a3845; brompton.com. Cannondale Quick 1, \u20ac1,249; cannondale.com. Omnium Cargo, DKr17,499 (about \u00a32,045); omniumcargo.dk.\n\nBarnaby Barford, artist\n\nI adore my S2L Brompton bike, which I have used every day since I bought it. It\u2019s fast and fun. I also gave my eldest son an Islabike Beinn 20 for a recent birthday. These bikes are extremely well made with the right size components, so they\u2019re easy for children to ride \u2013 hopefully he\u2019ll love being out on his. S2L Brompton, from \u00a3975; brompton.com. Islabike Beinn 20, from \u00a3389.99; islabikes.co.uk.\n\nAntonio Sersale, hotelier\n\nI bought a wonderful Cannondale racing bicycle from this great shop in Sorrento called Reaction Retail, not far from where I live. I am not the fittest of cyclists but this is a serious road bike, from a very serious American brand. I cycle regularly with a group of locals on the Amalfitana road. I\u2019m also eyeing a Triumph motorcycle, to go zooming up and down the Costiera Amalfitana. I think it will have to be a vintage one \u2013 they\u2019re super-classic; the most classic bike there is. Cannondale racing bicycle, from \u00a3649.99; Viale Nizza 58, 80067 Sorrento (sorrentobike.com). Triumph, triumph.co.uk.\n\nOliver Spencer, fashion designer\n\nMy Brompton bike is incredibly flexible and I ride it everywhere in London, including to my studio every day. I like the mechanical set up of this bike and the fact that it\u2019s made in England. I bring it on planes, trains, and even in the back of taxis, and the seat extension allows me to take a child to school on the back. From \u00a3845; brompton.co.uk.\n\nMourad Mazouz, restaurateur\n\nTransport on two wheels is important to me \u2013 although it\u2019s about the sense of freedom as much as the bikes. I was the first in London to buy an eco\u2011friendly scooter, a Vectrix; it\u2019s free to park in the West End and it\u2019s also good for society. From \u20ac4,900; vectrix.com."

    "authors": [
      "Lucy Warwick-Ching",
      "Family Money",
      "Personal Finance Advice"
    ],
    "text": "The tax-free childcare account has been ignored by most of the families it was meant to help \u2014 and I\u2019m not surprised.\n\nDespite saving hundreds of pounds on childcare bills for my two small children I have a love-hate relationship with the government account. I tell every new mother and father I meet about it and how much they can save on their childcare bills \u2014 before wondering just how much time I\u2019m going to have to set aside to help them understand how it works.\n\nMy experience of setting up and maintaining the account has been blighted by a catalogue of errors, from IT glitches when the website was first launched, to a problem relating to top-up payments and delays in paying bills to my childcare providers.\n\nLast month, just when everything seemed to be running smoothly, disaster struck again. This time the code associated with my son\u2019s tax-free account became linked with another child\u2019s name. I discovered, four months into the school year, that I had been paying my son\u2019s bill twice each month: once via the government\u2019s childcare account that I had diligently topped up each month (to get the free top-up); and then again via my \u201cemergency credit card\u201d that I had been asked to register with the after-school care account \u201cjust in case I didn\u2019t pay\u201d.\n\nIt could have been worse. The double payments could have related to my younger daughter\u2019s (eye wateringly expensive) nursery bill. But the fact remained that I was still hundreds of pounds in the red on the credit card and only received a full refund after a lot of angst and time on the phone to my childcare provider.\n\nThe intention behind the tax-free account is commendable \u2014 to reduce the excruciating costs associated with childcare for parents wishing to return to work \u2014 but the administration and funding of the scheme is severely lacking. It is too complex, time-consuming and has been fraught with technical problems during its roll-out. Many parents are unaware that this childcare scheme exists. Among those that do, few understand how it works or are put off by the \u201chassle\u201d associated with signing up to it.\n\nWhen I mentioned the tax-free accounts to parents at my child\u2019s nursery, for instance, their responses included: \u201cIsn\u2019t this the same as the 30 free hours?\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m retraining, do I qualify?\u201d; and \u201cWhat if I earn more than six figures?\u201d No one I came across had more than a glancing idea of the scheme or its benefits.\n\nTheir unfamiliarity is reflected in data from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) which show the government paid out just \u00a332m for tax-free childcare in the 2017-18 tax year \u2014 less than a tenth of the \u00a3390m it anticipated the policy would cost in its first year. Moreover, just 91,000 families of the 1.5m eligible to use the scheme had signed up by last December.\n\nThis lack of engagement makes no financial sense for parents. The savings from the account can be significant, particularly in London where childcare costs are steep.\n\nFamilies who use tax-free childcare receive \u00a32 from the government for every \u00a38 they pay in, to a value of \u00a32,000 per child per year. The account works alongside another childcare policy: parents of three- and four-year-olds can also apply for 30 hours of so-called \u201cfree\u201d childcare a week. To qualify, you must work at least 16 hours a week at the national living wage or higher and each parent must earn less than \u00a3100,000 a year.\n\nOn paper these schemes work well but in reality neither the tax-free childcare account nor the 30 hours scheme is promoted properly to parents. They are two schemes among a range of different types of childcare support, from child tax credits to childcare vouchers, each with different eligibility criteria and rules governing how they interact with each other.\n\nIt can also be difficult to compare options for parents, says Becky O\u2019Connor, personal finance specialist at Royal London. For a working couple paying the basic rate of income tax and have two children, the tax-free account will save them about \u00a3600 a year less than under the old childcare voucher scheme. This was offered through some employers, but was closed to new applicants in October 2018.\n\nWhat should have been a positive policy to help parents return to work has become a confusing initiative. Megan Jarvie, head of Coram Family and Childcare, a charity, this week said the government needed to streamline the maze of childcare support schemes so that families can understand what they are entitled to and access the childcare they need.\n\nEven if parents know about the financial help they are entitled to and have time to apply, many will struggle to find the childcare they need\n\nResearch from the charity published on Thursday found that childcare prices have risen by 3 per cent in the past year. Parents now pay an average of \u00a3127 a week or more than \u00a36,600 a year, just for a part-time nursery place. This varies across the country, with a part-time nursery place for a child under two in inner London reaching \u00a39,100 a year.\n\nHowever, even if parents know about the financial help they are entitled to and have time to apply, many will struggle to find the childcare they need. Coram says just over half of local areas in England have enough capacity to supply childcare for parents working full-time, due to inadequate funding from the government via local authorities.\n\nChildcare providers that contacted the FT told me they decided to limit the number of places they have for children of parents claiming the 30 hours of funding. Others have had to cross-subsidise the offer by charging higher fees to parents of younger children, while some have had to introduce additional \u201ccontributions\u201d to cover the higher costs.\n\nThe childcare support system is creaking under these pressures. It urgently needs to be simplified and better explained to parents before it can become a meaningful way to help parents back into the workforce.\n\nLucy Warwick-Ching is digital and communities editor of FT Money.

    "title": "Access all areas with the titans of Japanese art",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "I am sitting in an industrial car park in a Tokyo suburb on a drizzly Wednesday morning, waiting. A metallic clank shatters the silence as a garage door begins to roll up; slowly and steadily, like a theatre curtain, the grey, urban tableau transforms into a vivid, otherworldly burst of colour.\n\nCentre stage is an atelier with bright canvases stacked against white walls, clusters of squeezed paint tubes, overflowing ashtrays and a random scattering of unfinished bronze sculptures. Hauling up the door is a smiling young man in a navy wool hat, round gold-wire glasses and paint-spattered boots, who greets us with a quick bow of the head before asking us to step inside.\n\nIt\u2019s not every day you get invited into the world of Yukimasa Ida. A soaring star of Japan\u2019s contemporary art scene, the 29-year-old is famed for his distinct portrait style, faces often blurred into abstraction by haphazardly layered oils forming an impasto of raw jewel shades. (His collectors include Leonardo DiCaprio and Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, the man who broke auction records with his $110.5m Basquiat purchase in 2017.)\n\nArguably as remarkable as his artworks, though, is the fact that this visit is happening at all. My encounter with Ida was masterminded by People Make Places (PMP), a Tokyo-based outfit that designs trips across Japan tailored to the most precise personal interests. Be it a passion for rare, cultish Japanese denim, unusual nihonshu sakes or the finest examples of the art of kintsugi (ceramics repaired with gold), PMP creates ultra-specialist itineraries that delve far deeper than conventional tours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne area where PMP excels is contemporary Japanese art. This is no small thing: Japan\u2019s art world is famously tricky to navigate, with its minefield of cultural and linguistic barriers to entry, plus, more often than not, the absolute need for insider introductions. PMP circumvents these challenges through its impressively well-placed contacts to help its clientele \u2013 which includes international auction houses, contemporary museums and many private collectors \u2013 delve deep behind the scenes.\n\nThese bespoke tours aren\u2019t just about Sugimoto, Nara, Murakami or others in the pantheon of Japanese global art stars (though PMP can, given the time and the spending budget, arrange access to many of them). Instead, for genuine collectors and appassionati, PMP arranges private introductions to artists and makers who are celebrated in Japan \u2013 from contemporary painters to third-generation potters \u2013 but have perhaps not yet penetrated the world stage.\n\nMy own experience started with breakfast at the Aman Tokyo. I was whisked past a minimalist festive ikebana display (this hotel doesn\u2019t do Christmas baubles) and led to a window table in the restaurant, where PMP\u2019s founder, Charles Spreckley, a 42-year-old British journalist and editor who has lived in Tokyo for over two decades (during which our paths have crossed a number of times) was waiting for me. Softly spoken, perennially calm and unwaveringly discreet (first point of order at our breakfast: I\u2019m not allowed to publish client names \u2013 although I am allowed to say he was in the process of designing a trip for mega-donors to a major California museum), Spreckley explains, while tucking into a delicate medley of small dishes, that it all boils down to PMP\u2019s invaluable expert \u201cfriends\u201d. \u201cJapanese culture is entirely based on respect \u2013 for people, processes, objects, nature and other people\u2019s work. Connected to that, there is a culture of patience and dedication and thoughtfulness. It\u2019s about the process more than the reward. Because promoting yourself can feel or appear disrespectful, it takes time for talent to come to the fore.\u201d\n\nAs if on cue, PMP \u201cfriend\u201d number one, Shu Kuge, appears. A former comparative literature professor and artist who lived in California for decades, Kuge is as entertaining as he is stylish, in mustard tweed jacket, fashionable glasses, neon watch and yellow-and-blue trainers. After a mood-setting whizz around the National Museum of Modern Art, lingering in front of the delicate modernity of century-old silk screens depicting snow-covered pine trees, we are off, on the drive to Ida\u2019s studio in the Machida suburb.\n\nWhen we arrive, Kuge politely produces some Henri Le Roux chocolates \u2013 a thoughtful (and typically Japanese) gift for the artist, who is standing amid 360 degrees of unfinished artworks and cluttered tools. \u201cI moved here six months ago,\u201d smiles Ida. \u201cI\u2019m really good at making a mess.\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately we gravitate towards an epic three-panel work-in-progress at the rear, with abstract swathes of colour framing a cast of familiar figures (I spy the Pope, Audrey Hepburn and a Rembrandt-esque bathing woman among them). \u201cIt looks huge, but from a cosmic perspective it\u2019s very small,\u201d explains Ida, lighting the first of a continuous trail of cigarettes. As I sit on a hastily produced chair, a cup of politely proffered water on the stepladder next to me, he continues: \u201cMy interests lie in humans and history. You often encounter a person just once in a lifetime \u2013 the Japanese saying for this is ichi-go ichi-e. This theme of encounters, a moment happening just once, runs through all my work.\u201d\n\nFor the next hour, Ida smokes, laughs and ruminates as the conversation meanders from the influence of his artist father and teenage rebellion (he tried to stop painting but it didn\u2019t last) to his need for isolation. It\u2019s an exchange that is insightful, inspiring and \u2013 a precious anomaly, in the normally strictly controlled and protocol-saturated culture of Japanese meetings \u2013 refreshingly relaxed.\n\nAfter zooming back into the neon circus of central Tokyo, we pull up outside a nondescript old apartment block. I follow Kuge into a rickety elevator and trundle up to a 12th-floor apartment; swapping shoes for fluffy blue slippers at the entrance, we follow a dark corridor into a small room packed with a dizzying explosion of seemingly unrelated paraphernalia \u2013 stuffed rabbits, books, robots, black lace underwear, erotic sketches.\n\nHolding court is a small man in a hot\u2011pink T-shirt sitting at a table crowded with persimmon fruits, mugs of tea, a model of a breast-flashing woman and a robotic Mickey Mouse: he is Hajime Sorayama, the 72-year-old artist-illustrator famed for his simmeringly erotic female robots and for designing the original Sony AIBO robot dog.\n\n\u201cCan you advertise my work?\u201d he asks cheekily, releasing the first of many amused hoots during a surreally non-linear conversation. He proves to be an expert question dodger (Q: What do you do here? A: It\u2019s a secret. Q: Where do you live? A: the Imperial Palace). What he does tell me, among other things, is: he once drew Hitler as a robot with swastika veins; he works mainly overseas because \u201cJapanese clients have no money\u201d; he recently met David Beckham but has no idea what Beckham said because of his cockney accent; he has no interest in putting technology inside his female robots; and the life-sized drawing of a near-naked woman stuck to the ceiling (her pert posterior is directly, unavoidably above my head) is his ex-girlfriend \u2013 who was a vampire.\n\nFor all his zany political incorrectness, he clearly has influential admirers \u2013 as witnessed by the bespoke Dior silk jacket hanging behind me, custom-made for him by his friend, Dior creative director Kim Jones, to wear to the French house\u2019s recent collection presentation in Tokyo (Sorayama created a 11.9m-high female robot sculpture for the runway, and his illustrations will feature in Dior\u2019s pre-fall 2019 collection this summer). \u201cBeauty isn\u2019t my goal; I just want to do things that haven\u2019t been done before,\u201d he explains.\n\nA calmer but no less interesting story unfolds the next day in Kyoto. After a journey down on the bullet train, I am met by a sleek black BMW kitted out with bespoke electric-blue woven textile seating \u2013 courtesy of its owner, Hosoo, a 17th-century textile company that is a textbook-perfect example of Kyoto innovation. Currently steered by 12th-generation scion Masataka Hosoo (a presence at global design events from Milan to New York, he\u2019s unfortunately out of town when I visit), the textile house balances its historic kimono-production roots with a stream of contemporary projects that range from custom weaves for Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Dior to collaborations with Ritz-Carlton, Ambush and Leica, among others \u2013 and not forgetting the singular and ultra-exclusive Hosoo machiya residence, where I will be sleeping that night.\n\nIn the BMW sits Sara Aiko Coe, another PMP \u201cfriend\u201d: bubbly, clever and chic, she has a Kyoto-born mother and a father from New Zealand, which positions her perfectly to understand, and translate, the city\u2019s closed and socially complex world. Our first stop is the peaceful home of ceramic artists Shinya Tanoue and Machiko Hashimoto. Passing a traditional noren curtain, we wander past pottery wheels before entering a small tatami room filled with Tanoue\u2019s signature creations: organically curved, shell-like structures with white starburst etchings contrasting with a deep, smooth turquoise glaze. (They are increasingly coveted by serious collectors and museums: the director of Oregon\u2019s Portland Japanese Garden, widely regarded as the most authentic example outside Japan, keeps one on his desk.)\n\nSipping tea on the sofa, surrounded by shelves of sunlit vessels crafted by his wife, Tanoue talks quietly about his work. \u201c[Each piece] is a bit like an eggshell, just before it cracks. You ask yourself, is there life inside, or has life already started?\u201d he explains.\n\nWe are joined by Robert Yellin, a Kyoto-based American pottery expert with wild grey hair, who takes me to his atmospheric teahouse-style home-gallery near the Philosopher\u2019s Path. Yellin is a crucial conduit between many Japanese artists and the world beyond Japan\u2019s borders (just days earlier, he\u2019d sold a Tanoue work to a major New York collector). In his small exhibition space, my head is turned by the unglazed lines of one 15th-century jar, and abstract paintings by artist Daiki Nishimura (who apparently won the heart of the Aman Tokyo\u2019s designer, resulting in a 15-canvas commission for the hotel). \u201cIt\u2019s great to have old pieces, but it\u2019s even more exciting to find someone young and talented and bring them to the attention of the world,\u201d Yellin notes.\n\nLater, a slightly different side of Kyoto shifts into focus. I follow Aiko Coe uncertainly through an anonymous-looking car park at the rear of a hospital-style building before a hidden staircase takes us into Art Office Ozasa \u2013 a minimal white and concrete gallery showcasing Katsuhito Nishikawa\u2019s serene cloud photography. With neat grey hair and black poloneck, gallery director Yoshitomo Ozasa \u2013 a powerful, if understated, titan of Kyoto\u2019s art world \u2013 politely describes how he rather likes being hard to find: \u201cI often show older-generation artists. Younger people want to be loud and have big shows; I don\u2019t want to do that. My taste lies with more simple works. The more you promote, the more your value is reduced.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe day concludes watching chefs prepare a Kyoto-perfect contemporary kaiseki dinner at Wakuden Muromachi, an intimate counter restaurant with superlative cuisine (the mibuna mustard greens with pine nuts and fresh, jelly-like persimmon were among many highlights) and an ambience that masters the balance between intimacy, exclusivity and subtle informality. Then I repair to Hosoo Residence. Located down a quiet alley, the two-storey wooden house, which I have all to myself, was exquisitely restored by Hosoo\u2019s top brass, with (among many other exquisite design elements) a striking striped stonework wall in shades of pastels, and chairs upholstered in dazzlingly intricate woven metallic house fabrics. There\u2019s also a deliciously comfortable bed, into which I tumble after a soak in the black stone bath overlooking a small white pebble garden.\n\nMy final day opens two intriguing doors. First I visit the scenic family home of legendary ceramic artist Takahiro Kondo. A third-generation potter (his grandfather was a Living National Treasure), Kondo is calmly animated as he explains, over a steady stream of tea served in distractingly beautiful vessels, how Kyoto\u2019s once tightly-knit pottery community fragmented after the second world war, sparking waves of creative innovation. A private tour of his immaculately tidy workshop offers a precious glimpse into his latest works \u2013 white, curved vases, some perfect in structure, others collapsing with petal-like apertures and irregular foldings: \u201cI want to see how things create themselves,\u201d he says simply of their extraordinary forms.\n\nIn the afternoon I\u2019m driven about an hour out of the city to the studio of avant-garde calligraphy artist Tomoko Kawao, celebrated for her large-scale performances (she often uses her body to create \u201cbrush\u201d strokes). Warm, charming, with long ink-brush hair, she invites me to kneel at a low table inside the large, near-empty house to learn the rudiments of her art form (with, alas, limited success \u2013 the meditative action of rubbing ink into a block, which normally lasts an hour, makes my arm ache after two minutes).\n\nThen comes the PMP moment: a private calligraphy performance. Tension builds as Kawao kneels, eyes closed, in front of a large blank sheet of white paper; then, springing lightly to her bare feet, she plunges a huge brush into an ink bucket before dancing across the paper, the brush leaving dynamic trails of abstract strokes. Then abruptly she kneels again, inviting calm to descend.\n\nIt\u2019s a serendipitous twist that the word she chooses to paint for me is isshun \u2013 \u201cone moment\u201d or \u201cblink of an eye\u201d. That very Japanese notion of a single, never-to-be\u2011repeated moment in time has long been deeply rooted in the nation\u2019s creative DNA \u2013 a theme I observed threaded through the textured oils of Ida\u2019s paintings, the curved lines of Tanoue\u2019s shells, the fractured vases of Kondo. Likewise with my own encounters with all of them \u2013 singular moments that, in their aggregate, made for a lastingly memorable foray into the world of contemporary Japanese arts.\n\n442"

    "text": "MPs have urged the City watchdog to explain why HM Revenue & Customs has asked tens of thousands of self-employed workers to consider remortgaging their homes or take out loans to settle huge tax bills.\n\nA cross-party group of MPs objected to letters that HMRC has sent to about 50,000 individuals facing the loan charge \u2014 a new law that will tax up to 20 years of income received via \u201cdisguised remuneration schemes\u201d in one year.\n\nLetters sent by HMRC and seen by the Financial Times state: \u201cIt is expected that you use every means to meet your obligations and pay the tax and interest liabilities that are due. This may include raising a loan or selling other assets.\u201d\n\nMary Aiston, HMRC director of counter-avoidance, told the Treasury select committee in January: \u201cFor some people, [HMRC] may say [to them] you need to take a loan out if you have got equity in your property, if that\u2019s the right answer and people can manage the repayments.\u201d\n\nThe All-Party Parliamentary Group on the loan charge has written to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, to query whether the advice given by HMRC was a potential \u201cbreach of FCA regulations\u201d.\n\nAs political pressure mounts, Nicky Morgan, Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury select committee, has written separately to HMRC and Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, questioning how they are able to justify pursuing debts going back 20 years.\n\nMs Morgan also questioned why contractors who had declared the use of loan schemes on their tax returns, yet had heard nothing back from HMRC, were being caught by the new charge. \u201c[Such individuals] could have reasonably believed that their tax affairs were in order,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSir Ed Davey, chair of the APPG, said: \u201cThe FCA has stated that \u2018debt advice and the provision of personal loans or lending is a regulated activity\u2019 so we have written to [them] asking if HMRC\u2019s advice is in breach of their rules, as HMRC are not on the FCA list of approved organisations to offer debt advice.\u201d\n\nHe added that HMRC\u2019s advice was \u201cclearly inappropriate\u201d, as many people facing the loan charge would struggle to repay debts of this size as they were self-employed, retired or nearing retirement.\n\n\u201c[Several] reputable lenders will not lend the amounts of money to pay the huge demands many people are facing,\u201d Sir Ed added. As a result, he warned there was also \u201ca real danger\u201d that people would turn to less reputable lenders charging punitive rates of interest.\n\nOne individual facing a \u00a3100,000 bill who wished to remain anonymous said he called his mortgage provider \u201cin desperation\u201d to ask if he could remortgage, on the back of Ms Aiston\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201c[The lender] said they absolutely could not do that,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only was that devastating to hear but it also made my mortgage company think that I am in real trouble, which doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019m already in a fragile state.\u201d\n\nAnother individual facing similar difficulties said he had contacted six high street banks to ask whether he could obtain a personal loan to meet his tax bill. Only one \u2014 HSBC \u2014 said they would be willing to consider this.\n\nHMRC said: \u201cHMRC does not give personal financial advice. However, where taxpayers don\u2019t have the necessary liquidity, but do have assets that could be used to raise funds to pay what is legally owed, this is an option that should be considered.\u201d\n\nAn FCA spokesperson said: \u201cWe have received the letter and will respond.\u201d\n\nFT Money called some of the UK\u2019s biggest banks and building societies to find out how easy it would be to remortgage or take out a personal loan to pay a large tax bill.\n\nThe majority of lenders said they would not allow individuals to take out personal loans of \u00a350,000 or more to pay a tax bill. Of the 10 surveyed, only three \u2014 HSBC, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank \u2014 said they would consider such a request.\n\nThe same three lenders, plus Santander, Tesco Bank and TSB, said they would consider requests to remortgage in order to pay a tax bill. However, the majority of the lenders surveyed by FT Money said they would not. These included Aldermore, Barclays, Coventry Building Society, Halifax, Lloyds, Nationwide, Royal Bank of Scotland, Virgin Money and Yorkshire Building Society.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson said: \u201c[Disguised remuneration] schemes were designed to allow individuals to avoid paying income tax and national insurance on their earnings. The loan charge means people paying themselves through loans, often from offshore trusts, will now have to contribute their fair share to pay for our public services. We\u2019re producing a report about the issue of time limits for tax inquiries and disguised remuneration schemes, which will be published this month.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m faced with losing my home and my family, or having no retirement. If I lose my home and my family what\u2019s the incentive for me to work any more?\n\nRoss Thomson, Scottish Conservative MP and vice-chair of the APPG, said the loan charge \u201coverrides existing statutory taxpayer protections, allowing HMRC to seek tax for \u2018closed years\u2019 when they have no legal right to do so. This is quite manifestly retrospective and it is simply ludicrous to present it as anything else.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, MPs heard emotional testimony from the family of a contractor who had committed suicide because of the tax bills he faced as a result of the loan charge.\n\nMPs also heard evidence from a social worker, locum doctor and government contractor who had joined the loan schemes on the advice of accountants and recruitment agencies.\n\nRon Macey, a project engineer in the gas industry, told the MPs that HMRC needed to give more heed to what people could afford to pay.\n\n\u201cIf we have got to pay, we\u2019ve got to pay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m faced with losing my home and my family, or having no retirement. If I lose my home and my family what\u2019s the incentive for me to work any more? You\u2019ve got professional people here \u2014 doctors, nurses, financial people \u2014 if they go bankrupt they can never work in their professions again. What is the point of making them destitute, of ruining their careers and ruining the benefit to the country?\u201d"

      "Saint Laurent"
    ],
    "text": "The models aren\u2019t getting any bigger at Saint Laurent, but at least they\u2019re taking up more space. In the shoulders. Designer Anthony Vaccarello said that everything in his AW19 show for the Kering-owned label \u201chad started from the shoulder . . . to give a sharp sophistication to the liberated impulse of desire\u201d.\n\nIndeed. The construction, set slightly behind the shoulder and then padded, and exaggeratedly high, was certainly alluring. I\u2019m all about power tailoring at the moment. Vaccarello had channelled the spirit of the Eighties, and the energy of the house icons such as Bianca Jagger, Catherine Deneuve and Betty Catroux, to find his silhouette, and it seems so right for now. I felt the same surge of desirability at the Max Mara show last week, which also took an Eighties icon, Linda Evangelista, as its cue.\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nHere, the first look was the best one. Saint Laurent women are designed to look daunting, and this broad, in her herringbone overcoat with big lapels, barely there top and high-waisted satin trousers looked as dangerous as hell.\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nA small change, maybe, but this new shoulder shape, as well as the more avowedly Eighties sensibility seemed significant. A recalibration for the designer who succeeded Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent in 2016 and who has endured endless comparison ever since. This collection looked to be tilting in a new direction. The trousers for example, with their pleat at the front, were a break away from the liquorice-stick skinny leg. The \u201cOpium\u201d embroidered velvets, as inspired by the brand\u2019s fabled fragrance of that name, looked less rock chick and more luxurious. Where the last collection was Seventies glam rock and provocative, this felt more sensual and well-rounded than before.\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBut did that mean Vaccarello was done with the bestsellers \u2014 micro-mini cocktail dresses, hot pants, chiffon blouses \u2014 that have defined the brand in recent years? Lord no. There were still bountiful numbers of them here, and just as well considering Saint Laurent has just recorded its 20th quarter of successive growth and is set to hit \u20ac2bn in revenues this year. The brand\u2019s bankers, I don\u2019t imagine they\u2019re going anywhere soon. But it was the other stuff \u2014 a tiered, ruffled skirt in black leather with a button fastening down the front, a sequin top with chinoiserie-style flowers, the coat, the coat, the coat that got my heart racing here.\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWhile this was probably Vaccarello\u2019s best show yet for Saint Laurent, there were still some bum notes. Why, if you\u2019re bothering to show menswear, would you not extend the same new shoulder to him as well? Where were the Eighties influences for the guys? In a co-ed show in which the men barely got a look in, it seemed unfortunate not to give their looks more consideration. Instead they wandered by in standard skinny suiting \u2014 looking dangerously like an afterthought. Likewise, a long section at the end showing neon looks in black lighting which seemed to last for hours, mainly because I had no clue what I was looking at. Was that a faux fur shrug in neon orange, or a cocktail dress with a dayglo trim? Was it menswear, womenswear or something in between?\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nHowever, in light of recent competition (in the shape of Slimane who now offers his brand of waifish rock chick at the LVMH-owned Celine), Vaccarello\u2019s efforts made for a clever counter narrative. This Saint Laurent show offered new excitements but was steeped in the sensibility of its founder and \u2014 essentially \u2014 it felt authentic and brilliantly on brand. A bit of competition has been very good for him.\n\nSaint Laurent has been playing with its brand iconography and developing its story since 1961. Marine Serre, the French designer who won the LVMH prize in 2017, and who only made her runway debut in 2018, has managed to create one of the most distinct brands on the market in just over a year. Her \u201clogo\u201d, such that it is, recalls a crescent moon and is printed on bodystockings, leotards, leggings and under clothes to be worn like a second skin. For AW19 it went neon: on heads as balaclavas, over denim jeans and on to stretchy booties, too. Her brand is so all-consuming you can wear it head to toe.\n\nMarine Serre \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMarine Serre \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSuch a simple idea has been phenomenally successful. Serre\u2019s team now numbers 30 and her FutureWear studio is now producing 10,000 pieces for a prestigious range of global stockists. But it\u2019s as much for her outlook that the brand is gaining momentum. Since launching, Serre has championed feminine empowerment (her moon logo is the symbol of the woman), tolerance, environmental kindness and other ecological concerns that chime well with the times. She is careful about production, often using upcycled materials as part of her design. She\u2019s earnest \u2014 she served vegan food and chicory flavoured coffee at her show \u2014 but never boring. Hers is a rare young voice that thrills.\n\nMarine Serre \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMarine Serre \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nHer AW19 collection, \u201cRadiation\u201d, lead us to an underground cavern lit with fluorescent lights and imagined a world where \u201cecological crises and climate wars are destroying the last remains of civilisation\u201d. Her breakout survivors were a tribe of warriors whose style combined Apollo spacesuits, hazmat jackets, fluorescent yellow ball-gowns, driftwood jewellery, trash-bag dresses and \u201caction-hero coats\u201d. Yes, it all sounds a bit daft and Mad Max. But considering Paris is currently basking in the hottest temperatures yet recorded for the month of February, Serre may have a point. And while her futuristic fashion was extreme, it showed off a real skill for tailoring, form and innovation. I loved it \u2014 especially the \u201cgarbage\u201d strewn chain, with its seashell accessory, that functioned as a ticket. If fashion is all about tribalism, and belonging, I want to be in Marine Serre\u2019s gang.\n\nMarine Serre \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMarine Serre \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

    "text": "Working on the Dior exhibition, newly opened at the V&A and already sold out, has proven fertile ground for the brand\u2019s director of womenswear Maria Grazia Chiuri. This season she had been inspired by one the UK\u2019s ancient subcultures \u2014 the Teddy Girls of the Fifties \u2014 whom she has come to know through visiting the city, where she now has a flat.\n\nBut she had also used the exhibition, and its staging, as an opportunity to reflect on Dior as a brand, and on the culture at the house. \u201cDior is a more corporate brand than many,\u201d she said of the LVMH-owned company shortly before the show. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s less clear what exactly the Dior brand might be. It\u2019s a house which has had very different designers [there have been seven] and each has brought a very different style.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSeeing the work of individual designers \u2014 among them John Galliano, Raf Simons and Yves Saint Laurent \u2014 showcased at the V&A had only emphasised their differences. But other exhibition rooms, dedicated to broader themes at the house \u2014 the garden, the showstopper, the princess gown \u2014 had helped Chiuri identify its codes. The Teddy Girl duster coats, tartan skirts and patent jackets in her AW19 show, may have taken their cue from an underground movement adopted by the British working classes, but the real thrust of this collection was in Chiuri\u2019s reimagining of the circle skirts, bar jackets and dove grey tailoring designed by the brand\u2019s founder during that same period.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIf Chiuri has created a design signature at Dior it has been in making the house favourites work for the modern day. Heavy wool skirts are now lighter and more fluid, and she has replaced stiff organzas with cotton. The Bar jacket, with its sculptural peplum waist has been made less stiff and formal. And the sequin fairy skirts are more ethereal as well. For AW19, the \u201ccorset\u201d had been remade as a wide leather belt with elasticated panels, while the little fitted tops of Fifties debutantes were remade as black sweaters and adorned with a knitted bow. The looks were sparked with Teddy flair \u2014 a leather biker jacket, a stripy sweater, a pair of tartan culottes \u2014 but in the marriage between subculture and sophisticate, the sophisticate held the upper hand.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThere were a lot of looks, and a lot of it wasn\u2019t very thrilling \u2014 but then I\u2019m pretty sure it isn\u2019t designed to be. Chiuri\u2019s Dior is preoccupied with clothes that reflect real life, designs that are comfortable and wearable. Backstage, she spoke of the importance of dressing to suit your personality, rather than having a look imposed on you by a designer, and her collections are designed with Everywoman in mind: albeit an Everywoman who can buy a thousand-pound handbag and might have need for calf-length sequin skirts.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAnother Chiuri signature has been to highlight the world of female creatives and feminists in her work. This show\u2019s first look featured a T-shirt printed with \u201cSisterhood is Powerful\u201d, from the 1970 book by author and activist Robin Morgan. Pictures of naked women posed as letters of the alphabet by Bianca Pucciarelli Menna, the Italian artist better known by her male alter ego Tomaso Bingo, lined the walls. As a platform to promote equality and empowerment, Chiuri has one of the biggest in fashion. And as an endeavour, it\u2019s honourable, earnest and inarguably right on.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSome designer want to tell a story \u2014 to transfer you to a different world, to make you dream. Chiuri\u2019s collections are rooted in reality. Even though there were lots of elements going on here, the collection didn\u2019t take me very far at all. It was, dare I say, a trifle dull. But then again, in retail, there\u2019s an expression called \u201cwardrobing\u201d which describes brands that cover lots of categories \u2014 shoes, bags, coats, dresses \u2014 and do those items very well. Chiuri\u2019s Dior is very \u201cwardrobey\u201d. It\u2019s stuffed full of product, and highly wearable. While it\u2019s not always thrilling, it\u2019s sure going to sell.\n\n\u00a9 Dior\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

If you are looking for practical tips and inspiration on ways to command an audience, whether that's in a meeting or on social media, then this is the event for you.\n\nViv Groskop, author of 'How to Own the Room', will talk to FT feature writer Emma Jacobs about her work, from a career in journalism to becoming a stand up comedian, author and executive performance coach. Along the way she has learned a lot - and overturned the stereotypes about women and public performance. Now she teaches others how to perform better - and this interactive event will include drinks, practical exercises and takeaways, and the chance to ask Viv about your own performance dilemmas.\n\nViv's books will be available for purchase on the night.\n\nRead content related to the FT Engage event by signing up to an FT trial - visit ft.com/engage for more details. *Terms & Conditions apply"

    "authors": [
      "Jo Ellison",
      "Fashion Shows"
    ],
    "text": "For some time now Bottega Veneta has been one of the weakest players in the Kering stable. It has been dwarfed by the successes of Gucci, the group\u2019s star performer, and Saint Laurent, which eclipsed Bottega some time ago to become the second-biggest revenue driver at the house. In the group\u2019s annual statement, released last week, Bottega Veneta recorded revenues of \u20ac1.109bn, down 3.4 per cent on a comparable basis year on year.\n\nBut that\u2019s all set to change. After Saint Laurent, Gucci and Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta is the latest Kering brand to receive a reboot. Last June, and following the fairly unexpected departure of Tomas Maier, who served for 17 years as creative director, Kering announced their new man: a 32-year-old Englishman called Daniel Lee.\n\nDaniel who? Precisely. But the appointment of a relative unknown was in keeping with the current Kering habit of employing designers with long experiences of working with a brand but not leading them. Lee comes not from within the group however, but from the LVMH-owned Celine, where he worked with Phoebe Philo as the director of ready-to-wear design. A graduate of Central Saint Martin, he was tapped by Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault following Philo\u2019s departure. Celine has since gone in another creative direction under the direction of Hedi Slimane.\n\nBottega Veneta \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBottega Veneta \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nKering made a canny appointment. With Philo, who eschewed social media marketing and abhorred e-commerce, Lee helped steer the brand to revenues of around \u20ac800m and cultivated a devout tribe of female clients. In his former role, Lee delivered an aesthetic for minimal clothing with a subversive fashionability that earned Celine a reputation for \u201cintelligent\u201d clothes. Since Philo\u2019s departure, many brands have rushed to fill the vacuum, delivering their versions of a look in which Lee played no small part.\n\nBottega Veneta \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAnd so, the billion dollar question, did Daniel Lee\u2019s new Bottega Veneta look like old Celine?\n\nYes and no. It included menswear, to begin with, which he hasn\u2019t done before. But die-hard fans will have recognise many of his signatures \u2014 the loopy knitwear with its circular cutaway panels, the heavy soled elasticated Chelsea boots, the scoop-necked tops and the play on a bourgeois sensibility \u2014 corporate tailoring, minimal outerwear, blouses \u2014 with more subversive elements, such as ruched tulle eveningwear and leather bra-lets, shot through.\n\nBottega Veneta \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBottega Veneta \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBut this was a far tougher, more complicated collection than I expected. While the menswear was more minimal and straightforward, the women\u2019s was ambitious in design: a quilted skirt, in turquoise, folded at the sides and fastened with a chain; thick quilted biker trousers; tailoring that mimicked the house\u2019s famous intrecciato weave; a series of mirror-embroidered dresses and shirts. There was a lot going on.\n\nLee has been working on the collection for more than six months \u2014 he decided to skip last season and wait until he was ready to mount a show. Looking at this first collection, I wondered whether a tighter deadline might have suited him better. Some of it was lovely, a lot looked overworked. It was stylistically fussy, and surprisingly clumsy at times.\n\nSportmax \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSportmax \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOf the accessories, on which Bottega Veneta does the vast bulk of its business, there were several new ideas \u2014 a quilted clutch and tote bag in a supersized woven leather were arresting, as was a boxy handbag in tomato red with a bold, gold clasp. But none had that snatch it out of the model\u2019s hand desirability that I hoped so dearly to feel. It\u2019s also excruciatingly expensive. Lee\u2019s first Bottega Veneta merchandise is in store now, part of a pre-collection that has been quietly introduced. A new look tote bag will set you back about \u00a33,000.\n\nTod's \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nTod's \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThese are early days for Lee who must now negotiate his day job alongside the business of marketing the brand. And doing interviews. He seems quite unprepared for that. Backstage, before a throng of frenzied press journalists, he looked utterly bamboozled. Conversation was quickly cut short. Some designers are born to sell their product \u2014 usually those, such as Michael Kors and Tom Ford, who are brand founders and have pitched their wares on countless stages. In the safety of the Celine studio, Lee has been protected by the culture of anonymity \u2014 but we all know his name now. I don\u2019t doubt he\u2019ll find his voice. For someone so timid in person, his collection was strident \u2014 and surprisingly loud.\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLoud strident design has been a major theme in Milan, where lots of shows have featured a clumpy, elasticated bovver boot and tons of attitude. You might call it punk-y, if that didn\u2019t sound deliriously dated. At Gucci models wore fetish-style collars studded with nail-long barbs, the mood at Prada was dark and angry. Even at Tod\u2019s, the leather house more often associated with quiet gentility, the models wore black leather shorts and heavy patent boots. Riding boots, harnesses and leather strapping was a feature of the Sportmax show as well.\n\nWhy so many heavy, leathery looks? Is fashion feeling beleaguered? Or arming itself for a fight? Whatever it is, it\u2019s looking fearsome right now.\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

    "authors": [
      "Jo Ellison",
      "Fashion Shows"
    ],
    "text": "Miuccia Prada\u2019s AW19 collection for Prada was mostly black, staged on a jagged, spiked, sponge floor, sparsely lit, and rather angry. The models wore dark wool separates, tweeds, flak jackets, sparkly shoes and lace. Dresses with the classic Prada sweetheart neckline were fashioned in a raw grey tweed. A rose print motif was encircled by thorns. The models had Wednesday Addams hairstyles (the Addams family have been a regular feature at recent Prada collections) but they just as easily recalled Greta Thunberg, the Swedish 16-year-old climate change activist, who also has waist-length braids.\n\nPrada said her collection was about fear, and the threat of war \u201cin general\u201d. And romance. If she was feeling a little adversarial, perhaps she has good cause.\n\nThe Italian designer has always taken pride in her abstruse, stubborn, sometimes alternative point of view. She deliberately goes against the consensus. As she said this week, in an interview for the Business of Fashion: \u201cI\u2019m deeply against clich\u00e9 or the usual or what everybody else does.\u201d\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nNevertheless, her desire to be contrary has been curtailed of late. The recent fall out over the sale of a racially inflammatory Prada keychain, that looked like a monkey, has found the designer, along with Gucci\u2019s Alessandro Michele, embroiled in a broader debate about cultural sensitivity. Her new initiative, a diversity council, whose members include her friends the artist Theaster Gates and filmmaker Ava DuVernay, has been established to elevate voices of colour within the company, and in the industry at large. She expects the council to educate \u2014 and to be educated in return.\n\nIt\u2019s been a salutary lesson. Prada is only just creeping out of a long period of profit decline. The early signs are that its long overhaul is beginning to bear fruit. Last year, the Prada co-chief executive and owner Patrizio Bertelli declared that \u201ca new phase of progress has begun\u201d. A public relations disaster is not what they need.\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThis collection seemed less vulnerable to nuance and misrepresentation. It\u2019s messaging simple \u2014 it was a show of extremes. It was dark and light, rebellious and romantic. It featured stompy, heavy boots and a goth-metal soundtrack (spliced with campy horror themes such as The X Files) mixed with flashes of deep femininity \u2014 lace veils, crystal embellishments and rose adornments (some, stuck on outfits in wilting silk bouquets). It\u2019s dark energy was exciting \u2014 the clothes were better still. It showed women, as Prada collections are wont to do, as having different sides. This woman looked emphatically feminine \u2014 and royally pissed off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem for my whole career,\u201d said Prada of her own struggle to reconcile a passion for more political matters with her work in fashion, a job she summarised backstage as \u201cmaking clothes for rich people\u201d and a diversion for most people \u201cdesigned for lighter times\u201d. Although she makes broad statements with her collections \u2014 about women, fear, angst, empowerment \u2014 she finds it \u201cdifficult to sound intelligent when talking about politics in fashion because the themes can seem very superficial\u201d.\n\nThat she has created a new forum for a more constructive discussion is a good thing. In the current climate of recrimination, where social media has become a tinder box for outrage, we need more arenas for sensible debate. Perhaps more importantly, we need more arenas in which to listen.\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans"

    "authors": [
      "Madison Darbyshire",
      "Private Wealth",
      "Next Act",
      "Wealth Management"
    ],
    "text": "When Karl Lagerfeld, fashion royalty and longtime creative engine behind Chanel died on February 19th, the media rushed to speculate who would inherit the heir-less designer\u2019s vast fortune. Choupette, his beloved Birman cat, quickly became the top contender.\n\nThe German designer mentioned his intentions to leave Choupette at least part of his estate multiple times over the years. In an interview in the French Numero magazine, he said that Choupette would be his heir, \u201camong others\u201d. He added: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there is enough for everyone.\u201d\n\nA twitter account run on behalf of Choupette with the bio \u201cDaddy @KarlLagerfeld\u2019s spoiled pussy whose maids pamper her every need\u201d has since retweeted several stories reporting that she could inherit his millions.\n\nRich pets capture the public imagination, but their reality is much more straightforward. A search for \u201crich pets\u201d online sees Choupette rank alongside Blackie, an English black cat reportedly worth $13m and a $40m miniature poodle named Toby who allegedly inherited his fortune from a Gilded Age heiress in 1931, beating out the 2,300 people who claimed to be her heirs after her death. Gunther IV, a German Shepard the Miami Herald was duped into reporting had inherited a fictitious fortune from a German Countess, still consistently tops the rich pet rankings.\n\n'Corsa Karl and Choupette' at the Palazzo Italia in Berlin, Germany, 03 February 2015 \u00a9 DPA/PA Images\n\nFor the most part, rich pets are red herrings, arising from rumours about the eccentricities of the uber wealthy spun into fact by the press over decades. And while rich pets do exist, what constitutes pet affluence is a more complicated question, resting on structures determined by the owner and their asset managers and estate lawyers.\n\nHow the super-rich care for their pets after they die is a growing, and very discreet, area of estate law, says Valerie Wu, a partner specialising in tax, trust and fund law at Pinsent Masons, the law firm, in Singapore. Pets, she says, have become an established class of beneficiary.\n\nThe wealth of her clients, Wu says, \u201cis evolving to the extent, that affluence is an understatement. The fact that the dogs are beneficiaries means that they could be much wealthier than any common folk.\u201d\n\nGunther IV with members of his entourage \u00a9 Contrasto/eyevine\n\nEven Gunther\u2019s fictional reputation as the richest dog in the world is partly a question of definition: dogs cannot hold bank accounts, so all of Gunther\u2019s purchases would be made by a trust.\n\nIt is a common misconception in the lore of rich pets that animals can be asset-holders; in fact, they are assets themselves under the law. Dogs cannot inherit money directly, because they cannot legally acknowledge the wealth transfer nor sign bank account paperwork. Paw prints, it turns out, will not suffice legally.\n\nInstead, clients looking to provide for their animals can use trusts, either fixed or discretionary. Trusts can be created for people, says Jon Conder, a partner at law firm Macfarlanes in London, or they can be created for purpose. \u201cTrust law allows for a trust for purpose where the trust\u2019s purpose is looking after animals. It\u2019s not just a hope [for owners] \u2014 it\u2019s legally binding.\u201d\n\nA fixed trust is defined by specific instructions for the financial gift \u2014 for example, \u00a315m that is in trust is to be used by a best human friend for the care of a beloved animal. A discretionary trust, on the other hand, requires the trustee to make decisions about how the trust\u2019s money is allocated, and over what period.\n\nIn the dog's house: pet owners can bequeath their wealth for the care of animals in the form of legally binding trusts. \u00a9 Alan Knox/FT\n\nFor this reason, it is important for the wealthy and their wealth managers to decide the language of a trust\u2019s mandate: whether they want it to cover their whole family, how they define family (to include pets), and for how many generations. They must also decide if they would like it to be invested to grow, and decide to whom or what, at the end of its purpose, the trust\u2019s funds should be given, explains Wu. If a pet is left an inheritance in a will and no trust has been established, it is the executor\u2019s responsibility to set one up and appoint a trustee to manage the funds.\n\nWu had a client who put one-sixth of a \u201cparticularly large\u201d estate in trust for his 17 dogs. \u201cHe was very specific how he wanted the dogs to be taken care of,\u201d Wu says. He didn\u2019t just want to ensure that the dogs should receive wet or dry dog food, but instead to ensure that they would have the best of everything for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe trust was created in Singapore because of the city state\u2019s tax incentives for income on trusts, while the dogs resided in Canada. Because animals cannot take ownership of funds, Wu says, \u201cthey will always need a trustee to ensure they benefit from the trust\u201d.\n\nFinding a trustee willing to take responsibility for a dog\u2019s care for the rest of its life can be a challenge for wealth managers. The owner of the 17 dogs wanted the trustee of his pets\u2019 wealth to demonstrate that he had the right administrative team to attend to the dogs\u2019 needs, including a groomer and a veterinarian (one of the dogs had a medical condition). Finding the right person to hire for the role was an exhausting process, Wu says.\n\nWhat happens if the pets have heirs? \u201cA trust is a fixed instrument,\u201d Wu explains, \u201cso it needs to be specified.\u201d If the trust is designed to support the family indefinitely, Wu says, it is reasonable that the trustee would decide that this definition includes offspring.\n\nLeona Helmsley and her dog Trouble \u00a9 INFevents.com\n\nConder says most of his clients prefer to give the money outright to a custodian for their pet, so that their estate can be wound up soon after their death. But Conder suggests that those looking to give or leave money in trust estimate a figure for annual expenses over the lifetime of the pet \u201cand double it\u201d.\n\n\u201cWealthy people do have particular tastes,\u201d Conder adds of his experience. \u201cThey don\u2019t just say, I want Jon to look after my cat or my trustees to look after my dog. It gets quite specific, like requesting a lifetime\u2019s supply of a dog\u2019s favourite food.\u201d\n\nHe says people are often anxious about leaving animals behind when preparing their estates. \u201cThey worry that there might be a problem or that someone won\u2019t be around, but there are solutions to this worry,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not alone in having wishes for their animals and no one will think badly of them.\u201d\n\nThere are three \u201ccertainties\u201d required for a trust, Wu explains: certainty of subject matter, certainty of object and certainty of trust. So when an animal cared for by the trust dies, the object no longer exists, and the trust is terminated.\n\nIn cases where the funds for a pet were a part of a trust but not its sole purpose, the money designated for the pet will either be drawn back into the trust or will go to a designated \u201cfinal repository\u201d, such as a charity or family member.\n\nThat the dogs are beneficiaries means they could be much wealthier than any common folk\n\nTo prevent abuse \u2014 parakeets and kittens cannot easily stand up for themselves \u2014 trustees may also consider assigning a protector, or someone to act as a \u201cwatchdog\u201d for the beneficiary. This holds the trustees accountable and prevents, say, the quiet replacement of an aged black cat with a new one in order to keep a trust alive past its intended expiration \u2014 which advisers in this field say is often a concern.\n\nUltimately, the growth in trusts for pets is a result of an evolving definition of family around the world. \u201cThere is an interesting evolution from what is a classic concept of what a trust should benefit, which is usually family members. It\u2019s a \u2018more than family\u2019 concept,\u201d says Wu.\n\nStill, pet inheritance can be extremely contentious. In a New York Times obituary to Trouble, a dog who received $12m in 2007 after the death of her owner, Leona Helmsley, a woman emblematic of 1980s excess, the dog is described as \u201cthe world\u2019s most hated Maltese\u201d. Two of Helmsley\u2019s grandsons were cut out of the will in favour of the pooch, though many of her remaining substantial assets were directed towards animal welfare causes.\n\nBecause rich animals are evergreen fodder for news reporters, scandalised rumours of wealthy pets can be woven into fact by the press, overshadowing the real legacy of the deceased. Such is the urban myth of Gigoo, a chicken that reportedly inherited \u00a315m from the late Miles Blackwell, the British publishing mogul, and his wife, Briony. Gigoo now features on dozens of lists of \u201cwealthy pets\u201d, despite the chicken inheritance being a fabrication, according to a trustee of the Blackwell estate.\n\n\u201cIt is a silly rumour that doesn\u2019t do credit to the memory of Miles and Briony,\u201d says Jonathan Burchfield, a lawyer at Stone King and a trustee of the Blackwells\u2019 Tubney Charitable Trust. The Blackwells were animal lovers, and their trust distributed close to \u00a370m to charitable causes in the 10 years following their death in 2001. Much of this was directed to animal welfare charities around the world, says Burchfield. \u201cThey established a charity with millions of pounds that was used to create tremendous benefit for the welfare of animals.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be remembered for giving millions to a chicken or something daft like that.\u201d"

    ],
    "text": "Fashion journalists were caught off guard by news of Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s death on Tuesday. Reports that he was very ill abounded, but the reaction was still one of denial. Lagerfeld bestrode the fashion landscape for so many decades, and was so inexhaustible in his output, that no one was prepared to let him go.\n\nMany of the designers on the London Fashion Week schedule weren\u2019t born in 1983 when Lagerfeld was appointed to Chanel. They all grew up under the reign of Kaiser Karl. Dressed in his uniform of a high-collared shirt from Hilditch & Key, whip-thin suiting by Dior, leather gloves and powdered ponytail he embodied the cult of the designer personality and was the centre of an industry around which others merely lapped. In a business full of cynicism he was throughout his life a figure in whom others were in awe.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the most iconic creators of our time,\u201d said Alexander McQueen\u2019s Sarah Burton, one of the many designers showing this week to express their sadness. \u201cHe was a genius, whose talent, generosity and warmth knew no bounds.\u201d\n\nErdem Moralioglu, whose AW19 collection conjured a couture sensibility, praised Lagerfeld\u2019s vision of \u201cuncompromising beauty\u201d. Alexa Chung, who delivered her second catwalk show this season and who interviewed Lagerfeld early in her career, spoke of his overwhelming \u201ckindness\u201d towards her. Riccardo Tisci mourned his \u201cfriend and mentor\u201d.\n\nErdem \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u201cHe was a hero of mine, now and forever,\u201d said Christopher Kane of his influence. \u201cDreams came true on the Chanel runway.\u201d\n\nFor a generation of creatives, many of whom were educated and trained in London, Lagerfeld was a paternal figure: someone who gave them an early boost. \u201cHe has been an incredible guide and I will miss his support enormously,\u201d wrote Jonathan Anderson on Instagram. \u201cHe was clever, wickedly funny and encouraging,\u201d says Sam McKnight, the British hairstylist who has worked with Lagerfeld on the Chanel show for past 10 years. \u201cHe had such high standards for everything, he made you want to do your best. And he was always kind and generous. But the lasting memory will be joy.\u201d\n\nMatty Bovan \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOne hopes this London season would be one Lagerfeld would have approved of: it challenged preconceptions and was busy with ideas. Perhaps there was a little too much nostalgia, a pet hate of his, but it was certainly mischievous, directional and full of unexpected joys.\n\nWhich surprised me. Considering its scheduling, so close to Brexit, I had expected London Fashion Week was going to be more cautious, poised as it was in a period of flux. Currently, the British Fashion Council is pushing for continued access to talent, tariff-free trade, frictionless borders and competitive intellectual property regimes. \u201cWe have hosted roundtables, given evidence to select committees, submitted evidence to white papers and, just this week, hosted a roundtable technical working party to highlight knowledge information gaps as we prepare should there be a no-deal Brexit,\u201d said Caroline Rush, BFC chief executive, at a breakfast review. Her priority? \u201cTo promote creativity and to engage both industry and government to push the needs of the industry worth \u00a332bn to the British economy, and to build a narrative that London is open.\u201d\n\nChristopher Kane \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThe outlook was bracingly positive, even though, like everywhere, no one really has a clue. Each brand currently has its own considerations and concerns \u2014 a senior figure at Kering, which is headquartered in the capital, told me the only thing that might persuade him to leave Britain would be a Jeremy Corbyn government.\n\nBut, out of the crisis came a more creative view. Burberry\u2019s second outing under Tisci was gargantuan, set to a thumping Nineties rave mix and dedicated to the youth and rebel spirit of these islands. It also included lots of lovely suiting. Preen by Thornton Bregazzi dressed models in folkloric embroideries and Morris dancing clogs.\n\nBurberry \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOther collections were also escapist. At JW Anderson, women were imagined as mountain-top figures walking through the clouds. Sleeves were exaggerated, trousers were modelled on wide-legged Oxford bags and the clothes fell in generous silhouettes. The brand\u2019s designer Jonathan Anderson, who has long bemoaned the lack of \u201cfashion\u201d on the schedule, had been determined to do something more stylish himself, and his show blended avant gardist elements, craft touches and some excellent handbags, too. Anderson has now developed a strong accessories line on which to build his business, but it was interesting to note that, at a time when designers might cower behind more commercial collections, he was emboldened to take bigger risks.\n\nJW Anderson \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJW Anderson \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLikewise at Mary Katrantzou, which showcased huge rainbow-coloured feathered dresses and a riot of ruffles, Christopher Kane, whose ultra-feminine satin party dresses with \u201ccupcake\u201d skirts, balloon prints and crystal-embroidered cocktail dresses made for a romantic take on the themes of fetish, and Erdem, who imagined the private world of the Italian heiress Princess Orietta Doria Pamphilj and dressed her in Forties-style circle skirts and Sixties minis.\n\nMary Katrantzou \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMary Katrantzou \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nPrincesses on parade. You will know Molly Goddard\u2019s designs via the huge pink tulle frock worn by Villanelle, the anti-heroine and star of BBC series Killing Eve. For AW19, Goddard imagined women stomping through a storm in grey balaclavas and even bigger gowns. Simone Rocha cast a dozen different ages and dressed them in ethereal, organza trenches and gauzy puffball skirts. Her spider embroideries and prints were made in collaboration with Louise Bourgeois\u2019 foundation and all had an eerie, otherworldly appeal.\n\nMolly Goddard \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMolly Goddard \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nNot everyone was feeling so fantastical though. Ports 1961 continued to essay a quiet business-like authority, Margaret Howell\u2019s classic pieces were desirable and smart, and Grace Wales Bonner showed, once again, her skill for gender neutral, careful, tailored clothes.\n\nSimone Rocha \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSimone Rocha \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nVictoria Beckham delivered her best collection yet. A sharp edit of 38 looks, she showcased tailored tweeds, fluid silks and coats in lipstick red. It was striking and efficient, clothes for a woman with other things to do. It also featured an excellent black suit. And a striking, high-collared white shirt.\n\nVictoria Beckham \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting our Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

    "authors": [

      "Gucci Group Nv"
    ],
    "text": "Kering-owned Gucci reported revenues of more than \u20ac8bn last week, a rise of 33.4 per cent year-on-year and a 36.9 per cent increase on a comparable basis. It was declared by the group \u201can excellent performance\u201d.\n\nBut the star of the Kering-group stable is not invincible. Gucci is currently dealing with the fallout regarding the sale of a high-neck black sweater on which a cut out pair of red lips are designed to be pulled up and worn over the mouth. The \u201cblackface sweater\u201d has outraged civil-rights campaigners and become a social media cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Many have declared a boycott: the rapper 50 Cent, who has 22m followers on Instagram, has burnt his Gucci clothing and is now shaming other artists associated with the brand.\n\nGucci\u2019s response has been swift. It has removed the item from sale and promised to turn \u201cthis incident into a powerful learning moment for the team\u201d. But the event has once again exposed the systemic failure of the fashion industry to see issues of cultural sensitivity. In December Prada was forced to remove a $550 blackface keychain when a woman took offence at finding it in a Manhattan store. Dolce & Gabbana is still dealing with the fallout regarding its ill-fated outing in Shanghai, which involved a racially insensitive campaign, the publication of some inflammatory messages and a show cancellation. Burberry has just apologised for the use of a rope accessory, tied like a noose and worn around the neck as part of the AW19 show on Sunday, following reports that a model felt \u201ctriggered\u201d on seeing it backstage.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSocial-media visibility and growing consumer vigilance can now transform isolated cases into global crises \u2014 and, regardless of the intention, brands cannot afford to be complacent. Race continues to be an especially sensitive subject. Some brands have tried to initiate new measures \u2014 Prada launched a diversity initiative last week designed to \u201celevate voices of colour within the company, and in the fashion industry at large\u201d. And recent seasons have seen more non-white faces being appointed as designers to major houses, as well as appearing on the catwalk. But these incidents still underline the scarcity of representation, especially in fashion\u2019s executive management. Meanwhile, mistakes are still being made.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSome designers are criticised for having a too homogenous point of view \u2014 others for being too sweeping. Gucci\u2019s Alessandro Michele has always used a polyglot of references, which are pan global, particular and frequently provocative. Past collections have showcased Sikh turbans, veiled faces, third eyes, nuns\u2019 habits, porno pants and papal robes. All might be described as offensive. But it\u2019s clear in conversation that Michele, who describes himself as \u201cpagan\u201d, is no bigot. He\u2019s a fan of all mankind, embracing, drawing on and representing many cultures \u2014 and often, and sometimes contentiously, leaving things open to interpretation.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMichele\u2019s AW19 collection was in part an explanation \u2014 or at least an exploration of the authentic \u201cperson\u201d and the different masks we wear. \u201cI used the metaphor of mask to explore garments and what they say about us in real life,\u201d he said of his collection, which used elements of costume with quotidian clothes.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nHis catwalk featured heavy crucifixes, three-piece suits and pointed studded collars \u2014 a sign of defence and an emblem of servility. \u201cI try to stick to the rules, and to comply with the rules,\u201d he said of the collection\u2019s contradictions and his personal tastes. \u201cBut I have a wild side. And I can be very aggressive when I want to express myself.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nNevertheless, he is sorry about the sweater. \u201cFashion is politics. I try not to get involved.\u201d The recent scandal, however, has helped \u201cthe company open their eyes, and let [alternative opinion] in. We\u2019ll do things in a different way from now on. And this change is here to stay.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAs with any Gucci show, this was one with many faces. Several of the looks \u2014 with their balloon-shaped trouser legs and shirt bibs in ruffled lace recalled the clothing of a clown. The models wore latex tears \u2014 like a Pierrot\u2019s. The women carried sneakers, a self-conscious informality. The suiting, pointedly formal and worn with waistcoats and super-wide ties, seemed to suggest that the office look is no less of a guise.\n\nMichele makes no apology for his vision. Nor for his wilder side. But as he made clear after: the masks and bondage collars will not be going on sale.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting our Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

Neither will he dwell on his 32-year stewardship of Chanel, where he has been the chief designer since 1983. He hasn\u2019t even been to visit his vast \u201cfuturespective\u201d in Bonn, Germany, the most complete exhibition of his oeuvre ever mounted, featuring everything from a reproduction of the coat for which he was awarded the Woolmark prize for design in 1954, to his first collections for Chlo\u00e9 (for whom he worked between 1964 and 1996), and from a regiment of mannequins dressed in Chanel tweeds, through Fendi furs to pieces from his own eponymous line.\n\nAbsolutely not! For Lagerfeld, nostalgia is a creative poison. \u201cI\u2019m very much against it,\u201d he says from his studio in Paris. \u201cI\u2019m always into the next step. I\u2019m interested in what\u2019s going on, not what has happened. I never look at the archives. I hate archives!\u201d\n\nIf Lagerfeld sounds impatient, he is. His career has been built on a light-speed forward momentum. It\u2019s the same urgent energy that has enabled him to juggle the demands of three entirely separate and visually distinct houses at the same time (Fendi, Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld) and maintain alternative occupations as a photographer, occasional writer and keeper of Choupette, a snow white cat he was given in 2011 and who now commands an Instagram following of 64,000 followers. Even his unique German accent sounds impatient; like a man exasperated by a sentence\u2019s formulation in his mouth.\n\nKarl Lagerfeld at the new Fendi headquarters in Rome, 2014\n\nHis brisk focus brushes aside those things that displease him. He has already dismissed a publicist from our three-way phone conversation: \u201cI don\u2019t like it when someone listens when I talk to someone.\u201d He also forgoes deep analysis of his creative ideas: \u201cI don\u2019t put that into words because then it would become marketing.\u201d And too much talk of global trends is met with the immaculate: \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not in the sales department.\u201d\n\nTo begin with, he\u2019s not too happy to talk about Fendi\u2019s upcoming couture show either, which is a shame because that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to be doing. Fendi\u2019s first foray on to the couture stage, next week\u2019s Haute Fourrure (high fur) collection, is a debut for the house and the second of two couture shows that Lagerfeld will stage in Paris next week. (In fact, pedants could argue, it will be the third, as he will present Chanel couture twice so as to accommodate everyone who wants to see it). Mounting two collections, within as many days, which serve two different masters, is a superhuman undertaking, especially considering the designer is now 81, or thereabouts (discussion of Lagerfeld\u2019s exact age is hotly discouraged).\n\n\u201cIt was their idea,\u201d he says, when I ask about the Fendi show\u2019s genesis. \u201cI thought it was interesting because there\u2019s the market for that [couture], so I thought it could not be a bad idea to show the top of the craftsmanship in that business. But I didn\u2019t propose to do two collections at couture. I have more jobs and more work than I need . . . \u201d\n\nFantasy fur, Fendi style: vivid at AW14; luxe for AW15; intarsia for SS15\n\nFor the inaugural show on Wednesday, Lagerfeld will deliver about 30 looks in a collection that will shine a renewed focus on the brand\u2019s heritage as a specialist fur house and clothing line. The Italian luxury house was founded as a fur and leather brand by Edoardo and Adele Fendi in 1925. The couple then passed on the reins to their five daughters and, today, granddaughter Silvia Venturini Fendi oversees the men\u2019s and accessories lines alongside Lagerfeld (it was she who introduced the cult \u201cBaguette\u201d handbag in 1997). The house still manifests as a family business, even though LVMH bought a majority stake in 2001 and has since installed a chief executive, Pietro Beccari, who has been instrumental in creating a vision for the brand.\n\n1925: Edoardo and Adele Fendi open their first store on Via del Plebiscito, in Rome\n\nFor Fendi, already fabled for its novel treatment in a highly technical field, Haute Fourrure will be the ultimate expression of \u201cfantasy fur\u201d, as represented by the house\u2019s double \u201cf\u201d logo. Fendi has always innovated with its manufacturing methods: In 1989 the house developed a \u201cgrained leather\u201d technique, that combined fur and leather to create a lighter take of the traditional brown coat. More recently, Lagerfeld has played with texture: for SS15, he used shaved mink, inlaid with vivid geometric designs, to create a \u201cfur that doesn\u2019t even look like fur\u201d. Meanwhile, the house\u2019s \u201cbugs\u201d \u2014 neon-bright clip-on handbag accessories with cartoon faces that retail for about \u00a3500 a piece \u2014 have become an essential feature of the street-style uniform.\n\nThe couture show will allow him to experiment even further. \u201cTypically, the old furs hardly exist any more,\u201d he says of the heavier material that he used to work with. \u201cSo it\u2019s all in the craftsmanship. And at this level, you can push it to a level of craftsmanship that would be too expensive for ready-to-wear: mixing things, design, pattern, fur mixed with feathers, all kinds of things. For me, this is what\u2019s interesting.\u201d\n\n1967: An early Lagerfeld collection features Silvia Fendi as a child\n\nTo put a dedicated fur show within the couture schedule is not without controversy. But Lagerfeld doesn\u2019t do much soul-searching over the use of this most morally complex material. \u201cIt\u2019s changed since in the 1990s and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he says of the legislation that has seen the industry become more rigorously regulated. Nevertheless, there will always be people who see fur as wrong. Lagerfeld, who doesn\u2019t wear fur himself, says. \u201cAs long as people eat meat and wear leather . . . I don\u2019t see the thing . . . \u201d he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too easy, you know \u2014 there are enough unemployed people in the world that you cannot suppress a whole industry that would have nothing else to do.\u201d Besides, he adds: \u201cThe sales are good.\u201d\n\nThe sales are indeed good. According to Mark Oaten, chief executive of the International Fur Federation, the global mink industry alone is worth \u20ac3.7bn, while fox fur is worth a further \u20ac880m. Even in the UK, one of the most squeamish nations when it comes to the subject (and where exotic fur is not featured in many British fashion monthlies) the sales figures are steadily increasingly. \u201cWe saw a 20 per cent rise in London last year,\u201d says Oaten. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t think this was all down to tourism. Sales in cities like Manchester and Leeds are also seeing an increase.\u201d\n\n1970: An eskimo fur coat, as sketched and annotated by Lagerfeld for that year\u2019s AW show\n\nOnly time will tell if Fourrure is a commercial success, but placing the house on this rarefied stage is a neat bit of brand extension, all part of Beccari\u2019s desire \u201cto promote and promote and promote,\u201d according to Lagerfeld. The house will hope also to lure a small but significant clientele, whose numbers have been swelled by the new markets in Russia, Asia and the Middle East.\n\n1986: Lagerfeld surrounded by the five Fendi sisters (Paola, Anna, Franca, Carla and Alda)\n\n\u201cCouture is doing very well\u201d says Lagerfeld. \u201cI have no idea how it works at other houses but at Chanel, it\u2019s kind of a miracle.\u201d Why does he think that is? \u201cPeople want something that is worth spending their money on. \u201cToday, very basic classic things don\u2019t sell, or they have to be in a new material. They have to be from a new world.\u201d\n\nMany creative directors describe couture as being a crucible, in the sense that it allows them to distil a vision that will ultimately inform all of their ready-to-wear. No surprise, Lagerfeld is appalled by the notion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely different spirit,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it was in the same spirit, I just wouldn\u2019t do it because I would be bored to death. I would just say no. No, no, no!\u201d For him, couture is about \u201cthe craftsmanship, the proportions. It has nothing to do with the ready-to-wear. It should not have anything to do with ready-to-wear.\u201d\n\n2000: An intarsia mink fur for AW, with 1960s-inspired geometric patterns\n\nInstead, Lagerfeld starts every collection in the same way. With a blank piece of paper and a pencil. \u201cI sketch things, because I sketch everything,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t work with artists. I sketch everything myself. I wanted to be an illustrator and a potter before I was in fashion, and I was in fashion nearly by accident. So when I do a sketch that I keep \u2014 because 99 per cent goes to the garbage can \u2014 it is hardly changed. And the collection is made in exactly the way I made the sketch. Look at the boards, at Fendi and Chanel. You\u2019ll see the sketch and you\u2019ll see the final dress and they are the same. I\u2019m not there draping for hours and asking myself a hundred questions. Those questions I ask myself before I draw the sketch.\u201d\n\n2013: A neoprene robe coat for AW\n\nLagerfeld\u2019s process, then, is to \u201cpropose\u201d the final garment and then task others with conjuring it to his satisfaction. \u201cExactly, exactly. But I like to see it done in material, in another dimension. It\u2019s very exciting and very interesting. Sometimes you\u2019re disappointed, sometimes you are not. It\u2019s a very strange job. But that\u2019s what I like about it.\u201d\n\nIf Lagerfeld likes to play with new manufacturing techniques, it\u2019s because his sketches challenge the limits of what can be done. Only here does he admit to the advantage of a career\u2019s worth of experience. \u201cFor once, I must say, I have done it for such a long time that, for me, they can do things that are supposed to be unexpected or impossible.\u201d\n\n2014: A structured organza dress for SS, with a digital print pattern inspired by computer pixels\n\nMusic is playing in the background: it\u2019s a song Lagerfeld can\u2019t identify, part of an ever updating playlist he absorbs to keep abreast of cultural developments. He loves the act of discovery, be it a person, place, artist or book. It was he who first took the fashion show on the road, staging Chanel\u2019s M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art (the pre-fall collection) in a unique location every year, and inspiring a dozen other houses to do likewise. He was one of the first people to possess an iPod (he once told journalists he owned 300), and he\u2019s very proud of his new Apple Watch: a bespoke version that was made in rose gold with a matching bracelet. \u201cI think I\u2019m the only one who has one entirely in gold,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very beautiful.\u201d\n\nFendi \u2018Bugs\u2019\n\nHe\u2019ll never iDesign though. \u201cI don\u2019t design on computers,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know how; I don\u2019t like it.\u201d He pauses. \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019m the last designer that really sketches illustrations. And the people I work with are used to reading my sketches. And sometimes I see a fitting that is exactly what I wanted.\u201d\n\nFor a man who bestrides the fashion landscape so completely, the hand-drawn sketch seems also an excellent way of retaining creative control.\n\n\u201cExactly! exactly!\u201d he concludes. \u201cWhatever that means, that\u2019s what it is, my dear.\u201d\n\nPhotographs: Fendi; Catwalking; 2001 Snowbound; Fendi Adele S.r.l. \u2014 Rome"

    "text": "It\u2019s been six months since Burberry first unveiled its new look under the creative direction of Riccardo Tisci. The Italian designer\u2019s debut in September enjoyed a largely enthusiastic critical reception and the show helped reboot the reputation of London fashion, bringing with it a swell of buyers, models and editors who might have otherwise swerved the city. Tagwalk, the online fashion search engine, reported that Burberry was the second most watched show of the entire season and that London Fashion Week enjoyed an 11 per cent boost in web traffic overall.\n\nTisci\u2019s Burberry has been a boon for business more generally, but what of the brand itself? In its half year results, released in December, Burberry reported results in line with expectations. Yet aside from a few special projects, product drops and early collaborations, the first collection is still to arrive in store. The transition has been a long one, especially considering that Christopher Bailey\u2019s final \u201cready-to-buy\u201d collection went on sale last spring.\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMeanwhile, the shareholders are impatient for growth. Perhaps they should bear in mind that Gucci had to sit out a similar waiting period before Alessandro Michele\u2019s designs hit retail. The Kering\u2019s brand\u2019s growth was quite small to begin with. But, oh, just look at it now.\n\nCan Burberry pull off a similar success? Certainly, Tisci threw absolutely everything at his second show, which united the disparate themes of what he considers quintessential Britishness and delivered looks to suit everyone, from the ladies and gentlemen of the aristocracy to the city bankers and the kids on the street.\n\nThe show, called \u201cTempest\u201d, kicked off with the News at Ten soundtrack and an early Nineties broadcast about the rise of rave culture. And then the dance beats started pumping and the ravers arrived. They wore faux-fur coats, off-the-shoulder corset tops, parkas, puffa duffels, sneakers and tracksuits. They were followed by a series of more \u201cgrown up\u201d looks \u2014 a beige interlude of deconstructed trenches, embellished car coats, pleated skirts, printed shirts and crystal-strewn pumps. The chapter-style storytelling was much the same as last season, but the product lines were more developed. In particular, the eveningwear had been invested with some fine Tisci touches, as one would hope of a man who is a whizz at haute couture.\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nShow 106 eclectic looks and you\u2019ll surely find something to suit every taste. Tisci wants Burberry to be a lifestyle brand, and he\u2019s not leaving anyone out. \u201cI have been thinking a lot about England as a country of contrasts,\u201d explained Tisci of his melting pot of influences. \u201cFrom the structured to the rebellious and free. I wanted to celebrate how these elements coexist.\u201d\n\nSo, why chop the collection into chapters? Why not mix it up? Tisci explained: \u201cI know that different people are looking at the collection from different points of view,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch of it was a mash-up, and we used the same fabrications, but the brand is broken down into different styles and price points.\u201d He wanted each chapter to speak directly to each group.\n\nI liked it. It had energy and humour, and though it was at times slightly overwhelming, it was spiked, like the soundtrack, with big hits \u2014 I especially liked the faux-fur lined duvet quilts with a silk print illustration (a carry-over from the pre-collection), a black duster coat with oversized patch pockets and the tweedy car coat worn with driving gloves. I\u2019m a big fan of Tisci\u2019s more sophisticated leanings. The streetwear leaves me slightly confused. I liked the green duffel coat, and tailored tracksuits, but I\u2019m not persuaded the sneakers are enough to lure that all-important youth demographic quite yet.\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIn spirit however, the show was a fine one. Tisci, who arrived in London from Italy as a teenage student, remains enamoured of the city as he found it in the early Nineties, at a time he thinks that the culture was more \u201cfree\u201d. In some ways he is perhaps stubbornly nostalgic about the liberties enjoyed by Thatcher\u2019s children, but his enthusiasm for that era and his enduring affection for London is infectious. Lord knows, we need some love right now.\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry AW19 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nFollow @FTStyle on Twitter and @financialtimesfashion on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.

    "text": "One year ago, Edo Kurniawan, a jovial 33-year-old Indonesian who runs the Asia-Pacific accounting and finance operations for global payments group Wirecard AG, called half a dozen colleagues into a Singapore meeting room. He picked up a whiteboard pen and began to teach them how to cook the books.\n\nHis company would soon become one of Germany\u2019s most valuable financial institutions, but as Mr Kurniawan spoke, the task at hand was to create figures that would convince regulators at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to issue a licence so Wirecard could dole out prepaid bank cards in the Chinese territory.\n\nThe group was seeking to take over payment operations from Citigroup, covering 20,000 retailers in 11 countries stretching from India to New Zealand. Regulatory approvals in every territory were crucial, even if it meant inventing numbers to be used in the Hong Kong licence application.\n\nMr Kurniawan then sketched out a practice known as \u201cround tripping\u201d: a lump of money would leave the bank Wirecard owns in Germany, show its face on the balance sheet of a dormant subsidiary in Hong Kong, depart to sit momentarily in the books of an external \u201ccustomer\u201d, then travel back to Wirecard in India, where it would look to local auditors like legitimate business revenue.\n\nWirecard chief executive officer Markus Braun \u00a9 Bloomberg\n\nIn isolation, Mr Kurniawan\u2019s scheme might have appeared to be the act of a rogue employee in the provincial outpost of a little known financial group. But the account of what happened, in a preliminary report on the investigation by one of Asia\u2019s most eminent legal firms, indicated it was part of a pattern of book-padding across Wirecard\u2019s Asian operations over several years. Documents seen by the Financial Times show two senior executives in the Munich head office had at least some awareness of the round-tripping scheme: Thorsten Holten and Stephan von Erffa, respectively the company\u2019s head of treasury and head of accounting.\n\nThe revelations call into question the figures reported by one of Europe\u2019s few technological success stories, a German fintech group that has grown into a \u20ac20bn global payments institution. Before the FT exposed the existence of the investigation last week, the group was more valuable than Deutsche Bank or Commerzbank, whose place it has taken in Germany\u2019s main stock market index. Wirecard is a favourite of retail investors, who saw its rapid expansion into Asia as a sign that it can challenge the world\u2019s biggest banks for primacy in the $1.4tn market for payments.\n\nMarkus Braun has run the company since helping to recapitalise it in 2002, an investment which made the 49-year-old Austrian a billionaire. In the field of digital money, Wirecard presents itself as best in class.\n\nIn response to the news of the preliminary investigation, Wirecard initially said no material compliance findings had resulted. This week the company told the FT that while its investigation was ongoing, it had made no conclusive findings of criminal misconduct and it would be wrong to draw conclusions from the preliminary report.\n\nIt is not the first time the group\u2019s accounting practices have been called into question. Accusations of suspect accounting were levelled in 2008, 2015 and 2016. Each time Wirecard has alleged market manipulation, sparking investigations by the German market regulator, BaFin.\n\nThis time questions about its Asian operations began internally, prompted by a whistleblower left stunned by Mr Kurniawan\u2019s January meeting last year. Notifying Wirecard\u2019s senior legal counsel in the region on March 26, the whistleblower identified two senior finance executives, James Wardhana and Irene Chai, as accomplices in the book-cooking operation. A separate whistleblower also raised concerns in February, and on April 3 that person supplied the compliance team with a suspect contract they had received via Telegram, the encrypted messaging app.\n\nDaniel Steinhoff, Wirecard\u2019s head of compliance in Munich, flew in to Singapore for a briefing. On April 13 he ordered the email archives of these individuals \u201cmirrored\u201d, with copies seized.\n\nCompliance staff, who evidently found the accounts of the whistleblowers credible, soon found enough in the documents to warrant a snap investigation, codenamed Project Tiger. They called in Singapore-based Rajah & Tann, which sent in a team of former prosecutors.\n\nOn May 4 R&T submitted a preliminary report, running to 30 pages of bombshell allegations: evidence in the documents of \u201cforgery and/or of falsification of accounts\u201d, as well as reasons to suspect \u201ccheating, criminal breach of trust, corruption and/or money laundering\u201d in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nThe trio in Singapore, led by Mr Kurniawan, appears to have been fabricating invoices and agreements to create a paper trail which could be shown to auditors at EY, as if money was moving in and out of Wirecard for legitimate purposes.\n\nJan Marsalek, Wirecard\u2019s chief operating officer\n\nThe job of his finance team was to oversee the figures put together by the various Wirecard companies in the region, then supply the accounts to head office. But the book-keepers were also putting together contracts and signing off on technology projects.\n\nNot only were there no emails from certain supposed customers and suppliers to Wirecard, the preliminary investigation found that Wirecard lawyers, salespeople and technology staff did not appear to be involved in the deals either.\n\nFor example, in March last year Mr Wardhana, sitting at his computer, sent himself a digital copy of the logo for Flexi Flex, a hydraulics and piping company with offices in Singapore and Malaysia. The image was on invoices he presented to colleagues for payments, according to documents seen by the FT. These documents, including contracts for the supply and purchase of obscure software products signed by Mr Kurniawan, made it appear Flexi Flex was doing substantial business with Wirecard.\n\nIn an April 9 2018 email chain, Mr Wardhana drafted answers for queries from EY in Germany needed to close out that year\u2019s audit. He described Flexi Flex as \u201ca new client engaged in 2017\u201d which generated \u20ac4m of revenue for Wirecard Malaysia.\n\nWirecard has since confirmed it had no genuine business relationship with Flexi Flex. Mr Wardhana\u2019s email also attributed \u20ac3m of Hong Kong revenue to Right Momentum Consulting, another third party business partner. The Kuala Lumpur address for the company on documents seen by the FT could not be traced.\n\nThe R&T preliminary report said: \u201cWe may draw strong and irrefutable inferences from the documentary evidence there has been at the very least several accounting irregularities which take the shape of forged agreements. In the best-case scenario, the purpose behind these deliberate acts may be limited to the false creation of revenue, with no wrongful misappropriation of monies.\u201d\n\nSuspect transactions, while individually small in the context of Wirecard revenues, appear to have been designed to stop Wirecard entities missing profit targets, by filling holes after the end of a financial year with fake and backdated sales agreements according to the preliminary report and certain emails reviewed by the FT.\n\nWirecard told the FT on Wednesday that, subsequent to R&T\u2019s preliminary report, a separate internal investigation with access to accounting systems determined that the allegations were unsubstantiated and no regulations were broken. Notwithstanding those findings, the external R&T investigation \u2014 ongoing for more than eight months \u2014 reflected a commitment to good corporate governance, it said.\n\nMunich-based Wirecard was hailed as a star of the fintech firmament \u00a9 DPA\n\nSince 2012 the company has raised \u20ac500m from shareholders, and spent it on a collection of obscure payments companies. Missing profit targets could have called into question the basis of Wirecard\u2019s Asian expansion over the past decade.\n\nR&T\u2019s preliminary review of the documentary evidence and whistleblower testimony identified potential for accounting irregularities in numbers reported to Germany for businesses in the Philippines, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and India.\n\nIt also indicated another potentially significant issue. Singapore and Hong Kong, like Germany, have put in place strict reporting requirements to combat money laundering. Suspicious transactions, such as those identified by Project Tiger, should be brought to the attention of the authorities in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nAs the owner of a bank, and as a member of the Visa and Mastercard payment networks, Wirecard has a responsibility to file such reports. It distributes hundreds of millions of euros in credit and debit card transactions every day. It is a gatekeeper with responsibilities to help police flows of cash as governments try to restrict the ability of criminals and terrorists to move money. Wirecard this week said it has complied with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nYet, faced with evidence that a rogue unit in its fast-growing Asian business was forging documents, inventing money flows and sending real cash out the door to fictitious suppliers, the reaction of senior executives in Munich was curious.\n\nA briefing document dated May 7 2018 was prepared for a meeting of Wirecard\u2019s four most senior executives. Alexander von Knoop, chief financial officer, thanked the author in an email following the meeting \u201cfor the great job you are doing to clarify the circumstances and to prevent Wirecard Group from any financial and reputational damage\u201d.\n\nThe email also announced that Jan Marsalek, Wirecard\u2019s chief operating officer, had been appointed to co-ordinate the inquiry, \u201cto get the necessary pressure on the investigation\u201d, Mr von Knoop said.\n\nA Wirecard booth at a computer games fair in Cologne \u00a9 Reuters\n\nMr Marsalek, a 38-year-old Austrian with a military haircut, tailored suits and novelty solid gold credit card, was renowned within the company. He was also the management board member responsible for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nWirecard\u2019s lawyers in Singapore warned Mr Marsalek\u2019s proposed role presented \u201ca perceived and potential conflict of interest\u201d. He was a material witness of fact who had worked closely with Mr Kurniawan on certain projects, they said.\n\nR&T said in a May 9 email that his appointment could \u201cinvite forceful queries by regulators and enforcement agencies\u201d. It was a potential conflict which could be managed, but that \u201cin the worst case the investigation may be seen as fatally flawed to begin with \u2014 with the consequence that regulators and enforcement agencies may swoop in suddenly to conduct a full investigation of their own\u201d.\n\n\n\nOne matter under scrutiny was Wirecard Singapore\u2019s relationship with a third party, Matrimonial Global. R&T believed a sales agreement with the company had been backdated. A November 8 2017 email from Mr von Erffa pointed to Mr Marsalek\u2019s knowledge of the deal. Outlining the transaction, it said \u201cJan will support us for contracts and communication etc.\u201d\n\nMs Chai appears to have thought he had a stake in Matrimonial Global. On January 9 last year she wrote to a colleague: \u201cIf not mistaken this agreement is something like the one with Wirecard Dubai, I think the company belong to Jan.\u201d\n\nThe colleague replied: \u201cYup, is the additional \u2018revenue\u2019 that was put in last Q [quarter].\u201d\n\nWirecard told the FT that Mr Marsalek does not own Matrimonial Global, and that he has had no involvement in the investigations.\n\nThe COO had worked closely with Mr Kurniawan for years. For instance, a few days before the end of 2015 a Wirecard subsidiary in Indonesia, Aprisma, needed income of \u20ac3.3m to hit its profit target for the year. The two men discussed options. The target was reached thanks to what was described as an \u201cadditional project from Jan\u201d, according to subsequent emails. The backdated sales agreement which resulted did not appear to be genuine, according to R&T\u2019s preliminary report.\n\nA year later Mr Kurniawan and Mr Marsalek had worked together to provide answers to questions from EY during a tough audit, according to documents seen by the FT.\n\nIn October 2015, Wirecard agreed to pay \u20ac325m for a collection of businesses in India, its biggest-ever takeover. The deal came after the FT published a series of articles highlighting apparent inconsistencies in Wirecard\u2019s accounting and what looked like a growing hole in its balance sheet. The India deal attracted the attention of sceptical analysts and investors, who reported difficulty finding the scale of operations the company claimed. Inside Wirecard, EY directed a team at the end of 2016 to take a close look, now that a full year of ownership had passed.\n\nIn April 2017 Mr Kurniawan told a colleague he could not sleep because of Hermes, Wirecard\u2019s main business in India. And the entity\u2019s CFO, appointed only months before, submitted a disclaimer to the Hermes board that he \u201cshould not be held in any way responsible\u201d for many of the documents relating to the 2016 audit, due to his recent arrival. EY eventually signed off on the revenues Wirecard reported.\n\nThe clean audit in early 2017 helped to reassure investors. Wirecard\u2019s share price proceeded to quadruple, amid global enthusiasm for fintech companies.\n\nYet some of the documentary evidence placed in front of R&T, and since seen by the FT, raises fresh questions about the scope of accounting irregularities and the authority extended to the young book-keeper in Singapore.\n\nIndeed, a central question remains. What did management in Munich know about Mr Kurniawan\u2019s activities, and what should it have known?\n\nA February 15 2018 email chain indicates that some in Germany were at least made aware of a version of the round-trip scheme Mr Kurniawan had sketched on the whiteboard weeks earlier. Documents show that Mr Holten, whose signature was needed to authorise payments from head office, wrote: \u201cI need to know the whole cash flow.\u201d\n\nMr Kurniawan replied 13 minutes later with a plan to move \u20ac2m into India, via Wirecard Hong Kong and an outside entity. \u201cHope it\u2019s clear?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cVery good, thx,\u201d Mr Holten replied. Copied into the email was Mr von Erffa, whose signature would also be required.\n\nWhen the FT broke news of the investigation last week, Mr Kurniawan was still head of international finance and his alleged accomplices were still employed. The company on Wednesday said certain individuals had been temporarily assigned to other roles, pending the outcome of the probe, and any disciplinary action would be determined by the evidence.\n\nWirecard also said there had been significant developments and substantial new information taken into account since R&T\u2019s preliminary report.\n\nA whistleblower, who initially approached the FT due to the apparent lack of action, this week said: \u201cIf a payments company can do this, how can you have trust in the system?\u201d"

If you are looking for practical tips and inspiration on ways to command an audience, whether that's in a meeting or on social media, then this is the event for you.\n\nViv Groskop, author of 'How to Own the Room', will talk to FT feature writer Emma Jacobs about her work, from a career in journalism to becoming a stand up comedian, author and executive performance coach. Along the way she has learned a lot - and overturned the stereotypes about women and public performance. Now she teaches others how to perform better - and this interactive event will include drinks, practical exercises and takeaways, and the chance to ask Viv about your own performance dilemmas.\n\nViv's books will be available for purchase on the night.\n\nRead content related to the FT Engage event by signing up to an FT trial - visit ft.com/engage for more details. *Terms & Conditions apply"

If you are looking for practical tips and inspiration on ways to command an audience, whether that's in a meeting or on social media, then this is the event for you.\n\nViv Groskop, author of 'How to Own the Room', will talk to FT feature writer Emma Jacobs about her work, from a career in journalism to becoming a stand up comedian, author and executive performance coach. Along the way she has learned a lot - and overturned the stereotypes about women and public performance. Now she teaches others how to perform better - and this interactive event will include drinks, practical exercises and takeaways, and the chance to ask Viv about your own performance dilemmas.\n\nViv's books will be available for purchase on the night.\n\nRead content related to the FT Engage event by signing up to an FT trial - visit ft.com/engage for more details. *Terms & Conditions apply"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "THIS EVENT IS NOW SOLD OUT.\n\nHave you ever wanted to have more of a 'voice' at work - and in your life? Does the thought of public speaking send you into a cold sweat? If you are looking for practical tips and inspiration on ways to command an audience, whether that's in a meeting or on social media, then this is the event for you.\n\nViv Groskop, author of 'How to Own the Room', will talk to FT feature writer Emma Jacobs about her work, from a career in journalism to becoming a stand up comedian, author and executive performance coach. Along the way she has learned a lot - and overturned the stereotypes about women and public performance. Now she teaches others how to perform better - and this interactive event will include drinks, practical exercises and takeaways, and the chance to ask Viv about your own performance dilemmas.\n\nViv's books will be available for purchase on the night.\n\nRead content related to the FT Engage event by signing up to an FT trial - visit ft.com/engage for more details. *Terms & Conditions apply"

    "text": "A decade ago, the US pharmaceuticals company Merck paid $41bn to acquire Schering-Plough, consolidating and cutting thousands of jobs amid an industry crisis of innovation and confidence. The companies touted their cholesterol and HIV treatments, briefly noting a \u201cpromising pipeline\u201d in oncology.\n\nHidden in that pipeline was Keytruda, an antibody that enables the body\u2019s immune system to attack cancers. It was an accidental acquisition, initially ignored by Merck and almost discarded but now its main blockbuster, with sales expected by JPMorgan to hit $16bn a year by the mid-2020s. It extends patients\u2019 lives longer than chemotherapy alone, albeit expensively.\n\nRapid innovation in oncology drugs such as Keytruda and genetic medicine has prompted another merger wave. Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to acquire Celgene for $90bn in January, GlaxoSmithKline agreed to buy the US biotech Tesaro for $5.1bn in December, and Eli Lilly said last month it was acquiring Loxo Oncology for $8bn.\n\nIt is an exciting time for an industry that for many years struggled to make research and development produce results. It is also a welcome shift away from the mass marketing of primary care pills towards medicines for the gravely ill. This week, Keytruda was found to improve the health of patients with kidney cancer and with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumour.\n\nBut it begs questions about the future of pharma companies. One is whether they are more innovative than before, despite this activity. The second is how long the buzz about cutting-edge oncology can convince insurers and healthcare systems to pay bills that are already high and may rise higher.\n\nKeytruda illustrates how the industry now works \u2014 it was discovered by a Dutch pharma company that Schering-Plough bought in 2007, rather than in one of either group\u2019s research laboratories. Merck\u2019s role, when it finally realised what it was sitting on (thanks to seeing Bristol-Myers nurturing a rival drug called Opdivo) was to put Keytruda through trials and develop it.\n\nKeytruda and Opdivo are enormously important drugs in the developing field of cancer immunotherapy. They are \u201ccheckpoint inhibitors\u201d that prevent the body blocking an immune response to cancer cells. Since Keytruda\u2019s first approval in the US in 2014, it has been used to treat an expanding range of cancers, sometimes alone but often combined with other drugs.\n\nThis success has pushed other pharma companies to acquire biotechs, or to form partnerships to develop similar drugs, and others that can be used with them. A lot of drug discovery is done in biotech start-ups \u2014 the consultancy McKinsey estimates that 69 per cent of the portfolios of high-growth pharma companies came from acquisitions or licensing in 2015.\n\nThat avoids the risk of working for years on a drug that fails, but it creates other challenges. A pharma group that in effect outsources early stage research can suffer from a brain drain \u2014 it may lack scientists who can assess properly which deals to strike with biotechs. It can also struggle to make the most of the drugs it acquires from others by widening their applications.\n\nThis way of running the industry inflates prices. Biotech drug discovery is a risky endeavour, so investors (and research scientists who leave safe jobs) want to be rewarded richly for success. The wave of oncology innovations encourages the fear of missing out among drugmakers \u2014 recent deals show how high a price they will pay to secure their future.\n\nIn the end, the patient pays. In November, Keytruda was approved for use in the UK\u2019s National Health Service. The list price for each three-weekly infusion is \u00a35,260, and the average cost for a course of treatment is \u00a384,000, although the NHS gets a discount. The official price for Kymriah, a personalised leukaemia drug from Novartis, is \u00a3282,000 per treatment.\n\nInnovative drugs are not only expensive to develop but difficult to spurn. An oncologist may have one chance to save a patient\u2019s life and will pick the medicine with the best shot. That curbs the pressure to cut prices, in contrast with pills with generic competition or, for example, a hepatitis C drug with a rival that might also be effective.\n\nIn some ways, the market is working \u2014 such is the ferment of innovation stimulated by these rewards that rivals for drugs such as Keytruda are popping up faster than before. If cancer were less complex, one could expect prices to start falling; US President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign against \u201cthe injustice of high drug prices\u201d paid by Medicare would produce results.\n\nBut we are decades away from anything like a \u201ccure for cancer\u201d and one medicine is rarely enough \u2014 many pharma groups are working on drugs for use in combination with Keytruda or Opdivo. Not only will this make splitting the rewards difficult but the overall price will rise rather than fall. It is hard to deny any patient an extra year of life but the bill will be fearsome.\n\nFor now, the industry is enjoying a burst of profitability and dealmaking, with high prices justified by life-saving innovation. It knows one thing from history: the halo will fade.\n\njohn.gapper@ft.com"

    "authors": [

    ],
    "text": "When 34-year-old street photographer Tommy Ton was approached about taking on the creative direction of the New York label Deveaux, which launched in 2016, he realised a childhood fantasy that had until then seemed unattainable. \u201cI dreamt of becoming a designer as a teenager growing up in Canada,\u201d he said before his debut show on the city\u2019s schedule. \u201cBut then I spent 10 years on a very different road.\u201d\n\nThat road, however (or at least the very many pavements of the global fashion cities on which Ton trained his lens), has given him a unique insight into how modern men and women dress. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a decade doing demographic research,\u201d he added. \u201cWell, I could call it that. Mostly I just love people watching.\u201d\n\nThe collection was inspired by those people who Ton has always admired at the shows \u2014 often those with an empathy for minimalism and an affection for androgyny and earthy neutrals. The casting took in men and women of many different decades, and the models (many of whom were more like muses) walked around each other as though out in the world. Sometimes they exchanged a piece of clothing \u2014 a women in a long silk slip was fitted with a tweed overcoat by a fella. They ended up walking in pairs. It was sweet \u2014 this was inclusivism at its most gentle and endearing.\n\nDeveaux\n\nDeveaux\n\nDeveaux\n\nCertainly the collection owed a nod to Phoebe Philo\u2019s old Celine inasmuch as it had the same sensibility: the emphasis on form and functionality, the priority on comfort, and in the generous but flattering silhouettes. Ton had taken pains with the details; trousers skimmed the ankle bones (instead of sweeping long along the floor) and were worn with classic loafers. Coats were made for throwing over layers. The tailoring was sharp but not restrictive; a cashmere sweater had an integrated shawl scarf that, when worn wrapped around the shoulders over a long silk skirt, looked easy and elegant for evening. The clothes were primarily day focused but, as Ton pointed out, an ivory tuxedo suit layered with a shawl-neck shirt would \u201cbe a great thing to wear to a wedding.\u201d\n\nDeveaux\n\nDeveaux\n\nDeveaux\n\nDeveaux\n\nDeveaux\n\nMatches Fashion have already picked up the menswear, and Bergdorf Goodman, Net-a-Porter and Moda Operandi have taken up the women\u2019s. I expect more stockists will follow. Ton may not be a designer in the classic tradition \u2014 he\u2019s a curator. His collection was not revolutionary. It was better than that. The clothes looked as comfortable as an embrace and were absolutely effortless. I would have happily worn the lot.\n\nLikewise at The Row, where, after a short abstention, the sisters Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen were showing again. Thank god! The Row show, with its essential hallmarks, such as the coffee for the guests, the mid-century furnishings, the ornamental geodes around the showspace, not to mention seeing the designers walking among us, in real life, like seeing a unicorn, is for me a seasonal highlight. The Row offers the ultimate lifestyle fantasy \u2014 an alternate universe in which everything is delightfully tasteful and eye-wateringly expensive. In fact, I\u2019ve often thought that the Olsens\u2019 dedication to the coffee bean is so diligent they should open a caf\u00e9 called The Rowsted. They could serve everything in giant compostable branded cups, and offer not a scrap of food.\n\nTheir AW19 collection was not much of a departure from their usual fluid take on luxurious androgyny: trouser suits with single-breasted jackets buttoned to the side, and simple white shirts with an oversized funnel neck or exaggerated cuffs. Robe coats in camel and a stiffer car coat shape in chocolate-coloured leather; 50 shades of brown. If there was a distinction, it was that the silhouette was neater, the line contoured at the waist. Previous seasons have seen some garments look slightly overwhelming: this collection had cinched it in, but without looking prissy or feminised. Perhaps this was The Row version of body con? Whatever, it worked brilliantly well. The looks were worn with the sheerest of lace espadrilles (marvellously creepy) or a thick-soled zipped boot. It was all typically desirable.\n\nFor modern luxury brands, this is the time to seize the market. It\u2019s been more than a year since Philo departed from Celine and left her acolytes grieving: the last few vestiges of her tenure are now leaving the store. Second-hand or consignments sites such as The RealReal and Vestiaire have noted a sharp increase in Celine resales as customers stockpile her clothes. The question remains: what will the Philophiles buy next? Certainly, these two labels, despite having distinct and admirable qualities of their own, must be serious contenders for her money.\n\nThe Row\n\nThe Row\n\nThe Row\n\nThe Row\n\nThe Row\n\nThe Row\n\nThe Row"

    "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nBrexit is an \u201cacid test\u201d of the future for global trade and \u201ccould go quite badly\u201d, the Bank of England governor has said in his strongest warning yet on the risks of the UK leaving the EU without a deal.\n\nSpeaking to an audience of senior City figures in London, Mark Carney said the threat to the global economy posed by trade conflicts was greater than a financial crisis or a turn in the business cycle.\n\n\u201cWe should not be under any illusions: no-deal Brexit would be a shock for this economy and send a signal globally about the prospects of refounding globalisation,\u201d he said at the event, hosted by the Financial Times.\n\nAsked whether Brexit was a canary in the coal mine for the new global order, Mr Carney replied: \u201cThe bird may be towards the bottom of the cage, but it is still fluttering.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s comments came as Theresa May told MPs \u201cwe have to hold our nerve\u201d. She said she was willing to take Brexit negotiations to the wire, in the hope of securing a revised deal that could win parliamentary approval.\n\nDowning Street refused to deny speculation that the prime minister could wait until a European Council meeting on March 21 to secure a final deal, with MPs then being confronted with a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d vote shortly before Brexit day on March 29.\n\nMrs May said she was prepared to change the legislative rule book if there was a last-minute deal, to short-circuit the normal 21 days of Commons debate needed to pass such a measure. She refused to rule out a no deal Brexit.\n\nOn Tuesday night a cross-party group of senior MPs, led by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, published a bill to give parliament the power to stop Mrs May taking Britain out of the EU without a deal: a crunch vote on the measure will take place on February 27.\n\nMeanwhile ITV news reported that Olly Robbins, chief Brexit negotiator, was overheard in a Brussels hotel bar saying he expected the choice for MPs to be either backing Mrs May\u2019s revised deal or extending talks with the EU. Downing St declined to comment on \u201calleged remarks in a private conversation\u201d.\n\nMr Carney has repeatedly flagged up the damage being caused to the economy by the parliamentary stand-off on Brexit. \u201cWith fundamental uncertainty about future market access, UK investment hasn\u2019t grown since the referendum was called and has dramatically underperformed both history and peers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe world risked going down the same route, Mr Carney added. \u201cA prolongation of global trade uncertainty could undermine the global expansion,\u201d he said. \u201cContrary to what you might have heard, it is not easy to win a trade war.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s bid to leave the EU was a \u201cleading indicator\u201d of the fundamental pressure to reorder globalisation, he added.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that new rules of the road will be developed for a more inclusive and resilient global economy,\u201d the governor said. \u201cAt the same time, there is a risk that countries turn inwards, undercutting growth and prosperity for all. Concerns over this possibility are already impairing investment, jobs and growth, creating a dynamic that could become self-fulfilling.\u201d\n\nBrexit was fundamentally about whether a compromise could be found between democratic accountability and economic co-operation, Mr Carney said, telling politicians that it was \u201cimperative\u201d to find an outcome that balanced sovereignty and openness.\n\nAs the UK enters its final weeks of EU membership, the BoE governor has begun to spell out more clearly the economic implications of leaving with no transition deal.\n\nMrs May tried to reassure business leaders on a tetchy conference call on Tuesday afternoon, insisting that the government was \u201cvery clear about the impact on business\u201d of a no-deal exit.\n\nBut she frustrated executives by rejecting their calls for a delay to Brexit rather than allow a no-deal exit; Mrs May said she would not delay Brexit if MPs refused to back a deal because it would \u201cjust continue the uncertainty\u201d.\n\nThe BoE put future rate rises on hold last week, citing the uncertainties around Brexit as well as the slowing global growth picture.\n\nThe \u201cfog of Brexit\u201d was creating tensions in the financial markets which the central bank needed to monitor, Mr Carney said last week, as the BoE downgraded its outlook for Britain\u2019s economy to its weakest level for a decade.\n\nThe BoE last week estimated a one in four chance of a recession in the first half of 2019 and that was without knowledge of the latest data, which were significantly worse than expected.\n\nBut that was before economic data published on Monday highlighted the dramatic impact that Brexit was having on the UK economy: output has slumped and growth in 2018 was at its lowest level since the financial crisis."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The city is wooing expats with its reputation for safety and mixture of bustle and quiet\n\nBy Simon Brandon\n\nTaiwan, also known as the Republic of China \u2014 not to be confused with the People\u2019s Republic of China 110 miles to the west \u2014 is an island straddling the Tropic of Cancer. Its capital, Taipei, home to one-third of the country\u2019s population, is a cultural, political and financial hub.\n\nOpen to expat talent\n\nTaiwan is, with Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea, one of the four \u201cAsian tiger\u201d economies (so called because of their industrialisation and fast growth over the past 50 years). Taipei is the centre of the country\u2019s flagship technology sector.\n\nThe country\u2019s labour market is stretched: Taiwan has one of the world\u2019s lowest birth rates, so the government is encouraging companies to recruit from overseas. In October 2017, a law was passed with the aim of attracting more skilled foreign professionals. Among other incentives, expats earning more than NT$3m ($99,000) a year can apply to be taxed on only half their salary for the first three years.\n\nTaipei\u2019s Xinyi financial and commercial district\n\nOases of calm\n\nTaipei is famous for its many temples. Longshan, built in the 18th century, is one of the oldest and largest.\n\nThe 18th-century Longshan temple\n\nEscaping the city\u2019s bustle is easy, too. Taipei is bordered to the north by Yangmingshan National Park, where visitors can hike over dormant volcanoes and relax in hot springs.\n\nA mountain path in Yangmingshan National Park\n\nThere are pristine beaches for those who prefer to unwind a little closer to sea level. Fulong Beach, known for its golden sands, is an hour\u2019s drive east of Taipei, while the scuba diving off the south coast of Taiwan is some of the best in the South China Sea.\n\nQuality of life\n\nTaipei is the world\u2019s best city for expats, according to online expat community InterNations\u2019 Quality of Urban Living Index. It has also been ranked by cost-of-living database Numbeo as one of the world\u2019s safest metropolises, and is clean \u2014 so clean, in fact, that chewing gum on the city\u2019s Metro is punishable by a fine. More than eight in 10 respondents to InterNations\u2019 survey said the capital\u2019s public transport system was \u201cvery good\u201d.\n\nThe Taipei Metro is renowned for its cleanliness\n\nContrasting neighbourhood vibes\n\nThe cost of living in Taipei is low compared with some world cities: rent, for example, costs around half that in London. The city\u2019s Songshan district \u2014 home to the Wufenpu Wholesale Garment Market, a magnet for fashion bargain-hunters \u2014 is one of the city\u2019s more relaxed areas to live.\n\nThose who prefer bustle and nightlife might be more at home in the smart, up-tempo district of Xinyi \u2014 known for its bars, including the Landmark Craft Beer Taproom.\n\nThe Wufenpu garment market\n\nStreet food specialities\n\nTaiwanese food is an alchemy of Chinese and Japanese cuisines. In 2015, viewers of US news channel CNN voted Taiwan the world\u2019s top foodie destination. In Taipei, street food is the star and the city\u2019s night markets \u2014 Shilin is the most famous \u2014 are the best places to try specialities such as gua bao, a steamed pork belly bun.\n\nAlternatively, do as locals do and follow your nose: a local delicacy and acquired taste called stinky tofu announces itself from a good distance.\n\n\u2018Gua bao\u2019, a steamed pork belly bun and a street-food favourite\n\nPhotographs: Dreamstime; Getty Images/iStockphoto; Marek Slusarczyk"

    "text": "FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Free Lunch every day by email\n\nOn the banks of the picture-perfect Swiss mountain lake of Zugersee, the sedate town of Zug sports several well-tended aviaries. It is inhabited by scarlet ibises, golden pheasants, snowy owls and other non-native birds. They are a good symbol of another exotic species that have found a home in Zug: some of the world\u2019s richest and most notorious financiers \u2014 such as the late Marc Rich, the commodity trader and fugitive from US justice \u2014 have long been attracted by the canton\u2019s offer of a comfortable living, discretion and a light tax regime.\n\nMuch like tropical birds have got used to the Swiss winter weather, the resident rich have successfully acclimatised to one feature of Zug\u2019s tax system that on the face of it looks hostile. Zug\u2019s taxman may charge a very low rate of income tax, but it \u2014 like its fellow Swiss cantons \u2014 also confiscates a fixed portion of its residents\u2019 net wealth every year.\n\nI have long thought it is counterintuitive that Switzerland, best known abroad for welcoming the world\u2019s wealth and its owners, is one of few countries charging a regular tax on residents\u2019 net wealth in all forms. So last week, I went there to investigate more closely.\n\nIt is admittedly a very small portion that is confiscated: with a top marginal rate of 0.3 per cent, each additional SFr1m ($997,000) the richest Zug residents put in the bank incurs an annual tax bill of SFr3,000. But the tax starts at a low threshold and it has to be paid year in, year out. The revenue is significant. Heinz T\u00e4nnler, Zug\u2019s business-embracing finance minister, told me the wealth tax accounted for about one-fifth of Zug\u2019s tax revenue from personal taxation. And it is higher in other cantons; in Geneva, a 1 per cent top marginal rate means every additional million owned will set its wealthiest residents back SFr10,000 per year.\n\nSwitzerland is such a useful case study of the wealth tax because it achieves in practice something that in the abstract would seem impossible. Simple theoretical arguments about taxation and incentives suggest that a tax on net wealth should have at least four negative effects. The first is that it discourages the accumulation of wealth. The second is that it scares away the wealthy. The third is that, as a result, it encourages tax jurisdictions to undercut one another to attract wealthy taxpayers, which results in a race to the bottom. Try to have a wealth tax, in other words, and you will soon be forced to bring it down to almost zero. And the fourth is that a net wealth tax puts obstacles in the way of entrepreneurs and other taxpayers who may have high net worth but little income or cash flow \u2014 and who may find themselves forced to liquidate assets to pay the tax.\n\nThe fact that Switzerland, which on the face of it suffers from none of these problems, can sustain a net wealth tax suggests all four worries are exaggerated. That is the conclusion I take back from Switzerland when comparing it with other countries.\n\nTake wealth accumulation first. The incentive for accumulating wealth obviously depends on the threshold at which the wealth tax starts to bite. Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposed US wealth tax would only start at $50m \u2014 that is, only once a lot of wealth has already been accumulated. One could, however, expect a serious disincentive for saving if the tax started at low thresholds \u2014 as it does in Switzerland. In the canton of Zug the wealth tax is payable on net wealth above just SFr102,000 for single taxpayers. But in practice, there is no sign of damage on this score: Switzerland consistently records one of the highest savings rates of all rich countries.\n\nIn fact, if Zug is anything to go by, the second worry is misplaced too, at least for countries that have other attractions. The wealth tax is obviously not stopping some of the world\u2019s richest people from choosing Switzerland as their home. This could of course be different with net wealth tax rates much higher than Zug\u2019s, such as the 2 to 3 per cent rate proposed by Warren. But she has a convincing solution to this potential problem: the tax would be linked to US citizenship (and presumably US permanent residence, which remains highly coveted around the world) and a 40 per cent \u201cexit tax\u201d on net wealth would be due on relinquishing it.\n\nAgainst these impressions, however, one academic study finds a fairly large sensitivity in reported wealth to changes in the wealth tax in Switzerland. The researchers\u2019 key estimate is that a 1 percentage point increase in the tax rate reduces reported wealth by 23 per cent \u2014 very large, but note that even with such a drastic response, you could push rates up to at least 3 per cent and continue to increase tax revenues.\n\nThere are, however, reasons to think the real sensitivity is smaller. Even this study finds that the effect is not due to people moving between cantons; only to changes within cantons over time. If it is not that the wealthy are chased away, the question is how fast wealth stocks can be changed in response to tax reforms. The 23 per cent response to a 1-percentage-point tax hike was calculated from much smaller actual variations. You cannot easily consume 23 per cent of a large fortune, as doing so would usually just involve buying alternative valuable (hence taxable) assets. Meanwhile, studies in Sweden and Denmark (which both had net wealth taxes until recently) show a much smaller response \u2014 less than a 1 per cent reduction in reported wealth \u2014 to a 1 percentage point higher tax rate. Third, the Swedish study shows that this is almost entirely down to avoidance \u2014 under-reporting wealth \u2014 rather than changes in savings behaviour. This, in other words, is an effect that a state determined to enforce honest reporting can minimise.\n\nAll this, however, leaves intact the puzzle of why there is no race to the bottom between Swiss cantons, as well as the challenge of dealing with illiquid wealth. In the next Free Lunch I report what I learnt from my trip about these questions.\n\nOther readables\n\nTalk about the mirage of making America great again. US president Donald Trump has railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement and marginally renegotiated it, but who would benefit or lose from dismantling Nafta?\n\nEconomists Raphael Auer, Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Bonadio and Andrei Levchenko look at the location-specific impact of shifting Nafta-covered trade to baseline most favoured nation terms, given differences in local industry structure.\n\nThey conclude: \u201cThough dismantling or renegotiating Nafta was a prominent pillar of the Trump presidential campaign, Trump-voting districts would experience systematically greater wage decreases if Nafta disappeared.\u201d The reason is an almost perfect correlation between import and export exposure to Nafta countries: \u201cPlaces that suffer the most from Nafta import competition are also overwhelmingly those that export to Nafta.\u201d"

    "title": "Fendi exclusive: the return of the original \u201cIt\u201d bag",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "What is the recipe for an \u201cIt\u201d bag? It should be an easy question for the woman who, in 1997, cooked up the Baguette. Despite this, Silvia Venturini Fendi still laughs when asked about the magic ingredients in a bag that has been sold more than a million times and made in over 1,000 iterations. \u201cOh my God, I have no idea! If I knew that I could make one every year.\u201d\n\nFor all her protestations, as the brand\u2019s creative director of accessories for more than two decades \u2013 she went on to create the Peekaboo in 2008 and then charmed a new generation with quirky, customisable Bag Bugs \u2013 Venturini Fendi knows more than most about what makes a bag take hold. \u201cThese things come when it\u2019s the right bag at the right time,\u201d she says, perching on a gold velvet sofa in the Palazzo Fendi in Rome. \u201cThe idea for the Baguette came in an organic way. It was when everything was so functional and this was a bag with a personality.\u201d\n\nThis spring the Baguette is back. Did it ever really go away? The slender, unstructured, logo-clasped design, widely acknowledged to have put the \u201cIt\u201d in what was previously just called a \u201chit\u201d, has remained firmly in the style consciousness. But this feels like an apt moment for a full-on relaunch: fashion is in the grip of a highly styled, archly idiosyncratic phase and the character-driven Baguette will fit right in. Fendi is not alone in reprising its greatest hits; Versace, Prada and Dior are all reissuing iconic pieces that appeal to older fans and new ones too. \u201cWe like change, but there\u2019s also a bit of nostalgia,\u201d says Venturini Fendi. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see things come back, but in a different way.\u201d\n\nThe Baguette has certainly moved with the times. For a start, it now comes in multiple sizes and with detachable straps so that it can be worn as a cross-body bag, as well as over the shoulder. There are plush, monogrammed, butter-soft leather varieties in delicious colours such as lemon, purple, turquoise (embossed leather Baguette, \u00a32,190) and bubblegum pink; others (denim Baguette, \u00a31,690) come in denim with colourful stitched edges \u2013 and then there are the embroidered and embellished versions (embroidered jacquard and Swarovski crystal Baguette, \u00a34,590, embroidered jacquard Baguette, \u00a32,190, and embroidered jacquard Baguette, \u00a34,590) with bejewelled clasps, elaborate beading and colourful tassels that recall the rich decoration of their forerunners. There are are also techniques on show \u2013 such as beautiful matelass\u00e9 leather (for the aforementioned monogrammed designs) with a quilted appearance \u2013 that would not have been possible 20 years ago. Although, as the designer is quick to point out, the Baguette has always been experimental.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she started on the original design in 1996, the fashion landscape was much less colourful: still in the grip of 1990s minimalism, Prada\u2019s black nylon backpack ruled. Venturini Fendi had taken over as head of accessories just a couple of years before and although she was charged with designing a practical bag, she also noted how mobile phones were already becoming more compact. \u201cI thought about a small bag to wear with a short strap in an ergonomic way so that you can still use your hands.\u201d\n\nBut the bag\u2019s inspiration had deeper roots. \u201cMy grandmother had a collection of beautiful beaded bags from the 1920s and \u201930s \u2013 I always had them in my mind,\u201d the designer recalls. Growing up, she was always drawn to the room of evening bags in the family\u2019s Rome store: \u201cInstead of playing with dolls I used to come to the atelier; there was a grey velvet room that had little vitrines with all the evening bags in them \u2013 in satin, in crocodile, and then the most beautiful decoration\u2026 flowers, exotic designs. I played with them for hours.\u201d\n\nWhen she came up with her first designs for the Baguette, however, the in-house reaction was muted. Small and simple, it was practical in that it could be tucked under the arm \u2013 hence it was named after the French loaf, carried the same way \u2013 but compared to that Prada backpack, it seemed a frippery. Yet its creator was confident. The Baguette was soft and unstructured in the same way that Fendi furs were famed for their lightness. And crucially, the bags, in denim, cashmere, leather or fur, were also the perfect blank canvas for surface decoration. They could be adorned with kaleidoscopic hand embroideries and beading, intricate stones and extravagant appliqu\u00e9s, just like the vintage bags that had inspired her\u2026 except these were for daytime too.\n\nThere followed one-of-a-kind pieces made with artists such as Damien Hirst, Francesco Vezzoli and Jeff Koons, and ultra-precious Baguettes in silk brocades and velvets made with the Fondazione Arte della Seta Lisio, where the exquisite fabrics were created by hand on 17th\u2011century looms. \u201cThey can make just 4cm of the material each day \u2013 can you imagine?\u201d the designer exclaims.\n\nThe rarefied materials and decoration were a production nightmare. Mirrors, beading, silk thread, crystals, silk satin all came from different suppliers and, combined with the small teams of artisans at Fendi, led to growing waiting lists. It was, she says, the ultimate anti\u2011mass-production bag. Far from putting customers off, it had the opposite effect: \u201cWe thought, \u2018As long as we love it, we will do it\u2019 \u2013 and people were with us on this. They would wait months to have it.\u201d\n\nWithin a year of launching, the bag became a fashion phenomenon and fundamentally changed the handbag scene. It was, the designer points out, the first bag that had its own name. Before it, memorable bags like the Herm\u00e8s Kelly or Birkin took on the name of the elegant women who carried them, but the Baguette would kick off an era of bags that had the starring role \u2013 their own personality: Chlo\u00e9\u2019s Paddington and Mulberry\u2019s Bayswater followed in its wake and would be huge commercial hits for those brands.\n\nVenturini Fendi says the Baguette\u2019s success really hit home for her when the boutique called the studio to let her know that Madonna had arrived in the Rome store to buy some. But classicists were equally enamoured, with a broad church of admirers from Charlotte Casiraghi to Catherine Zeta-Jones. Joan Burstein, the eternally chic co-founder of Browns, is such a fan that she built a collection she has described as being \u201csoft, practical and always in style\u201d. Her favourite Baguette, in simple grey cashmere, is a perfect example of how they can be understated too. Many of Burstein\u2019s Baguettes were stolen in a burglary \u2013 a plot twist that echoes the Sex and the City storyline that made the Baguette a pop-culture sensation.\n\nFendi was the first luxury house to take a chance and lend pieces to stylist Patricia Field for the first season of the show in 1998, and she repaid their faith in her by making the bag one of its stars. In one episode, Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s Carrie Bradshaw was mugged for her treasured purple accessory (another two episodes would have storylines on the bag). When the mugger told her to give him \u201cthe bag\u201d, she set him right, squeaking back: \u201cIt\u2019s a Baguette!\u201d\n\nFor the Fendis, who had long collaborated with directors including Visconti, Fellini and Zeffirelli, taking a chance on a new television series was a calculated risk \u2013 and they liked the plot based around a group of women who were crazy about fashion. \u201cIt was very similar to us,\u201d Venturini Fendi reflects. \u201cWe are a company of women and we thought it was a very good story. What we didn\u2019t expect was the success.\u201d\n\nThe bag\u2019s popularity fundamentally changed the business too. In 1999, following the Baguette\u2019s stellar performance, LVMH bought a quarter of the house, before paying $225m to double its stake and take control of the brand two years later, when annual sales were around \u20ac289m. By 2017, annual sales were estimated to be around \u20ac1.2bn with double-digit growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Rachel Koffsky, handbag and accessories specialist at Christie\u2019s London, the longevity of the Baguette is all about the versatility of Venturini Fendi\u2019s original design: \u201cShe created a prototype for a handbag that could be modified in seemingly infinite ways. No embellishment was too fantastical; creativity reigned supreme. The It bag life cycle is generally about two years, but the Baguette has outlasted this lifespan 10 times by constantly evolving to suit the trends of the season or the style of a client. If you haven\u2019t seen a Baguette perfect for you yet, you probably just haven\u2019t seen enough.\u201d\n\nPredictably, the Baguette has also become a collector\u2019s item, fetching high prices at auction. Koffsky\u2019s favourite past lots at Christie\u2019s include one in monogrammed silk that belonged to Elizabeth Taylor, and a canary-yellow calfskin Baguette with multicoloured beaded flowers and fringing. The most avid collector Venturini Fendi has met had over 500 of them.\n\nArguably, though, it is craft that has made the Baguette into a museum-worthy handbag. At Fendi, these age-old skills have always been at the heart of the operation. \u201cBefore, there was a separation between artisan and designer. But for me to work directly with artisans is so inspiring, because they have ideas, which helps us do new things,\u201d Venturini Fendi enthuses.\n\nThe night before we meet, the company has thrown a party for some of its longest-serving employees, but it\u2019s the young artisans rising up that will also ensure its future. To that end, the company has specialist schools (the bag school is based in Florence), where students come at 18 or in their early 20s after a university degree and the best then go on to work for the company. For Venturini Fendi this nurturing of talent is fundamental in terms of future-proofing the company \u2013 that, and never resting on her laurels. \u201cYou should never say, \u2018Oh, look what I\u2019ve achieved\u2019. The moment you think you\u2019ve arrived is the moment you can go home.\u201d\n\n441"

    "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nInvestors\u2019 waning expectations of future rises in interest rates are giving a lift to the UK government bond market.\n\nGilt yields dipped \u2013 meaning prices rose \u2013 after the Bank of England last week pulled back on its rate-rise plans, echoing more dovish noises from the US Federal Reserve. The BoE downgraded its economic outlook to its lowest level since the financial crisis a decade ago amid mounting uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.\n\nThis week\u2019s House of Commons debate on Brexit is unlikely to resolve the question of what form the UK\u2019s departure from the bloc will take, with a vote having been pushed back to later this month. But it should shine a spotlight on the nation\u2019s fractured political scene, fuelling investors\u2019 jitters.\n\nLast week BoE governor Mark Carney warned that the risk of a no-deal exit was rising.\n\nMr Carney has in the past said that such a scenario could result in interest-rate increases \u2013 a move that should push up yields. But the downward move in gilt yields suggests that investors remain convinced a fresh bout of bond-buying stimulus is more likely than a rate increase.\n\nAs the prospect of rate rises fades, the additional yield that gilts offer over other major bond markets has helped to lure overseas investors back into the market.\n\nNearly four-fifths of the gilts in circulation are held by UK investors and the market has become increasingly reliant on domestic support. Last year foreign investors\u2019 net purchasing of gilts hit its lowest level for more than three years.\n\nThat trend has now begun to reverse. In the 12 months to end-2018 overseas buyers increased their holdings of UK government bonds by a net \u00a322bn, up from just \u00a33.6bn in the 12 months to mid-2018.\n\nTen-year gilts offer a 1.06 percentage point yield premium to the equivalent German Bund, and a 1.24ppt premium to Japanese government bonds, which recently slipped back into negative territory.\n\nOf the world\u2019s major sovereign bond markets, only the US is priced well above gilts, making the spread unattractive for US-based investors. The 10-year US Treasury bond yields 1.46 percentage points more than the equivalent gilt."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Seersucker\u2019s journey from subcontinental performance fabric to premium menswear staple continues apace. Two years ago I reported on the cool renaissance of seersucker, but now new designs and uses are leading the material in interesting directions.\n\nFor example, seersucker now brings an appealing crisp, matte texture to tailoring. Take the seersucker dinner suits at P Johnson. A tux (from \u00a31,350 made-to-measure) in a striped navy/black silk/cotton from Biella, in Piedmont, is soft but still looks sharp enough for dressier occasions. \u201cThe silk/cotton blend is a bit slinkier. It can be 35 degrees and humid, but quality seersucker rises to the occasion,\u201d says Johnson. And at Corneliani a new slate-grey wool/silk seersucker makes for an urbane day suit (\u00a31,206). \u201cSeersucker is always fresh and light, but this fabric gives extra movement and a rich feel,\u201d says style director Stefano Gaudioso. At Drake\u2019s, an olive Solbiati seersucker suit (\u00a31,195) with high-rise trousers makes a bold statement. And at Thom Sweeney, Loro Piana \u201cdice check\u201d seersucker jackets (\u00a31,180) feel fresh in either a smart navy and blue/black or summery white and navy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis chic tailoring harks back to a key motif of early 1980s Giorgio Armani, and this season the brand presents crisply refined versions of the look. A new, wider, jacquard seersucker has taut threads alternating with slacker ones to give the fabric an undulating finish. I am coveting the double-breasted \u201cheritage\u201d suit (jacket, \u00a31,650, trousers, \u00a3630), and the longer-length chalky-white and house-griege suit jackets with low fastenings are killer cool. For a slightly different smart summer accent, look to the Mandarin-collar jacket (\u00a31,150) in rich beige seersucker.\n\nA more casual, sporty style comes in Armani\u2019s asymmetrical zip-up top (\u00a33,350) in seersucker grosgrain jacquard, with matching wide trousers (\u00a3720). These new grosgrain seersuckers have a knockabout, workwear feel, while still evoking luxe elegance. They are also informing a wave of smocky overshirts, many with matching bottoms, such as Lou Dalton\u2019s gingham utility jacket (\u00a3480); P Johnson\u2019s laidback suit in a sporty Japanese-cotton seersucker, pairing a workwear jacket (from \u00a3360) and drawstring trousers (from \u00a3210); or The Gigi\u2019s cool blue/grey stripe jacket (\u00a3210) and trousers (\u00a3210). The Gigi\u2019s more tailored Art jacket (\u00a3580) is also stylish \u2013 a lightweight, soft, black and white Vichy seersucker that\u2019s washed with pigments to create a colour mix with a vintage feel.\n\nElsewhere, new stretch seersuckers are being used to update bomber/blousons designs. Paul Smith\u2019s natty bombers (\u00a3325) and matching trousers (\u00a3325) in navy/white/yellow check, or silver/sky-blue check, use a fabric commissioned from the Faliero Sarti mill in Italy. Lou Dalton reinterprets her classic Boston bomber (\u00a3470) in a cotton/polyester gingham seersucker (\u201cIt\u2019s even more hard-wearing and easy to wear,\u201d says Dalton). And Pal Zileri\u2019s smart blouson (\u00a31,190) now comes in a luxe-performance, water\u2011repellent seersucker.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s a rugged seersucker story to be told. Take Nanamica\u2019s Wind pullover anorak (\u00a3175) that uses stretchy threads for weft and cotton for warp for a supple texture and relatively shiny finish. Or Woolrich\u2019s new Outdoor line, which interprets seersucker in an all-American, great-outdoors style using a two-way-stretch-polyester double weave. The collection runs from trucker-style hats (\u00a350) and shoulder bags (\u00a345) to a quick-drying mesh seersucker Sleeping shirt (\u00a3140).\n\n441"

    "title": "Fendi exclusive: the return of the original \u201cIt\u201d bag",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "What is the recipe for an \u201cIt\u201d bag? It should be an easy question for the woman who, in 1997, cooked up the Baguette. Despite this, Silvia Venturini Fendi still laughs when asked about the magic ingredients in a bag that has been sold more than a million times and made in over 1,000 iterations. \u201cOh my God, I have no idea! If I knew that I could make one every year.\u201d\n\nFor all her protestations, as the brand\u2019s creative director of accessories for more than two decades \u2013 she went on to create the Peekaboo in 2008 and then charmed a new generation with quirky, customisable Bag Bugs \u2013 Venturini Fendi knows more than most about what makes a bag take hold. \u201cThese things come when it\u2019s the right bag at the right time,\u201d she says, perching on a gold velvet sofa in the Palazzo Fendi in Rome. \u201cThe idea for the Baguette came in an organic way. It was when everything was so functional and this was a bag with a personality.\u201d\n\nThis spring the Baguette is back. Did it ever really go away? The slender, unstructured, logo-clasped design, widely acknowledged to have put the \u201cIt\u201d in what was previously just called a \u201chit\u201d, has remained firmly in the style consciousness. But this feels like an apt moment for a full-on relaunch: fashion is in the grip of a highly styled, archly idiosyncratic phase and the character-driven Baguette will fit right in. Fendi is not alone in reprising its greatest hits; Versace, Prada and Dior are all reissuing iconic pieces that appeal to older fans and new ones too. \u201cWe like change, but there\u2019s also a bit of nostalgia,\u201d says Venturini Fendi. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see things come back, but in a different way.\u201d\n\nThe Baguette has certainly moved with the times. For a start, it now comes in multiple sizes and with detachable straps so that it can be worn as a cross-body bag, as well as over the shoulder. There are plush, monogrammed, butter-soft leather varieties in delicious colours such as lemon, purple, turquoise (embossed leather Baguette, \u00a32,190) and bubblegum pink; others (denim Baguette, \u00a31,690) come in denim with colourful stitched edges \u2013 and then there are the embroidered and embellished versions (embroidered jacquard and Swarovski crystal Baguette, \u00a34,590, embroidered jacquard Baguette, \u00a32,190, and embroidered jacquard Baguette, \u00a34,590) with bejewelled clasps, elaborate beading and colourful tassels that recall the rich decoration of their forerunners. There are are also techniques on show \u2013 such as beautiful matelass\u00e9 leather (for the aforementioned monogrammed designs) with a quilted appearance \u2013 that would not have been possible 20 years ago. Although, as the designer is quick to point out, the Baguette has always been experimental.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she started on the original design in 1996, the fashion landscape was much less colourful: still in the grip of 1990s minimalism, Prada\u2019s black nylon backpack ruled. Venturini Fendi had taken over as head of accessories just a couple of years before and although she was charged with designing a practical bag, she also noted how mobile phones were already becoming more compact. \u201cI thought about a small bag to wear with a short strap in an ergonomic way so that you can still use your hands.\u201d\n\nBut the bag\u2019s inspiration had deeper roots. \u201cMy grandmother had a collection of beautiful beaded bags from the 1920s and \u201930s \u2013 I always had them in my mind,\u201d the designer recalls. Growing up, she was always drawn to the room of evening bags in the family\u2019s Rome store: \u201cInstead of playing with dolls I used to come to the atelier; there was a grey velvet room that had little vitrines with all the evening bags in them \u2013 in satin, in crocodile, and then the most beautiful decoration\u2026 flowers, exotic designs. I played with them for hours.\u201d\n\nWhen she came up with her first designs for the Baguette, however, the in-house reaction was muted. Small and simple, it was practical in that it could be tucked under the arm \u2013 hence it was named after the French loaf, carried the same way \u2013 but compared to that Prada backpack, it seemed a frippery. Yet its creator was confident. The Baguette was soft and unstructured in the same way that Fendi furs were famed for their lightness. And crucially, the bags, in denim, cashmere, leather or fur, were also the perfect blank canvas for surface decoration. They could be adorned with kaleidoscopic hand embroideries and beading, intricate stones and extravagant appliqu\u00e9s, just like the vintage bags that had inspired her\u2026 except these were for daytime too.\n\nThere followed one-of-a-kind pieces made with artists such as Damien Hirst, Francesco Vezzoli and Jeff Koons, and ultra-precious Baguettes in silk brocades and velvets made with the Fondazione Arte della Seta Lisio, where the exquisite fabrics were created by hand on 17th\u2011century looms. \u201cThey can make just 4cm of the material each day \u2013 can you imagine?\u201d the designer exclaims.\n\nThe rarefied materials and decoration were a production nightmare. Mirrors, beading, silk thread, crystals, silk satin all came from different suppliers and, combined with the small teams of artisans at Fendi, led to growing waiting lists. It was, she says, the ultimate anti\u2011mass-production bag. Far from putting customers off, it had the opposite effect: \u201cWe thought, \u2018As long as we love it, we will do it\u2019 \u2013 and people were with us on this. They would wait months to have it.\u201d\n\nWithin a year of launching, the bag became a fashion phenomenon and fundamentally changed the handbag scene. It was, the designer points out, the first bag that had its own name. Before it, memorable bags like the Herm\u00e8s Kelly or Birkin took on the name of the elegant women who carried them, but the Baguette would kick off an era of bags that had the starring role \u2013 their own personality: Chlo\u00e9\u2019s Paddington and Mulberry\u2019s Bayswater followed in its wake and would be huge commercial hits for those brands.\n\nVenturini Fendi says the Baguette\u2019s success really hit home for her when the boutique called the studio to let her know that Madonna had arrived in the Rome store to buy some. But classicists were equally enamoured, with a broad church of admirers from Charlotte Casiraghi to Catherine Zeta-Jones. Joan Burstein, the eternally chic co-founder of Browns, is such a fan that she built a collection she has described as being \u201csoft, practical and always in style\u201d. Her favourite Baguette, in simple grey cashmere, is a perfect example of how they can be understated too. Many of Burstein\u2019s Baguettes were stolen in a burglary \u2013 a plot twist that echoes the Sex and the City storyline that made the Baguette a pop-culture sensation.\n\nFendi was the first luxury house to take a chance and lend pieces to stylist Patricia Field for the first season of the show in 1998, and she repaid their faith in her by making the bag one of its stars. In one episode, Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s Carrie Bradshaw was mugged for her treasured purple accessory (another two episodes would have storylines on the bag). When the mugger told her to give him \u201cthe bag\u201d, she set him right, squeaking back: \u201cIt\u2019s a Baguette!\u201d\n\nFor the Fendis, who had long collaborated with directors including Visconti, Fellini and Zeffirelli, taking a chance on a new television series was a calculated risk \u2013 and they liked the plot based around a group of women who were crazy about fashion. \u201cIt was very similar to us,\u201d Venturini Fendi reflects. \u201cWe are a company of women and we thought it was a very good story. What we didn\u2019t expect was the success.\u201d\n\nThe bag\u2019s popularity fundamentally changed the business too. In 1999, following the Baguette\u2019s stellar performance, LVMH bought a quarter of the house, before paying $225m to double its stake and take control of the brand two years later, when annual sales were around \u20ac289m. By 2017, annual sales were estimated to be around \u20ac1.2bn with double-digit growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Rachel Koffsky, handbag and accessories specialist at Christie\u2019s London, the longevity of the Baguette is all about the versatility of Venturini Fendi\u2019s original design: \u201cShe created a prototype for a handbag that could be modified in seemingly infinite ways. No embellishment was too fantastical; creativity reigned supreme. The It bag life cycle is generally about two years, but the Baguette has outlasted this lifespan 10 times by constantly evolving to suit the trends of the season or the style of a client. If you haven\u2019t seen a Baguette perfect for you yet, you probably just haven\u2019t seen enough.\u201d\n\nPredictably, the Baguette has also become a collector\u2019s item, fetching high prices at auction. Koffsky\u2019s favourite past lots at Christie\u2019s include one in monogrammed silk that belonged to Elizabeth Taylor, and a canary-yellow calfskin Baguette with multicoloured beaded flowers and fringing. The most avid collector Venturini Fendi has met had over 500 of them.\n\nArguably, though, it is craft that has made the Baguette into a museum-worthy handbag. At Fendi, these age-old skills have always been at the heart of the operation. \u201cBefore, there was a separation between artisan and designer. But for me to work directly with artisans is so inspiring, because they have ideas, which helps us do new things,\u201d Venturini Fendi enthuses.\n\nThe night before we meet, the company has thrown a party for some of its longest-serving employees, but it\u2019s the young artisans rising up that will also ensure its future. To that end, the company has specialist schools (the bag school is based in Florence), where students come at 18 or in their early 20s after a university degree and the best then go on to work for the company. For Venturini Fendi this nurturing of talent is fundamental in terms of future-proofing the company \u2013 that, and never resting on her laurels. \u201cYou should never say, \u2018Oh, look what I\u2019ve achieved\u2019. The moment you think you\u2019ve arrived is the moment you can go home.\u201d\n\n441"

      "Life"
    ],
    "text": "\u201cNobody ever forgets their first time,\u201d the captain said to me with a smile.\n\nIt was late 2007 and I was in the cockpit of a Hong Kong-bound Boeing 747, carefully taxiing what may well be our species\u2019 greatest winged creation on to the northern runway of Heathrow airport. I\u2019d completed months of classroom and simulator training and now, under the watchful eye of the training captain sitting next to me, I was just moments away from my first take-off.\n\nThe captain was right. Of the thousands of flights in my career as a pilot, it\u2019s that first journey at the controls of a 747 that I remember best. Now it\u2019s just over a decade later and I\u2019m taxiing a 747 towards the same Heathrow runway with an entirely different set of emotions, because I\u2019m about to perform my very last take-off on the jet that\u2019s affectionately known to pilots as \u201cQOTS\u201d (that\u2019s \u201cQueen of the Skies\u201d). Tonight, we\u2019re bound for Cape Town.\n\nMuch has changed in the decade between my first and last 747 flights. Heathrow\u2019s lighting has been updated, and so this venerable old runway now looks more like something out of Tron than anything the writer and aviation pioneer Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry might have recognised. Inside the aircraft, the 747\u2019s left and right brains, otherwise known as the two flight management computers, have been entirely upgraded. On the personal side, I\u2019ve got married, written a couple of books about flying, and had a chance to fly to pretty much every major city in the world \u2014 including one trip to Sydney, 17 to Vancouver, and 41 to Los Angeles.\n\nOne thing that hasn\u2019t changed over the past 10 years, though, is the unique exhilaration of take-off on a 747. As the tower controller gives us our official take-off clearance, I think back to what the training captain said to me at this same position, on this same runway, just seconds before my first take-off back in 2007: \u201cHere we go. Enjoy it.\u201d\n\nI will. The thrust levers advance to their take-off setting and 370 tonnes of aviation legend slowly start to move. Soon after, we\u2019re rolling across the Earth\u2019s surface at roughly the speed of a bullet train. The captain calls \u201crotate\u201d and I pull the control column backward. The 747\u2019s tail drops, its utterly iconic nose lifts, and we rise surely and steadily into the night. We raise the landing gear and bank left towards the lights of Southampton, the city from which generations of Cape-bound Union-Castle ocean liners once set sail.\n\nWhile the 747 has been in the news recently \u2014 as when Delta and United, the last two US-based operators of passenger 747s, bid farewell to their last jumbo jets \u2014 reports of its demise are at least a little exaggerated. Airlines such as KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways (my employer) still fly 747s. Not long ago the cargo carrier UPS confirmed a sizeable order for new 747s, reassuring the jet\u2019s many fans that the QOTS will remain in production into the 2020s.\n\nOf the thousands of flights in my career, it\u2019s that first journey at the controls of a 747 that I remember best\n\nNevertheless, as more modern airliners supplement or replace the 747, many pilots who have perhaps dreamt of flying one since childhood must say goodbye to it (as a young girl, one of my colleagues didn\u2019t want to be an airline pilot; she wanted only to be a 747 pilot). I\u2019ve made the decision to retrain on the Boeing 787, a new-generation aircraft that\u2019s proved to be popular among crew and passengers alike (a more natural cabin air environment is one advantage; another is that while no jet may ever look as lovely as the 747, the 787, with its sleek nose and pleasingly upswept wings, isn\u2019t exactly hard on the eyes).\n\nBut I\u2019ve got a few hours and a few thousand miles to go yet on the 747, and as we cruise at our initial altitude of 31,000ft, the stunning views below \u2014 of Barcelona shining like a piece of well-lit jewellery in a pitch-black display case, and then Algiers, and the dendrites of light running south across the Atlas Mountains and fading into the Sahara desert \u2014 are a chance to reflect on an aeroplane that\u2019s meant the world to me.\n\nSince childhood I\u2019ve had an irrational love for the 747 \u2014 for its size, its unique shape, and above all for the wonder and sense of freedom that those three famous digits so effortlessly conjure up. My Twitter handle is @markv747. I use the same formulation for my personal email address. Perhaps the most absurd expression of my love for the 747 came on a trip to Texas a few years back. At Space Center Houston, the home, of course, of many wonders of the space age, I saw a certain iconic shape parked outside the entrance, and said to my partner, all but involuntarily, \u201cOh, wow! A 747!\u201d Keep in mind that the only reason I was in Houston was that I myself had landed a 747 in the city only a few hours earlier, and you\u2019ll begin to appreciate my passion for this aeroplane.\n\nThe 747, which first took flight in February 1969, in the lead-up to the moon landing in the summer of that same year, was said to inaugurate the \u201cSpacious Age\u201d of travel. It was more than an easy play on words \u2014 parts of the 747\u2019s advanced navigation system were derived from technology used on the Apollo space programme, for example. But it was the size of the jet, and a passenger capacity more than double that of its predecessors, that revolutionised the economics of air travel, and, in turn, changed our relationship with distant peoples and places.\n\nI\u2019m as much a fan (and a beneficiary) of that cultural shift as anyone could be. Yet even I haven\u2019t quite grown accustomed to the technological and historical dimensions of journeys such as tonight\u2019s flight to Cape Town. Tomorrow afternoon I\u2019ll go for a hike around the Cape of Good Hope, near two crosses that commemorate the journeys of Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama, half a millennium ago. As we sail now between the stars above and Cameroon below, I wonder what the two explorers would have made of all this: the crystal-clear readout of our position on the cockpit screens, the moving maps glowing softly behind hundreds of passenger seats, the great wings of the vessel, tipped with lights, lifting us and our breakfast trays across an entire night and continent.\n\nWe\u2019re routing south-west now, roughly parallel to the Congo river, and it\u2019s time for my break. I head to the little bunkroom inside the cockpit. The \u201cheavy\u201d, or relief, pilot takes my place in the cockpit\u2019s right-hand seat. (On the return journey, in a few days, it\u2019ll be my turn to be the relief pilot, who doesn\u2019t perform the take-off or landing.)\n\nSoon we\u2019ll be flying over the former Belgian Congo, where my father lived in the late 1950s. He loved aeroplanes, and surely couldn\u2019t have imagined that a son of his would cross these same skies some 60 years later. As I unroll my blue sleeping bag, I recall a story he told me, about a flight he once took on a DC-7C (as in \u201cSeven Seas\u201d), an aircraft that weighed only a fraction as much as a Boeing 747. That flight made an unscheduled stop, during which my father watched the pilot, sweating under the tropical sun, repair a troubled engine with a part taken from a working one.\n\nAs I fasten my seatbelt over my sleeping bag, that story reminds me of a marvellous statistic once cited by the aviation historian Douglas J Ingells. The output of the Wright brothers\u2019 first engine was about one horsepower per 10 pounds of engine weight. It was only decades later that the mighty and revolutionary turbofans of the first 747 finally inverted this ratio, producing 10 horsepower for every pound of weight. My dad, who died in 2005 and who never flew on a 747 with me, would have loved that statistic, I think. Amid the soothing, muffled whoosh of four of Rolls-Royce\u2019s finest engines, I drift off to sleep.\n\nBA pilot Mark Vanhoenacker on his last Boeing 747 flight\n\nThree or so hours later the tell-tale \u201cding-dong\u201d of the 747\u2019s wake-up chimes echoes through the bunkroom. I return to the cockpit and pause as my eyes adjust to the blinding brilliance of a high-altitude, southern African morning. I ask for a white coffee and a full English breakfast. To my right, I gaze down on crimson dunes, rolling in clean lines as neatly as surf: the Namib desert. Off to the distant left, through the captain\u2019s windows, it\u2019s the Kalahari.\n\nWe complete the descent checklist and soon it\u2019s time for me to update the passengers. I always mention the potential for views when arriving in Cape Town. The weather here rarely disappoints, and for many passengers, of course, a journey to Cape Town is the trip of a lifetime. I can already see Table Mountain ahead and the line of peaks running south from it toward Cape Point, beyond which the sea and sky merge into a stately blue haze. Often when I fly here, I think that this is the bluest place on Earth.\n\nSteadily descending, we\u2019re soon out over False Bay. It sparkles in the morning sun, with long, disturbed patches that reflect the light differently \u2014 the marks of breezes moving across the water, as obvious and pleasing as the footsteps of an invisible character in a cartoon. Cape Town, like nearly all of Africa, is behind us now. Straight ahead there\u2019s only Antarctica. We start the first of the graceful turns that will bring us back to land.\n\nJust before we cross the coastline for the second time we lower the landing gear. The captain says \u201cgood luck\u201d \u2014 the usual allusion to the film Airplane!, and a bit of gentle ribbing that any pilot who writes a book called How to Land a Plane has asked for in spades.\n\nCape Town\u2019s main runway \u2014 61 metres wide, 3,201 metres long, at an elevation of 144ft \u2014 is straight ahead now, and as clear as the morning itself. At about 30ft I pull the nose of the great jet up ever so slightly and start to close the thrust levers that I first opened wide in the darkness of London, 11 hours and 6,000 miles ago. Now the 747 hovers just above Africa, its stationary wheels waiting for the contact that will speed them up once again, and that will bring my happy years flying the aircraft I dreamt of as a child to a close. All too soon, it seems, we touch down.\n\nOnce parked at the gate, I say farewell to our passengers. As I thank them I can\u2019t help adding that \u201cI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed flying to this beautiful city, on this beautiful aeroplane, just as much as we did.\u201d Then I head downstairs to the main deck to say goodbye to a few hundred customers in person.\n\nInside the terminal, my colleagues take a picture of me. The silent jet fills the windows behind me. As we walk toward passport control I turn my phone on. Amid the \u201cWelcome to South Africa\u201d messages there\u2019s an email from a pilot who\u2019s a good friend. He asks about my last flight and points out the 747-acclaiming email address that he\u2019s just written to me at. \u201cTime to change it, eh Mark?\u201d But he\u2019s joking, of course \u2014 he knows as well as I do that it\u2019s one to keep.\n\nMark Vanhoenacker is a pilot for British Airways and the author of \u2018Skyfaring\u2019 and \u2018How to Land a Plane\u2019\n\n\n\nDo you remember your first flight on a 747? Share it with us in the comments below\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nMemories of Boeing and the unique 747 / From Tony Price, San Diego, CA, US"

    "title": "Cambodia\u2019s paths less travelled",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "If part of the point of travel is to be moved and touched, then there is scarcely a country I can think of that stirs the soul as much as Cambodia. Much of its recent history has been deeply harrowing, yet the country projects a certain sense of youthful optimism; the roughly 65 per cent of the population that is under 30 seems to be looking to a more vibrant present and future, which is part of what gives a journey through Cambodia some of its singular charm.\n\nWhile it has always had its magnificent temple complex at Angkor as a huge draw, few tourists did more than fly into Siem Reap for two or three days of temple-viewing before journeying onward to Thailand or Vietnam. The rare one would, as George Morgan-Grenville of tour operator Red Savannah puts it, \u201coccasionally make it to Phnom Penh to put themselves through the harrowing S21 Tuol Sleng and Killing Fields experience before retreating to the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club for a calming sundowner \u2013 the lack of infrastructure made further exploration fairly futile except for the most intrepid\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is happening now, though, is that Cambodia is opening itself up to those who would like to discover more. Up in the impenetrable jungle-clad Cardamom Mountains where Khmer Rouge fighters used to hide out, there is a wonderful new lodge generating a great deal of buzz; and down on the Gulf of Thailand off the southern coast, two new island resorts have arrived, each offering a different sort of experience to the traveller wanting to rest up after the rigours of days of temple-viewing.\n\nBut start at Siem Reap \u2013 still as good a place as any, as no visitor to Cambodia should miss out on what remains one of southeast Asia\u2019s most magnificent sights. Though Angkor Wat is the most famous, there are many other great temples to see; allow three days, if you can, to experience as much as possible without overdoing it. Getting up at the crack of dawn to watch the sun rise over the great lotus-bud towers and stupas is the perennial advice; follow it and you will not be disappointed. Then repair for breakfast (or lunch, if you haven\u2019t made it at dawn) to Sala Kdei, a beautiful traditional Cambodian wooden house set in a verdant garden, for traditional Khmer fare and a foot massage. But also listen to the stories of its people so you begin to get a feel for the country and what it has been through. The father of Ohm, my guide in the temple complex, was a professor of fine art who was shot when Ohm was just five years old; the owner of the wooden house\u2019s husband, too, was killed by the Khmer Rouge, and she was forced to marry a Khmer Rouge fighter. Today she is an entrepreneur with a flourishing clutch of small businesses to her name.\n\nFrom the temples and buzz of Siem Reap it\u2019s just an hour\u2019s flight to Sihanoukville on the south coast, where two major new resorts, each only around 30 minutes from the airport by car and boat, have been created on small islands. Six Senses Krabey Island has 40 large and spacious villas, each with its own pool. It\u2019s all hills and curves, and I found walking there enchanting. Some of the villas are set on the hillsides amid the jungle, and others are dotted around the edge of the island, lapped by the sea. These all have decks leading down to the water, on which you could practise yoga, have private picnics or moonlit meals. The downside is that there is just a small beach beside the Tree restaurant, but I loved the lush, green setting. As for things to do, general manager Alistair Anderson will lead swimming all around the island, and there\u2019s also kayaking and surf\u2011skiing, while at night an astrologer will illuminate the goings-on in the sky. And since it is Six Senses, there is a serious spa, with the option of a wellness-screening programme that will tell you all the things you rather hoped not to know \u2013 such as how many kilos you need to lose, your cholesterol and insulin levels, oxygen levels, lung function and a great deal more. (It also gave me one of the best pedicures I\u2019ve ever had.)\n\nA mere five minutes away by speedboat is the new Alila Villas Koh Russey. Entirely different in character to Six Senses Krabey Island, Alila takes a restrained and austere approach to architecture and interior design, and its main claim to fame is its 1.2km-long sandy beach, from which you can kayak, paddleboard and swim in safety. Its beachfront villas have their own pools, while those in the suites in the main building can use the large communal pool, partly formed in the shape of the Angkor Wat temple. Alila will take guests to have a blessing at a newish pagoda on the mainland \u2013 its wonderful sculptures and carvings, though not in the Angkor Wat league, harbour a charm and a beauty of their own. Both islands will lay on day trips to nearby old French colonial-style towns such as Kampot and Kep; both have Khmer food on the menu and are staffed mostly by Khmer people.\n\nTwo-and-a-half hours away by car is Bill Bensley\u2019s Shinta Mani Wild, about which there is huge excitement in the whole of southeast Asia. Bensley, a Harvard-trained architect, designer, landscape architect and hotelier, is renowned for creating magical settings in the numerous hotels and gardens he has been responsible for in the area (he made his name with the game-changing Four Seasons tented camp in Chiang Rai). But above and beyond that, Shinta Mani Wild offers the visitor to Cambodia the chance to venture deep into the Cardamom Mountains \u2013 a part of the country that until now has only been open to the most intrepid and resourceful of travellers. Instead of rice paddies and pagodas, temples and street stalls, there is a kaleidoscope of waterfalls, rushing rivers and tropical rainforest in which lurks wildlife such as elephants, leopard cats, gibbons and pangolins. The camp lies on a corridor between Bokor National Park and Kirirom National Park, which is critical to the conservation of what is the largest rainforest left in southeast Asia. Shinta Mani Wild is funding rangers to protect the habitat from poachers and loggers and is also working with the Wildlife Alliance to protect the wildlife and educate the local population about conservation, providing many of them with employment.\n\nThere are 15 tents \u2013 each is vast, with a huge balcony on which there are sofas and chairs and an open-air bath, and each has views of a tumbling waterfall or the rushing river. Bensley has tried to recreate the glamour of the old colonial-style tented safari camp; he explains that he had in mind the sort of hospitality that King Sihanouk offered Jackie Kennedy when she visited Cambodia in 1967. Shinta Mani Wild is glamorous \u2013 there is nothing of the austere or minimalist about it. Huge trucks filled with antique treasures that Bensley has collected over the years drove from Bangkok, and as I left they were all being deployed about the campsite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe intrepid traveller on arrival can, if they choose, descend from the jeep at a judicious point and land in camp via two zip-lines that reach over the Tmor Rung river and waterfall. Every guest has an \u201cAdventure Butler\u201d who will organise the day, whether it be going out with a Mongolian fly-fishing expert to learn tenkara, a meditative Japanese way to fish, or with Wildlife Alliance in its endless quest to keep poachers and loggers at bay, or exploring the estuary on one of two expedition boats. Kayaking, mountain-biking, picnics on the river, birdwatching and orchid-hunting are just some of the vast array of experiences to be had.\n\nShinta Mani Wild is truly magical. And as it is halfway between the island resorts of the south coast and Phnom Penh, it is brilliantly placed to create a new sort of circuit connecting the centre of the country to its southern reaches, through less explored parts. There is now every reason for the visitor to Cambodia to dally awhile, and to realise that it has many riches to offer beyond Angkor Wat \u2013 and that, as a great bonus, they come without the crowds.\n\n441"

    "text": "One year ago, Edo Kurniawan, a jovial 33-year-old Indonesian who runs the Asia-Pacific accounting and finance operations for global payments group Wirecard AG, called half a dozen colleagues into a Singapore meeting room. He picked up a whiteboard pen and began to teach them how to cook the books.\n\nHis company would soon become one of Germany\u2019s most valuable financial institutions, but as Mr Kurniawan spoke, the task at hand was to create figures that would convince regulators at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to issue a licence so Wirecard could dole out prepaid bank cards in the Chinese territory.\n\nThe group was seeking to take over payment operations from Citigroup, covering 20,000 retailers in 11 countries stretching from India to New Zealand. Regulatory approvals in every territory were crucial, even if it meant inventing numbers to be used in the Hong Kong licence application.\n\nMr Kurniawan then sketched out a practice known as \u201cround tripping\u201d: a lump of money would leave the bank Wirecard owns in Germany, show its face on the balance sheet of a dormant subsidiary in Hong Kong, depart to sit momentarily in the books of an external \u201ccustomer\u201d, then travel back to Wirecard in India, where it would look to local auditors like legitimate business revenue.\n\nWirecard chief executive officer Markus Braun \u00a9 Bloomberg\n\nIn isolation, Mr Kurniawan\u2019s scheme might have appeared to be the act of a rogue employee in the provincial outpost of a little known financial group. But the account of what happened, in a preliminary report on the investigation by one of Asia\u2019s most eminent legal firms, indicated it was part of a pattern of book-padding across Wirecard\u2019s Asian operations over several years. Documents seen by the Financial Times show two senior executives in the Munich head office had at least some awareness of the round-tripping scheme: Thorsten Holten and Stephan von Erffa, respectively the company\u2019s head of treasury and head of accounting.\n\nThe revelations call into question the figures reported by one of Europe\u2019s few technological success stories, a German fintech group that has grown into a \u20ac20bn global payments institution. Before the FT exposed the existence of the investigation last week, the group was more valuable than Deutsche Bank or Commerzbank, whose place it has taken in Germany\u2019s main stock market index. Wirecard is a favourite of retail investors, who saw its rapid expansion into Asia as a sign that it can challenge the world\u2019s biggest banks for primacy in the $1.4tn market for payments.\n\nMarkus Braun has run the company since helping to recapitalise it in 2002, an investment which made the 49-year-old Austrian a billionaire. In the field of digital money, Wirecard presents itself as best in class.\n\nIn response to the news of the preliminary investigation, Wirecard initially said no material compliance findings had resulted. This week the company told the FT that while its investigation was ongoing, it had made no conclusive findings of criminal misconduct and it would be wrong to draw conclusions from the preliminary report.\n\nIt is not the first time the group\u2019s accounting practices have been called into question. Accusations of suspect accounting were levelled in 2008, 2015 and 2016. Each time Wirecard has alleged market manipulation, sparking investigations by the German market regulator, BaFin.\n\nThis time questions about its Asian operations began internally, prompted by a whistleblower left stunned by Mr Kurniawan\u2019s January meeting last year. Notifying Wirecard\u2019s senior legal counsel in the region on March 26, the whistleblower identified two senior finance executives, James Wardhana and Irene Chai, as accomplices in the book-cooking operation. A separate whistleblower also raised concerns in February, and on April 3 that person supplied the compliance team with a suspect contract they had received via Telegram, the encrypted messaging app.\n\nDaniel Steinhoff, Wirecard\u2019s head of compliance in Munich, flew in to Singapore for a briefing. On April 13 he ordered the email archives of these individuals \u201cmirrored\u201d, with copies seized.\n\nCompliance staff, who evidently found the accounts of the whistleblowers credible, soon found enough in the documents to warrant a snap investigation, codenamed Project Tiger. They called in Singapore-based Rajah & Tann, which sent in a team of former prosecutors.\n\nOn May 4 R&T submitted a preliminary report, running to 30 pages of bombshell allegations: evidence in the documents of \u201cforgery and/or of falsification of accounts\u201d, as well as reasons to suspect \u201ccheating, criminal breach of trust, corruption and/or money laundering\u201d in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nThe trio in Singapore, led by Mr Kurniawan, appears to have been fabricating invoices and agreements to create a paper trail which could be shown to auditors at EY, as if money was moving in and out of Wirecard for legitimate purposes.\n\nJan Marsalek, Wirecard\u2019s chief operating officer\n\nThe job of his finance team was to oversee the figures put together by the various Wirecard companies in the region, then supply the accounts to head office. But the book-keepers were also putting together contracts and signing off on technology projects.\n\nNot only were there no emails from certain supposed customers and suppliers to Wirecard, the preliminary investigation found that Wirecard lawyers, salespeople and technology staff did not appear to be involved in the deals either.\n\nFor example, in March last year Mr Wardhana, sitting at his computer, sent himself a digital copy of the logo for Flexi Flex, a hydraulics and piping company with offices in Singapore and Malaysia. The image was on invoices he presented to colleagues for payments, according to documents seen by the FT. These documents, including contracts for the supply and purchase of obscure software products signed by Mr Kurniawan, made it appear Flexi Flex was doing substantial business with Wirecard.\n\nIn an April 9 2018 email chain, Mr Wardhana drafted answers for queries from EY in Germany needed to close out that year\u2019s audit. He described Flexi Flex as \u201ca new client engaged in 2017\u201d which generated \u20ac4m of revenue for Wirecard Malaysia.\n\nWirecard has since confirmed it had no genuine business relationship with Flexi Flex. Mr Wardhana\u2019s email also attributed \u20ac3m of Hong Kong revenue to Right Momentum Consulting, another third party business partner. The Kuala Lumpur address for the company on documents seen by the FT could not be traced.\n\nThe R&T preliminary report said: \u201cWe may draw strong and irrefutable inferences from the documentary evidence there has been at the very least several accounting irregularities which take the shape of forged agreements. In the best-case scenario, the purpose behind these deliberate acts may be limited to the false creation of revenue, with no wrongful misappropriation of monies.\u201d\n\nSuspect transactions, while individually small in the context of Wirecard revenues, appear to have been designed to stop Wirecard entities missing profit targets, by filling holes after the end of a financial year with fake and backdated sales agreements according to the preliminary report and certain emails reviewed by the FT.\n\nWirecard told the FT on Wednesday that, subsequent to R&T\u2019s preliminary report, a separate internal investigation with access to accounting systems determined that the allegations were unsubstantiated and no regulations were broken. Notwithstanding those findings, the external R&T investigation \u2014 ongoing for more than eight months \u2014 reflected a commitment to good corporate governance, it said.\n\nMunich-based Wirecard was hailed as a star of the fintech firmament \u00a9 DPA\n\nSince 2012 the company has raised \u20ac500m from shareholders, and spent it on a collection of obscure payments companies. Missing profit targets could have called into question the basis of Wirecard\u2019s Asian expansion over the past decade.\n\nR&T\u2019s preliminary review of the documentary evidence and whistleblower testimony identified potential for accounting irregularities in numbers reported to Germany for businesses in the Philippines, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and India.\n\nIt also indicated another potentially significant issue. Singapore and Hong Kong, like Germany, have put in place strict reporting requirements to combat money laundering. Suspicious transactions, such as those identified by Project Tiger, should be brought to the attention of the authorities in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nAs the owner of a bank, and as a member of the Visa and Mastercard payment networks, Wirecard has a responsibility to file such reports. It distributes hundreds of millions of euros in credit and debit card transactions every day. It is a gatekeeper with responsibilities to help police flows of cash as governments try to restrict the ability of criminals and terrorists to move money. Wirecard this week said it has complied with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nYet, faced with evidence that a rogue unit in its fast-growing Asian business was forging documents, inventing money flows and sending real cash out the door to fictitious suppliers, the reaction of senior executives in Munich was curious.\n\nA briefing document dated May 7 2018 was prepared for a meeting of Wirecard\u2019s four most senior executives. Alexander von Knoop, chief financial officer, thanked the author in an email following the meeting \u201cfor the great job you are doing to clarify the circumstances and to prevent Wirecard Group from any financial and reputational damage\u201d.\n\nThe email also announced that Jan Marsalek, Wirecard\u2019s chief operating officer, had been appointed to co-ordinate the inquiry, \u201cto get the necessary pressure on the investigation\u201d, Mr von Knoop said.\n\nA Wirecard booth at a computer games fair in Cologne \u00a9 Reuters\n\nMr Marsalek, a 38-year-old Austrian with a military haircut, tailored suits and novelty solid gold credit card, was renowned within the company. He was also the management board member responsible for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nWirecard\u2019s lawyers in Singapore warned Mr Marsalek\u2019s proposed role presented \u201ca perceived and potential conflict of interest\u201d. He was a material witness of fact who had worked closely with Mr Kurniawan on certain projects, they said.\n\nR&T said in a May 9 email that his appointment could \u201cinvite forceful queries by regulators and enforcement agencies\u201d. It was a potential conflict which could be managed, but that \u201cin the worst case the investigation may be seen as fatally flawed to begin with \u2014 with the consequence that regulators and enforcement agencies may swoop in suddenly to conduct a full investigation of their own\u201d.\n\n\n\nOne matter under scrutiny was Wirecard Singapore\u2019s relationship with a third party, Matrimonial Global. R&T believed a sales agreement with the company had been backdated. A November 8 2017 email from Mr von Erffa pointed to Mr Marsalek\u2019s knowledge of the deal. Outlining the transaction, it said \u201cJan will support us for contracts and communication etc.\u201d\n\nMs Chai appears to have thought he had a stake in Matrimonial Global. On January 9 last year she wrote to a colleague: \u201cIf not mistaken this agreement is something like the one with Wirecard Dubai, I think the company belong to Jan.\u201d\n\nThe colleague replied: \u201cYup, is the additional \u2018revenue\u2019 that was put in last Q [quarter].\u201d\n\nWirecard told the FT that Mr Marsalek does not own Matrimonial Global, and that he has had no involvement in the investigations.\n\nThe COO had worked closely with Mr Kurniawan for years. For instance, a few days before the end of 2015 a Wirecard subsidiary in Indonesia, Aprisma, needed income of \u20ac3.3m to hit its profit target for the year. The two men discussed options. The target was reached thanks to what was described as an \u201cadditional project from Jan\u201d, according to subsequent emails. The backdated sales agreement which resulted did not appear to be genuine, according to R&T\u2019s preliminary report.\n\nA year later Mr Kurniawan and Mr Marsalek had worked together to provide answers to questions from EY during a tough audit, according to documents seen by the FT.\n\nIn October 2015, Wirecard agreed to pay \u20ac325m for a collection of businesses in India, its biggest-ever takeover. The deal came after the FT published a series of articles highlighting apparent inconsistencies in Wirecard\u2019s accounting and what looked like a growing hole in its balance sheet. The India deal attracted the attention of sceptical analysts and investors, who reported difficulty finding the scale of operations the company claimed. Inside Wirecard, EY directed a team at the end of 2016 to take a close look, now that a full year of ownership had passed.\n\nIn April 2017 Mr Kurniawan told a colleague he could not sleep because of Hermes, Wirecard\u2019s main business in India. And the entity\u2019s CFO, appointed only months before, submitted a disclaimer to the Hermes board that he \u201cshould not be held in any way responsible\u201d for many of the documents relating to the 2016 audit, due to his recent arrival. EY eventually signed off on the revenues Wirecard reported.\n\nThe clean audit in early 2017 helped to reassure investors. Wirecard\u2019s share price proceeded to quadruple, amid global enthusiasm for fintech companies.\n\nYet some of the documentary evidence placed in front of R&T, and since seen by the FT, raises fresh questions about the scope of accounting irregularities and the authority extended to the young book-keeper in Singapore.\n\nIndeed, a central question remains. What did management in Munich know about Mr Kurniawan\u2019s activities, and what should it have known?\n\nA February 15 2018 email chain indicates that some in Germany were at least made aware of a version of the round-trip scheme Mr Kurniawan had sketched on the whiteboard weeks earlier. Documents show that Mr Holten, whose signature was needed to authorise payments from head office, wrote: \u201cI need to know the whole cash flow.\u201d\n\nMr Kurniawan replied 13 minutes later with a plan to move \u20ac2m into India, via Wirecard Hong Kong and an outside entity. \u201cHope it\u2019s clear?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cVery good, thx,\u201d Mr Holten replied. Copied into the email was Mr von Erffa, whose signature would also be required.\n\nWhen the FT broke news of the investigation last week, Mr Kurniawan was still head of international finance and his alleged accomplices were still employed. The company on Wednesday said certain individuals had been temporarily assigned to other roles, pending the outcome of the probe, and any disciplinary action would be determined by the evidence.\n\nWirecard also said there had been significant developments and substantial new information taken into account since R&T\u2019s preliminary report.\n\nA whistleblower, who initially approached the FT due to the apparent lack of action, this week said: \u201cIf a payments company can do this, how can you have trust in the system?\u201d"

    "text": "Singapore police raided Wirecard offices in the city state on Friday, a significant step up in the authorities\u2019 investigation into the German fintech company, which comes after the Financial Times revealed that a preliminary internal probe had found forged documents and accounting irregularities.\n\n\u201cThe Singapore police has raided the premises of Wirecard in Singapore today,\u201d a police spokesperson told the Financial Times on Friday. About 10 officers in the police\u2019s commercial affairs department swooped on Wirecard\u2019s Singapore offices at 10.30am, according to one person familiar with the situation.\n\nTwo people familiar with the situation said that the police seized electronics, including laptops. The police did not confirm which unit carried out the operation, or what materials, if any, were taken in the raid.\n\nThe raid came after the FT published reports that raise questions about the integrity of the accounting at one of Europe\u2019s most successful fintech groups, which prompted a statement by the Singapore police earlier this week saying it was \u201clooking into the matter\u201d.\n\nWirecard, which has made clear there are no conclusive findings from an investigation it ordered, said in a statement that the police investigation was \u201cnormal procedure\u201d and it would \u201ccomplete our internal compliance investigations and disclose these findings to the public\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis morning, Wirecard met with Singapore law enforcement at Wirecard\u2019s headquarter[s] in Singapore and provided the police with comprehensive supporting material in regards to their enquiry into the defamatory allegations in the FT series of articles. We would like to reconfirm that the accusations against employees of Wirecard are unfounded. We are working closely with the Singapore police to clear all allegations.\u201d\n\nOfficers approached employees, including senior management, with questions. One member of staff was asked about the financial structure of Wirecard\u2019s Singapore offices, as well as to identify the finance team\u2019s members and their responsibilities, the person said.\n\nThe police also questioned the fintech group\u2019s senior executives, including Fook Sun Ng, a senior manager at Wirecard Singapore, according to two people familiar with the situation.\n\nEdo Kurniawan, responsible for Wirecard\u2019s accounting in the Asia-Pacific region, was last year suspected of using forged and backdated contracts in a string of suspicious transactions, according to a preliminary report on the matter prepared by R&T and seen by the FT. He was not seen in the office on Friday morning, said the person familiar with the situation. Mr Ng, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, and Mr Kurniawan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA probe into the group\u2019s Singapore operations would be led by the city state\u2019s police, given that Wirecard is not regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country\u2019s de facto central bank. Under current regulation, Wirecard requires no licence to operate in the jurisdiction.\n\nShares in Wirecard fell 15.8 per cent to \u20ac93.24. They have fallen 44 per cent since last week when the FT first published an article on the alleged activity at its Singapore offices."

    "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nThe Bank of England has retreated from plans for multiple interest rate rises as it sharply downgraded its economic outlook amid mounting Brexit uncertainty and slowing global growth.\n\nIn one of the largest near-term forecast revisions since the 2016 EU referendum, the central bank cut its forecast for UK growth to 1.2 per cent in 2019, the weakest level since the recession of 2009. As recently as November, the bank had expected 1.7 per cent growth this year.\n\nThe statement initially sent sterling sinking to a low of the day, but it recovered in afternoon trading as markets saw the BoE\u2019s statements and forecasts as a holding statement until greater clarity on Brexit emerged.\n\nThe BoE\u2019s forecasts and governor Mark Carney\u2019s commentary was significantly more downbeat on the economy than economists expected. It allied the central bank with its counterparts in the US, India, Australia and Canada who have all stepped back from plans for tighter monetary policy and highlighted concerns about the economic outlook.\n\nThe BoE\u2019s central forecast is for the UK to avoid a recession, but with only 0.2 per cent growth forecast for each of the first two quarters of the year, half the rate it previously thought.\n\nIt forecast a significantly higher chance of Britain sliding into recession this year, putting the odds at one in four that the UK\u2019s annual growth rate will have dipped below zero by the summer even assuming a \u201csmooth\u201d Brexit process.\n\nMr Carney said this risk of recession would rise significantly if Britain left the EU in March without a deal and with no transition arrangements. \u201cWhen the economy is growing more slowly, the probability of having a negative quarter or two goes up . . . and if there is a shock \u2014 a no-deal, no-transition Brexit would be a shock \u2014 that further increases the possibility of negative quarters,\u201d he said.\n\nMuch of the BoE\u2019s gloom stemmed from much weaker business investment that the bank had been expecting. Officials blamed \u201csofter activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home\u201d for the forecast downgrades and the more dovish attitude to interest rates.\n\nThe BoE expects business investment to drop 2.75 per cent this year, having previously expected growth, blaming Brexit uncertainty, which has led \u201caround half\u201d of the companies surveyed by the central bank to implement contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit without any transition at the end of March.\n\nThese forecasts would be significantly worse if Britain left the EU abruptly next month. \u201cThe economy as a whole is still not yet prepared for a no deal, no transition exit,\u201d Mr Carney said. He added that there were now signs that in addition to companies holding back on investment and there were signs that the caution was spreading to households.\n\n\u201cIndicators suggest spending growth has been modest since the start of the year,\u201d the governor said.\n\nIn the face of the significantly weaker outlook, the Monetary Policy Committee indicated it was much less likely to raise interest rates. It voted unanimously to hold the benchmark rate at 0.75 per cent in the February meeting.\n\nThe committee\u2019s forecasts showed little concern about rising inflation even if it kept rates on hold for the next three years. They illustrated that policymakers thought there was only a 56 per cent probability that inflation would exceed the BoE\u2019s 2 per cent target after two years if it left rates unchanged with a weaker inflation profiles than in the November forecasts.\n\nDavid Page, senior economist at Axa Investment Managers, said the new forecasts \u201csuggest the BoE will be in no hurry to raise rates\u201d.\n\nAndrew Goodwin, associate director of Oxford Economics, said \u201cthe sands do now seem to be shifting\u201d on the MPC\u2019s hawkish rhetoric even though the committee decided to repeat its rhetoric that there would be \u201climited\u201d and \u201cgradual\u201d interest rate rises to come.\n\nThe forecasts suggest the MPC believes that at most a one quarter-point interest rate rise is required over the next three years to keep inflation under control\n\nAllan Monks of JPMorgan was one of a number of City economists to push back previous forecasts of the next quarter-point rate rise from May to August and acknowledged \u201cthe risks around this are still skewed towards a later tightening\u201d.\n\nOn financial markets, traders who make markets on future interest rates on a new CME market predicting BoE actions now think it is more likely than not that the central bank will not raise rates at all this year.\n\nHighlighting internal worries about the accuracy of its forecasts, BoE staff published alternative scenarios for the economy on the basis that uncertainty over Brexit became even more acute and subsided faster than it expected.\n\nThey showed that if uncertainty grew over the Brexit outcome, growth would be significantly weaker by up to 1.5 per cent over three years, but if uncertainty could be resolved quicker than it currently expects, there could be an equivalent dividend, alongside higher inflation and interest rates."

    "text": "One year ago, Edo Kurniawan, a jovial 33-year-old Indonesian who runs the Asia-Pacific accounting and finance operations for global payments group Wirecard AG, called half a dozen colleagues into a Singapore meeting room. He picked up a whiteboard pen and began to teach them how to cook the books.\n\nHis company would soon become one of Germany\u2019s most valuable financial institutions, but as Mr Kurniawan spoke, the task at hand was to create figures that would convince regulators at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to issue a licence so Wirecard could dole out prepaid bank cards in the Chinese territory.\n\nThe group was seeking to take over payment operations from Citigroup, covering 20,000 retailers in 11 countries stretching from India to New Zealand. Regulatory approvals in every territory were crucial, even if it meant inventing numbers to be used in the Hong Kong licence application.\n\nMr Kurniawan then sketched out a practice known as \u201cround tripping\u201d: a lump of money would leave the bank Wirecard owns in Germany, show its face on the balance sheet of a dormant subsidiary in Hong Kong, depart to sit momentarily in the books of an external \u201ccustomer\u201d, then travel back to Wirecard in India, where it would look to local auditors like legitimate business revenue.\n\nWirecard chief executive officer Markus Braun \u00a9 Bloomberg\n\nIn isolation, Mr Kurniawan\u2019s scheme might have appeared to be the act of a rogue employee in the provincial outpost of a little known financial group. But the account of what happened, in a preliminary report on the investigation by one of Asia\u2019s most eminent legal firms, indicated it was part of a pattern of book-padding across Wirecard\u2019s Asian operations over several years. Documents seen by the Financial Times show two senior executives in the Munich head office had at least some awareness of the round-tripping scheme: Thorsten Holten and Stephan von Erffa, respectively the company\u2019s head of treasury and head of accounting.\n\nThe revelations call into question the figures reported by one of Europe\u2019s few technological success stories, a German fintech group that has grown into a \u20ac20bn global payments institution. Before the FT exposed the existence of the investigation last week, the group was more valuable than Deutsche Bank or Commerzbank, whose place it has taken in Germany\u2019s main stock market index. Wirecard is a favourite of retail investors, who saw its rapid expansion into Asia as a sign that it can challenge the world\u2019s biggest banks for primacy in the $1.4tn market for payments.\n\nMarkus Braun has run the company since helping to recapitalise it in 2002, an investment which made the 49-year-old Austrian a billionaire. In the field of digital money, Wirecard presents itself as best in class.\n\nIn response to the news of the preliminary investigation, Wirecard initially said no material compliance findings had resulted. This week the company told the FT that while its investigation was ongoing, it had made no conclusive findings of criminal misconduct and it would be wrong to draw conclusions from the preliminary report.\n\nIt is not the first time the group\u2019s accounting practices have been called into question. Accusations of suspect accounting were levelled in 2008, 2015 and 2016. Each time Wirecard has alleged market manipulation, sparking investigations by the German market regulator, BaFin.\n\nThis time questions about its Asian operations began internally, prompted by a whistleblower left stunned by Mr Kurniawan\u2019s January meeting last year. Notifying Wirecard\u2019s senior legal counsel in the region on March 26, the whistleblower identified two senior finance executives, James Wardhana and Irene Chai, as accomplices in the book-cooking operation. A separate whistleblower also raised concerns in February, and on April 3 that person supplied the compliance team with a suspect contract they had received via Telegram, the encrypted messaging app.\n\nDaniel Steinhoff, Wirecard\u2019s head of compliance in Munich, flew in to Singapore for a briefing. On April 13 he ordered the email archives of these individuals \u201cmirrored\u201d, with copies seized.\n\nCompliance staff, who evidently found the accounts of the whistleblowers credible, soon found enough in the documents to warrant a snap investigation, codenamed Project Tiger. They called in Singapore-based Rajah & Tann, which sent in a team of former prosecutors.\n\nOn May 4 R&T submitted a preliminary report, running to 30 pages of bombshell allegations: evidence in the documents of \u201cforgery and/or of falsification of accounts\u201d, as well as reasons to suspect \u201ccheating, criminal breach of trust, corruption and/or money laundering\u201d in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nThe trio in Singapore, led by Mr Kurniawan, appears to have been fabricating invoices and agreements to create a paper trail which could be shown to auditors at EY, as if money was moving in and out of Wirecard for legitimate purposes.\n\nJan Marsalek, Wirecard\u2019s chief operating officer\n\nThe job of his finance team was to oversee the figures put together by the various Wirecard companies in the region, then supply the accounts to head office. But the book-keepers were also putting together contracts and signing off on technology projects.\n\nNot only were there no emails from certain supposed customers and suppliers to Wirecard, the preliminary investigation found that Wirecard lawyers, salespeople and technology staff did not appear to be involved in the deals either.\n\nFor example, in March last year Mr Wardhana, sitting at his computer, sent himself a digital copy of the logo for Flexi Flex, a hydraulics and piping company with offices in Singapore and Malaysia. The image was on invoices he presented to colleagues for payments, according to documents seen by the FT. These documents, including contracts for the supply and purchase of obscure software products signed by Mr Kurniawan, made it appear Flexi Flex was doing substantial business with Wirecard.\n\nIn an April 9 2018 email chain, Mr Wardhana drafted answers for queries from EY in Germany needed to close out that year\u2019s audit. He described Flexi Flex as \u201ca new client engaged in 2017\u201d which generated \u20ac4m of revenue for Wirecard Malaysia.\n\nWirecard has since confirmed it had no genuine business relationship with Flexi Flex. Mr Wardhana\u2019s email also attributed \u20ac3m of Hong Kong revenue to Right Momentum Consulting, another third party business partner. The Kuala Lumpur address for the company on documents seen by the FT could not be traced.\n\nThe R&T preliminary report said: \u201cWe may draw strong and irrefutable inferences from the documentary evidence there has been at the very least several accounting irregularities which take the shape of forged agreements. In the best-case scenario, the purpose behind these deliberate acts may be limited to the false creation of revenue, with no wrongful misappropriation of monies.\u201d\n\nSuspect transactions, while individually small in the context of Wirecard revenues, appear to have been designed to stop Wirecard entities missing profit targets, by filling holes after the end of a financial year with fake and backdated sales agreements according to the preliminary report and certain emails reviewed by the FT.\n\nWirecard told the FT on Wednesday that, subsequent to R&T\u2019s preliminary report, a separate internal investigation with access to accounting systems determined that the allegations were unsubstantiated and no regulations were broken. Notwithstanding those findings, the external R&T investigation \u2014 ongoing for more than eight months \u2014 reflected a commitment to good corporate governance, it said.\n\nMunich-based Wirecard was hailed as a star of the fintech firmament \u00a9 DPA\n\nSince 2012 the company has raised \u20ac500m from shareholders, and spent it on a collection of obscure payments companies. Missing profit targets could have called into question the basis of Wirecard\u2019s Asian expansion over the past decade.\n\nR&T\u2019s preliminary review of the documentary evidence and whistleblower testimony identified potential for accounting irregularities in numbers reported to Germany for businesses in the Philippines, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and India.\n\nIt also indicated another potentially significant issue. Singapore and Hong Kong, like Germany, have put in place strict reporting requirements to combat money laundering. Suspicious transactions, such as those identified by Project Tiger, should be brought to the attention of the authorities in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nAs the owner of a bank, and as a member of the Visa and Mastercard payment networks, Wirecard has a responsibility to file such reports. It distributes hundreds of millions of euros in credit and debit card transactions every day. It is a gatekeeper with responsibilities to help police flows of cash as governments try to restrict the ability of criminals and terrorists to move money. Wirecard this week said it has complied with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nYet, faced with evidence that a rogue unit in its fast-growing Asian business was forging documents, inventing money flows and sending real cash out the door to fictitious suppliers, the reaction of senior executives in Munich was curious.\n\nA briefing document dated May 7 2018 was prepared for a meeting of Wirecard\u2019s four most senior executives. Alexander von Knoop, chief financial officer, thanked the author in an email following the meeting \u201cfor the great job you are doing to clarify the circumstances and to prevent Wirecard Group from any financial and reputational damage\u201d.\n\nThe email also announced that Jan Marsalek, Wirecard\u2019s chief operating officer, had been appointed to co-ordinate the inquiry, \u201cto get the necessary pressure on the investigation\u201d, Mr von Knoop said.\n\nA Wirecard booth at a computer games fair in Cologne \u00a9 Reuters\n\nMr Marsalek, a 38-year-old Austrian with a military haircut, tailored suits and novelty solid gold credit card, was renowned within the company. He was also the management board member responsible for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nWirecard\u2019s lawyers in Singapore warned Mr Marsalek\u2019s proposed role presented \u201ca perceived and potential conflict of interest\u201d. He was a material witness of fact who had worked closely with Mr Kurniawan on certain projects, they said.\n\nR&T said in a May 9 email that his appointment could \u201cinvite forceful queries by regulators and enforcement agencies\u201d. It was a potential conflict which could be managed, but that \u201cin the worst case the investigation may be seen as fatally flawed to begin with \u2014 with the consequence that regulators and enforcement agencies may swoop in suddenly to conduct a full investigation of their own\u201d.\n\n\n\nOne matter under scrutiny was Wirecard Singapore\u2019s relationship with a third party, Matrimonial Global. R&T believed a sales agreement with the company had been backdated. A November 8 2017 email from Mr von Erffa pointed to Mr Marsalek\u2019s knowledge of the deal. Outlining the transaction, it said \u201cJan will support us for contracts and communication etc.\u201d\n\nMs Chai appears to have thought he had a stake in Matrimonial Global. On January 9 last year she wrote to a colleague: \u201cIf not mistaken this agreement is something like the one with Wirecard Dubai, I think the company belong to Jan.\u201d\n\nThe colleague replied: \u201cYup, is the additional \u2018revenue\u2019 that was put in last Q [quarter].\u201d\n\nWirecard told the FT that Mr Marsalek does not own Matrimonial Global, and that he has had no involvement in the investigations.\n\nThe COO had worked closely with Mr Kurniawan for years. For instance, a few days before the end of 2015 a Wirecard subsidiary in Indonesia, Aprisma, needed income of \u20ac3.3m to hit its profit target for the year. The two men discussed options. The target was reached thanks to what was described as an \u201cadditional project from Jan\u201d, according to subsequent emails. The backdated sales agreement which resulted did not appear to be genuine, according to R&T\u2019s preliminary report.\n\nA year later Mr Kurniawan and Mr Marsalek had worked together to provide answers to questions from EY during a tough audit, according to documents seen by the FT.\n\nIn October 2015, Wirecard agreed to pay \u20ac325m for a collection of businesses in India, its biggest-ever takeover. The deal came after the FT published a series of articles highlighting apparent inconsistencies in Wirecard\u2019s accounting and what looked like a growing hole in its balance sheet. The India deal attracted the attention of sceptical analysts and investors, who reported difficulty finding the scale of operations the company claimed. Inside Wirecard, EY directed a team at the end of 2016 to take a close look, now that a full year of ownership had passed.\n\nIn April 2017 Mr Kurniawan told a colleague he could not sleep because of Hermes, Wirecard\u2019s main business in India. And the entity\u2019s CFO, appointed only months before, submitted a disclaimer to the Hermes board that he \u201cshould not be held in any way responsible\u201d for many of the documents relating to the 2016 audit, due to his recent arrival. EY eventually signed off on the revenues Wirecard reported.\n\nThe clean audit in early 2017 helped to reassure investors. Wirecard\u2019s share price proceeded to quadruple, amid global enthusiasm for fintech companies.\n\nYet some of the documentary evidence placed in front of R&T, and since seen by the FT, raises fresh questions about the scope of accounting irregularities and the authority extended to the young book-keeper in Singapore.\n\nIndeed, a central question remains. What did management in Munich know about Mr Kurniawan\u2019s activities, and what should it have known?\n\nA February 15 2018 email chain indicates that some in Germany were at least made aware of a version of the round-trip scheme Mr Kurniawan had sketched on the whiteboard weeks earlier. Documents show that Mr Holten, whose signature was needed to authorise payments from head office, wrote: \u201cI need to know the whole cash flow.\u201d\n\nMr Kurniawan replied 13 minutes later with a plan to move \u20ac2m into India, via Wirecard Hong Kong and an outside entity. \u201cHope it\u2019s clear?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cVery good, thx,\u201d Mr Holten replied. Copied into the email was Mr von Erffa, whose signature would also be required.\n\nWhen the FT broke news of the investigation last week, Mr Kurniawan was still head of international finance and his alleged accomplices were still employed. The company on Wednesday said certain individuals had been temporarily assigned to other roles, pending the outcome of the probe, and any disciplinary action would be determined by the evidence.\n\nWirecard also said there had been significant developments and substantial new information taken into account since R&T\u2019s preliminary report.\n\nA whistleblower, who initially approached the FT due to the apparent lack of action, this week said: \u201cIf a payments company can do this, how can you have trust in the system?\u201d"

    "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nThe Bank of England has retreated from plans for multiple interest rate rises as it sharply downgraded its economic outlook amid mounting Brexit uncertainty and slowing global growth.\n\nIn one of the largest near-term forecast revisions since the 2016 EU referendum, the central bank cut its forecast for UK growth to 1.2 per cent in 2019, the weakest level since the recession of 2009. As recently as November, the bank had expected 1.7 per cent growth this year.\n\nThe statement initially sent sterling sinking to a low of the day, but it recovered in afternoon trading as markets saw the BoE\u2019s statements and forecasts as a holding statement until greater clarity on Brexit emerged.\n\nThe BoE\u2019s forecasts and governor Mark Carney\u2019s commentary was significantly more downbeat on the economy than economists expected. It allied the central bank with its counterparts in the US, India, Australia and Canada who have all stepped back from plans for tighter monetary policy and highlighted concerns about the economic outlook.\n\nThe BoE\u2019s central forecast is for the UK to avoid a recession, but with only 0.2 per cent growth forecast for each of the first two quarters of the year, half the rate it previously thought.\n\nIt forecast a significantly higher chance of Britain sliding into recession this year, putting the odds at one in four that the UK\u2019s annual growth rate will have dipped below zero by the summer even assuming a \u201csmooth\u201d Brexit process.\n\nMr Carney said this risk of recession would rise significantly if Britain left the EU in March without a deal and with no transition arrangements. \u201cWhen the economy is growing more slowly, the probability of having a negative quarter or two goes up . . . and if there is a shock \u2014 a no-deal, no-transition Brexit would be a shock \u2014 that further increases the possibility of negative quarters,\u201d he said.\n\nMuch of the BoE\u2019s gloom stemmed from much weaker business investment that the bank had been expecting. Officials blamed \u201csofter activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home\u201d for the forecast downgrades and the more dovish attitude to interest rates.\n\nThe BoE expects business investment to drop 2.75 per cent this year, having previously expected growth, blaming Brexit uncertainty, which has led \u201caround half\u201d of the companies surveyed by the central bank to implement contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit without any transition at the end of March.\n\nThese forecasts would be significantly worse if Britain left the EU abruptly next month. \u201cThe economy as a whole is still not yet prepared for a no deal, no transition exit,\u201d Mr Carney said. He added that there were now signs that in addition to companies holding back on investment and there were signs that the caution was spreading to households.\n\n\u201cIndicators suggest spending growth has been modest since the start of the year,\u201d the governor said.\n\nIn the face of the significantly weaker outlook, the Monetary Policy Committee indicated it was much less likely to raise interest rates. It voted unanimously to hold the benchmark rate at 0.75 per cent in the February meeting.\n\nThe committee\u2019s forecasts showed little concern about rising inflation even if it kept rates on hold for the next three years. They illustrated that policymakers thought there was only a 56 per cent probability that inflation would exceed the BoE\u2019s 2 per cent target after two years if it left rates unchanged with a weaker inflation profiles than in the November forecasts.\n\nDavid Page, senior economist at Axa Investment Managers, said the new forecasts \u201csuggest the BoE will be in no hurry to raise rates\u201d.\n\nAndrew Goodwin, associate director of Oxford Economics, said \u201cthe sands do now seem to be shifting\u201d on the MPC\u2019s hawkish rhetoric even though the committee decided to repeat its rhetoric that there would be \u201climited\u201d and \u201cgradual\u201d interest rate rises to come.\n\nThe forecasts suggest the MPC believes that at most a one quarter-point interest rate rise is required over the next three years to keep inflation under control\n\nAllan Monks of JPMorgan was one of a number of City economists to push back previous forecasts of the next quarter-point rate rise from May to August and acknowledged \u201cthe risks around this are still skewed towards a later tightening\u201d.\n\nOn financial markets, traders who make markets on future interest rates on a new CME market predicting BoE actions now think it is more likely than not that the central bank will not raise rates at all this year.\n\nHighlighting internal worries about the accuracy of its forecasts, BoE staff published alternative scenarios for the economy on the basis that uncertainty over Brexit became even more acute and subsided faster than it expected.\n\nThey showed that if uncertainty grew over the Brexit outcome, growth would be significantly weaker by up to 1.5 per cent over three years, but if uncertainty could be resolved quicker than it currently expects, there could be an equivalent dividend, alongside higher inflation and interest rates."
