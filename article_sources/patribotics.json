But that is not true. The AG cannot comment on a sealed indictment that is pending. It is sealed. He cannot comment on pending cases, or prejudice a jury.

    "text": "What if Bill Barr\u2019s notification letter summarizing the Mueller Report was not terrible news for America, but actually was brilliant, glorious and exciting?\n\nHere is page 2 of Barr\u2019s letter. Now here is why I think it is actually wonderful.\n\n\u201cDuring the course of his investigation, the Special Counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action.\u201d\n\nThat line confirms our report of yesterday \u2013 Mueller handed off prosecutions to main Justice divisions as he went along.\n\n2. \u201cThe report does not recommend any further indictments, nor did the Special Counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public.\u201d\n\nThat is entirely compatible with dozens of sealed indictments sitting at the branches of main Justice, sealed indictments obtained as Mueller went along, referring out his cases.\n\nNext, in a section which describes how Mueller defines collusion with Russia, we have these sentences.\n\n3. \u201cThe report further explains that a primary consideration for the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation was whether any Americans \u2014 including individuals associated with the Trump campaign \u2014 joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election, which would be a federal crime. The Special Counsel\u2019s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As the report states: \u201c[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d\n\nNow, here is where I think the letter actually gets brilliant. AG Barr points out that any American joining in the Russian conspiracies would be committing a federal crime. And what do people who have committed crimes have the right to?\n\nWhy, fair trials \u2013 and due process. You see, I believe that this means Mueller\u2019s report will lay out the evidence he has found, or some of it, and then state that he has referred the criminal matters for trial.\n\nBarr\u2019s letter carefully states that \u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s office did not find\u201d\u2026. and Mueller uses the even more careful words \u201cThe investigation did not establish\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cEstablish\u201d is a nice legal word. It means, in this context, \u201cprove definitively\u201d. And of course Mueller could not in fact \u201cestablish\u201d this \u2013 he could not \u201cfind\u201d this \u2013 because that is the job of a jury!\n\nPatribotics is grateful to our readers, who make this reporting possible. Your support helps hold Donald Trump to account. Please consider a donation here\n\n\n\nHow could Mueller say Donald J Trump Jr committed treason when the man hasn\u2019t even seen the inside of a courtroom? In fact, were Mueller to say anything of the sort, the defense could claim their trials were prejudiced! Mueller\u2019s conclusions before a trial would be a functional grant of immunity!\n\n4. \u201cAs noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities.\u201d\n\nAgain, all that is happening here is Barr is telling Americans what categories of crimes the probe is going charge these domestic traitors with. The Special Counsel indicted Russians who will never see an American courtroom, to serve his overall investigation; note the \u201cdid not find that any U.S. person\u201d \u2013 because a U.S. person, (such as this reporter) is entitled to a fair trial. It is not for Mueller to \u201cfind\u201d they conspired before a jury of their peers does the same.\n\n5. \u201cThe second element involved the Russian government\u2019s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election. The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons associated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for the purposes of influencing the election. But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nIf you are reading the tea leaves the way I am, this is the paragraph you love most of all. From here we lack the generic \u201cUS persons\u201d that might describe somebody outside the Trump campaign, like Cassandra Fairbanks. This paragraph on hacking is limited in it\u2019s \u201cdid not find\u201d to the Trump campaign and associates. If I am correct, that means that Mueller will allege, but will not \u201cfind\u201d, the actual Trump campaign helped Russia hack the DNC and worked with Wikileaks.\n\nThen there is the boring bit on obstruction, which I will leave to others to analyze and debate. Sometimes it is good that a journalist should be somewhat of an ornery person. Tonight, on March 24th, I write this blog knowing that the entire American press corps takes a different view. And it is certainly possible \u2013 it is statistically probable \u2013 that they are right. But grammatically, they are not right.\n\nIn fact, the report neither found, nor declared. any such thing\n\nMueller Report didn\u2019t say that\n\n\u201cReport declares Trump didn\u2019t coordinate\u201d \u201cMueller finds no conspiracy\u201d \u201cMueller report says no collusion\u201d \u2013 all of those characterizations are flat wrong. What the letter says is a negative, not a positive. Mueller\u2019s report does not find a crime of collusion, does not establish Trump campaign personnel joining with Russians; Mueller did not find that Trump\u2019s campaign staff helped Russia and Wikileaks hack. At the risk of sound like your second grade English teacher, \u201cdid not establish conspiracy\u201d is not the same as \u201cestablished there was no conspiracy\u201d; \u201cdid not find collusion\u201d is not the same as \u201cfound no collusion\u201d.\n\nAm I parsing words? No. I\u2019m not. Because \u201cfound no collusion\u201d means Mueller declared the President innocent. \u201cDid not find collusion\u201d means, in my opinion, that Bob Mueller is likely to deliver a report like an Exocet missile, a report that reads like an indictment \u2013 and an indictment is not a conviction. At the same time, the prosecutions sent out to main US attorney\u2019s offices will start to be revealed. Because, as Tom Cruise says of Jack Nicholson at the end of \u201cA Few Good Men\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe witness has rights\u201d.\n\nAnd the much reviled Bill Barr, along with Rod Rosenstein, drafted a letter that, over and over, emphasized that Mueller had not found, established, or proved, guilt. Because to say otherwise would be to prejudice the trials of the loathsome batch of traitors who are laughing tonight, as I write this piece, but whom, I hope and expect, will be crying tomorrow \u2013 or on one tomorrow in the very near future.\n\nUpdate: an eagle-eyed reader spots an important footnote that confirms that the report contains Grand Jury material that needs redacting:\n\n\"matter(s) occurring before (a) grand jury.\" Right in the summary. pic.twitter.com/4yAyyXg23O \u2014 Glenn Griffin (@GlennGriffin8) March 25, 2019\n\nIf you enjoy our reporting, please consider a donation.

AG Barr points out that any American joining in the Russian conspiracies would be committing a federal crime. And what do people who have committed crimes have the right to?\n\nWhy, fair trials \u2013 and due process. You see, I believe that this means Mueller\u2019s report will lay out the evidence he has found, or some of it, and then state that he has referred the criminal matters for trial.\n\nBarr\u2019s letter carefully states that \u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s office did not find\u201d\u2026. and Mueller uses the even more careful words \u201cThe investigation did not establish\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cEstablish\u201d is a nice legal word. It means, in this context, \u201cprove definitively\u201d. And of course Mueller could not in fact \u201cestablish\u201d this \u2013 he could not \u201cfind\u201d this \u2013 because that is the job of a jury!\n\nPatribotics is grateful to our readers, who make this reporting possible.

In fact, were Mueller to say anything of the sort, the defense could claim their trials were prejudiced! Mueller\u2019s conclusions before a trial would be a functional grant of immunity!\n\n4. \u201cAs noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities.\u201d\n\nAgain, all that is happening here is Barr is telling Americans what categories of crimes the probe is going charge these domestic traitors with. The Special Counsel indicted Russians who will never see an American courtroom, to serve his overall investigation; note the \u201cdid not find that any U.S. person\u201d \u2013 because a U.S. person, (such as this reporter) is entitled to a fair trial. It is not for Mueller to \u201cfind\u201d they conspired before a jury of their peers does the same.\n\n5. \u201cThe second element involved the Russian government\u2019s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election. The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons associated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for the purposes of influencing the election. But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nIf you are reading the tea leaves the way I am, this is the paragraph you love most of all. From here we lack the generic \u201cUS persons\u201d that might describe somebody outside the Trump campaign, like Cassandra Fairbanks. This paragraph on hacking is limited in it\u2019s \u201cdid not find\u201d to the Trump campaign and associates. If I am correct, that means that Mueller will allege, but will not \u201cfind\u201d, the actual Trump campaign helped Russia hack the DNC and worked with Wikileaks.\n\nThen there is the boring bit on obstruction, which I will leave to others to analyze and debate. Sometimes it is good that a journalist should be somewhat of an ornery person. Tonight, on March 24th, I write this blog knowing that the entire American press corps takes a different view. And it is certainly possible \u2013 it is statistically probable \u2013 that they are right. But grammatically, they are not right.\n\nIn fact, the report neither found, nor declared. any such thing\n\nMueller Report didn\u2019t say that\n\n\u201cReport declares Trump didn\u2019t coordinate\u201d \u201cMueller finds no conspiracy\u201d \u201cMueller report says no collusion\u201d \u2013 all of those characterizations are flat wrong. What the letter says is a negative, not a positive. Mueller\u2019s report does not find a crime of collusion, does not establish Trump campaign personnel joining with Russians; Mueller did not find that Trump\u2019s campaign staff helped Russia and Wikileaks hack. At the risk of sound like your second grade English teacher, \u201cdid not establish conspiracy\u201d is not the same as \u201cestablished there was no conspiracy\u201d; \u201cdid not find collusion\u201d is not the same as \u201cfound no collusion\u201d.\n\nAm I parsing words? No. I\u2019m not. Because \u201cfound no collusion\u201d means Mueller declared the President innocent. \u201cDid not find collusion\u201d means, in my opinion, that Bob Mueller is likely to deliver a report like an Exocet missile, a report that reads like an indictment \u2013 and an indictment is not a conviction. At the same time, the prosecutions sent out to main US attorney\u2019s offices will start to be revealed. Because, as Tom Cruise says of Jack Nicholson at the end of \u201cA Few Good Men\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe witness has rights\u201d.\n\nAnd the much reviled Bill Barr, along with Rod Rosenstein, drafted a letter that, over and over, emphasized that Mueller had not found, established, or proved, guilt. Because to say otherwise would be to prejudice the trials of the loathsome batch of traitors who are laughing tonight, as I write this piece, but whom, I hope and expect, will be crying tomorrow \u2013 or on one tomorrow in the very near future.\n\nUpdate: an eagle-eyed reader spots an important footnote that confirms that the report contains Grand Jury material that needs redacting:\n\n\"matter(s) occurring before (a) grand jury.\" Right in the summary. pic.twitter.com/4yAyyXg23O \u2014 Glenn Griffin (@GlennGriffin8) March 25, 2019\n\nIf you enjoy our reporting, please consider a donation.

Trump fans gleefully noted that they were vindicated, and so, with barely-concealed glee, did national news reporters who had, throughout, downplayed the significance of what Donald Trump and his team did to collude with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nA \u2018senior Justice official\u2019 \u2013 in all likelihood Bob Barr\u2019s spokesperson \u2013 then briefed to all news channels that there were no further \u2018Mueller led indictments\u2019 coming, whether sealed or unsealed. This blog reported exclusively, in late 2017, that Mueller had \u2018dozens of sealed indictments\u2018 and we included those obtained by offices of the DOJ other than his own. Several months later, senior NSA veteran and national security journalist John Schindler echoed this reporting from his own sources. The mainstream press, and various citizen journalists on Twitter, all crowed that we were wrong. The lack of \u2018Mueller led indictments\u2019 and the winding up of the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, the message came, meant that Donald Trump was in the clear on the main issue Mueller was hired to investigate \u2013 collusion between his campaign and the Russians. Oh, sure, there were odds and ends at other courts, and some of his existing cases would be handed off, but there would be no new indictments \u2013 and nothing on the substance.\n\nBut there is no reason to suppose that this \u2018take\u2019 \u2013 near universal among American journalists \u2013 is accurate. In fact, I believe it to be demonstrably false. Making predictions when we are close to the revelation of the Mueller report is a risky business; but some risks are worth taking. Here\u2019s our breakdown. Oh, and if you find our journalism worthwhile, please consider a donation \u2013 we rely wholly on reader support, as this platform\u2019s advertising package mandates including Yandex, the Russian ad website that was involved in attacking the election.\n\nMueller Farmed Out His Cases\n\n\u201cNo new Mueller-led indictments\u201d is undoubtedly true, if Barr\u2019s office says so. However, the crucial mistake the media made is to equate that with \u201cno new indictments\u201d. The record factually shows that Mr. Mueller had joint prosecutions with offices of \u2018main Justice\u2019, and that he referred, for indictment, cases out to other federal prosecutors. There is sometimes confusion as to whether we mean the fall-back position of state prosecutions, which Trump cannot pardon. We don\u2019t. In the case of Michael Cohen, Mueller referred it to SDNY (the federal court). In the case of Rick Gates, Mueller signed the indictment but the case is at the District of Columbia. Ditto with Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik. Because Manafort refused to waive venues, he had two trials, one at the Eastern District of Virginia, again signed by the Special Counsel.\n\nNow, all these trials were \u2018Mueller led\u2019. Mueller himself signed the indictments. But they all have something in common, too. None of them indict a US person for any crimes arising from collusion with the Russian government. The trials of Paul Manafort, the conviction of Gates, arose from crimes he committed by colluding with the Ukranian government when it was run by a Russia-friendly puppet.\n\nRod Rosenstein\u2019s letter authorizing Mueller as Special Counsel is explicit that he is taking over the FBI probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, including whether any members of the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian state. He is authorized, but not mandated, to bring Federal Prosecutions on matters arising from this investigation. And Mueller indicted a number of Russian entities for attacking the election, including entire military units of the GRU, as well as trolls and their handling organizations included, but not limited to, the Internet Research Agency. Mueller has not considered it \u201cappropriate and necessary\u201d to bring, himself, prosecutions against Americans involved in this matter, although there are plenty of redacted references to Americans in the indictments.\n\nThe media has taken this to mean that if Mueller did not personally bring or seal the indictments on Trump-Russia related offenses, they do not exist.\n\nBut that is wrong.\n\nComey: \u2018Main Justice\u2019 Offices Would Still Prosecute Under a Special Counsel\n\nMueller was taking over the FBI investigation. And the FBI investigation was bringing its prosecutions to prosecutors at main divisions of the Federal Courts. In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey said:\n\nHIRONO: So in the investigations that you\u2019re currently doing on the Russian interference and the Trump team\u2019s relationship, are you coordinating with any U.S. attorney\u2019s office in these investigations? COMEY: Yes, well \u2014 two sets of prosecutors, the Main Justice the National Security Division and the Eastern District of Virginia U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\n\nNow, here is Comey\u2019s really important answer, for the present circumstance. He is asked if a Special Counsel is appointed, would the FBI end its work with these career prosecutors and simply transfer everything to his office?\n\nHIRONO: So should the A.G. decide to go with this special prosecutor, then you would end your engagement with these other two entities and work with the DOJ special prosecutor? COMEY: Well, I could \u2014 yes, potentially or it could be that in some circumstances, an attorney general will appoint someone else to oversee it and you keep the career level prosecutive team. And so to the prosecutors and the agents, there\u2019s no change except the boss is different\n\nComey corrects Senator Hirono here, saying that the Special Counsel would oversee the prosecutions, in such a circumstance, but that the ordinary, main Justice prosecuting offices \u2013 the career prosecutors \u2013 would continue to work the cases, as would the FBI agents on those cases, but they would report to the Special Counsel rather than to the FBI Director.\n\nThat means that Bob Mueller took over cases from Comey that were at the National Security Division of \u2018main Justice\u2019 and the Eastern District of Virginia. It also means that ordinary Federal Offices would continue to prosecute under the Special Counsel as \u2018boss\u2019, \u2018overseeing\u2019 the work. In other words, the idea that only cases with \u2018Robert Mueller\u2019 as signatory on the indictment sheet fall under Mueller\u2019s investigation is wrong.\n\nMueller\u2019s Mandate: To Investigate, Not to Prosecute\n\nRosenstein\u2019s letter uses the word \u201cauthorized\u201d both for \u2018investigate\u2019 and \u2018prosecute\u2019. But the eye might slide past the title of his letter, and it should not:\n\nAPPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE WITH THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND RELATED MATTERS\n\nThe special counsel is not merely authorized to investigate, he is mandated, or appointed, to do so. Mueller must investigate. That is what Rosenstein appointed him to do. Rosenstein did not order him to prosecute, and certainly not to prosecute directly. Therefore, if Mueller found, or if he took over cases that were already advanced under Jim Comey \u2013 it has been my reporting that all three of Trump\u2019s eldest children will be indicted, and I can report today that on Eric Trump and Donald J Trump Jr, Mr. Comey was already close to an indictment for both of them before he was fired \u2013 there was no requirement for Mueller himself to bring those cases. In that he took over Comey\u2019s investigation, Mueller necessarily took over cases which, Comey testified, were already being worked on in two main Federal offices.\n\nMueller Has Effectively Told Us That Trump Russia Cases Are With Other Federal Offices\n\nRick Gates continues to cooperate with other federal prosecutors. Mueller\u2019s heavily-redacted case filings show us this, as a fact.\n\n\u201cThe status of this matter has not changed substantially since the January report, as defendant Gates continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations, and accordingly the parties do not believe it is appropriate to commence the sentencing process at this time,\u201d they wrote in a one-page update for U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District. The investigations were not described.\n\n\n\nClearly, then, the other investigations are not with the Special Counsel, and they are sealed. If they do not relate to Trump and Russia, why are they sealed?\n\nThe same report refers to Mike Flynn and Bijan Kian\u2019s indictment for attempting to kidnap a US person. Federal prosecutors are fighting discovery requests, calling them \u201csensitive\u201d and referring to \u201cother investigations\u201d \u2013 again, clearly sealed, and clearly not with Mueller\u2019s office \u2013 where disclosure could be harmful.\n\nBut during a Friday hearing in Alexandria federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney James P. Gillis resisted handing over some \u201csensitive\u201d documents to Kian\u2019s attorneys, saying \u201cthere are other investigations that would or could be hampered by disclosure of unfettered information.\u201d\n\nIn short, it could easily be that the vast majority of the sealed indictments that exist were obtained under Director Comey, or even in the interregnum week after Comey was fired and before Mueller was appointed.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt is this reporter\u2019s firm belief that Mueller has dozens of sealed indictments under his belt, at other offices. His report had to be presented to the Justice Department, and to Congress. The main question of whether the Trump campaign\u2019s members colluded would have required all related cases to be brought under seal; if indictments were revealed before Mueller\u2019s report was delivered, partial information about one suspect or another suspect would have disclosed Mueller\u2019s conclusions before Congress and Justice got to see them. Furthermore, later today we expect some kind of brief executive summary will go to Congress. I do not expect we will see an accompanying unsealing of indictments, although it is possible. Mueller and Barr are likely to believe that Congress must have a chance to digest the report, and levels of classified and unclassified release must be worked out, first. Indictments released piecemeal, or in advance of this, would reveal information too early.\n\nI therefore theorize that after the full report, or a version thereof, is released and digested by Congress, and after a declassified version is made available to the American people, that we will see the unsealing of indictments on the main question. That process may take two weeks; it may take a month. But one way or another, the end is in sight.\n\nPatribotics is grateful to our readers, who make this reporting possible.

    "text": "When Mr. Barr was briefed on the investigation this month, he was told that there would be no more subpoenas or indictments, and that Mr. Mueller\u2019s team was ready to wrap up in mid-March, according to people familiar with the investigation who were not authorized to discuss it. The special counsel\u2019s office later notified Mr. Barr that it needed a few additional days to take care of administrative issues, which pushed the delivery to Friday.\n\nWithout certainty about what Mr. Barr would disclose or when, House Democrats convened a 30-minute conference call on Saturday afternoon to line up talking points. Democrats led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have begun insisting that only the release of Mr. Mueller\u2019s full report and underlying findings will be sufficient so that Democrat-led House committees can conduct their own scrutiny of Mr. Trump.\n\nThe top Democrats on nearly a dozen House and Senate committees sent letters on Friday to the F.B.I., the Justice Department, the White House and other federal agencies demanding that all documents, communication and evidence amassed by Mr. Mueller and his team be preserved because Congress might request access to it.\n\n\u201cCongress requires the full report and the underlying documents so that the committees can proceed with their independent work, including oversight and legislating to address any issues the Mueller report may raise,\u201d Ms. Pelosi wrote in a letter to fellow Democrats before the call.\n\nDuring the call, she added that she would reject any offer from the Justice Department to brief the bipartisan Gang of Eight House and Senate leaders or some other configuration of lawmakers in a classified setting on findings that are not made public, according to a person present. Ms. Pelosi said she would insist any briefing be unclassified to allow lawmakers to discuss the full investigative findings publicly.\n\nRepublican leaders convened their own brief call on Friday night, after the Justice Department notified Congress that it had received the report from Mr. Mueller\u2019s office, but it was primarily limited to logistics, according to one person with knowledge of the call. Welcoming the news that the special counsel would seek no further indictments, members of the president\u2019s party were cautiously optimistic.\n\nThe Republican National Committee circulated talking points to allies on Friday that emphasized Mr. Trump\u2019s cooperation with the inquiry and appeared to set the stage for the president and his party to claim political victory. They asserted that \u201cspeculation\u201d about interference with the investigation had been proved \u201cdead wrong.\u201d"

If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nThe Mueller report has finally been delivered, and it seems the mainstream media is getting the Trump Russia story as wrong at the end as it did in the beginning. There was a surge of rejoicing from both overt Trump supporters, and journalists in the mainstream media who have always been keen to play down the consequences to Trump and his co-conspirators. A carefully-worded statement by the Office of the Special Counsel was, I believe, widely misinterpreted to mean that no more indictments would be coming on Russia and collusion.\n\nChairman @RepAdamSchiff says more indictments \"likely\" \u2013 whether \"on the core issues of potential conspiracy\" or \"peripheral\" is \"yet to be determined\" #MuellerReport pic.twitter.com/rilGPSy66M \u2014 Patribotics (@patribotics) March 23, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ll know more in the next few days. But this short piece stands to correct a significant misstatement by Ken Dilanian, a national security reporter at MSNBC. Mr. Dilanian falsely reported that even though Adam Schiff, the Chairman of the House Select Committee on intelligence, had said there might be more indictments, he\u2019d also admitted these \u201ccould not be on the the Russian collusion questions Mueller was hired to answer. It\u2019s important to be straight about this.\u201d\n\nThat was wrong. Rep. Schiff said exactly the opposite; more indictments were \u201clikely\u201d and they could be \u201ccentral\u201d to the \u201ccore issues of conspiracy\u201d, or not; that was \u201cyet to be determined\u201d. (Eagle-eyed grammar aficionados will note Schiff used \u2018yet to be determined\u2019 over whether more indictments were \u2018peripheral or central\u2019 \u2013 not over whether they would happen; he called that \u201clikely\u201d.\n\nBut not on the Russia collusion questions Robert Mueller was hired to answer. It\u2019s important to be straight about this. https://t.co/RsXCKXN6jg \u2014 Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) March 22, 2019 Narrator: Ken Dilanian was not being straight about this\n\nHere\u2019s the transcript of what Chairman Schiff said:\n\nRep. Schiff: \u201cWell, what it means is that the Office of the Special Counsel, which is essentially a contract attorney to the Justice Department, that that Office won\u2019t be bringing any further indictments. It doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that main Justice, or the Southern District of New York US Attorney\u2019s office, or the Eastern District or others may not bring indictments; in fact, given the lengthy redactions in many of the pleadings of the Special Counsel alluding to other investigations, I think it\u2019s entirely possible, if not likely, that there will be other indictments. Now how central or peripheral they\u2019ll be to the core issues of potential conspiracy is yet to be determined.\u201d Narrator: Adam Schiff explicitly stated new indictments could cover \u201cthe Russia collusion questions Mueller was hired to answer\u201d\n\nSince Trump Russia, the story whereby a President of the United States was elected to office with the help of a hostile power, is the single most important story since World War Two, it is vital that correspondents on a trusted news channels tell the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be straight about this,\u201d to coin a phrase.\n\nTwo other senior Democratic lawmakers also stated that they believed new indictments could be revealed. Rep. David Cicilline said \u201cIt certainly sounds like Mueller\u2019s going to tell us who\u2019s been indicted and who hasn\u2019t,\u201d using the future tense. An even more exuberant Senator Richard Blumenthal, of the Senate Judiciary committee, said that more indictments were very likely \u2013 featuring the President\u2019s family, as I reported in a world exclusive two weeks ago.\n\nRichard Blumenthal, referencing other investigations by SDNY, etc., tells @MSNBC that \"there's a high likelihood that there are indictments in this president's future.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think there's a strong possibility of additional indictments, including the president's family.\" \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 22, 2019\n\nIf you like our work at Patribotics, please consider a donation \u2013 we need your help to keep going!"

    "text": "U.S. Congressman John Rutherford on Thursday sided with departed Sen. John McCain over President Donald Trump after recent comments.\n\nOne day earlier, the President lamented in a speech that he \u201cdidn\u2019t get a thank you\u201d from McCain after having \u201cgiven him the funeral he wanted.\u201d\n\nExcoriation for the President\u2019s comments has come from surprising quarters, including Republican Senators.\n\nRutherford has aligned with the President on most issues, but broke with Trump regarding the late Arizona Senator.\n\n\u201cSen. McCain was a war hero. I\u2019m not going to, particularly now that the man has passed, address issues of his politics. But as a man, I\u2019m very proud of his service,\u201d Rutherford said.\n\nThe Congressman suggested that a root of the Trump/McCain animus was that the Christopher Steele dossier on the President was \u201cdelivered to the FBI by John McCain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether he knew the dossier was not factual or not,\u201d Rutherford said, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cMcCain delivered that to the FBI without vetting it,\u201d Rutherford added.\n\nTrump\u2019s animosity to McCain predates the dubious dossier. As far back as 2015, the President lambasted McCain as a \u201closer,\u201d questioning how he could be a \u201cwar hero\u201d given that he was \u201ccaptured.\u201d\n\nHowever, revelations that McCain leaked the documents did irk the President anew.\n\nSo it was indeed (just proven in court papers) \u201clast in his class\u201d (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election. He & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2019\n\n\u201cSo it was indeed (just proven in court papers) \u2018last in his class\u2019 (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday. \u201cHe & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!\u201d\n\nThe Congressman, meanwhile, is \u201cvery confident\u201d in the Robert Mueller investigation of the President, with trust both for Mueller and new Attorney General William Barr.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident they are going to find justice in this case,\u201d Rutherford said, including \u201cgoing back and looking at the misdeeds of this cabal at the top of the FBI and the AG.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of issues \u2026 it looked like a bloodless coup. First they were going to prevent him from becoming President, then when he became President they moved to take them out,\u201d Rutherford said, \u201cand whatever comes out, comes out.\u201d\n\nRutherford maintained that he is \u201cnot concerned\u201d about the ongoing investigation previously.\n\nRutherford was in Jacksonville to highlight the return of a bill that would help veterans return to the workforce.\n\nThe Veterans Armed for Success Act, which passed the House last year, creates a $10 million grant matching program for organizations, such as Operation New Uniform in Jacksonville, that provide job readiness for veterans and their spouses.\n\nU.S. Congressman Al Lawson co-introduced the bill. Also co-sponsoring: Republicans Mike Waltz and Ted Yoho.\n\nThe bill ran out of time in the Senate, Rutherford said, but he\u2019s determined for that not to happen again.\n\nHe is hopeful that Sen. Rick Scott will carry the legislation."

The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:35 a.m., in room SD-562, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Susan M. Collins, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Collins, Lieberman, Akaka, and Lautenberg. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN COLLINS Chairman Collins. The Committee will come to order. Good morning. During the past 2 years, this Committee has held three hearings to investigate terrorism financing. From the flow of money through certain Islamic charities in this country to terrorist organizations around the world, to the role played by Saudi Arabia, described to this Committee as the epicenter of terrorism financing, we have learned much about this complex and murky subject. Today, we explore another aspect of the shadowy world of terrorism financing. The theft of intellectual property rights through counterfeiting and pirating of consumer goods is a huge and growing criminal enterprise. It is estimated that counterfeit merchandise accounts for between 5 and 7 percent of all the goods moved in world trade. According to Interpol, this counterfeit merchandise is worth approximately $450 billion annually. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, American businesses lose as much as $250 billion each year to counterfeiters. The U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection seized about $138 million in fake goods in 2004, compared with $94 million in 2003. Compact disks, computer software, sneakers, golf clubs, perfume, soft drinks, baby food, electronics, auto parts, name the product and someone is selling a bogus or pirated version on a street corner in some American city, and as you can see, we have an array of counterfeit merchandise that has been seized in various raids that is displayed on the table. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, counterfeit goods are knock-offs or look-alikes of brand-name products, such as this counterfeit Gucci watch. Goods are referred to as pirated when criminals steal and sell the content of a legitimate product, such as the latest Star Wars movie, already out in pirated version, and copy it illegally without the permission of its owner. Both kinds of illegal goods are often referred to as counterfeit. Combine counterfeiting's high profits with the uninformed notion that the purchase of a knockoff designer handbag, a fake wristwatch, or a pirated DVD is a victimless crime and it is no surprise that the trade in counterfeit goods is extremely lucrative. This criminal activity has damaging consequences for our economy and for honest businesses and their employees. Moreover, given the evidence that terrorists are engaging in counterfeiting to secure money to support their operations, the potential consequences are far more dire than economic damage. The unclassified evidence linking terrorism and counterfeiting is compelling and it spans several agencies and years. For example, in a 2002 advisory entitled, ``Financing Terror: Profits from Counterfeit Goods Pay for Attacks,'' the Customs Service warned of an increasingly close connection between transnational crime and terrorism with the profits from counterfeit and pirated goods being the strongest link. In 2003, the Secretary General of Interpol testified before Congress that intellectual property crime, the pirating of such products as software, CDs, and DVDs, is becoming the preferred method of funding for a number of terrorist organizations. He cited direct and indirect connections between counterfeiting and Hezbollah, the Chechen rebels, extremist groups in Kosovo, and al Qaeda, among others. Also in 2003, the Terrorist Financing Operations Section of the FBI provided a document to the Committee stating that the sale of counterfeit goods is among the ways in which Hezbollah finances its terrorist activities, and we have a graphic that takes information from this FBI report. In its 2004 report, ``Patterns of Global Terrorism,'' the State Department wrote that the tri-border region of South America, Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, is a regional hub for Hezbollah and Hamas fundraising activities, including the manufacture and movement of pirated goods. In January of this year, the International Anti- Counterfeiting Coalition stated that there is ample evidence to confirm that terrorist organizations are profiting from the manufacture and sale of counterfeit and pirated goods. In addition to the high profits, there is another reason that terrorists have turned to this method of financing. The United States and our allies around the world have made some significant progress in shutting off the flow of terrorist money through established mechanisms and institutions. These concerted efforts are making a difference. But we know that terrorists are nothing if not resourceful and determined. When we shut off one avenue of financing, they find another. This point was made well recently by Treasury's Under Secretary Stuart Levy when he said, ``We have indications that terrorist groups like al Qaeda and Hamas are feeling the pressure and are hurting for money. We are also seeing terrorist groups avoiding formal financing channels and instead resorting to riskier and more cumbersome financial conduits, like bulk cash smuggling. One rich source of bulk cash is the sale of counterfeit consumer products.'' Finally, I would note that the focus to date by this Committee on its hearings, as well as by our government and our allies, has been on high-level terrorist financing, for example, by multi-million-dollar charities and foundations, by entities linked to Saudi Arabia, and by Iran. That certainly is appropriate and it is where the primary focus should be. But we know that terrorism is also funded by street crime. There are many examples of this. Ahmed Ressam, the Millennium bomber, funded his activities by stealing tourists' suitcases in hotels and by credit card fraud. In testimony before this Committee last June, the former general counsel at the Department of Treasury noted that the Madrid train bombers were financed through criminal activity, including drug dealing. We also know that it does not take a large sum of money to commit a devastating terrorist attack. After all, the organizing, planning, and training for September 11 cost only an estimated $500,000, a sum easily generated by criminal activity such as counterfeiting. The purpose of this hearing is to focus much-needed attention on what appears to be a fertile and growing source of financing for terrorists. It is my hope that this attention will lead consumers to reject these low-cost street corner bargains because, in fact, they carry a terrible price. It is my expectation that this attention will lead to increased efforts by our government and our allies to close off this rich avenue of terrorist financing. Senator Lieberman. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LIEBERMAN Senator Lieberman. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. Thanks so much for calling this hearing today on a problem that deserves far greater recognition than it has yet received. Over the years, we have obviously heard much and tried to do much about the counterfeiting of consumer goods and the economic losses suffered by manufacturers whose popular CDs or designer jeans are counterfeited for mass sale around the globe. I want to compliment you, Madam Chairman. I just heard yesterday that ``Return of the Sith'' was already selling on the streets of Beijing, and here you have already got one, I see. Very impressive. [Laughter.] But today, obviously, we are going to look at counterfeit goods from a different perspective, from a national security perspective, which adds, of course, a new and critical dimension to the urgency of curtailing this illicit activity, counterfeiting. The experts estimate that as much as 7 percent of world trade is involved with the sale of counterfeit goods. That amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars a year that eat away at the income of American manufacturers and workers, but counterfeiting is obviously more than just a bunch of people hustling for a few extra bucks, a victimless crime. It has become a major source of income for organized crime and, as we shall hear today, for terrorists because of its low risks and high rewards. In other words, the risk of getting caught and the penalties if you are caught are minimal, while the potential for making money is maximal. There is a recently published book which was called Lightning Out of Lebanon, which details a notorious North Carolina case a few years ago that implicated Hezbollah, the terrorist organization, in counterfeiting here in the United States to support their activities in the Middle East. One of our witnesses here today, former FBI analyst Matthew Levitt, worked with the authors of the book and I look forward to hearing about his work in that area. Madam Chairman, as you well know, 3 years ago, in the context of another investigation by this Committee, the Terrorist Financing Operations Section of the FBI provided an unclassified document to the Committee that listed the sale of counterfeited goods among various criminal activities the terrorist organization Hezbollah uses to raise cash in the United States. This evidence puts the lie to what I think is that commonly held belief that trade of counterfeit goods is a victimless crime. If anybody suffers, it is only a couple of big people at the top of the corporations. That is not true. Certainly, it has never been true. But as the evidence strongly suggests that we will hear today, profits from counterfeit sales are used to finance terrorist activities, and this is anything but a victimless crime. This is a crime that finances random murder around the world, including, needless to say, the murder of Americans. We are very fortunate today, in addition to Mr. Levitt, to have two witnesses from Los Angeles who will testify to what they have done and discovered about the counterfeit trade and its connection to terrorism. All three witnesses, I hope, will help us understand the nexus between terrorism and counterfeiting, and also help us to evaluate whether the Federal Government, State, and local governments, and law enforcement generally are receiving the resources and are coordinating their investigatory and prosecutorial activities to meet this challenge. Local leads regarding counterfeit goods and possible terrorist connections are extremely valuable, particularly since the Federal Government has strong financial tracking capabilities with regard to terrorist financing that have been developed in recent years and were further improved by the intelligence reform legislation signed into law last year by the President, which came out of this Committee. That legislation authorized additional funding for the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and its technical tracking capabilities to strengthen the Department's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing efforts. So we know that Federal agencies track and investigate terrorist financing. What we want to find out today from the witnesses is whether those agencies are doing enough to track and investigate and prosecute those who are using the sale of counterfeit consumer goods to finance terrorist activities. This is a very important hearing today and one in which, Madam Chairman, I think we are playing another appropriate role of oversight, which may lead to legislation--perhaps we will decide that there ought to be stiffer penalties for counterfeiting--but hopefully, we will focus attention on this problem that it hasn't received before, and that attention, in turn, will engender the kind of prosecutorial activity that I believe this problem merits. Thank you very much. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Senator. Senator Akaka. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR AKAKA Senator Akaka. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman, for calling this hearing to learn more about a developing and growing problem not only in our country, but in the rest of the world, as well. Today's hearing provides us, and I join Senator Lieberman in saying that this provides us with two opportunities. One opportunity is to understand the connection that may exist and is developing between organized crime and terrorism. The other opportunity is to, as was mentioned, evaluate the level of cooperation between the Federal level and the local level of law officials. I want to thank our witnesses for being here to provide us with their testimony. Thank you, Lieutenant Stedman from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, also Kris Buckner and Dr. Matthew Levitt for your expert testimony. The selling of counterfeit goods pervades every major area of the United States. According to recent estimates, $286 billion in counterfeit goods are sold in the United States every year. The problem is not just large companies protecting their intellectual property and their profits. It is also consumers paying for goods they believe are of a certain quality, only to receive fake goods. It is about people buying dangerous counterfeit pharmaceuticals over the Internet, as we heard at several hearings last year before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Interpol recently reported a tragic case of counterfeit baby formula sold in China which resulted in the deaths of 13 babies and serious illness to another 171 babies. Counterfeit goods is not a victimless crime. Of those organized criminal enterprises that are involved in the profitable business of counterfeit goods, there is a small number who directly threaten our national security by providing financial support to terrorists. In July 2003, the House Committee on International Relations held a hearing entitled, ``Intellectual Property Crimes: Are Proceeds from Counterfeited Goods Funding Terrorism?'' At that hearing, the Secretary General of Interpol, Mr. Ronald K. Noble, sounded the alarm that, and I quote him, ``Intellectual property crime is becoming the preferred method of funding for a number of terrorist groups.'' Department of Homeland Security Under Secretary Hutchinson said, ``Terrorist organizations worldwide are looking for a variety of illegal activities to fund their efforts. They have looked at contraband and counterfeiting and piracy, all as means of illegal activity to fund their organizations.'' One well-known case involving counterfeit and pirated goods was reported in the joint Departments of Justice and Treasury in 2003 National Money Laundering Strategy, working with Canadian law enforcement. U.S. officials obtained 18 convictions of members of a Charlotte, North Carolina-based Hezbollah cell which had smuggled untaxed cigarettes into North Carolina and Michigan and used the proceeds to provide financial support to terrorists in Beirut. There is a danger that, over time, terrorist cells and criminal gangs could forge mutually beneficial financial links that will facilitate terrorist infiltration into the United States. It is one short step from smuggling narcotics to smuggling terrorists and explosives. Once this link is made, that challenge to our domestic security will have exponentially increased. Some concern has already been reported about possible connections between al Qaeda and the street gang known as MS- 13. While these connections appear now not to have been made, our vigilance must be strict. It illustrates the important need for cooperation between criminal intelligence divisions in the local law enforcement field and terrorist intelligence agencies at the Federal level. Madam Chairman, I hope today's witnesses will address some of these issues, and I hope, Madam Chairman, that the Committee will continue to look into these issues. I ask to be excused for another important Committee statement that I have to make elsewhere. Thank you very much. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Senator. You are a very dedicated Member of this Committee, and I appreciate your coming by this morning. Senator Akaka. Well, it is no secret. I enjoy working with you. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Lautenberg. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LAUTENBERG Senator Lautenberg. Thank you, Madam Chairman. It is pretty obvious that we must do whatever we can to interrupt funds that might go to terrorist organizations or countries that support terrorism, and today, we are looking at one way that funds are developed to support these enemies of the United States. We have all had the experience, as we talk about counterfeit goods, we have all had the experience of walking down streets in cities like Newark, New York, Philadelphia, or any other major city and see people selling items like handbags, clothing, and the miscellaneous replications that we see here on this table and that we are all aware of. At first glance, these items might appear to be a great bargain. But most of us have learned that when a deal seems too good to be true, it usually is, and that is certainly the case with counterfeit consumer goods. They are a bad deal for consumers because they don't really receive what they think they are buying. And counterfeit goods are certainly a bad deal for the companies whose goods they mimic. That is one part of the thing. The result is, as we look at today, is not only does it hurt the economy, hurt the companies, and hurt the buyers, but it appears that trade in counterfeit merchandise might even damage our national security by funneling money into the hands of terrorists. President Bush has said it, that money is the lifeblood of terrorists, and that is certainly true. We have learned that. But there are other larger sources of income to terrorists that are also not being shut down, and one that I have focused on in the past is American companies that do business with terrorist States. That is why I have introduced a bill that would close the loophole in our current law that allows U.S. companies to do business with nations like Iran, simply by going through offshore subsidiaries. Now, we need to close this loophole and cut off the flow of dollars to terrorists, people who want to destroy our lives and our Nation. I look forward to hearing more about the issue of counterfeit goods from our witnesses. It is my hope that my colleagues will join with me to stop U.S. companies from doing business with terrorists once and for all. We have got to do whatever we can to make sure that no help goes from any American company by any device or ruse to countries like Iran, where funds travel to terrorist organizations, wind up killing or injuring Americans, whether or not they are in or out of uniform, and I commend you, Madam Chairman, for calling this hearing and focusing on this issue of funds to terrorists. Chairman Collins. I would now like to welcome our first panel--our only panel this morning, of witnesses. Each is truly an expert in his field. Lieutenant John Stedman is a 24-year veteran of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and is currently a supervisor in the Criminal Investigative Section of the Department. Kris Buckner is President of Investigative Consultants, a private investigation firm specializing in intellectual property crime investigations. And Dr. Matthew Levitt is an expert on the subject of Hezbollah. He is also the Director of the Washington Institute's Terrorism Studies Program. We are very pleased to have you here with us this morning. We appreciate all of the prior assistance you have given the Committee as we have investigated this issue. Lieutenant, we are going to start with you. Thank you. TESTIMONY OF JOHN C. STEDMAN,\\1\\ LIEUTENANT, SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES Lieutenant Stedman. Thank you, Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman, for the opportunity to testify today. My name is John Stedman. I am a lieutenant with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in California. My testimony today will address the enforcement efforts of the Sheriff's Department regarding intellectual property rights crimes and the involvement of organized crime groups operating in Los Angeles county. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Lieutenant Stedman appears in the Appendix on page 31. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- My experience with IPR crimes dates to the late 1980s, when my unit was approached by members of the Latin American Music Association. They were experiencing large revenue losses due to proliferation of unauthorized and illegal duplication of music onto cassette tapes. The Music Association was seeking cooperation from local law enforcement to enforce a State of California statute that makes it a crime to illegally duplicate copyrighted or trademarked materials. Over the next 2 years, my unit investigated dozens of these cases, resulting in the seizure of hundreds of thousands of cassette tapes and the incarceration of many suspects. During the 1990s, the Motion Picture Association of America also requested the services of local law enforcement to enforce the same copyright or trademark statutes of California. Detectives under my supervision completed many of these investigations, seizing thousands of illegally duplicated motion pictures. Many of these videos were of films not yet released to the theaters. In 2003, I was assigned to supervise the Criminal Investigations Section of the Emergency Operations Bureau. It was at this time that I gained a full realization of the pervasiveness of IPR crimes in Los Angeles County. We concentrated our investigative resources on IPR crimes and have uncovered significant organized criminal enterprises operating within Los Angeles County. Victims of the organized criminal groups include the tobacco industry, luxury goods manufacturers, clothing companies, and the music and motion picture industries. Information in open sources indicates that across the globe, anything that has a decent profit margin is being counterfeited. While there are no local statistics on the magnitude of the problem, I can relate what my small team of one sergeant and six investigators has accomplished in a little more than a year. We have served 60 search warrants, which have yielded 125 arrests and $16 million in seized counterfeit products. An additional $3.5 million in cash has been seized and is currently in forfeiture proceedings. With your permission, Madam Chairman, I would like to show a short video which illustrates one of our warrant operations. Chairman Collins. Please do. [A videotape was played.] Lieutenant Stedman. Within the Sheriff's Department, there are units designated to combat organized criminal enterprises, such as the one you just saw, and we are represented on nearly every task force created to investigate these groups. These units have similar experiences with IPR investigations, noting that the profits are enormous with minimal criminal exposure. Russian organized crime, Eurasian organized crime, Asian organized crime, and Lebanese organized crime groups all profit from IPR crimes. Additionally, we believe that there may be a trend developing for local gang involvement in IPR criminal activity. Recently, we have investigated several individuals with strong gang ties and extensive criminal records. During interviews, these suspects have admitted that IPR crime is attractive because of the high profit and minimal jail sentences. In the parlance of one suspect, it is better than the dope business. No one is going to prison for DVDs. There are also indicators that some associates of terrorist groups may be involved in IPR crime. During the course of our investigations, we have encountered suspects who have shown great affinity for Hezbollah and its leadership. The following are just two examples. During the service of a search warrant in which thousands of dollars in counterfeit clothing was seized, I saw small Hezbollah flags displayed in the suspect's bedroom. Next to the flags was a photograph of Hassan Nasrallah, whom I recognized as the leader of Hezbollah. The suspect's wife asked me if I knew the subject of the photograph. I identified Nasrallah and the wife said, ``We love him because he protects us from the Jews.'' Also in the home were dozens of audio tapes of Nasrallah's speeches. During the search, one of my detectives also found a locket which contained a picture of the male suspect on one side and Sheik Nasrallah on the other. In 2004, detectives served an IPR search warrant at a clothing store in Los Angeles County. During the course of the search, thousands of dollars in counterfeit clothing was recovered, as were two unregistered firearms. During the booking process, the suspect was found to have a tattoo of the Hezbollah flag on his arm. To my left is a photo of that tattoo. Again in 2004, detectives served a multi-location IPR- related search warrant involving a large-scale counterfeit blanket operation. During the course of the investigation, detectives located a photo album. Within the photo album were dozens of pictures of attendees at a fundraising event for the Holy Land Foundation. When questioned about the album, the suspect said that the Holy Land Foundation was not a terrorist funding operation. When I informed the suspect that the U.S. Government had shut down the charity because of its alleged support of Hezbollah, the suspect replied that the U.S. Government was stupid and would do anything that the Jews told them. When confronted with these indicators, we passed the information immediately to the Los Angeles Joint Terrorism Task Force for further review. As a result of this kind of information sharing, we enjoy an outstanding relationship with the JTTF as well as with the other three FBI offices located in Los Angeles County. As I have stated, the financial rewards of IPR crimes are immense. Many times, the biggest issue for the criminal or his group is how to disperse the money generated from the crimes committed. It is difficult to use traditional banking practices to account for the huge profits generated. In one of our cases involving counterfeit baby blankets, we discovered over $800,000 in cash located throughout the suspect's residence, hidden in trash bags, under beds, stuffed in trash cans, and stashed in the attic. In fact, more than $10,000 was found in a child's piggybank. On other occasions, we have seen activity consistent with money laundering and structuring occurring between similar businesses. Another of our cases began with the stop of a suspect at Los Angeles International Airport by U.S. Customs officers. Strapped to the suspect's body was more than $230,000 in cash. The suspect told the Customs officers that she was en route to Lebanon for a vacation. Information was developed that the suspect owned a chain of cigarette shops. Service of search warrants led to the seizure of more than 1,000 cartons of counterfeit cigarettes, an additional $70,000 in cash, as well as wire transfers to banks throughout the world. The financial cost of IPR-related crimes to the State of California is significant. As an example, my small team has seized about 40,000 cartons of counterfeit, untaxed cigarettes. The California State tax on cigarettes is $8.70 per carton, representing a loss to the State of $348,000. It should also not be a surprise to anyone that suspects involved in IPR crime do not concern themselves with paying appropriate taxes, whether Federal, State, or local. Our experience has been that suspects claiming $20,000 or $30,000 on their yearly income tax forms routinely keep tens of thousands of dollars in cash at their homes. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has, like most local agencies, suffered cutbacks in personnel over the past several years due to severe budget curtailments. There has not been a mechanism to address IPR crimes other than that based on interest from small units or individual investigators. We believe that there is a critical void in personnel to mount an effective campaign against the criminal enterprises that utilize IPR as a revenue stream. It is well-documented that organized criminal enterprises engage in IPR crimes. There are mounting indicators of the involvement of terrorist groups and their supporters. In Los Angeles County, we believe there should be a task force commitment in order to combat the problem. Members of the Sheriff's Department have begun to explore different sources of revenue to fund such a task force in our region. The private sector has shown interest in contributing to such an effort. In fact, the private sector, comprised of manufacturers and companies such as Investigative Consultants, whose President, Kris Buckner, is speaking today, plays a vital role in our enforcement efforts. Without this cooperative public-private sector relationship, the Sheriff's Department, because of limited personnel resources, would quickly be overwhelmed and would not be able to maintain our current investigative pace. We also believe that there should be legislation to enact or increase the levy on containers shipped through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. These levies would fund intensified IPR enforcement efforts. It is my hope that by drawing more attention to this crime, we can reinforce the American dream of having an idea, bringing it to market, and profiting from its success without interference from the criminal element. On behalf of Los Angeles County Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, I wish to thank the Committee for this opportunity to represent our county in discussing this important topic. Thank you, and I look forward to any questions you might have of me. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Lieutenant. Mr. Buckner. TESTIMONY OF KRIS BUCKNER,\\1\\ PRESIDENT, INVESTIGATIVE CONSULTANTS Mr. Buckner. Thank you. I would like to thank Chairman Collins, Senator Lieberman, and all of the Members of the Committee for the opportunity to appear before you today. Intellectual property crime is an important topic, and I am very pleased that the Committee is holding this hearing to discuss how intellectual property crime affects our country, including the possibility that proceeds from counterfeiting fund terrorism. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Buckner appears in the Appendix on page 35. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For the record, my name is Kris Buckner. I am the President of Investigative Consultants, a licensed private investigative firm based in Southern California. I have been a private investigator for over 10 years and specialize in investigations involving manufacture, distribution, and sale of counterfeit goods. Investigative Consultants began as a single-person operation in 1994. The company now employs 14 full-time employees and several part-time and contract employees. Ninety- five percent of the company's time is spent investigating intellectual property matters, and we currently represent over 80 different brand owners. The job of our company is to work on behalf of brand owners to uncover evidence of counterfeiting activities. When we find concrete evidence that some person or group is substantially engaged in counterfeit goods marketing, we contact the appropriate law enforcement agency and provide them with the evidence and assist them on behalf of the brand owners in the identification, inventory, and storage of the counterfeit items to ensure that the counterfeiters are brought to justice. How big is the problem of counterfeit goods? Let me answer that in three words. Out of control. In only 10 years, my company has conducted over 9,000 intellectual property investigations that have resulted in the recovery and seizure of over $1 billion worth of counterfeit and pirated merchandise. Over the past 10 years, our investigations have helped law enforcement arrest over 3,000 people for counterfeiting and piracy. There is no end in sight. My business continues to grow. I would like to show a short video that illustrates the problem, with your permission. [A videotape was played.] Mr. Buckner. What you are looking at here is a search warrant getting served at an embroidery factory that contained two sophisticated embroidering machines that were embroidering counterfeit clothing. Each of those machines is worth about $250,000. What you are looking at now is video footage of an LAPD search warrant of a warehouse that contained counterfeit handbags. The operator, who was subsequently convicted of trademark counterfeiting, advised law enforcement that he was making $30,000 cash per week in this business and had retired from a nine-to-five job at Northrup because this was so lucrative. What you are looking at now is a DVD lab that is manufacturing counterfeit and pirated movies. Those are finished movies there that you are looking at. This lab has the capability of manufacturing tens of thousands of counterfeit movies per week, and those are the computer tower burners that are used to manufacture the movies themselves. The counterfeiting problem is not just limited to handbags, watches, and other luxury goods. I have been involved in cases involving DVD movies, music CDs, glue, children's toys, sunglasses, food items, computer equipment, toner products, and numerous other items. I have also seen cases where brake pads, aircraft parts, baby formula, and even cough syrup have been counterfeited. You name it and criminals can and will counterfeit it. As long as counterfeiters are making money, they do not care who they hurt or kill. Most brand owners go to great lengths to combat the problem. One of the ways in which they do this is hire people like me to serve cease and desist notices on people we know are engaging in the sale of counterfeit merchandise. I have served thousands of these notices. In my hand is what we call our subject book. This is just one of five such binders, all of which are as big or bigger than this one, that are kept in my office. These binders all contain photographs of people that we have served with the cease and desist notices. Ninety percent of these vendors continue to sell counterfeit merchandise, even after we advise them what they were doing was illegal. They continue their operations because of the large amount of money that they make. And make no mistake about it, counterfeiting is profitable. I have participated in multiple law enforcement operations in which huge sums of cash have been recovered. During one such raid, officers found over $370,000 in cash in a decrepit warehouse. That money was just some of the profits enjoyed by a subject who had merely been selling counterfeit blankets. Some counterfeit goods are manufactured in the United States. While assisting law enforcement, I have seen California factories involved in the large-scale manufacture of counterfeit merchandise. I have been involved in cases in which owners of factories routinely locked employees inside the manufacturing facilities. Law enforcement had to call the fire department, which used the Jaws of Life to cut open the doors and free the employees. If there had been a fire, the employees would have died. Counterfeiters valued cash more than human life. The vast majority of counterfeit merchandise is manufactured outside the United States in countries like China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Mexico. The merchandise is often manufactured under unsafe conditions, and there have been cases where counterfeiters used child labor to make products. Counterfeiters often smuggle goods into the United States. Several times, I have come across brand-name counterfeit handbags sewn inside the linings of generic handbags. Once the generic handbags pass Customs, counterfeiters cut open the generic handbags and remove the counterfeit ones. Lieutenant Stedman is going to show us a perfect example of one of these bags I just spoke about, where you look at the outside and it looks like a generic, non-descript handbag. But you cut open the lining of the bag and you will see what is inside. And inside, you have the counterfeit. It may seem like a lot of work to smuggle counterfeit handbags, but keep in mind that a counterfeiter can make approximately $500,000 in cash per container. It is wrong to think that counterfeit merchandise is only sold on the street corners. Counterfeit merchandise regularly ends up in all types of stores, including large chain department stores, hotel gift shops, upscale boutiques, swap meets, flea markets, and other retail locations. There is a shopping district in Los Angeles called Santee Alley, where counterfeit merchandise is openly sold. On any given day, there are over 75 vendors in Santee Alley selling all kinds of counterfeit merchandise. I am frequently asked whether I believe organized criminal groups engage in the sale of counterfeit and pirated merchandise, and my answer is yes. Sometimes, an organized counterfeiting operation profits primarily from the sale of counterfeit goods, whereas in other instances, counterfeiting is just another revenue stream for the criminal syndicate. In Los Angeles, the various criminal groups profiting from the sale of counterfeit goods are extremely well organized. They hire lookouts, utilize countersurveillance techniques to track my employees' activities and the activities of law enforcement. The groups use two-way radios and have also developed an elaborate warning system to alert vendors of impending enforcement actions. During heavy enforcement periods, counterfeiters have placed lookouts near the Los Angeles Police Department's Central Division to monitor the movements of law enforcement. Counterfeiters have surveiled my team of investigators. They have also been spotted surveiling our office location. During counterfeit goods raids, I found lists containing the names of my employees, their physical descriptions, descriptions of our company vehicles, and license plate numbers. Counterfeiters are making so much money that they will do anything to disrupt our efforts. My investigators have been assaulted by counterfeiters. Counterfeiters have slashed the tires of our vehicles. A counterfeiter injured one of my investigators when he broke out the window of the investigator's vehicle while the investigator was driving it. There is clear and convincing evidence that street gangs have begun to profit from the sale of counterfeit merchandise on the streets of Los Angeles. Not only do the gangs place their soldiers on the street to sell pirated movies and music, they attack other street vendors who want to sell counterfeit merchandise on their turf. It only stands to reason, then, that the proceeds from the sale of counterfeit goods are used to buy guns and drugs. More and more organized criminal groups are engaging in the sale of counterfeit merchandise to raise money. The great profits and the limited risk of prosecution make it an extremely attractive enterprise. For these criminals, it is simply a matter of business. They get caught selling drugs, they go to prison. They get caught selling counterfeit goods, they get probation. I am also frequently asked if terrorist groups profit from the sale of counterfeit goods. I do not know the answer to that question. What I do know is that while working with law enforcement to conduct counterfeit goods raids, I have been in homes and businesses in which photos of Hezbollah Sheik Nasrallah have been prominently displayed. On several occasions during these same raids, I have heard subjects make anti- Israeli and anti-Jewish statements. I have also observed evidence indicating that counterfeiters send large amounts of money to places such as Lebanon and Paraguay. My company is hired by major corporations, and I know that many people don't have any sympathy for big businesses. However, the public needs to understand that they are forced to pay higher prices for brand-name products because of counterfeiters. It has been estimated that counterfeiting costs brand owners billions of dollars a year in lost revenue. Brand owners must raise their prices to recoup those losses. In my opinion, the general public has no appreciation for how many mom-and-pop retail establishments are driven out of business every year by counterfeiters. As everyone knows, there is great demand for brand-name products. How can a legitimate small retailer compete when consumers have the option of buying a $20 pair of generic sunglasses in their store or a $20 pair of brand-name counterfeit sunglasses in the store next door? Far too many consumers buy the counterfeit brand-name sunglasses. Time and again, I receive calls from legitimate small business owners begging me to investigate their counterfeit competitors. These people know that they will quickly be driven out of business if the seller of the counterfeit goods is allowed to continue to operate next door to them. There is nothing more rewarding than receiving a congratulatory phone call from these same small business owners after participating in a counterfeit goods raid with law enforcement. In closing, I would like to say that although I am not an expert on organized crime and terrorism, I do know how the counterfeit goods operations work, and every day in the course of my investigations, I see things that strongly suggest that terrorist groups are raising funds through the sale of counterfeit goods. The opportunity is there and the indicators are there. The sale of counterfeit goods is not a victimless crime. I again want to thank the Committee for holding this hearing, and I would like to acknowledge the outstanding efforts of the law enforcement agencies in California, especially the Criminal Investigations Section of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Los Angeles Police Department. They understand the importance of aggressively pursuing counterfeiters. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Dr. Levitt. TESTIMONY OF MATTHEW LEVITT,\\1\\ SENIOR FELLOW AND DIRECTOR OF TERRORISM STUDIES, THE WASHINGTON INSTITUTE FOR NEAR EAST POLICY Mr. Levitt. Thank you, Madam Chairman, Senator Lieberman, and Members of the Committee. I am grateful for having the opportunity to testify before you today. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Levitt appears in the Appendix on page 41. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- What I would like to do is to put Lieutenant Stedman's and Mr. Buckner's testimony into context in terms of what Hezbollah's modus operandi is. First, let us understand what Hezbollah is all about. Aside from suicide truck bombings targeting U.S. and French soldiers in Beirut in 1983 and 1984, Hezbollah is also behind the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in 1986, two sets of bombings in Argentina in 1992 and 1994, attempted bombings in Thailand in 1994, attempted attacks in the streets of Singapore, and many other attacks internationally targeting American, French, German, British, Kuwaiti, Bahraini, and other interests worldwide. According to U.S. authorities, concern over the threat posed by Hezbollah is very well placed. FBI officials have testified that Hezbollah continues to have subjects based in the United States and have the capability to attempt terrorist attacks here should this be the desired objective of the group. Hezbollah continues to surveil U.S. interests internationally and in the United States. Former CIA Director George Tenet testified in 2003 that Hezbollah, as an organization with capability and worldwide presence, is al Qaeda's equal, if not a far more capable organization. Therefore, anything it is doing to fund its activities should be our concern, and I commend the Committee for holding this hearing in the context of its national security implications. Iran is believed to fund Hezbollah to the tune of at least $100 million a year. But the group is also believed to engage in all kinds of other fundraising techniques through charities, but perhaps most importantly and most successfully through criminal enterprises, and I would like to focus on that criminal enterprise aspect. Consider just a few examples, because in the open source world, there is only so much detailed information available to us. But in the Charlotte case that Senator Lieberman mentioned earlier, of which I was the government's expert witness, law enforcement authorities were able to trace half-a-million dollars through various accounts tied to the cell members. They believe most of the funds, however, remained in cash. There was approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million in profit made on $8 million of cigarettes that were smuggled. Of this, tens of thousands of dollars--some investigators still maintain it may be closer to hundreds of thousands of dollars--were never found and are suspected of going to Hezbollah beyond the funds that they can demonstrate went to Hezbollah. U.S. officials believe a substantial portion of the estimated millions of dollars raised by Middle Eastern terrorist groups in the United States comes from the $20 million to $30 million annually brought in by the illicit scam industry here in the United States. Of the Middle Eastern terrorist groups present in the United States, Hezbollah is far and away the most criminally oriented, and so we need to assume that the vast majority of that activity is being carried out by Hezbollah cells in this country, and there are several. In South America in the tri-border area, it is especially important to Hezbollah. There are criminal enterprises. The group there raises close to $10 million a year, according to a study by the U.S. Naval War College. According to that report, U.S. Southern Command estimates that the Islamist terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, raised between $300 million and $500 million per year in the Triple Frontier and the duty-free zones of the Iquique, Colon, Maicao, and Margarita Islands. Hezbollah also raises tremendous amounts of money through foreign expatriate remittances, and this is also tied to criminal activity. For example, in 1988, Lebanese expatriots in Senegal attempted to smuggle approximately $1.7 million to Lebanon. At the time, the local community claimed that the smuggling operation was not intended to fund Hezbollah but merely to evade Senegalese law. It appears that it was intended to both evade Senegalese law and finance Hezbollah. Israeli intelligence, according to one Israeli report, ranks Senegal as the second most important center in Africa for Hezbollah financing after the Ivory Coast. Similar activity has been documented in South America, where Hezbollah funds are raised through criminal enterprises and then sent back to Lebanon as foreign remittances, or under the cover of foreign remittances. A senior U.S. law enforcement official noted that, ``there is a significant amount of money moved out of the United States attributed to fraud that goes to terrorism.'' The most outstanding case that we know about is the case in Charlotte, North Carolina, where two brothers, Mohammed and Chawki Hamoud, led a cell in Charlotte, North Carolina, with a parallel part of the network in Canada. Investigators reviewed over 500 bank, credit card, and other financial accounts. Some members used multiple identities. For example, they would simply buy-out the identity of Middle Eastern students who had been studying at the University of North Carolina- Charlotte and use those legal identities under the names like Ali Abu Sala or Hassan Shavski. They had several legitimate driver's licenses, INS work authorization cards, Social Security numbers. Each of these individuals had multiple identities. Said Harub, one of the cell members who turned evidence against his fellow cell members, had three legitimate driver's licenses, over a dozen other I.D.'s with which he established credit and busted out that credit at the $150,000 limit and then did it over and over again. The bottom line is that every member of this cell, this network, entered the country illegally, stayed here illegally, committed crimes while they were here, and sent the proceeds back to Hezbollah. In Canada, where the network procured dual-use technologies, like night-vision goggles, for Hezbollah, some of the material was bought with funds that were sent from Lebanon. Some of the material, however, was bought through credit card scams. And to make matters worse, Hezbollah would still pay the cell members 50 cents on the dollar so that they made profit on the material that they were procuring for Hezbollah. It is a typical modus operandi for Hezbollah, where individual cell members are often out for the money, which is one of the reasons they are so interested in criminal activity. In a particularly disturbing case, the Canadian part of the network talked about--there is no evidence that it actually did--taking out life insurance policies for suicide bombers in Southern Lebanon--this was just before the Israeli withdrawal in 2000--taking out life insurance policies for suicide bombers who would then attack Israelis and then cashing in those life insurance policies in Canada. Hezbollah and other terrorist groups also traffic narcotics in North America. A DEA investigation into a pseudoephedrine smuggling scam in the American Midwest led investigators as far as Jordan, Yemen, Lebanon, and other Middle Eastern countries, including bank accounts tied to Hezbollah and Hamas. Then-DEA Chief Asa Hutchinson confirmed that a significant portion of some of the sales are sent to the Middle East and used to benefit terrorist organizations. In South America, Hezbollah operatives engage in a wide range of criminal enterprises to raise, transfer, and launder funds in support of their terrorist activities. In one case, Paraguayan officials arrested Ali Khalil Mehri, a Hezbollah operative, for selling millions of dollars in pirated software and funding Hezbollah with some of the profits. Assad Barakat, one of the most important Hezbollah operatives in South America, not only served as a treasurer for Hezbollah, but was also involved, according to their investigation, in a counterfeiting ring that distributed fake U.S. dollars and generates cash to fund Hezbollah operations. He personally cleared contributions to Lebanon for Hezbollah. Hezbollah operatives also run otherwise legitimate business enterprises that function as shell companies or fronts for raising, laundering, and transferring large sums of money. For example, the Charlotte cell members used some of the money they raised to buy a BP gas station, funded in part with a loan from the Small Business Administration. Mohammed Hamoud, the cell leader, wondered to his wife at the time what kind of background investigation would be required, and when she asked why he was so concerned, he said, ``There are some things about me you are better off not knowing.'' According to Israeli officials, Hezbollah operatives run several Western Union offices in Lebanon and use the co-opted services of others worldwide. In some cases, they actually run the offices and skim some of the 7 percent service fee charge, which they split between themselves as profit and for Hezbollah. In at least one case in the United States involving Western Union, in January 2002, a case in Burbank, Illinois, three Middle Eastern men sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to Turkey, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates. There is no known terrorist link to that investigation, though it was never fully investigated and it remains an open question. According to a former senior law enforcement official, and I quote, ``Hezbollah is very criminally oriented for its fundraising in the United States, including legitimate and illegitimate business activities.'' Despite all the money the group receives from Iran, Hezbollah activists in the United States are believed to be self-funding, mostly through criminal enterprises, including counterfeit goods. The extent of Hezbollah counterfeit activity in South America, of which we know a great deal, combined with the group's known presence in this country and its predilection for engaging in fraud and other criminal activity in this country, point to the group's likely deep involvement in counterfeit activity in the United States. I thank you for having me here to testify and I look forward to answering any questions you may have. Chairman Collins. Thank you for an excellent statement. I want to thank all of you for adding to our knowledge of this important subject. When most consumers look at counterfeit goods, such as those displayed on the table, I think they believe, oh, it doesn't matter if it is fake. It is kind of fun to have one and I am going to buy it. I hope through this hearing today that we can help increase public awareness of just what the consequences are of buying counterfeited goods, that it isn't some kind of lark, but rather that the proceeds not only harm legitimate businesses and their workers, but even more troubling, are being used for criminal and terrorist activities. So one of the reasons I wanted to hold this hearing is to try to get consumers to think twice before purchasing counterfeited or pirated goods. Dr. Levitt's statement talked about Hezbollah targeting Americans around the world, and indeed, the 9/11 Commission found that prior to the attacks on our country by al Qaeda on September 11, that Hezbollah was responsible for killing more Americans than any other terrorist group. Lieutenant Stedman, you noted in your opening statement that one of the individuals you arrested for the sale of counterfeit goods had a Hezbollah logo tattooed on his arm, and you pointed to the picture, which we have blown up. Could you walk us through what is on the tattoo, since many of us are not familiar with the symbols and the Arabic script? Lieutenant Stedman. I had the Arabic examiner for the Sheriff's Department take a good look at it and this is what he interpreted to me. The bottom script, underneath the green, in the Arabic writing would be translated as ``The Islamic Revolution of Lebanon,'' and you have the upraised arm, fist, holding the assault weapon. The script above that was translated as saying ``Hezbollah are the Winners,'' and then the dome you see at the top is a temple mount or--the disputed dome in Jerusalem. Pretty much, that is the same picture, Hezbollah logo that you see on the flags and all the other paraphernalia that we run across. Chairman Collins. And you have also found, I understand, audio tapes that contain the speeches of Hezbollah's leader. Is this an isolated occurrence, or have you seen this evidence and audiotapes during other raids on counterfeit operations? Lieutenant Stedman. We have seen those on numerous occasions, both in the residences that we go to and the businesses. I have seen thousands of those tapes all over. Chairman Collins. You have seen thousands of those tapes? Lieutenant Stedman. Yes, ma'am. Chairman Collins. Dr. Levitt, you mentioned that Hezbollah is operating in the United States in cells. What do you think are Hezbollah's objectives in the United States? Mr. Levitt. Hezbollah, like Hamas and most other groups in this country, with extended continued presence in this country, take advantage of the freedoms in this country and use the United States primarily as a cash cow to engage in fundraising through charities and, of course, as we have discussed today, through criminal activities. I should note that in the Charlotte case, it was the same exact thing, tremendous amounts of Hezbollah material were found all over the place. The FBI has testified before Congress in the past, however, that Hezbollah operatives are also known to surveil potential targets in this country. The FBI has assessed that those activities are primarily used to vet new recruits, but the fact is that they then have that surveillance report available for off-the-shelf use, and the FBI has also testified, as I mentioned earlier, that Hezbollah has the capability to conduct attacks, should it be their desire to do so. So it is a tremendous concern to us. We know that Richard Reid, for example, the infamous shoe bomber, was sent on a similar vetting mission, including going to Israel and other places, and that his report was found in Afghanistan. That report was available to al Qaeda later should they want to use it for attacks, as Hezbollah would be able to use vetting reports, reports from vetting operations where new recruits are asked to surveil targets here. Chairman Collins. Mr. Buckner, you have mentioned that you have an excellent partnership with law enforcement, and that is obviously critical. Have you learned during the course of your investigations whether individuals that you are looking at for intellectual property crimes are also the subject of investigations by other law enforcement groups, particularly the FBI? Mr. Buckner. Yes, ma'am. On numerous occasions when we have conducted even civil enforcement actions at a location, I have received several calls from the FBI asking me about our activities and what we were doing at locations, and this has happened to us numerous different times. Chairman Collins. Have you seen any evidence of wire transfers to Lebanon? Mr. Buckner. Yes. During my 10 years of doing this, I have seen tremendous amounts of wire transfers going to both Lebanon and Paraguay, it seems like is one of the countries of choice. Chairman Collins. Lieutenant Stedman, what about you? Have you seen evidence of wire transfers and other ways to get funds from the United States from these counterfeit goods to Lebanon and the three-state area in South America? Lieutenant Stedman. My experience has been that--I don't have a lot of experience in the three-state area, but we do see wire transfers, both Western Union and bank transfers, from the States to--I have seen them to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria. They are very common. As Kris said, we see them almost everywhere we go. Chairman Collins. And one final question for the three of you before I yield to my colleague. In addition to educating consumers that by their purchases of counterfeited or pirated goods, they may well be supporting terrorist activities, what more do you think we should be doing to assist law enforcement in cracking down in this area, or beyond law enforcement? What steps would you recommend that this Committee encourage? I will start with Dr. Levitt. Mr. Levitt. Perhaps one of the most useful discussions could be about potential punishment for this type of activity. As my colleagues have discussed, there basically is none. In other areas, I know, and there may be in this already, I am not an expert on the legal side, but terrorism enhancements, and if there are not terrorism enhancements for this type of activity, that is something we should definitely consider. It should be. Senator Lieberman. You mean enhanced penalties? Mr. Levitt. Yes, sir. It should be considered a worse crime if you are doing something that is not only illegal but is also supporting terrorism, even if we can't meet the threshold of the material support statute, which has very technical thresholds that need to be met. The other thing I think we are already well along in doing, and both my colleagues have highlighted this, and in Los Angeles, it certainly sounds like it is working very well, and that is the local law enforcement and FBI JTTF cooperation. Again in the Charlotte case, this started with an off-duty sheriff who came across a case. In that case, however, there was not direct communication with the FBI at that time. It is only when they went to the U.S. Attorney's Office with their case. Then the FBI came to the U.S. Attorney's Office and said, do you see this slide? They said, yes, that is our cigarette smuggling ring. And then they showed them another slide of identical people and said, well, this is our Charlotte Hezbollah cell, and they decided at the U.S. Attorney's Office level to make this much more than just a smuggling fraud case. If we can get the cooperation at a much lower level, like Lieutenant Stedman said is common in his jurisdiction, I think we can do a lot more to prevent this activity. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Those are very helpful suggestions. Mr. Buckner. Mr. Buckner. I think public education is the most important key, as you stated previously. We have to kill the demand for the counterfeit goods, and we really do have to educate the public on where the proceeds go and that it is not a victimless crime. Though I represent the brand owners and that is how I make my living, there are a lot of mom-and-pop retail folks out there that are trying to make a living that get killed by the counterfeiters out there. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Lieutenant Stedman. Lieutenant Stedman. I agree with what both of my colleagues have said. I would only add that we have had some contact with the Department of State, and this is way out of my realm of expertise, but some pressure put on the countries that are manufacturing all these goods, specifically in my experience China, would be helpful, to stem the flow at the other end. Chairman Collins. That is another good suggestion. Thank you very much. Senator Lieberman. Senator Lieberman. Thanks, Madam Chairman. Thanks to the witnesses. Your testimony has been excellent, I think. Let me ask you a few factual questions just to make sure I am clear of how this is happening, and to go really to the beginning of the counterfeiting operations themselves. This is not the kind of stuff that you can do in your living room or your basement. I mean, I suppose if you had enough sophisticated equipment, you could, but what I am saying is it is real manufacturing. You have got to have the semblance of a business. So my question is, who is doing it at that level? Are these just entrepreneurs here in the United States or Asia or other parts of the world, or is there organized criminal involvement at the level of the counterfeiting itself? I will start with anybody. Mr. Buckner. Mr. Buckner. In regards to certain different types of counterfeit goods, whereas DVDs and CDs can be mass produced in a small apartment--in fact, in my experience in Los Angeles, most of the labs that we come across are based out of small apartments. Senator Lieberman. Right. Though as you said, or somebody did, you still have to have a pretty expensive set of equipment to do it. Mr. Buckner. Yes, sir. You are probably looking at about $10,000 worth of computer towers, printers, things of that nature, and you can really set up a nice operation that can---- Senator Lieberman. Actually, that is relatively inexpensive compared to the profit. I guess I was thinking about the quarter-of-a-million dollars that was the other video. Mr. Buckner. Yes, the different goods will dictate how your operation needs to be set up. An embroidery factory, as we saw in the videotape, you do need a warehouse-type facility to house those machines and it takes a large-scale operation. Senator Lieberman. So my question really is, who are those people here and other places around the world? Are they just unethical business people, or does organized crime get in at that level, at the manufacturing level? Lieutenant Stedman. Our experience has been that the people that are involved in importing these goods, which is most of my business, the importation, they have been doing this for a lot of years. The community in Los Angeles has been around for probably 20 or 30 years in the garment district. My grandmother and my mother used to shop down there. These people have been importing textiles for years and years, and from the same companies that are dealing the counterfeits and the same countries. Senator Lieberman. So it is not clear whether there is organized crime involved in the manufacturing. Lieutenant Stedman. That is outside my realm of expertise. I know there is once it gets here. Senator Lieberman. Dr. Levitt, do you have any information on that? Mr. Levitt. I don't have any information on the extent of it in this country. My sense is that it is likely, coming from production in China or elsewhere, and if there are then, as you saw in the videos, selling it here. What we do know, there is a lot more information on what goes on in South America and the likely trends may be parallel. In South America, Hezbollah operatives are deeply involved in import-export companies. Senator Lieberman. Right. Mr. Levitt. They are deeply imbedded in the free trade zones in Iquique and Maicao---- Senator Lieberman. Where there is manufacturing going on, or is that more the export-import? Mr. Levitt. I don't know if there is manufacturing going on there, but they are then at that level involved in the import- export themselves as opposed to someone else importing it and them just taking and running with it here. Senator Lieberman. Got it. Mr. Levitt. But the software side of it is extremely inexpensive. Senator Lieberman. Inexpensive? Mr. Levitt. Inexpensive. Senator Lieberman. Right. Mr. Levitt. In our think tank, after we have an event, we put it on CD. We send it out to our trustees. We have a tower. It doesn't cost a lot of money. We do it in a couple hours. We produce a whole bunch of these CDs to send out to people who couldn't make the event. Senator Lieberman. Right. I mean, another question I raise, and I want to pursue it on my time, I want to get on to the subject, is whether legitimate businesses who happen to manufacture pocketbooks or hats are doing this as a sideline. Mr. Buckner. I have had cases where there have been legitimate businesses that have also turned after hours into counterfeiting operations, double-dipping, is what we will say. Senator Lieberman. Let me ask you about the distribution chain. You said that these counterfeit goods are not only sold on street corners, etc., but often in stores. Is it your presumption that the merchants who are selling counterfeit goods know that they are counterfeit, or are they being duped? Mr. Buckner. Well, I think your street corner vendors do, but your fixed retail locations, I could name names of some very big chain stores today, which I don't want to do, that have been involved in counterfeiting unknowingly. Senator Lieberman. Unknowingly? Mr. Buckner. Yes, sir. Senator Lieberman. So let us now go to the subject of terrorist links. Let me ask the question simplistically. If you are in Hezbollah's cell in Los Angeles or Charlotte and you are looking to make some money to send back to finance terrorist activities, where do you go to begin to connect to the counterfeit ring? How do you do that? How would they do that? Lieutenant Stedman. It is very simple. Like I said, this group down in the Santee Alley--like Kris was talking about-- they have been there for years and years. The counterfeiting has been going on for years and years. You could go down there, start as just a part-time employee, and before you know it, you have people driving up to your door with vans loaded full of counterfeit stuff. You don't even have to go search it out. They are going to bring it right to you and you can start business that day. Senator Lieberman. Well, that is very interesting. So if you are Hezbollah and you are trying to raise money illegally, that is not very complicated to get into the distribution network to get the stuff. Lieutenant Stedman. It is an easy business, not like the drug business, where you would have to be introduced and vetted out and be trusted before you would be able to operate. It is just so rampant that you can set up today and get started. Senator Lieberman. Let me ask this question. Is there any evidence of direct connections between organized criminal families, let us say, operations, and terrorism? In other words, I don't mean the organized criminal families are involved in terrorism, but is there any evidence of joint activities between, let us say, Hezbollah and organized criminal gangs or organized crime operations? Mr. Buckner. One thing that I can say, I don't know the exact answer to that question, but groups down in Los Angeles who normally may be enemies in the real world will cooperate with the---- Senator Lieberman. Such as? Mr. Buckner. Let us say Israelis, Jewish folks, along with these other groups of people that we are talking about. They will cooperate to make money. They will buy from each other, trade their goods. It is all about the money. Senator Lieberman. No scruples of any kind. What I was thinking of, you know, there is some significant evidence, suggestion, that there may be cooperation between Latin American drug gangs and terrorists in limited areas, for instance, in helping to smuggle, bring terrorists into the United States. You don't have any evidence of an organized connection between those two. We have focused on Hezbollah here. Is there any evidence of any of the other terrorist groups, Middle Eastern or otherwise, benefiting from the sale of counterfeit goods here in the United States? Mr. Levitt. Certainly involving criminal enterprises. I don't know the specifics about whether they are involved in counterfeit goods, but we do have evidence not only of cigarette smuggling, but of baby formula and credit card fraud---- Senator Lieberman. By other terrorist groups? Mr. Levitt. Yes, groups like Hamas and---- Senator Lautenberg. I wonder, Madam Chairman, are we going to have a second round, because then I could jump in here and be out. Senator Lieberman. I am going to yield to you. I am sorry. I didn't see the clock going. Chairman Collins. We will have a second round if you need additional time. Senator Lautenberg. Yes, and I can get my first one and go. Senator Lieberman. OK. Very significant answers to the questions and a significant problem. I want to come back on my second round and talk a little bit more about what more we might do to focus attention and action on this problem. Thanks, Madam Chairman. Chairman Collins. Dr. Levitt, I want to give you a chance, however, to answer Senator Lieberman's question. You started to and mentioned Hamas, I believe. Mr. Levitt. Yes, just that we do know, and law enforcement officials tend not to speak open source in great specifics, but they have mentioned Hezbollah, Hamas, and others, is usually the way they put the package together, involved in this type of fraud activity, credit card fraud and all these other things we have discussed. I think it would be naive to assume that they are not involved in the kind of other criminal activity that we are looking at here at the table. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Lautenberg. Senator Lautenberg. Thank you, Madam Chairman. The thing that occurs to me is that we permit a lot of this to go on by issuing licenses to street vendors who invariably, I think, do tend to carry counterfeit or knocked-off goods, as they call it. I don't understand why the licenses are issued in the streets of New York or Boston or Newark in my State. If they don't issue the licenses to these people, which are competitive with the regular merchants, and the regular manufacturers and merchants are much more able to determine whether or not they are getting counterfeit goods. And then they just do street sweeps. I mean, to me, it is kind of cozying up to the idea and permitting discounted merchandise to be sold in front of very valuable leasehold properties that companies invest in. Do you have any idea on why these permits are issued? Lieutenant Stedman. Our experience is that once the permits are issued, if there is an enforcement action, whether it is a search warrant or maybe a civil action by someone like Kris, the permit may be revoked by the city, but then the next family owner will go get a new permit with a new name and continue business on. So there is---- Senator Lautenberg. There ought to be a look at that. Mr. Levitt, I want to ask you, how much damage do you think Iran does by its interference in our activities in Iraq? Are they a significant factor, do you know, in providing resources to Iraq, equipment, etc.? Mr. Levitt. Officials do believe that Iran is engaged in disruptive activity in Iraq for certain, not only supporting some of the militias that are causing a great deal of damage and loss of life there, but also with reportedly a great number of intelligence operatives of their own. Hezbollah's al Manar satellite television not only includes vitriolic messages of hate against Israel, but also very explicitly against the United States, and that doesn't help, either. Senator Lautenberg. So we must do whatever we can to cut off resources for Iran. Mr. Levitt. Yes. Easier said than done, in large part because the oil industry is such that while I certainly think there is an important moral statement to be made by our not participating in funding Iran, someone else is going to step in by the nature of the fundible oil industry and I don't believe that is necessarily going to cause a loss of income to Iran unless it is extremely multi-lateral. And given the nature of international oil business and the price of oil today, there is, unfortunately, always going to be someone out there willing to buy that barrel. Senator Lautenberg. I don't want to ask you to moralize here, but should American companies be particularly outside the circle--I mean, competition for the business, that as an excuse can create all kinds of things. Why don't we grow more opium here? Why don't we get into the business if someone else is going to do it? I don't buy that at all. To me, if help comes for an American company, I think it is treasonous if it goes to Iran and then helps to kill our troops. Every day, you hear the reports about two more, four more being killed, and the number of Iraqis being killed. To me, I think that we have to be--this is a very interesting hearing that we are having, Madam Chairman, and I think it is important. I think it is important from two standpoints. One is the fleecing of the customers, the penalty for business. But when those funds flow to enemies of our country, and you mentioned, I think, Dr. Levitt, that Hezbollah has surveillance routines existing in our country---- Mr. Levitt. That is what the FBI says, yes. Senator Lautenberg. Now, are they surveying potential targets for violence against those individuals? Is that part of their scheme? Mr. Levitt. The FBI has described it as basically training missions for new recruits, but we need to assume, because this is traditional terrorist modus operandi, that they don't then throw out those reports. Those reports are available to be used as off-the-shelf operational menus should they decide to use them. I don't know what types of targets specifically they are surveiling, but yes, we need to be concerned that there is that possibility. Senator Lautenberg. Well, everyone is very concerned with I.D. thefts. I mean, that then permits lots of funny things to go on. People hide their real identity and adopt those that would get them into places that we don't want them to be. I thank you for your testimony, all three of you, but I really think that we have to kind of look inside and make sure that by accident or design, that no American companies are helping Iran, and I will be damned if the reason that we shouldn't do it is because a competitor could come in there. We are either out to protect democracy and lives or we are not. And if we say, well, hey, listen, business comes first, then it is a kind of society I don't think that is good for my family or my friends or my community. Thank you. Chairman Collins. Mr. Buckner, you have concentrated, as has Lieutenant Stedman, on the Los Angeles area and what is going on there with regard to counterfeit goods, but is this a problem throughout the United States? Does it affect smaller cities? Could you give us some idea of the scope of counterfeiting operations in this country? Mr. Buckner. Yes. The counterfeiting problem is widespread throughout the United States. Obviously, in your bigger metropolitan areas, it is more in your face, on the streets of New York, the streets of Los Angeles. But I have worked cases in probably 30 different States, and there are investigators just like me all over the country that do exactly what I do. It is amazing, the scope and the magnitude of the problem. Chairman Collins. Each of you has mentioned that the high profits involved and the ease of getting into counterfeiting makes this activity very attractive to criminals, including terrorists. Is another factor that it is unlikely to be prosecuted? Is there a low risk of these cases actually making their way to the courts? Lieutenant Stedman. Lieutenant Stedman. All of our cases are filed. The priority in Los Angeles is violent crime. There is a lot of violent crime going on, the robberies, rapes, and murders and all that kind of stuff. This, obviously, would take secondary interest to the District Attorneys' Offices because of that. But we have actually had pretty good cooperation from the District Attorneys' Offices. They see the problem. I think because there are units like mine out there starting to do more and more of it, they are realizing the scope of it and we are actually getting pretty good cooperation from the District Attorney's Office. Chairman Collins. I think one of you may have mentioned that if you are a criminal who is dealing drugs, you have a far greater chance of going to prison than if you are selling counterfeit goods, and yet when you look at the implications of these sales for terrorist activities, you may, in fact, be doing more damage even than someone who is peddling drugs. Mr. Buckner, could you comment based on your experience, is there a low risk of going to prison, a low risk, in fact, of being prosecuted? Mr. Buckner. I have to compliment the L.A. County DA's Office. They really proactively are looking at doing more and more of these cases, but unfortunately, for example, there is a subject that we arrested five different times. On his sixth arrest, he finally is going to State prison. The sixth time, he is now going to State prison. Unfortunately, what usually happens is guys get probation, and the problem is the profit margin is so huge on this, I don't think anybody really realizes that it is worth the risk. If they get arrested one time, get probation, pay a fine, they look at it as a cost of doing business, and that is the unfortunate part. At the same time, the DA's Office in L.A. County is taking these cases more seriously and filing more cases than they ever have. I think the problem is just really overwhelming. Chairman Collins. Dr. Levitt, do you have any comment on that based on your work? I realize it is a little bit outside of your area. Mr. Levitt. Just I completely agree with what they said. We have a problem with being short-staffed, as Lieutenant Stedman said. We do need more resources. Law enforcement is doing a wonderful job, but the problems are immense and there are so many things on their plate. As Mr. Buckner said, not only terrorists, but criminals realize how profitable this is and many of them, certainly in the case of Hezbollah, they see how successfully they have been able to engage in these activities in other places, particularly in South America, where the laws are even more lax, and they take that assumption here, too. Frankly, they find it to be very similar, probation and a fine. The way Mr. Buckner put it, the cost of doing business, I couldn't have put it better myself. That is exactly how they see it, and frankly, that is all it is. Chairman Collins. That is why I think that your suggestion that we take a look at the penalties and whether there should be an enhanced penalty is a very interesting suggestion and one that I am very interested in exploring further. Mr. Levitt. Thank you, and I think that part of the problem is that we all agree that if there were a way to decrease demand, that would be wonderful. But, I don't know, maybe it is the realist in me. There are people with low incomes, there are people who--everybody is looking--this is the United States of America. Everybody wants to get a deal. And so it is going to be very hard, even with great public education, to significantly decrease the demand. I think that is just the reality--which doesn't mean we shouldn't try, and it doesn't mean there aren't things we can do that would make a serious dent. But I think if we are really serious about this, we have to focus on the supply. Like Lieutenant Stedman said, we have to have the State Department and others focus on countries like China, where this is being done rampantly and being shipped here. We need to focus on vendors who may be doing this, and we need to focus on ways to decrease the supply. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Just one final question for Lieutenant Stedman. You have referred to a particular part of the Los Angeles that is known for this activity. Why not just shut it down? Am I missing something here? Lieutenant Stedman. There are many legitimate businesses down there, people trying to make a decent living, playing by the rules, obeying the laws. I don't know what the percentage would be, but it wouldn't be 20 or 30 percent of the area that is doing this. It is a huge draw for the city. It is huge tax revenue, legitimate tax revenue, but there is a significant counterfeit problem down there. We are doing the best we can, but I think it is--I just don't want to shut down the whole area to get rid of a few bad apples. Chairman Collins. Thank you. Senator Lieberman. Senator Lieberman. Thanks again, Madam Chairman. You know, it strikes me, as we talk about public education, I know we hear a lot about brand name--from brand name companies involved in a lot of this stuff about cutting back on intellectual property violations around the world, particularly in Asia, but around the world. Maybe I missed it, but--and American companies lose hundreds of--well, I may be overstating it, but a lot of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions, in this operation. I wonder if it would be worth it for them to launch an advertising campaign which basically says to people, when you buy something--when you buy a counterfeit good on the street, you may be saving a few bucks, but the dollars you are spending may well be going to terrorist groups that are going to use it to kill Americans. That is a strong message, but from all you have told us today, there is some truth to it. I don't know, it is not within your--maybe the Chairman and I can think about how to call on some of the large companies that are really concerned about this problem and suffer from it to try the demand reduction part of it. Mostly up until now, as I understand it, they have tried the supply reduction, particularly in trade negotiations and diplomatic relations with some of the producer countries, and it obviously hasn't worked very well. Mr. Buckner. One thing I can say about several of the brand owners, they have partnered up with several different magazines and they have put into print and sponsored articles regarding counterfeiting and where the proceeds go and the other implications. And more and more, since I started this business, more and more, I am seeing these companies do press releases and actually interact with the press, where they were scared to interact with the press before, to try to get the message out. But I definitely agree that more needs to be done on behalf of the private sector. Mr. Levitt. If I could add---- Senator Lieberman. Yes. Mr. Levitt [continuing]. One concern, and that is, again, I think targeting demand is important, but you may recall that there were commercials years ago, post-September 11, about drugs and how purchasing drugs is not only an issue of drugs, it also can finance terrorism. Senator Lieberman. Yes. Mr. Levitt. They were so poorly received by the public and it became a joke, which is the last thing we would want to do. So I am not a marketing expert, but my concern would be that it has to be done, it has to be done properly. I am not sure what the right exact message is---- Senator Lieberman. Because the public thought it was far- fetched? Mr. Levitt. Yes. Senator Lieberman. OK. That is something that the marketing and advertising experts at the brand name companies can answer better than I can. Lieutenant Stedman, Senator Collins asked a question which raised an interesting point about this problem obviously doesn't only exist in Los Angeles. It exists, I presume, anywhere there is a significant market for counterfeit goods, and that is a lot of places in the United States of America. What is your sense--a quick response, but what is your sense of to what extent others, particularly large urban police departments, or sheriff's offices, have focused efforts on stopping counterfeit sales? Lieutenant Stedman. I know New York had a huge problem. I know they are trying to put a dent in it like we are. Senator Lieberman. NYPD is on it. Lieutenant Stedman. That is correct. I was in New York over last summer and it was pretty rampant. I mean, my daughter tried to buy a purse and I dissuaded her, but---- Senator Lieberman. Good work. [Laughter.] Lieutenant Stedman. Yes. It was worse than even Los Angeles. It was everywhere, everywhere I walked down the street. But I know in New York, we talk to them often---- Senator Lieberman. That is what I was just going to ask. Do you all communicate on this problem? Lieutenant Stedman. We do. We have connections in most of the major metropolitan areas and we talk about people of interest, and we run across a lot of business records where different businesses are talking to each other, shipping back and forth. There is actually an overland trucking of this material from New York to California in some instances, or by train. So it doesn't just come through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. It comes overland, probably stops along the way. But between New York and Los Angeles, there is a huge transit. Senator Lieberman. This is obviously a national problem. It is an international problem. So let me ask you now, to what extent in the work that you are doing in Los Angeles you have received cooperation from Federal agencies. Lieutenant Stedman. We receive actually outstanding cooperation from the Customs Service and from---- Senator Lieberman. And this obviously has to do with---- Lieutenant Stedman. The ports. Senator Lieberman [continuing]. The counterfeit goods coming in. Lieutenant Stedman. Yes. They do a great job down there, but I am sure you have been to the port. You know how many containers come in every day. It is really shoveling sand against the tide. We do get great cooperation when we try and backtrack some of the shipments that come in from Customs. We have a great relationship with ICE agents. A lot of these people's immigration status is iffy. Senator Lieberman. Right. Lieutenant Stedman. And we invite them along with us when we think that might be the case. Senator Lieberman. So Customs and Immigration, good cooperation. How about Federal law enforcement, like FBI? Lieutenant Stedman. We speak to the FBI often. We deconflict every case that we do, because we never know where we are going or who we are going to be seeing that day. So we have five---- Senator Lieberman. What does deconflict mean in this case, for the record? Lieutenant Stedman. Deconfliction means that we are not stepping on somebody else's toes. Senator Lieberman. Another agency that is investigating, you mean? Lieutenant Stedman. That is correct. We have five members of the Sheriff's Department on the JTTF. We clear every investigation through them to make sure we are not stepping in the middle of an investigation that is already going on at the Federal level. Senator Lieberman. So that, in other words, you may be pursuing a counterfeit goods ring, but somebody else will be pursuing those same people for a terrorist investigation? Lieutenant Stedman. Exactly right. I don't get that information, but I make that attempt to make sure we don't bungle somebody else's investigation by either hitting the suspect too quick or not at all, so we do that on every case that we do. Senator Lieberman. Dr. Levitt, with your experience at the FBI, can you comment on whether you think the efforts to enforce anti-counterfeiting laws are getting enough attention and are sufficiently coordinated at the Federal level, particularly whether there is a clear sense of coordination between the FBI, Treasury, for instance? Mr. Levitt. Well, unfortunately, I really can't, only because I wasn't involved in any of that at the FBI. I was on the counterterrorism and on the intelligence side---- Senator Lieberman. Right. Mr. Levitt [continuing]. And that would have primarily been run through the Criminal Division. But I do know from my interaction with FBI officials and Treasury officials now that there is a tremendous amount of attention being given not only to this issue substantively, but to the nature of the cooperation. I think there is still some ways to go, but I am actually very pleased at the kind of attention that people at very senior levels are giving to making sure that the interconnectivity and the cooperation is improving. Senator Lieberman. That is encouraging. One last question. I am curious, a couple of times Paraguay has been mentioned. What is going on in Paraguay? Mr. Levitt. Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina, where those three countries meet is the triple border, or the tri-border area. Asuncion is a very big problem, and you can cross that border with great ease. It is beautiful. A very famous waterfall is there. Senator Lieberman. Right. Mr. Levitt. A great tourist attraction. And if there is ever any counterfeit good that you could ever imagine, it is there, and---- Senator Lieberman. Manufacturing is going on there, or---- Mr. Levitt. I don't know that there is manufacturing going on there. Senator Lieberman [continuing]. Or sales? Mr. Levitt. My sense is that it is all sales and that it is--basically, imagine this neighborhood in Los Angeles times I don't know how many---- Senator Lieberman. So what you are saying is that there is reason to believe that there is at least a Hezbollah presence there---- Mr. Levitt. We know there is a Hezbollah presence there. There is a Hamas presence there. It is a very serious problem. It is getting a lot of attention. Senator Lieberman. Thank you. Thank you, all three of you. You have really been excellent, and I hope we can take it from here. Thanks, Madam Chairman. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Senator. I want to thank our witnesses today for their fascinating and well-informed testimony. It was very helpful. We have had success in this country in shutting down some of the formal mechanisms, the financial mechanisms that terrorist groups have been using as well as closing down certain Islamic charities that have been used as conduits for terrorists to finance their operations. But as today's hearing shows, each time one avenue is closed down, another one is exploited by ever-resourceful terrorist groups, and counterfeiting, because it is extremely lucrative and easy to get into, is the mechanism that terrorist groups have discovered and are exploiting. I want to thank you for increasing our knowledge of this, and I hope this hearing will help promote better public awareness, as well, which I agree with Mr. Buckner is a key part of the solution in addition to looking at enhanced penalties, international efforts, and other means of cracking down on this problem. I want to thank the staff for their hard work on this hearing, and I particularly want to recognize the efforts of Bill Priestap, who is sitting quietly in the corner. He has worked for the Committee for the past 16 months as a detailee from the FBI. He was the one who suggested that we look into this area. He has worked very hard on a whole host of issues, but particularly the terrorism financing issues, and his work has been outstanding. I am very sad to have him go back to the FBI, but I do appreciate the Director allowing us to have him for more than a year's time and we very much appreciate the new role that he is going to be taking on at the Bureau in the new Intelligence Office. I would note, he starts his new job next week, so he is not even taking any time off between assignments. So, Bill, thank you for all your hard work, and we wish you well and will miss working with you. The hearing record will remain open for 15 days. I do want to announce that the Committee will be having a very brief business meeting after the first vote to act on some pending nominations, including that of Phil Perry, who has been nominated to be the General Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security. This hearing is now adjourned.

    "title": "Rick Gates Sentencing DELAYED AGAIN & FIRTASH UPDATE",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Posted on March 15 2019\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY AMERICA\n\nTurns out that Rick Gates is still cooperating and the joint Status Report states:\n\n\n\ndefendant Gates continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations , and accordingly the parties do not believe it is appropriate to commence the sentencing process at this time.\n\nNONE of this should surprise you.\n\n\n\nAnd while some might overlook this status report, I\u2019d like to remind you:\n\nINVESTIGATIONS , as in PLURAL\n\nNot to belabor the point, a vast majority of political and legal pundits got this wrong. As recent as this morning several were vociferously arguing that Gates\u2019 cooperation has (notice the past tense) reached its end and that Special Counsel\u2019s Investigation is effectively over. That SCO Mueller has (notice the past tense, again) completed his report and we should expect said report in late February 2019.\n\nI do not understand why the media continues runs with this (false flag) narrative or why they choose to believe and then amplify this disinformation. The likely culprit are always Team-Traitor-Thots...Giuliani who can not keep his mouth shut. Because according to Trump et al Mueller\u2019s Report was completed on or about February 26, 2019.\n\nNewsFlash it is NOW March 15, 2019 and we still do NOT have confirmation from Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s Office that his Report is done. Below are a few factually based rationales of why I refuse to believe anonymous reports that Mueller\u2019s investigation is winding down.\n\nWe know that Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s team does not leak, they are a black box and only speak through court filings.\n\nJanuary 2019, DC Chief Judge Howell extended the Grand Jury Term, pursuant to local rules it could extend for an additional six months.\n\nextend for an additional six months.\n\n\n\n\n\nMystery Company A & Foreign Country A, still awaiting SCOTUS determination. See archived twitter thread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlynn\u2019s Joint Status Report, seeking a 90 day continuance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiuliani predicted Mueller\u2019s Investigation \u201cwould end in two weeks\u201d based on his pronouncement, that was May 2018, see archived twitter thread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRick Gates recent FBI 302s. see entry here.\n\nWith respect to Rick Gates, remember he was in Trump\u2019s orbit throughout the 2016 Campaign, the Trump Inauguration, the Presidential Transition and was last spotted visiting the White House in late June 2017. Also do not forget that Tom Barrack hired Gates shortly after January 20, 2017 and terminated Gates\u2019 employment with Barrack\u2019s company shortly after the October 2017 indictment.\n\nWith respect to Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s Report, this was amplified by nearly all news outlets on February 22, 2019...even if we are to take the Justice Department\u2019s statement at face value that would have meant the SCO Report would have been submitted to the Attorney General on or about March 3, 2019. Yet still no such report or acknowledgement from Attorney General Barr.\n\nIf you are asking me what areas do I -think- Gates is fully and forthrightly extending his cooperation...specifically I\u2019d say with zero reservation:\n\nTRUMP INAUGURATION COMMITTEE\n\nNUCLEAR DEALS with Saudi Arabia ( George Nader )\n\nEven though my twitter account is no more, the funny thing is my awesome trolls/stalkers actually archived a large swath of my research. See this archive of my deeper dive into Trump\u2019s Inaugural Committee, found here and here.\n\nSee my previous Twitter Account where I aggregated why Tom Barrack is in it, Archive found here.\n\nSee my previous 2017 Twitter thread highlighting the trenche of letters from Senator Feinstein, Archive found here.\n\nSee previous 2018 archived twitter thread regarding Manafort-Gates trial and Manafort\u2019s strategy, found here.\n\nThis archived thread I pointed out that Manafort\u2019s lease agreement had Gates listed.\n\nAnd this archived thread from a few weeks ago concerning the August 2016 Grand Havana Room meeting with Kilimnik, Manafort and Gates. (it is still vexing to me that some of my threads are only available on Yandex\u2019s archive whereas American based cached pages no longer show my old twitter account, that\u2019s not weird at all, right?)\n\nFirtash Update:\n\nGranted Firtash is my pet, occasionally I like to play with him but oddly not that many people on twitter have given much credence to the ongoing and confounding random twist and turns to the Firtash matter.\n\nsee my archived twitter thread, found here. But the scoop-lette is just a few moments ago one of Firtash\u2019s defense attorney withdrew:\n\nDefendant Dmitry Firtash, pursuant to Local Rule 83.17, respectfully requests that the Court grant leave for Alison S. Cooney to withdraw as counsel in the above-captioned matter. In support of this motion,\n\nIt is a bit unusual because there isn\u2019t a clear reason stated why she is withdrawing but this is also the first docket activity since October 2018. See docket report below:\n\nUpdate #1\n\nI inadvertently overlooked that yesterday a new attorney entered an appearance in the Firtash matter, see below:\n\n-SpicyFiles Out..."

    "text": "In a CNN face-off between former independent counsel Ken Starr and President Clinton\u2019s former press secretary Joe Lockhart last week, Starr dropped a mini-bombshell, saying that he \u201cdisagree[s] with the Justice Department\u2019s guidelines\u201d that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\nStarr\u2019s comment is significant because it properly calls into question the regularly reported claim that President Trump \u201ccannot be indicted.\u201d\n\nFor non-lawyers, it\u2019s important to emphasize that the no-indictment \u201crule\u201d is not in the Constitution. It\u2019s not contained in an opinion by the U.S. Supreme Court. It\u2019s not in a statute. It\u2019s not even in an agency regulation (unlike the rules governing the special counsel\u2019s investigation, for example).\n\nIt\u2019s contained in a memo produced by lawyers in the Department of Justice at the apparent behest of President Clinton\u2014and on the heels of the Starr investigation. In an equally thoughtful and timely legal analysis, Starr\u2019s team concluded the opposite\u2014that \u201cPresident Clinton is subject to indictment and criminal prosecution, although it may be the case that he could not be imprisoned (assuming that he is convicted and that imprisonment is the appropriate punishment) until after he leaves office.\u201d\n\nWhy the disparity among legal \u201cexperts\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the argument against indicting a president has nothing to do with the availability of impeachment. The DoJ memo declares that \u201cthe Impeachment Clause could not itself be said to be the basis for a presidential immunity from indictment or criminal trial.\u201d\n\nSo where does the president\u2019s alleged immunity from indictment come from?\n\nThe argument is a wholly pragmatic one: In DoJ\u2019s words, \u201ccriminal proceedings against a sitting President should be barred by the doctrine of separation of powers because such proceedings would unduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the conduct of the Presidency.\u201d In short, if Trump were indicted, he wouldn\u2019t be able to execute his job as president to the best of his capacity.\n\nThis is a pretty thin reed upon which to hold the presidency above the criminal laws. After all, the Supreme Court already held in a case called Clinton v. Jones (yes that\u2019s Bill Clinton and an alleged sexual harassment victim, Paula Jones) that no sitting president is too busy to take the time to sit for a civil deposition to determine his potential liability for money damages to a single individual. And of course, the Constitution itself contemplates that quasi-indictment of the president via articles of impeachment and a trial in the Senate would not be too burdensome or distracting for a president.\n\nThere must be something special about a criminal indictment, then, that would make it extra hard for a president to execute the duties of his office. So hard, in fact, that the Constitution must be read implicitly (not expressly, mind you) to ban the practice.\n\nOn this point, the DoJ memorandum reasons, first, that \u201cphysical disabilities \u2026 imposed by criminal prosecution\u201d (meaning jail time, presumably) are a no-go. That\u2019s a hard one to dispute.\n\nBut the memo goes further, arguing second (and quoting from a prior DoJ memo on the subject, which was written during the embattled Nixon presidency), that \u201cthe President is the symbolic head of the Nation. To wound him by a criminal proceeding is to hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus, both in foreign and domestic affairs.\u201d\n\nIt would cause widespread damage to the symbolic stature of the office, in other words, to indict a sitting president.\n\nWith 17 ongoing investigations into Team Trump so far (not including the ramping-up congressional ones), this argument against criminal indictment of a president seems a bit na\u00efve, if not silly, in 2019.\n\nThe memo goes on to note that \u201c[a] criminal trial of a sitting President \u2026 would confer upon a jury of twelve the power, in effect, to overturn [a] national election.\u201d Of course, this is what happens whenever a sitting member of Congress is indicted for commission of crimes, and nobody cries constitutional foul then.\n\nThe easy answer to such a conundrum would be to indict a deserving president for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations\u2014which is generally five years for federal crimes\u2014and conduct the trial once the president is a private citizen and no longer in office. The DoJ memo doesn\u2019t address this seemingly easy fix to what is otherwise a full-blown constitutional crisis of unaccountability at the highest echelon of power in the United States.\n\nOne thing is for sure: If a sitting president made it a habit of shooting bystanders through the window of his limo while rolling down Fifth Avenue in New York, or if he regularly siphoned off U.S. Treasury funds to a personal bank account in the Seychelles, nobody would expect law enforcement to turn a blind eye because the Constitution somehow implicitly requires it. The constant refrain of \u201cyou can\u2019t indict a president\u201d is thus vastly overblown.\n\nMoreover, that a decision of such momentousness is being dictated by a 19-year-old internal memo drafted by unelected employees within the president\u2019s chain of command should trigger deep skepticism in all of us. The question whether it\u2019s constitutional for a president to be indicted can be resolved definitively only by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAnd the only way to get the question before that body is\u2014if warranted by the facts, of course\u2014for a grand jury to issue an indictment and see how things shake out for this president, and for those that follow."

    "text": "FILE - In this April 19, 2016, file photo, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and his wife Jane take a walk in State College, Pa. The Sanders Institute, a think tank founded by Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders\u2019 wife and son, has stopped accepting donations and plans to suspend all operations by the end of May. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)\n\nCONCORD, N.H. (AP) \u2014 The Sanders Institute, a think tank founded by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders\u2019 wife and son, is shutting down, at least for now, amid criticism that the nonprofit has blurred the lines between family, fundraising and campaigning.\n\nThe Vermont-based institute has stopped accepting donations and plans to suspend all operations by the end of May \u201cso there could not even be an appearance of impropriety,\u201d Jane Sanders told The Associated Press.\n\nThe unexpected move by the institute\u2019s board of directors comes as Bernie Sanders, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination, prepares for a wave of intense scrutiny into his political network and his family\u2019s role in its operation.\n\nAs a candidate in 2016, Sanders criticized Hillary Clinton over her family\u2019s nonprofit, saying the foundation run by Clinton\u2019s husband and daughter amounted to a back door for foreign leaders and others seeking to buy access and influence. The Sanders Institute could open the Vermont senator to charges of hypocrisy.\n\nThe institute was founded to promote liberal policies less than two years ago by Sanders\u2019 family with the backing of pro-Sanders celebrities and advocates\u2014 though Sanders himself had no formal role. While it operates at a fraction of the scale of the Clinton Foundation, it has accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars during its brief existence and has declined to disclose its donors.\n\nJane Sanders, who also serves as a chief adviser to her husband\u2019s presidential campaign, is not compensated for her role at the institute. Her son, David Driscoll, is paid $100,000 a year as co-founder and executive director. Driscoll previously was an executive for Nike and the Vermont snowboarding firm Burton, but had no previous nonprofit experience, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe lack of transparency and the family ties have drawn criticism from good-government advocates.\n\n\u201cFor a politician who runs on fairness and socialist principles, this looks like the old political games,\u201d said Lawrence R. Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Humphrey School of Public Affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s a product of running a political operation in which family rules the roost.\u201d\n\nJane Sanders said the institute will not accept more money so long as her husband is a presidential candidate. Driscoll and the organization\u2019s two other employees would be laid off with no severance by the end of May, and its Burlington, Vermont, office would be closed, she said. Sanders said questions of nepotism have no merit because the senator himself played no role in the organization, which was led by an independent board of directors.\n\n\u201cI think that was the most important thing to do \u2014 to not accept donations, because nobody should think that they\u2019re giving money to an organization and that gains them access or favor to anybody else and anybody running for office,\u201d she said in an interview this week. She added: \u201cIt just seemed the responsible thing to do.\u201d\n\nIn her own founding role at the institute, Jane Sanders acted as the organization\u2019s curator, both online and in person. She was the star of the organization\u2019s December \u201cGathering\u201d in Burlington, an assemblage of progressive speakers that included her husband as well as environmentalist Bill McKibben and actor Danny Glover.\n\nHer continued involvement with the institute and her active role in her husband\u2019s campaign could have raised questions about the nonprofit\u2019s tax status under federal law. The institute was founded under Section 501c3 of the U.S. tax code, which prohibits it from substantial involvement in influencing legislation or participating \u201cin any campaign activity for or against political candidates.\u201d\n\nThe institute\u2019s only available federal tax return showed it raised $459,000 in 2017. Jane Sanders told the AP that the group raised about $730,000 last year, much of it in \u201csmall donations from about 10,000 donors.\u201d\n\nWhen she unveiled the think tank in June 2017, Jane Sanders said she and her husband had donated $25,000. The institute also received a $105,000 loan from the Sanders-affiliated political action nonprofit, Our Revolution, which was repaid last summer.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t disclosed names and contribution amounts because we\u2019ve relied mainly on small donor contributions from thousands of people. The bulk of our donations come from donors that contribute less than $100,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cSome of our biggest contributors were organizations that came on to partner with us for the Sanders Institute Gathering, such as National Nurses United, Healthy Housing Foundation and Our Revolution.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 Senate campaign has stressed that both Our Revolution and the Sanders Institute have independent boards and are not directed either by his presidential campaign or his Senate office. But some figures have crossed easily between the groups. Institute fellow and Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner recently resigned as president of Our Revolution to be co-chairwoman of Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign. Turner could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nSome in the Sanderses\u2019 orbit expressed disappointment at the shutdown, suggesting concerns about nonprofits and disclosure were unfair and unnecessary.\n\nGlover, a founding board member, defended the Sanders family\u2019s involvement but acknowledged that critics within the Democratic Party would question the legitimacy of the institute whether the criticism was fair or not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sometimes important to play it safe,\u201d Glover said in an interview. \u201cThis is a very dangerous moment.\u201d\n\nOne of the many fellows at the institute, the former public policy director for the California Nurses Association, Michael Lighty, said he was proud of the policy work the institute spearheaded. As a fellow he worked on an exhaustive report examining the cost of Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan that was later presented to members of Congress.\n\nThe report was one of several accomplishments highlighted by the institute, which also produced a six-video series about climate change, a video series on threats to voting rights and additional content on student loan forgiveness and federal budget priorities.\n\n\u201cFrom my point of view, we went very far in terms of policy development and promotion,\u201d Lighty said in an interview. \u201cIn this political environment, the optics sometimes come to the fore in ways I wish they didn\u2019t. ... The dissolution will be seen by good-government people as a good thing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBraun reported from Washington."

    "text": "Under Trump, Witness Protection has been infiltrated by the Russian Mafia\n\nPatrick Simpson Blocked Unblock Follow Following Mar 14\n\nIn October 2017, Curt Weldon joined the board of advisors for Monarch Air Group, which had just completed its first contract with the Justice Department\u2019s Witness Security Division.\n\nMonarch Air is a known Russian mob front. This is such an open secret that a Conspiracy Theory website made up a story about how Monarch Air worked with the FSB to transport 370 Spetznetz troops to the United States to protect the Trump inauguration.\n\nIt was actually somewhat believable given the presence of a South Florida biker gang literally named after the Spetznetz with ties to Trump properties.\n\nWhy would the Trump Administrations Department of Justice allow a company that operates as a front for the Russian mob anywhere near the sacred halls of Witness Protection, not once, but twice? What was going on in June 2017 and January 2018 that warranted these contracts?\n\nContract on Gov Tribe between\n\nThe only reason these people have not ended up in prison is that it seems like Law Enforcement is too busy to communicate crimes across state lines.\n\nCurt Weldon is the author of the backchannel Ukrainian Peace Plan that Michael Cohen and Andrey Artemenko worked on and delivered to President Trump\u2019s now-convicted National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) sent inquiry letters to Cohen and Cambridge Analytica requesting correspondence with Weldon at the end of 2017, and some refer to him as Putin\u2019s first congressman. He is arguably the most significant tie between politicians in the United States and Putin\u2019s Government, and given his belief that he was betrayed by his own government, it may not be hard to guess where he stands.\n\nMonarch is significant because of the ties it represents. In USA vs. Alimzon Tokhtakhounov, Attorney Joshua Naftalis made a matter of fact statement that the defendants were using Monarch to funnel money and drugs on behalf of the Russian Mafia.\n\nIn this case, he was talking about the defendants Vadim Trincher and Anatoly Golubchik, who were in charge of the huge racketeering ring being run of out Trump Tower.\n\nThe Trincher family\n\nWhile Trincher and Golubchik were running what Attorney Joshua Naftalis referred to as \u201c one of the biggest bookmaking operations in the world.\u201d in New York, they were also running Monarch Air, Shuttleliner Cab of Ocala, Suncoast Air Cargo, and Skyway International out of Jacob Gitman\u2019s Kane Concourse Address in Miami. Andrey Artemenko himself runs a defense contracting company, Ancovi International, out of the same Kane Concourse address.\n\nOne of the Managers of \u201cAncovi\u201d is a company named Global Assets LLC \u2014 which was founded by Artemenko AND Vadim Netscheret. Netscheret is another tie to Michael Cohen as Cohen had to go to court to discuss why he gave the alleged mobster check for $350,000.\n\nMonarch is just one of the hundreds of interconnected companies registered out of the same office building in the Bay Harbor Harbor Islands, connected to one family lead by one Jacob Gitman.\n\nNatasha Bertrand reported last year that the Ukrainian Peace Deal was able to happen because Artemenko was introduced to Felix Sater through a mutual friend named Yan Aronov. Yan is a registered agent at one of these many companies.\n\nFAKE DEBT PORTFOLIOS AND THE RUSSIAN MOB\n\nIn 2017, Zeke Faux wrote an explosive Pulitzer Prize worthy article for Bloomberg about a topic I had no idea existed; Phantom Debt Portfolios.\n\nAs the story goes, scammers bought a whole load of personal information on the internet and packaged the information as loans that needed to be collected on. These portfolios get sold over and over and over again to hide the liability.\n\nHowever, they didn\u2019t count on the tenacity of a small town guy named Andrew. After one of the debt collectors threatened to rape his wife in a debt collection call, he transformed into what can only be described as the modern-day equivalent of the Marvel Anti-Hero, the Punisher. They threatened his family so he vowed never to stop searching.\n\nHe kept moving up the chain, taking down the payday loan industry, bit by bit when he found the supposed ring leader \u2014 Joel Tucker (and his brother Scott.)\n\nVery interesting connections existed from the outset of my reporting about the Joel Tucker case. For instance, Pay Day Loan Financier Del Kimball had to declare bankruptcy because Joel Tucker and his allies worked with Russian Payday loan magnate and son of the oligarch Igor Provkin to extort Kimball out of millions of dollars. In the Bankruptcy filings themselves, Kimball revealed that his business partner in Russia \u2014 Notorious Russian criminal Oleg Boyko was harassing him for payment of the monies Tucker stole and that he felt afraid for his life. Interestingly enough, Boyko was using Roman Abramovich as his intermediary.\n\nBoiko owned a condo in Trump tower from 1994 until he sold it to Gitman\u2019s business partner and convicted criminal Vadim Trincher in 2009.\n\nScott was convicted on 14 charges and sent to Prison. Six months after Bloomberg Article published the story, Joel was indicted on 15 counts and is due to in court later this year.\n\nAndrew, like Frank Castle, had finally caught his man.\n\nOr had he?\n\nThis is where it gets truly fascinating\n\nOn 8/27/18, the Attorney General of the State of New York filed a lawsuit against Hylan Asset Management and other related companies concerning the Phantom Debts.\n\nThe Web connecting Gitman and his associates to the Fake Debt Portfolios and Private Airlines\n\nAndrew Shaevel, a well-respected businessman from Buffalo was one of the principles involved in the Phantom Debt scheme. He ultimately claimed he was unaware of the fake debts being sold by his company, but email evidence showed that he was aware of it and did not stop buying up the fake debts.\n\nDisbarred former lawyer Jon Purzihansky was his Partner in the venture. In 2006, Purzihansky, himself a Russian born American Citizen was found guilty of helping a Russian mobster obtain a VISA on false pretenses. Hylan was accused of purchasing the Phantom Debt Portfolios through a Chicago area intermediary, Stark Law.\n\nAttorney Dennis Vacco is the lawyer Purzihansky and Shaevel hired to defend them. He is the former New York Attorney General, serving while Giuliani was Mayor of New York City .\n\nVacco is well known in New York circles for becoming the lobbyist for Waste Management months after settling an anti-Trust lawsuit against them. Michael Caputo also hired Vacco as his attorney in the \u201cTrump Russia\u201d scandal.\n\nAlong came the Gitman Family. Jacob Gitman, through a Brazilian Investment Company \u201cPrudent Investimentos\u201d purchased 200 million in the fake debt portfolios, while allowing Hylan to continue managing the portfolio.\n\nBizapedia lists Prudent as being registered in 2014, by Jacob Gitman, LGN International, and Roman Faizulin. Despite being registered by Gitman, Prudent was being run in public by Dennis Klemming. He has no connection to the company on any registrations forms that I\u2019ve seen.\n\nAccording to Open Corporates, the directors of Prudent are a Brazillian man, Edson Luis Paulino, and what appears to be a \u201cKSB International.\u201d\n\nKSB International is a Maltese company, formed six months before Prudent invested in the fake debt portfolios. In April 2016, KSB itself entered into an agreement to purchase part of the Phantom debt portfolios from Hylan. Roman Faizulin was the point of contact.\n\nLGN Internation, a registered agent for Prudent Investmentos, filed a lawsuit on behalf of KSB International, in 2017. The Lawsuit alleges that KSB International and Russian-Israeli mercenary Edi Gurlovsky reached an agreement to form KSB Holdings and work together to collect on the 60 million of phantom debts KSB had purchased from Hylan.\n\nOnce Gurlovsky was able to obtain the debt information, the lawsuit alleges that he formed his own collection company and transferred the phantom debts to said company.\n\nLiving in a world where two debt collectors can sue each other over debts that don\u2019t even exist is mind-boggling when you stop and think about it.\n\nKocharov Partner Alexander Nogueira with the Trump family.\n\nMichael Kocharov is yet another tie from Gitman to Trump. He is an owner of two Trump Tower Panama Properties, and also a registered agent for one of Jacob Gitman\u2019s companies. Kocharov\u2019s business partner Alexandre Ventura Nogueira was the primary broker for the Panama Project and is now a convicted felon.\n\n\u201cSIPHONING OFF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR PERSONAL PROJECTS\u201d\n\nJacob and his son David are embroiled in a contract dispute being played out in the Miami County court system. The Plaintiffs allege that the Gitman\u2019s siphoned 11 million dollars off of the contract they signed in 2012 for personal use through one of his companies, Basta Holdings (now known as Blackpoll Fleet International.)\n\nAside from this, the former Basta CFO, Andrew Logullo had his FINRA membership suspended due to corruption. This case connects a lot of dots the federal government should have connected long ago.\n\nJacob, David, and the Gitman family businesses have attempted to turn the case into one that blames another party. They started the case by convincing everyone around them that Boruch Freedman was the real decision maker and that they were unaware of the situation and just following directions.\n\nEvidence Freedman\u2019s lawyers collected throughout the case revealed that Freedman supposedly wasn\u2019t an officer in the company involved, nor did he fill out any of the bank paperwork. The Plaintiffs were able to convince the court to request his arrest, but he had already fled the country due to receiving threats from the plaintiffs. Further research has revealed that Boruch has been involved with Monarch Air since the beginning, and any claim of innocence is likely false.\n\nDuring the case, it was revealed that the Plaintiffs \u201cE.R. Troika\u201d are actually the mobsters known as the Khazakh trio. The Trio \u2014 Patokh Chodiev, Alijan Ibragimov and Alexander Machkevich \u2014 built their fortunes in the mining, oil and gas industry. They\u2019ve partnered with the Bayrock Group on developing Trump SoHo in the past and share extensive ties to Felix Sater.\n\nWhile this court case was ongoing, two of Jacobs children (Larry and David) were being served eviction notices for breaching their rental contracts. Interestingly enough, at least one of the brothers used their mother, Alisa, as a real estate agent. Alisa works for Sib Realty, the real estate agency that almost exclusively deals with Trump properties in Florida\n\nSources have placed Michael Cohen in the same world as Jacob Gitman on multiple occasions as well. There are pretty significant indirect ties between the two, but no smoking gun as of yet.\n\nThese aforementioned crimes mentioned above would send anyone to jail. Certainly, the Fake Debt scheme harmed more people than Hollywood Celebrities wasting money to get their kids into reputable colleges, but this happened because authorities across the country fail to share notes and lack the manpower to do the research needed to find the crimes.\n\nThe very fact that Monarch Air was able to sign two major Witness Security contracts with the DOJ while being tied to the Russian Mob is a story that should have been told months ago. My only hope is that somebody important in the Mueller investigation reads this article and acts appropriately.\n\nWhat is going on in Miami?"

    "text": "BAGHDAD\u2014\u201cISIS was looking for scientists,\u201d said Ahmed, a 36-year-old follower of the so-called Islamic State who holds a Ph.D. in medicinal chemistry and drug design. And Ahmed was looking for a chance to put his scientific knowledge to use.\n\nThis would not be theoretical research. ISIS and al Qaeda before it have been working since at least the 1990s to obtain biological and chemical weapons. But as with many gruesome enterprises, ISIS has been more methodical than its predecessors and competitors.\n\nWe do not yet know for sure the extent to which ISIS was successful and cannot confirm some of the claims made by Ahmed, but they fit with those made by an Iraqi geologist, Suleiman al-Afari, who told The Washington Post recently that he supervised a mustard gas production line for the Islamic State.\n\nWe also know that ISIS, through its global social media and internet recruiting, managed to create a corps of scientists interacting in person and on dark web forums to support the creation of a WMD arsenal, and Ahmed, whose name has been changed here, was part of the team. We interviewed him last month along with other ISIS prisoners being held in the Iraqi capital.\n\nAt the height of its power four years ago, ISIS\u2019 worldwide recruiting effort offered top dollar to equip labs and support scientists to an extent much greater than anything Ahmed had been offered in Iraq, which basically was nothing.\n\n\u201cI knew I could synthesize the biological and chemical weapons I researched on the web,\u201d he told us. \u201cI just needed the supplies and a well-equipped lab.\u201d\n\nU.S. coalition and Iraqi forces have recently announced the discovery of an installation in Mosul where ISIS was indeed working on such weapons, and Ahmed says he was involved in that same lab\u2019s operations.\n\nWe should be careful not to confuse the attempts by ISIS to develop and use chemical weapons with the infamous attacks launched by the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad. Of an estimated 300 such attacks in Syria in the course of the conflict there, a new study from the Global Public Policy Institute (PDF) estimates 98 percent are attributable to the regime, and only about 2 percent to ISIS.\n\nBut the group\u2019s aspirations in this regard, and some usage, is well documented. For instance, the group successfully deployed mustard and chlorine gas against the Kurdish Peshmerga. ISIS also set up a secret chemical weapons production facility in northern Iraq and has been quite innovative in using drones as dispersal devices for biological and chemical materials.\n\nSurprisingly, research on the extent to which the group used or desired to expand on the use of chemical and biological weapons remains rare and largely under-researched, as noted in a report published last year by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.\n\nAhmed, imprisoned inside the compounds of the Iraqi Special Operations Forces of the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Services, recounted in detail his rise from a promising but frustrated young scientist, to one who saw himself as a galvanized agent of social change at the time he joined ISIS, to his eventual capture.\n\nAhmed, like so many who joined and served ISIS, had come into contact with the group via social media while a Ph.D. student in India after a scientist friend, who was already working for them, encouraged him to join up.\n\nWhile initially attracted to the idea of an \u201cIslamic State,\u201d he claimed it was not so much the ideology as what he thought would be the ability to show off his scientific and technical skills that actually drew him to ISIS: \u201cAt first I was looking into their ideology because of their interest in science and technology. I was convinced I would join an authentic scientific community. Many scientists joined from many countries,\u201d he claimed in our interview. \u201cLots of nuclear physicists and engineers, especially from Russia joined them.\u201d\n\nAhmed said he did not ever join the group physically, but supported them virtually and substantially. Searching the worldwide web and pursuing scientific journals, some of which he hacked into, allowed him to pass on knowledge about manufacturing chemical and biological weapons to those scientists already working in the Mosul lab.\n\nWhile Ahmed started his work for ISIS by spreading this research and interacting on web forums on behalf of the group in 2015 and 2016, he fully intended to join the lab in Mosul upon his graduation and was confident of his ability to create the desired chemical and biological weapons. At the time, he believed ISIS was already an established state and would continue to expand.\n\n\u201cI would upload and [my research] would get read by the high command of the Caliphate,\u201d he told us. \u201cThey were interested in my posts and asked how we can acquire these chemicals. I also summarized books from a Russian website. There are loads of [scientific] journals I could access on the web and it\u2019s not classified. I told them everything was in my summary, but also told them, you must have a real lab.\u201d\n\nThe operation in Mosul succeeded in producing mustard gas, which it dispersed in various operations using drones. In Baghdad, we viewed pictures of victims allegedly burned in ISIS mustard gas attacks.\n\nAhmed and his research colleagues working in the Mosul lab were not the only ISIS members striving for biological weapons. A chilling arrest occurred as recently as June 2018, in Germany, when Sief Allah H, a Tunisian man living in Cologne, was arrested after preparing the deadly biological poison ricin, made from castor beans. Security sources told ICSVE\u2014the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism\u2014that the police knew of his activities and that he was following instructions provided over the internet by ISIS, and that police surveillance of the operation was terminated and arrests made after he succeeded, but before he was actually able to deploy the infamous compound.\n\nAhmed proudly boasted about his knowledge of computer science and the ability to modify, synthesize, and manufacture lethal weapons from raw substances, at times appearing highly ecstatic and fervent in his answers during the interview.\n\n\u201cThere are loads of scientific journals and it\u2019s not classified. You just have to access them through a scientific institution,\u201d said Ahmed, explaining how he managed to access the latest in science by going to the dark web and using a Russian website that cracked these journals\u2019 codes.\n\n\u201c My friend [in ISIS] told me about WMD, that they were interested in making mustard gas, nitrogen, and sulfur. Nerve agents are easy to synthesize \u201d \u2014 Ahmed\n\n\u201cI used Russian search engines that no one can penetrate and a Tor browser to hide and search,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cFor instance, the first item I put up for them was from the journal of Organic Phosphorus Chemistry about VX gas in Israel. It\u2019s a new generation nerve agent. The authors told how they made particle Isomers and structural modifications to enhance the activity of the gas in use,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cI can tell a scientist about how to carry out the organic synthesis for this in micro quantities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was one article on pyrophoric [flammable] materials from a hazardous materials journal,\u201d Ahmed went on. \u201cThese pyrophoric materials become flammable with water and moisture creating gas, fire and choking smoke to cause asphyxiation. The article was speaking about the flammability [of the materials] and what kind of gas was being generated, about the hazardous materials you could throw to troops, and on streets, on floating bridges, etc. All the necessary materials are available on the market... There was also a book from a Russian website about the experimental synthesis of all explosives. For me, I can synthesize any of these.\n\n\u201cMy friend [in ISIS] told me about WMD, that they were interested in making mustard gas, nitrogen, and sulfur. Nerve agents are easy to synthesize,\u201d Ahmed said, noting that he was disappointed that ISIS wasn\u2019t going further into the subjects he felt proficient in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like writing a paper. I can search and modify the structure. I passed this to them. If I gain access to a lab, then I can do it. In our lab in India [where he was studying] I learned how to synthesize theoretically. We take the structure into a software and see how it works on this nerve, then we try it on animals. I synthesized for anti-diabetic and anti-epileptic activity and it worked, so I know I can do it for these substances as well.\u201d\n\nAhmed, who does not appear particularly connected to his own emotions, insisted that his work for ISIS was to help them as a state to be able to defend against and repel attackers. When reminded that ISIS had been at war with the Iraqis, Syrians and Western powers at that point, he kept insisting that the weapons he hoped to build for them were only for defense.\n\nHe also seemed oblivious to ISIS\u2019s already deployed use of mustard gas against civilian populations. \u201cMy idea was to use weapons as a deterrent, not to be used against humankind.\u201d He also seemed oblivious to the extraordinary brutality of ISIS during the time he was working for them and much more interested in and excited by the recognition he could achieve.\n\nHe hoped to branch out from poisons and plagues to explore new technologies for delivering them. \u201cI learned in the engineering world they [ISIS] were interested in anti-aircraft missiles and drones. They complain about coalition jet fighters destroying their troops on the ground. The admin on the website, there was a guy on the website who provided links from a British university to make drones from organic synthesis to make the whole body of the drone. It was some kind of solution, liquid phase synthesis, polymer science. We have already developed anti-aircraft missiles. We were going to use them.\u201d\n\nIt appears that Ahmed was not particularly religious prior to joining ISIS. He articulated only a very rudimentary grasp of the Islamic faith, which he said he rarely practiced. \u201cI was not very religious. I was not looking for an Islamic State. They [ISIS] were more interested in science and technology. They were thinking forward. My family is interested in science and technology. I find religion suspicious.\u201d\n\nAlthough incongruous on its face, it has been common for many ISIS recruits to believe that somehow the Caliphate could fulfill their dreams, even if those had little to do with the way ISIS twisted the teachings of the Quran and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nAhmed said he was deeply dissatisfied with widespread corruption and sectarian discrimination in the Iraqi job market following the 2003 toppling of the Saddam regime. As a Sunni, and despite being qualified, he felt he was kept out of jobs in areas of national defense and in any government-sector related to science.\n\n\u201cPolitical things, the quality of the regime after 2003, it pushed me to interact and work against the regime,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked as a student in a lab in Iraq for four years. It was not possible to gain employment there. After, I worked in a pharmaceutical lab. It was totally corrupt. The whole facility was corrupt and it lacked in everything. I was completely frustrated. I considered it a primary school,\u201d he said.\n\nAhmed claimed he was compelled to look for jobs elsewhere, first in Qatar and then Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, but to no avail. His disconnected personality probably contributed to his failure in that regard, but all the same he was a gifted individual frustrated by his inability to pursue his chosen field\u2014until ISIS came along.\n\nAhmed was arrested in 2018 by the Kurdish security forces during an undercover counterterrorism operation in Erbil, the capital of the Iraq\u2019s Kurdish regional government. He was then handed over to the U.S. Army in Erbil for further interrogation and later transferred to Iraqi authorities in Baghdad.\n\nWhile Ahmed claimed he had stopped working for ISIS after he looked more closely into their violent Islamic ideology, he continued to see himself, as many jihadists are encouraged to do, as a sort of chivalric hero and, in his case, a chemical whiz kid.\n\nDuring our interview, he expressed regret over his decision to join ISIS.\n\n\u201cMy advice to everyone in the world is not to believe [ISIS] propaganda and media. Real jihad is to support your country and families and provide them with the best knowledge. Don\u2019t believe ISIS or join any upcoming group.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he seemed to still be angling for a job in his chosen field. Appearing to think we could bounce him out of prison, he offered to help the Americans now to fight ISIS. He had made a similar egotistic offer to the Peshmerga and also to others who had handled him following his capture.\n\nAhmed\u2019s story serves to demonstrate ISIS\u2019 horrifying ambitions and tryst with chemical and biological weapons in Iraq and Syria, nearly actualized through their power to attract scientists like him from around the globe.\n\nThese experts are capable of researching methods for and carrying out the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction from raw substances and materials that ISIS also appears adept at procuring.\n\nThe notion that ISIS and its operatives can deploy weapons of mass destruction outside of Syria and Iraq still remains far-fetched, but even if Ahmed is overstating his abilities by a considerable margin, there is no question that the Caliphate had a substantial group of capable scientists, engineers and technicians.\n\nISIS\u2019 capacity for innovation and the ability to replicate itself elsewhere\u2014that is, engage in transfer of tools and techniques learned abroad for use in Europe, Asia or the Americas\u2014must be taken seriously.\n\nThe Islamic State may have lost every last acre of the Caliphate in Iraq and Syria, but it lives on in the the minds of many who would inflict terrible attacks on its enemies, and may yet acquire the means to do so."

    "text": "In the latest round of sanctions aimed at Russian cyberattacks, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned five companies. Three are connected with one person, a Russian cybersecurity professional named Ilya Medvedovsky.\n\nMedvedovsky is CEO of ERPScan, with offices in Palo Alto, near Stanford University, as well as Amsterdam, Prague, and Tel Aviv. He\u2019s also CEO of Embedi, based in Berkeley and Tel Aviv. And finally, he is or was general director of Digital Security, one of Russia\u2019s leading information security consultancies. (Medvedovsky is described in some reports as a past employee of Digital Security, but he\u2019s described as general director in this TASS report.) All three companies were sanctioned June 11th by the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury stated that \u201cas of 2015\u201d Digital Security \u201cworked on a project that would increase Russia\u2019s offensive cyber capabilities for the Russian intelligence services\u201d including the FSB, the successor agency to the KGB. ERPScan and Embedi are described as being owned or controlled by Digital Security.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what connection, if any, Medvedovsky had to the FSB. I did come across an interesting press release on Digital Security\u2019s web site. In 2015, Medvedovsky presented a report at a conference organized by Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry titled \u201cCyberwar today: promising technologies of the future.\u201d\n\nSoftware and hardware solutions used in state institutions contain multiple vulnerabilities, and new, unexplained types of problems appear constantly. Recently it became known, for example, on the presence of vulnerabilities in the BIOS of motherboards and in the firmware of routers that are used in the public sector everywhere. All this opens up ample opportunities for cybercriminals and puts under attack not only business of large companies, but also national security. To confront threats, it is necessary to develop the country\u2019s protective cyber capabilities.\n\nMedevedovsky said in a statement that Digital Security has never been involved in politics. On his personal Facebook and Twitter accounts, he said he believes the sanctions were an act of retaliation. He says he has stepped on the toes of so many big U.S. companies by exposing some 600 vulnerabilities in the products of SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Cisco, and others. \u201cIt was only a matter of time before one of them lobbied like that,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u041d\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u041c\u044b \u0437\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0437\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443 \u0433\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0418\u0422-\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f \u0443\u044f\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0445, \u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435. \u2014 \u0418\u041c (@imedv) June 11, 2018\n\nDigital Security clients include Sberbank, Yandex, Mail.Ru Group, Rosselkhozbank, Gazprombank, UniCredit Bank, Bank VTB 24, Rafifeisenbank, Sibur, and Metalloinvest, several of which are also under sanctions.\n\nMedevedovsky is the author of a classic series of hacker books written in Russia, \u201cAttack via the Internet,\u201d which were bestsellers in 1997-2000.\n\nOn Medvedovsky\u2019s Facebook page, there was some talk of challenging the sanctions. But most of the replies seem to be high-fives over what an action the Russian hacking community seems to view as a badge of honor. \u201cBy current standards, it\u2019s like the order of merit in front of the fatherland,\u201d one commenter wrote."

    "text": "Separate sources with links to the diplomatic and intelligence communities report that Jared Kushner, son in law of Donald Trump and an adviser to the White House, blackmailed both Qatar and Saudi Arabia after his father in law was elected. Kushner then changed US foreign policy to benefit himself, punishing Qatar and rewarding Saudi Arabia when the former refused the bribe and the latter paid up, these sources said.\n\nAccording to these sources, Kushner asked both Qatar and Saudi Arabia to invest in his troubled real estate empire. Qatar initially refused; Saudi Arabia agreed.\n\nIf you enjoy our reporting, please consider a donation. Patribotics is totally reader-supported. Thank you for keeping us going!\n\nFollowing these meetings, sources said, Mr. Kushner changed US foreign policy in order to benefit himself. The long-standing policy of neutrality between Qatar and Saudi Arabia was altered and Saudi Arabia was permitted to blockade Qatar \u2013 despite the United States forward headquarters for CENTCOM being located there.\n\nDonald Trump also tweeted against Qatar and in favor of Saudi Arabia imposing the blockade as Kushner changed US foreign policy to enrich himself.\n\nSo good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding\u2026 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017\n\n\u2026extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017\n\nIf these sources are correct, as I reported earlier, this would explain why Jared Kushner has been seen befriending the murderer of Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed Bin Salman. Bin Salman knows that Kushner extorted him for money, and can threaten to tell the Special Counsel this, keeping Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump, and by extension Donald Trump, at his mercy. However, public reporting suggests the Mueller report is imminent, and these sources said that Mueller\u2019s office is well aware of extortion practiced by Mr. Kushner, and by other members of the Trump family. As we reported earlier:\n\n\u201cKushner is the administration\u2019s so-called Middle East expert, a job for which Trump granted a basic security clearance after Chief of Staff John Kelly had it downgradedfrom TS/SCI to \u2018Secret\u2019.\n\nThe White House reviewed the background investigation by the FBI on Kushner and then granted \u2018Top Secret\u2019 clearance, which it has the right to do whatever the FBI report says; but the CIA prevented Kushner from regaining the TS/SCI clearance that Kelly effectively stripped from him. The stripping followed accusations that Kushner had given names of MBS opponents taken from the Presidential Daily Briefing to MBS in Saudi Arabia, which resulted in the Prince\u2019s torture purge of his opponents.\u201d\n\nIt was revealed this week in the New York Times that General Kelly was overruled by Donald Trump who insisted on granting a security clearance to Jared Kushner despite General Kelly\u2019s actions, and the recommendations of the FBI and the CIA.\n\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here .

    "text": "Sources with links to the intelligence community report that Donald Trump is being investigated for trafficking underage girls into the United States for sexual abuse, under the guise of his shell modeling company, Trump Models.\n\nThese sources report that Trump is linked to a Russian-based human trafficking enterprise, where girls and women were kidnapped into sexual slavery. This includes underage girls and minors.\n\nThe human trafficking arrests made recently in Europe, and several human trafficking cases in the United States, are linked to the same paedophile ring, these sources say.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate make a contribution here. , there are buttons around the site, or you could\n\nFurthermore, the sex trafficking of girls and underage children is linked to the Russian government via the same internet data that links Hostkey, the Russian hackers of the American election, with Mir Telemakti. They all share a registrant address in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nSources report that this nominal internet services provider, Dragonara Alliance, is in fact a mere intranet, over which Russian organized crime sponsored by Vladimir Putin discusses the kidnap and rape of girls. Dragonara Alliance was traced back to various IP addresses shared by Hostkey and Mir Telemakti. An intranet needs publicly to exist, these sources say, as an IP provider, in order that its existence not cause questions. But the NSA is deep inside Dragonara Alliance\u2019s servers, and can read their packet data. It provided material assistance to Europol and Interpol in making recent arrests, these sources say.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s company, Trump Models, recently locked its account on Twitter. It has been listed as paying women slave wages, and Trump has been accused of bringing in girls illegally, making them work without visas for nothing and housing them 11 to a room.\n\nTrump Model Management recruited models as young as 14\n\nDespite the scrutiny, Trump Models has deleted its Instagram account. Sources report Trump cannot provide accounts showing Trump Models was ever a legitimate business. There are multiple public reports that the agency forced girls to work for slave wages. The Daily Beast\u2019s Michael Gross also reported that Donald Trump personally pimped out underage girls from parties at his own hotels. For this, Trump, and his children Don Jr, Eric and Ivanka Trump, all part of Trump International Hotels management, may be held liable, sources say.\n\nFurther, sources report that Smart jet Aviation LTD, which uses SmartJet.ru and Jetorama.com, is an aviation company used to ferry trafficked females around. Smart Jet purchased a lot of fuel and acts as a broker for private flights. Again, sloppy opsec had the company registered to the same PO Box as Hostkey in the British Virgin Islands. The Smart Jet Aviation registrants use a type of trolling familiar to the student of the Trump-Russia \u201cPO Box 3469\u201d address, the use of a Russian scientist as a pseudonym for the registrant. However, they were dumb enough to use an email address connected with \u201cbizarrebrain.com\u201d where they forgot to take the real name of the registrant, one Damir Valiullin, off the site. Damir links in the Panama Papers to Dennis Kolyago, who is a senior executive with a regional Russian fuel company. This may explain all Smart Jet Aviation\u2019s purchases of airline fuel for human trafficking.\n\nJetSmarter, a company linked to Donald Trump and the Russian mob, used to be called Smart Jets Inc in the United States, but it is not known if it is the same company as \u201cSmart Jet Aviation.\u201d\n\nJetSmarter maintains it is a legitimate business. Sources say it is under counterintelligence investigation for Russian mob activity. Its former CEO , Edward Barsky, was a mobster who has invested in Sunny Isles, Florida.\n\nBarsky was also executive chairman of local real-estate development company Verzasca Group, according to a 2015 press release issued by the company.\n\nAnd it is directly linked to Donald Trump through both Barsky and Mike Flynn and Ron Torossian. Researcher Louise Neu showed on Twitter that Torossian was a spokesman for Michael Cohen\u2019s partner, and also wrote the pro-Turkey op-ed attributed to Mike Flynn. Torossian was forced to amend his FARA earlier this year.\n\nDmitry Sorokin, the current COO of Smart Jet Aviation, is also listed on LinkedIn as the head of Red Square Holding. Red Square Realty is linked to Donald Trump\u2019s own Miami properties and to the Russian mob, as we have previously reported.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s PACs also accepted funding from companies linked directly to the Smart Jet Aviation and Hostkey P.O. Box.\n\nIs it a coincidence that Smart Jet Aviation, registered to the same PO Box as Hostkey, hackers of the Russian election, and Jet Smarter, BOTH share investors with Donald Trump\u2019s properties in Miami, Florida? Is it also a coincidence that JetSmarter used to be called \u201cSmart Jets\u201d in America?\n\nPossibly so. The company declined to comment. But what is definite is that Smart Jet Aviation is being investigated for human trafficking with Dragonara Alliance used for the communications; and Donald Trump is being investigated for human trafficking with Trump Models. JetSmarter is under investigation for Russian mob ties, and Smart Jet for trafficking girls into misery, rape and death. Industrialized child abuse has been carried out on behalf of Vladimir Putin. And for Donald Trump himself, a locked Twitter and deleted Instagram are not going to save him."

    "text": "In mid-January, a delegation from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) traveled to Washington, seeking to convince the CIA to resume the military aid frozen under President Donald Trump. Otherwise, the group argued, Iran's influence would continue to grow in Syria. There was little they could do to counter that on their own, said Mustafa Sejari, an FSA commander.\n\nThe situation was urgent, Sejari told the Reuters news agency. \"It is time to turn words into action. Until now on the ground it's the Iranian militias that are expanding without serious resistance,\" he said. \"We asked for the resumption of aid and explained the dangers of leaving moderate FSA forces without support.\"\n\nEvents a week later showed what Sejari was talking about.\n\nAround 35,000 FSA fighters moved into the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, side-by-side with Turkish forces. The FSA was formed in July 2011 as a group of secular opponents to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and now, in January 2018, it is fighting Syrian Kurds\u2014 that is, the citizens of the very country whose democratic and republican nature the FSA once defended.\n\nFSA fighters teamed up with the Turkish military in the assault on Afrin\n\n'The FSA is a smokescreen'\n\nThe decision to fight against citizens of one's own country is the result of the widely non-transparent, constantly changing alliances that characterized the varied Assad opponents at an early stage of the insurgency. The FSA has been on a political and most of all military odyssey in recent years \u2014 and at its end, the group's initial nature has been reversed.\n\n\"The Free Syrian Army practically doesn't exist,\" Kamal Sido, a Mideast expert at the human rights group Society for Threatened Peoples (GfbV) told Germany's Deutschlandfunk broadcaster. \"The Free Syrian Army is a smokescreen hiding various names, and if you look at the names, at these groups' videos, you'll find they are radical Islamist, Jihadist groups.\"\n\nIdeological division\n\nA large part of the groups on the FSA ticket represent Islamist programs, some more moderate, others more radical. Some groups continue to pursue secular goals. Charles Lister of the Brookings Institution think tank lists almost 80 different factions that identify with the FSA brand. They often pursue completely different political goals, and their military action varies as well.\n\nThe term FSA suggests a unity that is a thing of the past.\n\nSyria has been embroiled in civil war since 2011\n\nThe demise of the group's ideology follows on the heels of its military disintegration. The US, which stood behind the moderate opponents of Assad in the Syrian war, never saw the FSA as a fully reliable partner, and feared the aid they gave the group might fall into the hands of Jihadist fighters like the \"Islamic State.\" That skepticism has carried over from the Obama to the Trump administration, which is reluctant to arm the FSA.\n\nSeeking a strong partner\n\nAs a result, the FSA is searching for other allies, and has inched closer to often well-equipped Jihadist groups. They feel as though they have had little choice given the military pressure exerted by the Assad regime. And so, Washington's concerns of backing the wrong partner appears to tragically have come true: The lack of support contributed to creating the kind of group the US did not want to back in the first place. Some of these radical groups are now marching on the Kurds alongside Turkey.\n\nBut only some of the FSA units are fighting on Turkey's side. \"The broadly delineated lines that existed for some years are now fuzzy; the days when the supporters of the Al Assad regime were on one side and FSA on the other have gone,\" wrote journalist Faisal al-Yafai in UAE newspaper The National.\n\nAfter years of bloody conflict, the FSA has turned to Turkey for support\n\nWar in the name of the Republic\n\nThe attack on Afrin highlights the consequences of that collapsed front. Jihadists and secular forces \u2014 all using the FSA brand \u2014 marched alongside the Turks. Many who support the revolution are in favor the idea of maintaining Syrian territorial integrity, an integrity they see threatened by the Kurds in Afrin, according al-Yafai.\n\nThe FSA fears the region in northwestern Syria might one day no longer be Syrian territory, but Kurdish territory, perhaps even part of an independent Kurdish state. That is a goal the Democratic Union Party (PYD) that rules the region around Afrin rejects, but Turkey and the FSA marching by its side are both wary.\n\nThere is one discrepancy the FSA can't elude: The people they attack in the name of Syrian territorial integrity are Syrian Kurds, members of the republic the FSA pretends to be defending. Political ideology and military practice contradict one another.\n\nIt seems as if the uprising in Syria no longer has a goal. Supported by Russia and Iran, Assad is still in power. It is less clear what the rebels of yore are continuing to fight for these days."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "EMBED >More News Videos There have been dozens of twists and turns since \"Empire\" start Jussie Smollett reported being attacked. Here are some key moments from the start of this story.\n\nAs Supt Johnson stated, allegations against Mr. Smollett are shameful & if proven, they are an affront to the people of Chicago who embraced him as a neighbor & respected him as a role model. We stand behind the work of detectives & refer any comment on indictment to prosecutors https://t.co/7bFECluCSP \u2014 Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) March 8, 2019\n\nCHICAGO (WLS) -- A Cook County grand jury has returned a 16-count indictment against \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett.The Cook County State's Attorney's Office confirmed the indictment, which they said was returned by a grand jury on Thursday.Smollett was originally charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office on Feb. 20.Now the grand jury has returned 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.The TV actor claimed he was the victim of a vicious hate crime in the Streeterville neighborhood on Jan. 29. He said two men physically attacked him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, threw a chemical liquid on him and looped a rope around his neck.The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, one of each lie Smollett allegedly told. The first set are related to what Smollett told officers about the alleged attack, including that the attackers called him racial and homophobic slurs, struck him with their hands, put a noose around his neck, and poured some sort of chemical substance on him.The second set of charges are related to the second interview Smollett had with police about the alleged attack later that day, saying the men attacked him from behind and he fell to the ground, at which point the men continued kicking him. Smollett also told police on this occasion that one of his attackers was white.The two sets of charges correspond to two sets of police officers Smollett allegedly lied to.A charge of felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report carries a possible sentence of probation to three years. Smollett already pleaded not guilty to the first disorderly conduct charge. He was taken into custody and posted $100,000 bond to be freed.Experts believe it is likely he will strike a plea deal and potentially not spend time in prison.Smollett's attorney Mark Geragos released a statement addressing the indictment Friday night:Two days after the alleged attack, Chicago police released surveillance images of two people they said they considered persons of interest in the attack.But the investigation turned on Smollett. He's now accused of allegedly orchestrating the attack with the Osundairo brothers, who he knew. One brother was an extra on \"Empire\" and the other was Smollett's personal trainer.Prosecutors say Smollett paid the Osundairo brothers to pull off the staged attack.Smollett had also reported a threatening letter sent to him on the \"Empire\" set containing a white powder, a week before the alleged attack. The letter is currently in the FBI crime lab for analysis, sources said, and experts believe Smollett could face federal charges for allegedly sending the letter.Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor initially faked a letter using racist and homophobic language. When that didn't get attention, Johnson said, Smollett paid two brothers $3,500 via personal check to stage the attack, because he was \"dissatisfied with his salary.\"Chicago police have launched an internal investigation stemming from what they said were inaccurate leaks during the three week investigation into the alleged attack, but Superintendent Johnson stands by his officer's work."

    "text": "(CNN) Senior leaders at the Justice Department did not want Bruce Ohr interacting with the White House after his contacts with Trump opposition research dossier author Christopher Steele became known, according to newly released testimony from Ohr's closed-door congressional interview last year.\n\nOhr was demoted in December 2017 from his position as an associate deputy attorney general in part because he did not tell the department soon enough about his contacts with Steele, an ex-British intelligence official. But Ohr told Congress he was later stripped of another title the next month, running a Justice Department organized crime task force, for a different reason that came from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: the White House.\n\n\"I was told at the time that the attorney general and the deputy attorney general didn't want me in a position where I would be interacting directly with the White House,\" Ohr told the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees.\n\nOhr, who sparked the ire of President Donald Trump for his role as a middle man between the FBI and Steele, was one of numerous Justice Department and FBI officials the committees interviewed last year as part of the Republican-led investigation into the FBI and DOJ handling of the investigations into Hillary Clinton and Trump and Russia.\n\nOhr's August 2018 testimony was released Friday by Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, who made the transcript public without consulting with the panel's Democratic chairman and ignoring proposed redactions by the Justice Department.\n\nMuch of Ohr's testimony has already been reported and his role in the Russia investigation is well known: Ohr met with Steele and Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, and passed along information he was provided to the FBI, which was investigating Trump campaign contacts with Russians. Ohr's wife also worked for Fusion GPS as a contractor researching Russia.\n\nLast year, Trump repeatedly attacked Ohr on Twitter and questioned why he was still employed by the Justice Department.\n\n\"Is it really possible that Bruce Ohr, whose wife Nellie was paid by Simpson and GPS Fusion for work done on the Fake Dossier, and who was used as a Pawn in this whole SCAM (WITCH HUNT), is still working for the Department of Justice?????\" Trump tweeted in October.\n\nThe 236-page transcript filled in more details into Ohr's testimony and role in the FBI's Russia probe.\n\nAmong the previously reported details in Ohr's testimony was his disclosure of meeting Steele at a breakfast with his wife in July 2016, around the same time that the FBI was opening its counterintelligence investigation.\n\nAt the breakfast, as CNN previously reported and the transcript confirmed, Ohr said that he was told by Steele that the former head of the Russian foreign intelligence service thought they had Trump \"over a barrel.\"\n\nOhr provided the FBI with a memory stick of information from Steele and Simpson, as well as one from his wife, but he did not look at either.\n\n\"I don't plug any (memory) stick that anyone gives me, even my wife, into a work computer,\" he said.\n\nTranscript from GOP-led probe\n\nIn December, the Republicans leading the probe into the FBI and the Justice Department said in December they planned to make all of their interview transcripts public, after giving the agencies a chance to review them for classified or other information they did not want public.\n\nBut Republicans have grown frustrated with the pace of those reviews. Collins said Friday that the proposed DOJ redactions \"have nothing to do with national security and are anathema to our goal of government transparency,\" and therefore he was releasing the transcript in full.\n\nThe Georgia Republican told reporters that he would eventually release the committee's other interview transcripts, such as those with former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page \u2014 who both worked on the Trump and Clinton investigations and exchanged anti-Trump text messages \u2014 but he did not have a timeline for those releases.\n\n\"People anticipate the Mueller report soon. Will he find any so-called collusion? Or was the only collusion among agency personnel who hated the president and started this investigation?\" Collins said Friday.\n\nDemocrats said that Republicans were trying to use the transcripts from the previous Congress as way to distract from the new Democratic investigation into the President.\n\n\"All of this is a completely irrelevant distraction from the massive corruption that is surfacing in the Trump administration and the White House,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sat in for most of the closed-door interviews last year. \"And so they're basically posting graffiti with all of these sideshow escapades.\"\n\nOhr explains Steele interactions\n\nIn the testimony, Republicans pressed Ohr to explain why Steele and Simpson, who were being paid by the law firm representing the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, used him to provide their information to the FBI, rather than go directly.\n\nOhr told the committees that he had known Steele for nearly a decade, and he had passed along information previously, too. He said he didn't know for sure why they came to him, but that he felt he had an obligation to give it to the FBI.\n\n\"Part of my job, as I saw it, as having been for a long time responsible for organized crime at the Department, was to try to gather as much information or introduce the FBI to possible sources of information, whatever ways to further the program's goal,\" Ohr said.\n\nRepublicans have accused the FBI of masking the political origins of the opposition research dossier when it was used to obtain a foreign surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\nOhr testified that he did inform the FBI that Steele was being paid from a political source. \"I didn't know they were employed by the DNC, but I certainly said, yes, that -- that they were working for -- you know, they were somehow working associated with the Clinton campaign,\" Ohr said.\n\nRepublicans have also pointed to Ohr's testimony to say that Steele was politically biased. Ohr told the committees that he \"definitely got the impression (Steele) did not want Donald Trump to win the election,\" though he could not remember if he said it directly.\n\nBut Ohr disputed that he was a \"backchannel\" to Steele for the FBI, which had stopped talking to him in October 2016 over his contacts with the media. Ohr said the bureau gave him a main \"point of contact,\" an agent named Joe Pientka, in case he had anything to report.\n\n\"I don't know what the FBI's thinking was specifically,\" he said. \"They just told me that if I received information, that there would be an agent that I could talk with.\""

    "text": "Special counsel Robert Mueller has finally submitted his long-awaited report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and any contacts Trump campaign associates may have had with Kremlin officials. And while we don't know what Mueller and his investigative team say in that report \u2014 or what will eventually make its way to the public \u2014 there are regulations in place that present a road map for what should happen next.\n\nHere's what will occur now that Mueller and his team have completed their report:\n\nIt goes to the new attorney general, William Barr\n\nPresident Trump's newly-confirmed attorney general now oversees the Mueller investigation, and he's the person who receives Mueller's confidential report. In that report, according to Justice Department guidelines, Mueller must explain his \"prosecution and declination decisions.\" Barr will then submit a report to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees explaining Mueller's findings and why the investigation ended.\n\nJustice Department guidance stipulates Barr should only submit a \"brief notification\" containing \"an outline of the actions and the reasons for them.\" What that means is probably open to some interpretation, but anyone hoping for a massive Starr Report-like document \u2014 from either Barr or Mueller \u2014 is likely to be disappointed. The current special counsel guidelines were written in large part because lawmakers decided the 1998 report by independent counsel Ken Starr, which contained graphic details about President Bill Clinton's sexual liaisons, went too far in publicizing private misdeeds.\n\nBarr can decide to make much of Mueller's report public if he deems it in the public interest. But during his confirmation hearings in January, the attorney general was cagey on how much of the report he might make public, saying he would need to have a better understanding of the regulations governing the investigation and what the special counsel report would look like to make a final decision.\n\nAlternatively, Barr's report to Congress could contain relatively little information about Mueller's findings.\n\nWe may never see Mueller's full report\n\nThe report Barr receives will be confidential, and because it's possible Mueller's report may also contain extremely sensitive information regarding how the intelligence community collects information, much of it could stay under lock and key for some time.\n\nMueller's report is likely to explain why he declined to prosecute some individuals and, as Barr noted during his confirmation hearings, the Justice Department tends not to reveal why it did not prosecute someone. However, that policy is not absolute.\n\n\"The policy is designed to protect targets of investigations if the evidence does not support indictment. This situation may be different if the Justice Department does not indict President Trump because it concludes that a sitting president cannot be indicted,\" explained CBSN legal contributor Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School and a former Manhattan assistant district attorney.\n\n\"The public interest in keeping the information private is not the same,\" Roiphe added. \"In fact, the public interest is the opposite, because the broad principle that no person is above the law would mean that Congress and the public must have access to the evidence to hold the president accountable through impeachment or political process.\"\n\nThe current legal opinion of the Justice Department is that sitting presidents cannot be indicted. If Barr adheres to that opinion, which he is not legally bound to do, he could decide to withhold information in Mueller's report that implicates the president.\n\nBut as legal expert Neal Katyal \u2014 who wrote the underlying regulations governing the special counsel investigation \u2014recently explained in The New York Times, if Mueller's report suggests that the president should be indicted, Barr would have to tell Congress whether he overruled the special counsel's recommendation and explain that decision to lawmakers.\n\nThe purpose of the regulation, Katyal said, is partly to allow Congress to act as a check on the president if the Justice Department insists a president cannot be indicted. But the report would need to be substantive enough to help Congress do that. Grand jury testimonies contained in Mueller's report are also likely to remain secret unless a court orders them made public. Some argue that a court could release the material if Congress issues subpoenas.\n\nHow Mueller's report could become public\n\nDuring Barr's confirmation hearings, Senate Democrats said they wanted Mueller's report released to the public in full, with the exception of any sensitive intelligence matters. And Barr testified before Congress that he wants to release as much of it as he can, \"consistent with the law.\"\n\nIf the Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee wants more information than Barr provides, it could also subpoena Mueller's report, setting up a potential battle with the White House over executive privilege, national security and the role of grand juries. That would send the decision to release Mueller's report to the judiciary."

    "text": "Patribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nPART ONE: PAWN TAKES QUEEN\n\nI have an overarching theory of Russia\u2019s attack on America and the West. Here it is.\n\nThere have not been a series of attacks on America and Europe by Vladimir Putin. There has been one single operation; it is the same operation.\n\nBy 2008, possibly even earlier, according to John Schindler, a National Security expert formerly at the NSA, Russia had placed moles in the highest levels of US counter-intelligence. I take this as my starting-point, because all the subsequent facts bear it out.\n\nMr. Putin always wanted to use the strength of the West as a lever to attack it, because Russia is weak and poor. So he did, and he used a very old-fashioned and effective method. Spies inside the IC. He also believes in propaganda and mind-games. He uses them on the West, he uses them on Russians, in Russia.\n\nHillary Clinton correctly noted that Putin rigged his own election in 2011. This, apparently, is when he started to hate her.\n\nBy the 2012 election, Russia\u2019s desire to interfere with American democracy was already there, but it as yet didn\u2019t have the tools to succeed in that aim. I deliberately omit some of the timeline here in order to get to the bigger points in the story, but I will return to it later.\n\nRussian moles placed inside the NSA recruited Edward Snowden. A letter between the FSB in Cuba and SENAIN in Quito held in a file marked \u2018Assange\u2019 in London, dated 4th April 2013, the day before Snowden sent his only email on legalities, April 5th 2013, and before Snowden took his uppermost level documents during the rest of the month of April, proves conclusively that Mr. Snowden is a Russian agent who acted on instructions from Moscow. After Snowden fled to Hong Kong, he escaped from there by an Ecuadorean travel document arranged by Julian Assange, and tried to get to Cuba.\n\nSnowden is a low-level IT idiot. He had help taking what he took from the NSA. I recommend the NSA review their case files and pick up the Russian moles within their agency. Snowden used stolen credentials, but it is almost certain that he received a piece of removable media like a memory card from his Russian handlers. He took military secrets. And by \u201che\u201d I mean the FSB.\n\nIn 2013, after the Russians received all of the Snowden files, and China some of them, most press coverage concentrated on the traps that terrorists and Russian spies were able to avoid. They missed that Russian hackers would now proceed to use the NSA\u2019s tech offensively.\n\nIn 2013, the Russians briefed their army of hackers.\n\nIn 2012/13, a young Russian hacker called Yvegeny Nikulin, then 26, was using Snowden\u2019s NSA techniques \u2013 stolen credentials \u2013 to hack LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring.\n\nFormspring, which shut down late 2013, was the app that Anthony Wiener used for his sexting.\n\nAccording to John Schindler, \u201ca hacker\u201d(Nikulin) was picked up in Prague, October 5th, on suspicion of interfering with the DNC and the Democrats in America\u2019s election. He had been sought on an FBI red warrant.\n\nHe is being extradited to the United States (if Jeff Sessions, a Russia partisan who recruited the spy Carter Page into Team Trump, does not try to stop it) over strong protests from Russia. The DoJ announcement on his indictment mentioned not only Formspring, but \u2018a count of conspiracy\u2019 and \u2018sending a code to a computer\u2019.\n\nIt was three years later. Nikulin was now 29.\n\nOn Oct 26, Rudy Giuliani joked on television about a big surprise coming in the election that would turn things around for Trump.\n\nOn Oct 28, Director James Comey of the FBI announced that more as yet unexamined emails had been found on an old laptop of Mr. Wiener\u2019s.\n\nMr. Putin, it is my surmise that some of the Russian moles inside US counter-intelligence work within the FBI\u2019s criminal division, and particularly, within the New York field office.\n\nIt is my surmise that your hacker, Nikulin, sent a command buried in a virus earlier transmitted by Formspring to \u2018wake up\u2019 that old computer and either find, or place, emails from Huma Abedin on to it, and that you then contacted your moles inside the NYPD/ FBI NY and told them to \u201csuddenly find\u201d emails that, the expectation was, could not possibly be combed through in time before the election.\n\nYour agents within the FBI Field Office then did a number of additional things.\n\nFirstly, they illegally spoke to any friendly press and the Trump campaign about putative ongoing criminal investigations into the Clinton Foundation and the matter of her email server.\n\nThey told Fox News\u2019s Brett Baier that Hillary Clinton \u201cWould soon be indicted\u201d and this was reported on TV, and then retracted after the damage was done.\n\nThey told your agents of influence, Rudy Giuliani and X Kallstrom, that \u2018a group of active FBI agents\u2019 had demanded Comey release his letter. Both of them stated as much, Mr. Giuliani specifying \u2018active\u2019 FBI agents.\n\nThey used your agent General Flynn \u2013 I scorn to use \u2018of influence\u2019 in this case, Flynn knew what he was doing \u2013 to say on live television that active FBI agents were talking to him about an going \u2018criminal investigation\u2019\n\nAnd they told the New York Times that the FBI \u2019Saw No Clear Ties to Russia\u2019 in the matter of the Russian bank servers. And the New York Times printed it, even though they, the Times, knew it was false.\n\nBefore the election, only I reported, correctly, that the FBI\u2019s Counter-Intelligence division in Connecticut had obtained a FISA warrant for \u2018any US persons\u2019 relating to the two banks involved in the Trump Tower server; Alfa Bank and SVB Bank.\n\nSo your moles in the NSA recruited Ed Snowden in 2012/2013.\n\nYou got to work using NSA hacking techniques. Stealing legit credentials features often. You hacked Wiener in 2013 via Formspring. You waited.\n\nYou used your moles in the FBI Field Office and, in 2016 at the right moment, you woke up Wiener\u2019s laptop via the \u2019Snowden Virus\u2019, found or planted old emails on it, and suddenly had the FBI Field Office \u201cfind it\u201d and then lean, hard, on Comey to produce the letter he did.\n\nYour RIS moles in the FBI then engaged in some agitprop with Giuliani, Flynn, an innocent Fox News, a not-innocent New York Times who deliberately used its prior authority to rubbish Franklin Foer and David Corn\u2019s Alfa Bank server reporting, to make absolutely certain that \u201cTrump-Russia\u201d was suppressed and Clinton was defeated.\n\nYour agents in the FBI Field Office in New York did, however, make one incredibly stupid mistake. A coder named Dustin Giebel caught it and he flagged it up to me.\n\nThe trouble with hiring young and foolish men to flood twitter and Facebook, to act as your hackers and so forth, is that they are young and foolish. Trolls gonna troll.\n\nIn this case, the Twitter account @FBIRecordsVault ceased being dormant for the first time in two years. It went on a little tweet storm. The last tweets were attacks on Hillary Clinton with a chaser of an attack on Eric Holder, the former AG. The first tweet, however, was a tweet praising Fred C. Trump. (Donald Trump has often said that his father is his only hero). It used language about Mr. Trump senior that was not only unlike any FBI descriptors ever used before, but had been lifted from Donald Trump\u2019s commercial, company website.\n\nWhen I saw that, I was overwhelmed with joy. It was not the severity of the offense, it was its traceability. Somebody sat at a keyboard and typed those tweets. Identifiable people. An FBI statement wrongly said that these were automated responses to three FOIA requests. Not true. Some identifiable person ordered and gave that statement. When I filed a private FOIA lawsuit with Mark S Zaid and Bradley Moss, we wrote the questions in ways that would be difficult to avoid answering. Who wrote those tweets? How many agents knew of them? What records exist of FBI agents or staff visiting the Trump commercial website to lift the descriptor of Fred Trump? What internal investigations exist into FBI agents leaking criminal investigations to Flynn and Giuliani? Do they feature any of the same agents who composed, knew of or authorized the FBI Records Vault tweets?\n\nDays after our FOIA requests landed, Mr. Giuliani abruptly withdrew from his application to be Secretary of State. A week after our lawsuit was announced over non-response, the Department of Justice announced an investigation into more or less every matter named in our lawsuit, including the FBI Records Vault\u2019s beautifully traceable tweets.\n\nEven little pawns, like Twitter accounts, can become Queens, if you let them reach the 8th square, Mr. Putin.\n\nSo there you have it. Part One:\n\nRussia has moles inside the IC, several of whom are not yet caught.\n\nThe NSA moles recruit Snowden.\n\nAssange Ecuador and Russia give Snowden orders, and removable media to scrape intel and military secrets.\n\nEcuador exfiltrates Snowden to Moscow.\n\n2012-2013, Russian hackers are given all of the NSA techniques. Nikulin hacks Formspring and Wiener. He plants a virus in his laptop. He waits and wakes it up in October.\n\nRussia\u2019s FBI Field Office moles \u201csuddenly find\u201d the emails, perhaps even placed on that computer, at a crucial juncture.\n\nRussia\u2019s FBI Field Office moles pressure Comey into releasing his letter, and thereby spin the election to Trump.\n\nHow am doing so far, Mr. Putin? You know, for a woman. And an amateur.\n\nPART TWO \u2013 FBI: WHITE KNIGHT VS BLACK KNIGHT\n\nOr, James Comey\u2019s Counterintelligence FBI vs Rudy Giuliani\u2019s NY Criminal FBI\n\nThere are three parts to this theory, like a good play, and narratively, the next section ought to be about your spy ring in the University of Cambridge, your hacking of Facebook and Twitter and your propaganda wars across Europe, but as I have learned from you one must play to the audience, and I think American readers are mostly terrified that Director Comey will throw America under the bus and cover up your coup.\n\nI don\u2019t agree. Here is my take.\n\nBefore the BBC and the Guardian confirmed my HeatStreet exclusive on the FISA warrant issued in October, I was a lone voice in the wilderness on its existence.(And may history record that our conservative-leaning website had that scoop). When the writer Jason Leopold of Vice asked if Trump had been under investigation in September he got a GLOMAR response: \u2018We can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any such records\u2019.\n\nGLOMAR responses are named for a submarine and can only be given if a matter of national security is at stake. Mr. Leopold announced he would sue, for why should a concluded investigation be a matter of national security? I told him, with little credibility then and tons now, that the GLOMAR response made sense because there is an ongoing investigation into Mr. Trump and his associates on a matter of national security.\n\nDemocrats, including Democrats in Obama\u2019s government who ought to know better, have asked if James Comey had \u2018a double standard\u2019 over the investigations into Clinton and Trump. Yes; he did, and he does. He may talk about a criminal investigation. He may not talk about a current, ongoing investigation into espionage, bribery, money laundering and so forth that affects US national security.\n\nOver the summer and early autumn Democrats wrongly stated that the FBI / Comey had said they were not looking into Roger Stone and had declined to investigate Roger Stone, who announced his links to Wikileaks. This came from a Senate hearing and Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony to Democrat Rep. Nadler. Rep. Nadler asked if Stone\u2019s boasts constituted special circumstances, Comey said \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d It must have been frustrating for Comey. He was GLOMAR-ing Congress right to their face and they did not understand what was going on.\n\nSubsequently, the heads of NSA, CIA and FBI \u201cGlomar\u201ded, in no particular order, two Congressional open Russian hack hearings, one closed briefing to the House of Representatives, and in the case of the CIA\u2019s Director Brennan, Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday.\n\nFurthermore, although Comey is a natural Republican he appeared to have played it straight. In the summer he cleared Clinton of a criminal standard of negligence. In the fall, he had been sandbagged by Russian moles inside the FBI Field Office in New York. But I do not believe Mr. Comey surrendered wrongly to \u2018pressure\u2019. He knew the moles had effective kompromat \u2013 the emails your hacker Nikulin planted or woke \u2013 and that were he not to revise his testimony in the light of new evidence, his far more important natsec investigation into the traitor, Donald Trump, would be discredited. He then worked around the clock to clear Mrs. Clinton.\n\nAll evidence shows that James Comey is pursuing your assault on America, Mr. Putin, with the fearless I expect from a counter-intelligence patriot. In June, he named Donald Trump to a FISA court as an agent of Russian influence. In July, he did the same. Both times, the court turned him down. In April, Mr. Comey received audio of Russian money financing Trump \u2013 that\u2019s the same time that Paul Manafort joined the campaign to run it. He formed a joint CIA/FBI /Treasury task force to look at the money.\n\nOver the summer, US counter-intelligence met with Chris Steele because they had already got their own independent information that he was correct. On October 5th, your hacker Nikulin was picked up on an FBI \u2018Red Warrant\u2019 in Prague which means Director Comey had put a top priority on getting him some time before. Armed with whatever Nikulin spilled \u2013 and, Mr. Putin, he fainted when they caught him \u2013 Director Comey went back again, to a new FISA judge, on October 15, and he got his warrant.\n\nEvery indication is that Director Comey is not only independent but plays better chess than both you or I, Mr. Putin. (Can I call you VVP? I feel like I know you). For in September, the FBI did not join the ODNI statement about Russia\u2019s intent being to aid Trump. Why not? Because while the NSA and CIA had heard the tapes of Americans in Trump\u2019s camp working with your officials, taking your bribes, disseminating your information, Director Comey had not yet received his warrant. In order not to give Trump\u2019s defense and the defense of his camps anything to go on, the FBI was Caesar\u2019s wife. It did not act on surveillance of US persons abroad offered by the UK, Estonia, BIS, and Lithuania until it got the warrant. Director Comey does not want any \u2018fruit of the poisoned tree\u2019 defenses (no pun intended, Mr. Putin, and may I remind you sir that it is bad form to kill one\u2019s opponents in chess. It\u2019s cheating).\n\nThe FBI \u2018changed\u2019 its stance on the final Russian hacking report because they had, by then, listened to the tapes. Legally. Under a warrant.\n\nThe FBI has, fortunately, always employed the principle of compartmentalization. The FBI Counter-Intelligence division in New York kept their dealings secret from the criminal field office in New York.\n\nBut, some readers will say, Russian moles in the NSA \u2013 OK, it\u2019s a worthy target. Why would the Russians have sleeper moles in a mere FBI criminal field office, even if it is New York?\n\nAnd the answer to that is simple; a corrupt FBI NY Field Office guards the interest of Russian mobsters, allows them to launder their money through Trump\u2019s \u201cfailing\u201d casinos and building projects, makes sure that Trump being paid double for a Florida house doesn\u2019t get investigated, allows paedophile Jeffrey Epstein to keep a mansion in New York City, ensures that Trump\u2019s criminal taxes don\u2019t get investigated, and sits hard enough on the NYPD that Trump can commit crime after crime in plain sight, socializing with the FBI\u2019s most wanted mobsters, and never get charged with a damn thing. It ensures that Manafort and Stone can live in Trump tower, that Cohen\u2019s trips on Russian-Registered private jets get washed. It allows the \u201cFBI\u201d to be next to the media, including the New York Times and Fox news, and act as un-named law enforcement sources. The FBI Field Office in New York wasn\u2019t just infiltrated by your agents to scupper Hillary Clinton, Mr. Putin. It was there to guard the money of your billionaires and to cover the tracks of your handlers in the Russian embassy and consulates. That\u2019s why the dead security guard at the Russian consulate never got investigated. You have a lot of people in New York, and they are very affable, pleasant folks, too. I\u2019ve met a couple.\n\nBut let\u2019s get back to the game. Your trouble is that Mr. Comey is not for sale. You have nothing on him. Let\u2019s remember your hacker Nikulin, whom Comey was chasing since who knows when. A few days ago Comey picked up another of your hackers in Spain as he was about to board a plane to France with his wife. You yourself, through your propaganda sites, connected this to the DNC hack. You had the identical reaction that you did to Nikulin being picked up. You threw a rather beta male hissy fit. Stanislav Lisov had coded a bank virus. But there\u2019s rather more to it than that. Lisov fits the hacker narrative in the Steele dossier. He needed paying. He has Gazprom connections, and he has a scary interest in satellites, which you, Mr. Putin, would like to weaponize against the United States.\n\nBut you know, the FBI caught him, none the less. Comey caught him. They know about the US company he formed, how it transferred to Oregon from Florida, and how money was funneled through a failed \u2018secretive startup\u2019.\n\nThe white knight is outplaying the black knight and all his moves indicate that.\n\nPART THREE: ENDGAME \u2013 THE \u2018IAGO GAMBIT\u2019\n\nIs it really worth chronicling the rest of the match? You, Mr. Putin, have relied on big data and on propaganda, including an army of trolls. It is plain to UK intelligence that you have a Russian spy ring at Cambridge University; that you may have combed through and stolen, illegally in the EU, the Facebook data of hundreds of millions of Americans; that you use propagandists SCR and combined GSR and SCR to form Cambridge Analytica; and that you used Twitter\u2019s database to create a bot army.\n\nIt\u2019s plain from both money and propaganda that Steve Bannon is your tool, your agent of influence; that you work through Nigel Farage and so on; that RT and Sputnik are not merely spy centers, but money-laundering tools; and that you have used \u2018Big data\u2019 of Cambridge Analytica (personality types plus propaganda from SCR) to poison the minds of Americans and indeed voters across the West. You have your hackers sitting on 4 Chan, where the \u2018prank\u2019 on the Brexit petition involved Russian server addresses.\n\nBut you are a careless player, Mr. Putin. Scrubbing archive.is of tweets wherein @GenFlynn pushes your hideous propaganda is pretty dumb. Scrubbing Michael Cohen\u2019s phone data is also dumb, when we have him and his daughter waltzing around Europe and the Caribbean in Russian-owned private jets. You live by the troll, sir, then you die by the troll. Your propaganda and how you pay for it is all traceable. America has its hackers, too.\n\nThe DoJ inquiry has fired the first shots. It\u2019s named Erik Prince. It knows you have the Mercers, it knows about Bannon, it knows about your moles in the NYPD. You see sir it all goes back to Nikulin. The NYPD \u2018found\u2019 that laptop on October 3rd. And on October 5th, Nikulin comes to Prague for payment.\n\nBut Mr. Putin, James Comey\u2019s friends were waiting there to turn your black pawn into our white queen. And whenever Flynn tweeted Russian agitprop, the FBI and the NSA had a URL.\n\nYou sir, are like a chess player in possession of all his many, many pieces, but boxed in, in the back row, and despite having them all arrayed on the board \u2013 Jeff Sessions as Attorney General even though he recruited the spy Carter Page into your team \u2013 despite all of that, none of it will matter. White has you trapped. You and your ally Iran. Checkmate came from the Persian phrase, \u201cShah Mat\u201d.\n\nThe King is dead. And I didn\u2019t even have to bother with Sessions, Page, Manafort, Stone, Flynn, and all the SIGINT that we have on them, the deals they made with Wikileaks to receive intel that you hacked and phished and planted with your viruses.\n\nImpeachment of Mr. Trump is on the way.\n\nWhat you should ask yourself is if it is in Russia\u2019s and your own best interest for you to keep deceiving an angry America? For when the trials do start, the back-covering, the rage, the scrambling, the desperate need to seem harder on your oligarch friends than the next politician \u2013 this could harm not only you and your allies but the next generation of Russian kleptocrats too.\n\nIt would surely be better to give it up now, release some of that kompromat now, push Trump out, and face the anger of a relieved United States after Trump resigns.\n\nBut perhaps you cannot.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Putin, you have played yourself right into a corner. After all, those who know what komprat you hold on them also know that you hold it. And they can collaborate with the FBI.\n\nChess is a good game, sir.\n\nBut the reason Russians are so poor is that you can\u2019t stop playing it."

    "text": "In January, BuzzFeed published perhaps the clearest accusation against President Trump in all of the reporting about the Russia investigation. Under the headline \u201cPresident Trump Directed His Attorney Michael Cohen to Lie About the Moscow Tower Project,\u201d the article, written by the BuzzFeed News senior investigative reporter Jason Leopold and his colleague Anthony Cormier, said that the President had personally instructed Cohen to lie to Congress about when negotiations on the project ended, and that the office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had learned about \u201cTrump\u2019s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.\u201d The story was sourced to \u201ctwo federal law enforcement officials involved in an investigation of the matter.\u201d However, once it was published, other federal officials spoke up. Mueller\u2019s office released a rare public statement, saying that \u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the special counsel\u2019s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s congressional testimony are not accurate.\u201d BuzzFeed, and its editor, Ben Smith, have stood by the story.\n\nThis controversy, and the underlying question of whether Trump had directed Cohen to lie, were two of the many reasons that people were anxious to hear Cohen\u2019s public testimony on Wednesday to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. In his opening statement, Cohen claimed that \u201cMr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no Russian business and then go on to lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.\u201d The strong language that BuzzFeed used\u2014which described Cohen\u2019s earlier testimony as \u201cthe first known example of Trump telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia\u201d\u2014appeared to conflict with Cohen\u2019s account. At the same time, Cohen confirmed other aspects of BuzzFeed\u2019s reporting, including that he briefed Donald Trump, Jr., and Ivanka Trump on the deal, and that, as BuzzFeed wrote, \u201cattorneys close to the administration helped Cohen prepare his testimony and draft his statement to the Senate panel.\u201d On Wednesday, Cohen said that \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it.\u201d\n\nI recently spoke by phone with Leopold about his reporting of this story and his other work on the Trump-Russia affair. Leopold, who was previously at Vice News, is considered an expert at using Freedom of Information Act requests and was part of a team of BuzzFeed reporters who were Pulitzer Prize finalists in 2018. He has also been the subject of controversy. In 2002, Salon removed an article from its Web site after Leopold was accused of inaccuracy and plagiarism. Four years later, he incorrectly reported that Karl Rove, George W. Bush\u2019s deputy chief of staff, had been indicted in the investigation into the outing of the C.I.A. agent Valerie Plame. (Leopold was open about past substance abuse and mental health issues in a 2006 memoir, \u201cNews Junkie.\u201d) His work with Cormier on the Trump Tower Moscow project has advanced that story significantly, despite the controversy surrounding it. My conversation with Leopold, which has been edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nDo you have any evidence that what Michael Cohen said to Congress this week was incorrect or dishonest?\n\nWas incorrect or dishonest? You know, I cannot talk about any of the evidence, documents, or anything that I have that may relate to any stories that I will be working on in the future.\n\nSo, that\u2019s your answer for that question? You don\u2019t feel like you can go beyond that?\n\nI mean, I will say that I have evidence that what he said to Congress as it pertains to the story that Anthony Cormier and I wrote was correct, but whether he has anything that\u2019s dishonest, I mean, it may relate to things that I am writing in the future. I don\u2019t have anything to say about that.\n\nDo you believe that what Cohen said backs up your story? It seems like you just said that.\n\nYes, Cohen confirmed the central thesis of our report. The President met with him before his false testimony, White House lawyers edited his false testimony before he gave it, and Cohen understood that the President was directing him to lie to Congress. [Cohen claimed that the changes were made by Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, not White House lawyers.]\n\nIn the piece, you wrote, in what was the central thesis of your story, that this was \u201cthe first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia.\u201d Was that language accurate?\n\nSo, you know, Cohen totally understood that he was being directed by Trump to lie to Congress. He did not mention how many meetings or explicit words that the President may have spoken that led him to lie. And, you know, more may come out, but Cohen himself made it clear in his testimony that he and Trump both understood this to be explicit, that he should lie to Congress. And he made it clear that it was an explicit command.\n\nDo you think him saying \u201cHe did not directly tell me to lie\u201d contradicts at all you writing that this was \u201cthe first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie?\u201d\n\nThose people are seizing onto Cohen\u2019s use of the word \u201cdirectly.\u201d The President didn\u2019t \u201cdirectly tell me to lie.\u201d That\u2019s an adverb that characterizes the underlying instruction to lie. And Cohen says almost immediately after that that the President was telling him to lie \u201cin his way.\u201d So there is no longer any question about the direction Trump gave Cohen. The debate is now about how the direction was given, and a lot of people don\u2019t want to admit that they were wrong.\n\nAnd if I could just go back to the question you asked me about \u201cexplicit.\u201d Let me just say this: Anthony and I and, obviously, BuzzFeed are standing by what our sources told us, which is not contradicted by Cohen\u2019s testimony, and what he said is that he knew a hundred per cent what the President was telling him to do. You know, Isaac, if that is not an explicit instruction, then everything short of \u201cMichael, please lie for me\u201d isn\u2019t, either. Cohen understood it to be an order, a direction, an instruction.\n\nCohen\u2019s sentencing memo, which was made public in the month before your story, stated that \u201cWe address the campaign finance and false statements allegations together because both arose from Michael\u2019s fierce loyalty to Client-1. In each case, the conduct was intended to benefit Client-1, in accordance with Client-1\u2019s directives.\u201d It seems like what Cohen stated to Congress last week is not really different than what was in the sentencing memo, correct?\n\nIt would seem that way, yes, you are absolutely correct.\n\nSo then, in terms of the central thesis of your story, how do you think it was different than what Mueller\u2019s sentencing memo said? Do you think it was different?\n\nI feel that it was different because the story itself had many other examples of what Cohen and what Trump were discussing as it pertained to Trump Tower Moscow. That was a single line. What our story did was expand upon certainly what was in the sentencing memo, and we discussed all the contacts that Cohen and Trump had related to the Trump Tower Moscow project. Cohen testified that there were ten discussions he had with Trump, or the Trump family. Our story states, based on these two law-enforcement sources, that they had ten discussions, that Don, Jr., and Ivanka Trump were involved, that Trump was very eager to go to Russia. So our story fleshes out further what the sentencing memo essentially implied.\n\nI don\u2019t want to take away credit from your story for getting things we also heard from Cohen on Wednesday. I am just trying to understand about this central issue. It seems to me that the way in which your story maybe went further than the Mueller sentencing memo about directives was not confirmed by Cohen. Do you think that is fair?\n\nI do not think that\u2019s fair. I think Cohen confirmed that he was directed to lie. I am very comfortable with the use of the word \u201cdirected.\u201d\n\nAnd explicitly? O.K.\n\nI think, at this point, Isaac, that people are twisting themselves into pretzels to justify their earlier reporting that doubted the central claims in our story rather than trying to get at the truth of what Trump actually said to Cohen to make him lie, which Cohen acknowledged multiple times in the hearing.\n\nYou wrote, \u201cThe special counsel\u2019s office learned about Trump\u2019s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents. Cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.\u201d Is your belief that this documentary evidence presents any sort of a different picture than the one Cohen provided to Congress, or is it essentially the same?\n\nSo, you are going to have to forgive me. When it comes down to at least the documents, standing by what we reported, I don\u2019t want to get into anything else further about the characterization of those documents, largely because there have been calls for a leak investigation. Judicial Watch recently sent a letter to the Inspector General calling for a leak investigation into the two law-enforcement sources who have been leaking for us. So, when it came down to what any documents may or may not say, I don\u2019t even want to discuss that because of those issues.\n\nCormier said in an interview that you were briefed on the documents, but neither of you had seen them. Is that correct? [In the interview, on NPR, Cormier, when asked if he had seen the documents, stated \u201cI have not. But our two sources [are] fully, a hundred-per-cent read into this. They have reviewed these documents in person.\u201d]\n\nAgain, I am not going to discuss what either of us may or may not have seen.\n\nThe reason I am bringing it up is because he discussed it.\n\nI know. I understand that. He was on \u201cReliable Sources\u201d and was asked the same question. But, again, there have been calls for a leak investigation. This Administration, this Justice Department has been very aggressive about that, and I just cannot discuss.\n\nI understand where you are coming from but he said that and then you said, on MSNBC, \u201cWe have seen documents, we have been briefed on documents.\u201d It does raise questions, and you understand why people would be curious about it.\n\nI completely understand that. What I am saying is that, at this point in time, where we are right now, I am not going to add anything else to that. Whatever either of us said a month ago, things may have changed. Right now, I am just not going to discuss anything related to what we may have or have not seen. [In an e-mail the day after our conversation, Leopold noted that Cormier only spoke for himself when he said that he had not seen the documents. Leopold added, \u201cWhen we reported this story out, I was in LA and DC and Anthony was in NYC.\u201d]\n\nI want to ask about how these stories are framed. Another piece was headlined \u201cThe Trump Organization Planned to Give Vladimir Putin the $50 million Penthouse in Trump Tower Moscow.\u201d The piece presents this as an idea that was broached, but I would not call it a plan. It is a couple of people discussing it as an idea. Is there a danger in overstating stuff like this?\n\nAre you speaking specifically about my story, or in general?\n\nIn general, but also the fifty-million-dollar penthouse.\n\nWell, let me remind you what the story said. Michael Cohen discussed this with an assistant to [Putin\u2019s spokesman] Dmitry Peskov. I understand that there has been commentary by one of the other individuals involved in that who said it was just a marketing plan. But we made it clear in the story that this was not just an idea that these two people were spitballing. This was a plan that was discussed with Dmitry Peskov\u2019s assistant. Michael Cohen, in his own testimony, called it a marketing plan or marketing idea\u2014I don\u2019t have the exact wording. And, in addition to that, he noted that the reason they were discussing it was to hopefully attract buyers. [When questioned about this during the hearing, Cohen named Felix Sater as the originator of this idea, saying, \u201cIt was a marketing stunt.\u201d]\n\nBut, to your larger point, just about this story and others, I want to make clear that this story, the penthouse story, as well as the story we wrote a month ago, and all the other stories, are subject to the highest level of scrutiny. As is all of our high-profile articles. It was vetted by multiple editors and lawyers, and we did not publish it until everyone was satisfied that the reporting was rock-solid.\n\nDo you have a larger sense now of why you think Mueller\u2019s office disputed aspects of your reporting?\n\nI do not. And, in fact, we are obviously very eager to learn why they made those comments, what led them to make those comments. I filed several FOIA requests with the Department of Justice, the office of the special counsel, with the hopes of prying loose a wide range of records that would lay bare what took place behind the scenes, that could shed light on that decision-making process on the decision to release that unprecedented statement. As it stands right now, as we are speaking, I do not have any additional insight into why they issued that statement.\n\nWhen the statement was released, was your thought that they were disputing what you and I spent the first half of this phone call haggling over or debating? To what degree was this a direct order?\n\nHonestly, it was confusion, because my reaction to it was, \u201cThis is a carefully worded legal statement that is also somewhat ambiguous.\u201d I was unable to determine what they were referring to. So first it was confusion, then it was simply a matter of trying to figure out within our story, going through each paragraph, what they were referring to. Because it was not a wholesale \u201cThis story isn\u2019t correct.\u201d They seem to have spent quite a bit of time targeting something in the story. I did not think of it as \u201cthey are disputing a word\u201d [or] \u201cthey are disputing a certain paragraph.\u201d I simply could not figure out what they were trying to say about the story itself. My first reaction was confusion, that it was unclear to me where they were going with it, and then realizing that [it] was a very carefully worded statement. And then, after that, this sense of feeling that it was ambiguous.\n\nWhen Michael Cohen released his statement, based on your previous reporting, did the way Cohen phrased those statements I read to you earlier about \u201cdirectly\u201d and \u201ctelling me to lie\u201d surprise you or change the way you thought of it, or was this what you were expecting?\n\nIsaac, I\u2019ll be honest with you, I had no idea what Michael would say.\n\nIf we assume that what Cohen said was true, for the sake of this conversation, was that, from your reporting, your general sense of what occurred between the President and Michael Cohen?\n\nI\u2019ll say this. Cohen totally understood he was being directed to lie. And my understanding, sticking to and standing behind what my sources said, is that Cohen was directed to lie. And I also expect that more information will come out that will make it even clearer that this was in fact a directive. And, again, Cohen used the word \u201cdirectly.\u201d We said \u201cdirected.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cnot directly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did not directly tell me to lie.\u201d And he said he was directed, and he made that clear in his testimony that he was directed to lie. I feel like I have to go back again to state it was an adverb, and it characterizes the underlying instruction to lie. I am comfortable with the use of our word \u201cdirected\u201d and I am confident more will be revealed about what exactly was said to Cohen, or what additional words were said to him. But in terms of \u201cWas I surprised? Was it what I expected?\u201d I had no reaction other than that I was very confident when he would be testifying for a second time that the truth would be revealed and that he was directed to lie.\n\nIn March of 2018, you and Cormier wrote a long profile of the Trump associate Felix Sater. This was a relatively positive piece about him, talking about his work with American intelligence going after Osama bin Laden. Do you worry, with stories like this, that it is hard to find balance talking about someone like Sater, who has a very shady past, but whom also you might want to use as a source and would be an important source going forward?\n\nAbsolutely not. It\u2019s a fascinating story, the fact that he did all of this work for the U.S. government for decades. But, in terms of finding the balance, no. We were very clear in that story about the crimes that he committed, which he was sentenced for, what he was charged with. Not at all. In fact, any story that we have written about that involves Felix Sater, we have stated what the public record states. You asked, is it hard to find a balance? With Felix Sater, we simply were looking into who is this person that seems to be at the center of everything at that time involving Trump, and, coming across his background, which I had already been aware of, from Loretta Lynch\u2019s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, when she was asked by Chuck Grassley about him. So I was already fascinated about, \u201cWho is this guy?\u201d\n\nRight, but you have this story that is the type of story Sater would like to see about himself, and, the next month, you have a story where Sater seems to be a source. And it seemed like there might be some tension there.\n\nAgain, I am not going to talk about who my sources or who Anthony\u2019s sources are. Obviously, within this world, within the Trump universe, there are people who are in the know, and in some cases it\u2019s a small circle of people and we all sort of use the same sources or try to get information from the same sources. Some of these individuals have interesting pasts, and their stories in and of themselves are interesting. I think you asked the question of if it creates for any tension.\n\nYeah.\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I think, at the end of the day, we are simply just reporting the facts about what is taking place, and in terms of individuals we are writing about, when it is time to inform people about who they are, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\n\nSome of the critiques of your story referenced aspects of your past about previous journalistic errors and substance abuse. Do you think it is totally fair that people bring it up, and that they should bring it up while also focussing on the content of the story, or do you feel like it\u2019s a cheap shot? What\u2019s the proper journalistic way to handle it?\n\nIt\u2019s a good question. Let me just say that I did make mistakes, O.K., but that was decades ago, and since then I have learned from those mistakes. And I am in a unique position of knowing how not to repeat those mistakes. I think the series of stories that Anthony and I wrote is evidence we have been way ahead of the investigation time and again. My work has stood up to the highest forms of scrutiny, and I welcome this scrutiny. My past is my past and I have to have a thick skin, and that is, essentially, people are going to say what they are going to say. I do not want to be in the position of monitoring how people report about my past. It\u2019s out there. The thing I would say, or just note, is what my work looks like. What I would say is that my work has stood up to scrutiny. It continues to stand up to scrutiny. I welcome people scrutinizing my work. I am happy that they are doing it. Do I think it\u2019s a cheap shot? I am obviously aware of my past. I know that it\u2019s there and I know it can be weaponized.\n\nAn earlier version of this piece misstated the headline of Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier's BuzzFeed story."

    "text": "Maggie Haberman and Alisyn Camerota/CNN screen shot\n\nAn interview with New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman went careening off the rails when host Alisyn Camerota flipped out over Haberman suggested that there was nothing unusual about President Donald Trump paying off his porn star mistress while conducting the nation\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time you have had a president of the United States who was wealthy, right? There were others who were wealthy who had to take care of private citizen business,\u201d Haberman said. \u201cThis is a different realm of private citizen business. It is going to continue to dog him, I think, for the next couple of months.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is absurd, Maggie,\u201d interjected Camerota.\n\n\u201cWhich part?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe part that Donald Trump every month would sign, by hand, a check for $35,000 and not know,\u201d said a laughing Camerota as Haberman insisted it was perfectly normal. \u201cThis is a man who didn\u2019t even pay his vendors when they completed work for him. This is somebody who doesn\u2019t part with $35,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing this for a theoretical,\u201d Haberman shot back. \u201cSay he thought he was reimbursing Michael Cohen for other things that he may not want people to know about. I\u2019m talking specifically about the Stormy Daniels thing. I disagree that it\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d said Camerota. \u201cYou\u2019re talking specifically that there might have been other things we didn\u2019t know about connected to Stormy Daniels \u2013\u201c\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m saying there might have been other things in the realm of things he didn\u2019t want the public to know about,\u201d Haberman said coyly. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should presume just because we see something that it is giving us complete visibility into everything.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "- Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nListen To The Story Marketplace Embed Code <iframe src=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2019/03/06/tech/exclusive-look-numbers-showing-users-leaving-facebook-by-the-millions/popout\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"240px\"></iframe>\n\nAll the bad press about Facebook might be catching up to the company. New numbers from Edison Research show an an estimated 15 million fewer users in the United States compared to 2017. The biggest drop is in the very desirable 12- to 34-year-old group. Marketplace Tech got a first look at Edison's latest social media research. It revealed almost 80 percent of people in the U.S. are posting, tweeting or snapping, but fewer are going to Facebook. Marketplace\u2019s Kimberly Adams talked with Larry Rosin, president of Edison Research. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nKimberly Adams: In your survey you found an estimated drop of 15 million fewer Facebook users in the U.S. today than in 2017. That's just in the U.S. Is this a meaningful drop for Facebook?\n\nLarry Rosin: I don't see how you couldn't say it's a meaningful drop. Fifteen million is a lot of people, no matter which way you cut it. It represents about 6 percent of the total U.S. population ages 12 and older. What makes it particularly important is if it is part of a trend. This is the second straight year we've seen this number go down. Obviously, the U.S. is the biggest market, in terms of dollars, and it's going to be a super important market for Facebook or anybody who's playing in this game.\n\nCourtesy of Edison Research and Triton Digital\n\nAdams: But if we look at Facebook's earnings report, they are still reporting an increasing number of active users. What's behind the difference between what the company is saying and what your survey found?\n\nRosin: When they're producing those numbers, they're typically talking about their global platform. This is a survey just of the USA. Furthermore, we're asking about usage. We're saying, \"Do you currently use Facebook?\" Facebook is probably measuring it on, \u201cDo you ever open the app, or do you ever use it on any level?\u201d\n\nRead more Check out the full Infinite Dial report\n\nAdams: Are those people going somewhere else or leaving social media altogether?\n\nRosin: We only show trace numbers of people leaving social media altogether. They're obviously just transferring their usage. The big gainer, interestingly, is under the same roof as Facebook. It's their co-owned Instagram.\n\nCourtesy of Edison Research and Triton Digital\n\nAdams: Do you have any sense as to why people are leaving Facebook in particular?\n\nRosin: The survey didn't specifically ask, \u201cWhy are you using Facebook less?\u201d or \u201cWhy have you stopped using Facebook?\u201d among those who say that they have. There's tons of other information out there, whether it be the politically related aspects to Facebook. There's conjecture about as Facebook has become more popular among older people, whether that's affected younger people. Then we have to consider whether some of these other social media platforms, in particular Instagram and Snapchat, are just more appealing to younger people. I should also mention that while we've seen dramatic reductions in usage among younger people, we're still seeing some gains among people, for instance, 55 and older. That is maybe not the advertising target Facebook is necessarily looking to work on, but it's not as if all is lost there.\n\nRelated links: more details from Edison's Infinite Dial report\n\nIt\u2019s pretty ironic that most of those Facebook departures seem to have gone to Instagram, which, being owned by Facebook, doesn't necessarily have better policies. And it's worth noting that Facebook is still the most-used social media platform, according to Edison, with 61 percent of people in the U.S. using the site. Instagram is a distant second. Edison also looked at media hardware and found smartphone ownership continues to rise. About 84 percent of us in the U.S., 237 million people, own these pocket computers. Smart speaker ownership saw a big jump in the last couple of years and keeps climbing. About 23 percent of us have them now, with Amazon's Alexa devices in the lead. One interesting trend developing around smart speakers is that people who get one tend to want multiple. In 2018, only about a tenth of smart speaker owners had several. Now, about a quarter of owners have three or more.\n\n\u201cI think the best compliment I can give is not to say how much your programs have taught me (a ton), but how much Marketplace has motivated me to go out and teach myself.\u201d \u2013 Michael in Arlington, VA As a nonprofit news organization, what matters to us is the same thing that matters to you: being a source for trustworthy, independent news that makes people smarter about business and the economy. So if Marketplace has helped you understand the economy better, make more informed financial decisions or just encouraged you to think differently, we\u2019re asking you to give a little something back. Become a Marketplace Investor today \u2013 in whatever amount is right for you \u2013 and keep public service journalism strong. We\u2019re grateful for your support. BEFORE YOU GO"

    "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday laid into Democrats and Republicans who've condemned freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar of making comments perceived by many as anti-Semitic.\n\nDemocratic leadership, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is expected to put a resolution opposing anti-Semitism up for a vote in the House this week, after Omar in a tweet over the weekend accused pro-Israel lawmakers of pushing \"for allegiance to a foreign country.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez didn't defend Omar's comment but argued in a series of tweets that the fierce backlash the Minnesota Democrat is facing revealed a double standard in Congress' response to different forms of bigotry.\n\nShe added that Omar, who is Muslim and a Somali-American immigrant, \"has demonstrated a willingness to listen+work w/impacted communities\" and shouldn't be subjected to the \"nuclear option\" of a formal condemnation.\n\n\"One of the things that is hurtful about the extent to which reprimand is sought of Ilhan is that no one seeks this level of reprimand when members make statements about Latinx + other communities (during the shutdown, a GOP member yelled 'Go back to Puerto Rico!' on the floor),\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\nShe said that lawmakers were often given a pass for misogynistic, racist, or anti-LGBTQ comments and that congressional leaders should be clear about what behavior merits formal condemnation.\n\n\"It's not my position to tell people how to feel, or that their hurt is invalid,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"But incidents like these do beg the question: where are the resolutions against homophobic statements? For anti-blackness? For xenophobia? For a member saying he'll 'send Obama home to Kenya?'\"\n\nOn Monday, Republican Rep. Steve King, who was stripped of his House committee seats in January following a controversial New York Times interview and renewed scrutiny over his many racist statements, promoted a white nationalist on Twitter. On Sunday, GOP Rep. Jim Jordan referred to the Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer as \"$teyer\" in a tweet, which some have also condemned as anti-Semitic, as Steyer's father was Jewish.\n\nOcasio-Cortez also argued that Omar's critics were attempting to silence voices that oppose Israeli government policy and are critical of US policy in the Middle East.\n\n\"I remember a time when it was 'unacceptable' to question the Iraq War,\" she tweeted, later clarifying that she meant to say the war in Afghanistan. \"All of Congress was wrong, including both GOP & Dem Party, and led my generation into a disastrous + wrong war that virtually all would come to regret, except for the one member who stood up: Barbara Lee.\"\n\nOmar supports the movement to boycott Israel and has been critical of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. She has also been vocal in her opposition to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in Washington that nearly always aligns with the Israeli government.\n\nLast month, Democratic leaders in the House condemned another tweet in which Omar argued that pro-Israel American lawmakers were influenced by donations from groups like AIPAC. Omar apologized amid the intense backlash.\n\nThe Minnesota Democrat also faced criticism for saying in a tweet in November 2012, during the Israeli military campaign against Hamas, that \"Israel has hypnotized the world.\"\n\nOmar. Reuters/Eric Miller\n\nIslamophobic attacks\n\nOmar has also been a victim of bigoted attacks recently.\n\nLast Friday, the West Virginia Republican Party displayed a poster linking Omar with the 9/11 terrorist attacks during an event at the statehouse. The poster featured an image of the twin towers in flames with the words \"'Never Forget' \u2014 you said..\" above an image of Omar with the words \"I am the proof \u2014 you have forgotten.\"\n\nThe state Republican Party said in a statement that it never approved of or saw the poster before it was displayed and that it had it removed after learning of its existence.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said she was \"heartbroken\" that the state party didn't receive more criticism for the incident.\n\n\"Those who stood up against anti-Semitism a few weeks ago should also be calling out the Islamophobia here, too,\" she tweeted.\n\nOmar, who, along with Rep. Rashida Tlaib, is the first Muslim congresswoman, described it as one of many instances of Islamophobia she has faced.\n\n\"No wonder why I am on the 'Hitlist' of a domestic terrorist and 'Assassinate Ilhan Omar' is written on my local gas stations,\" she tweeted. \"Look no further, the GOP's anti-Muslim display likening me to a terrorist rocks in state capitols and no one is condemning them!\"\n\nMichelle Mark contributed to this report."

    "text": "Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) Photo: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call,Inc.\n\nEarlier this month, Representative Ilhan Omar tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins, baby!\u201d in response to a report about AIPAC, a pro-Israel organization. Omar\u2019s tweet echoed a longstanding anti-Semitic trope \u2014 in particular, the implication that Jewish political influence operates entirely (\u201call about\u201d) through money.\n\nAfter wide condemnation, Omar apologized. It seemed fair to read her tweet generously: Perhaps she was not familiar with the particular vein of anti-Semitism she happened to echo. Indeed, progressives often make crudely reductive statements about the influence of money in supporting policies they oppose (to wit: everything Bernie Sanders says), so it wasn\u2019t necessarily anti-Semitic for Omar to extend that thinking to Jews. Her apparently sincere apology seemed to set to rest a minor offense.\n\nBut at an event last night, Omar went much farther, reports Laura Kelly. After an audience member shouted out, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins,\u201d at which, according to Kelly\u2019s reporting, she smiled. (Jeremy Slevin, Omar\u2019s press secretary and strategist, denies she acknowledged that line from the audience.) Later she stated, \u201cI want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\u201d\n\nThis is much worse. Accusing Jews of \u201callegiance to a foreign country\u201d is a historically classic way of delegitimizing their participation in the political system. Whether or not the foreign policy agenda endorsed by American supporters of Israel is wise or humane, it is a legitimate expression of their political rights as American citizens. To believe in a strong American alliance with Israel (or Canada, or the United Kingdom, or any other country) is not the same thing as giving one\u2019s allegiance to that country. Omar is directly invoking the hoary myth of dual loyalty, in which the Americanness of Jews is inherently suspect, and their political participation must be contingent upon proving their patriotism.\n\nOf course, she is attempting to couch her position as a defense of free speech, and against a tendency to reflexively dismiss all criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic. And it\u2019s certainly true that many Israel hawks do label criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic without a good basis to do so. There should be more space in American politics to advocate criticism of Israel and support for Palestinian rights.\n\nBut Omar is using that cause to smuggle in ugly stereotypes. And whatever presumption of good faith she deserved last time should be gone now.\n\nThis post has been updated."

Here\u2019s how I explained my views on the subject in my book about demographics, What to Expect When No One\u2019s Expecting:\n\nThat four-car pile up\u2014younger sexual initiation, more cohabitation, later marriage, and decreased total fertility\u2014are all just the unintended consequences stemming (in part) from Margaret Sanger\u2019s Pill. The intended consequence was to remove the entire idea of consequences from sex. This separation of the act from the messy result nine months later became a cultural imperative in the West with the advent of the Pill. And prophylactic birth control was just the start. The next step was controlling pregnancy after the fact, via abortion. Before you start flipping ahead, let me make a promise. I\u2019m one of those anti-abortion nut jobs who thinks that every embryo is sacred life and abortion is killing an innocent and blah-blah-blah. But when it comes to abortion, most Americans aren\u2019t crazies like me\u2014they think abortion should be, in essence, legal, but somewhat restricted, and rare. So without my pushing judgments of any kind, let me just give you the brief demographic tour as to how abortion has affected American fertility. . . .\n\nI have paid some small price for my pro-life views over the years. For instance, when the New Yorker reviewed What to Expect, Elizabeth Kolbert wrote that\n\nLast has aimed his book at the same sort of readers who subscribe to The Weekly Standard. He describes himself as an \u201canti-abortion nut job\u201d . . .\n\nWhich intentionally misled readers as to what I was trying to do with my disclaimer. But whatever. This isn\u2019t about me. I\u2019m only putting my cards on the table.\n\nA few weeks ago I asked Molly Jong-Fast to report from CPAC for The Bulwark. I did this because MJF is a writer with a great eye for absurdity and because CPAC is absurd. And it has been absurd for at least 20 years.\n\nFor as long as I\u2019ve been in Washington, CPAC was the Creature Cantina of conservatism. It was a joke during the Gingrich Revolution. It was a joke when Mitt Romney went there insisting that he was \u201cseverely conservative.\u201d It\u2019s a joke now that the torch has been passed to Charlie Kirk and Seb Gorka and Laura Loomer.\n\nIn short, MJF was there to cover the event with all of the seriousness it deserves.\n\nFunnily enough, I sent someone else there to cover it, too; someone who is deeply pro-life and a pretty hard-core social conservative. He never filed a piece because, as he explained to me, \u201cThe trouble with CPAC is that I was going in to counter-program a little by trying to do some silver lining stuff. But no: It\u2019s trash pretty much top to bottom and the misanthropic take is the honest one.\u201d\n\nNow, MJF did publish a lot of anti-pro-life stuff on her Twitter feed because she, personally, is pro-choice. According to people who are angry on the internet this is a scandal for one of two reasons. Either (1) The Bulwark is responsible for the Twitter feeds and personal views of everyone we publish; or (2) The Bulwark should not publish the writings of people who are not 100 percent aligned with our political worldview.\n\nLet\u2019s take the first part first: I am not going to police the Twitter feeds of people who write for The Bulwark looking for deviationist thoughts. I do not control\u2014nor do I want to control\u2014the outside writings and thoughts of people who are published on this site. That way lies madness. Are there places I would draw a line? Yes. If someone who writes for us were to tweet about how the Holocaust is a big hoax perpetrated by the THE JOOS, I would not publish them. Notwithstanding my personal convictions, I do not draw that line at a political position on abortion law that is held by half of America.\n\nSome people suggest that there is a special duty of The Bulwark to own MJF\u2019s tweets while she was at CPAC. I have a hard time parsing that position, to be honest. Would it be the case that we are responsible for her Twitter feed last week, but not next week? Or while she was physically at CPAC, but not when she left the building? These distinctions seem to be non-obvious at best and arbitrary at worst.\n\nOr maybe people wouldn\u2019t have gotten so upset if MJF\u2019s Twitter bio had said: \u201cTweets reflect my views only.\u201d But somehow, I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s the case. Do you?\n\nAs for the second part, that The Bulwark should only publish the views of people who agree with our institutional positions, 100 percent: This assumes a view of public life that is pathetically crippled.\n\nLook, I don\u2019t know you. This is the internet. You could be a dog or a Martian or Bryce Harper. But I know this: The only way you\u2019re going to find someone with the exact same matrix of political preferences as you is by looking in the mirror.\n\nThe question then is: Can you extract value by reading the work of people who don\u2019t agree with you? If the answer is no, then this isn\u2019t the place for you.\n\nFor most people in public life, though, the answer has historically been yes. Do you remember where Charles Krauthammer got his start? At the New Republic. Did you ever get any value from reading Christopher Hitchens? I did. But boy, howdy, he was a piece of work. Hitchens wasn\u2019t just pro-abortion, he was virulently anti-God. He was an actual, literal blasphemer. And yet, most thoughtful conservatives I know valued large swaths of his writing and still consider him a legend.\n\nAnd it seems to me that the organizers of CPAC are pretty heterodox themselves. The final speaker on the CPAC agenda\u2014the last person scheduled to be on stage before Matt Schlapp\u2019s closing remarks\u2014was Jeanine Pirro. Who is pro-choice.\n\nLook: There are limits to heterodoxy. I remember Ben Domenech dealing with criticisms a few years back when he published a particularly stupid piece over at the Federalist. There was a backlash to it. Allow me to reproduce how Domenech and some of his Federalist colleagues reacted to this backlash:\n\nOn Twitter, \u201cThe Federalist\u201d became a top-three trending topic. But the site\u2019s editors refused to back down, arguing that the article was a contributed opinion article, not a statement by the editorial staff. Several also claimed that the publication\u2019s critics were merely upset at a differing political opinion, as if defending the sexual abuse of children were just another issue of the day on which reasonable people could disagree. \u201cIf you are filled with rage at the mere thought of reading a political perspective you don\u2019t agree with, perhaps you shouldn\u2019t be in the business of political punditry,\u201d the site\u2019s co-founder Sean Davis wrote on Twitter. . . .\n\nAnd here\u2019s what Domenech wrote in \u201cA Note on What We Do Here\u201d:\n\nI understand full well why people do not like this piece. Every day we publish articles at The Federalist with which I disagree. It\u2019s an impossibility for a publication that offers the variety of content and perspectives we do to always line up with our editors\u2019 views. But we publish the things we think make valuable contributions to the public debate, and represent the views of voters. . . . If you don\u2019t want to know the answers to any of these questions, that\u2019s fine. If you want to plug your ears and go LA LA LA that\u2019s fine. But I will not apologize ever, for any reason, for trying to understand the motivations of people who vote in this country. I will not apologize ever, for any reason, for publishing the views of people who don\u2019t make a living in politics about why they plan to vote a certain way. . . . The goal of any worthwhile and effective journal of opinion analysis in navigating what is an increasingly tribal and divisive period in American history should be to promote real debate. That does not mean retreating to our corners and pretending that if we ignore the perspectives we don\u2019t like, they will magically go away. It means dealing with the world as it is, and the spectrum of opinion as it exists\u2014not pretending that things are what they are not.\n\nActually, I basically share Domenech\u2019s views here, within reason. Now, we won\u2019t publish pieces that conflict with bedrock aspects of our worldview. So, for instance, we would not publish a piece arguing against the pro-life position because, institutionally, we take that as non-negotiable.\n\nBut we\u2019re also not going to demand that anyone who writes for us holds this or that belief.\n\nSpeaking of Ben Domenech, this brings us to the section about Bad Actors. Domenech has called The Bulwark a \u201cgarbage organization.\u201d\n\nI like Domenech. He\u2019s a talented writer and an interesting thinker. We\u2019ve always gotten along well. That said, he\u2019s been convicted of two of the three biggest crimes in journalism: plagiarism and payola. The website he runs has published everything from an affirmative defense of Roy Moore\u2019s affinity for teenage girls\u2014that\u2019s what his response above was about\u2014to a snuff fantasy that included the following passage:\n\nClose your eyes and imagine holding someone\u2019s scalp in your hands. I don\u2019t mean cradling his skull as you thousand-yard-stare at his lifeless face. I mean a real scalp, Indian-style, of some enemy you just killed on the battlefield; somebody you hated and who hated you back. You killed him, won the day, carved off the top of his skull, and now you\u2019re standing over him victorious on the now-quiet field of battle, with a quiet breeze blowing through your hair. Your adrenaline is still pumping with that primal feeling of victory and the elation of having survived when others didn\u2019t. . . . So, back to scalping thing. When you make that long trek to the reservation the leftists have set up for you\u2014and make that trek you will\u2014what memories do you want to take with you? When living in the liberal utopian nightmare of 57 genders and government control over everything in your life, you will want to have been a Lakota. You\u2019ll want to know, to remember, even just cherish the knowledge that, one day, you rode out onto the plains and made them feel pain.\n\nI should emphasize that these were not tweets from people who wrote for the Federalist but actual pieces that were edited and published on the Federalist.\n\nYou tell me which is the garbage organization.\n\nAll of which is to say that criticisms from bad actors are not worth paying attention to.\n\nI do, however, take to heart criticism from people I admire and respect, such as Erick Erickson and Alexandra DeSanctis. (Full disclosure: Erickson is a friend and has written for The Bulwark.)\n\nTheir criticisms are\u2014and here I\u2019m approximating, because I didn\u2019t want to ask them and put them on the spot; I trust they\u2019ll correct me if I\u2019m mistaken\u2014that the pro-life movement is different from other causes. It\u2019s not a fight about eminent domain or gun control or tax rates. It\u2019s about life and death for the most vulnerable humans. It\u2019s about the pain that women who have abortions often carry with them for the rest of their lives. It\u2019s about the 61 million Americans who should be here, but aren\u2019t, because of the gruesome regime ushered in by Roe v. Wade.\n\nAnd given this difference, pro-life activists\u2014however ridiculous it might be for them to appear at CPAC\u2014ought to be cut some slack and that a place supposedly made up of fellow travelers, such as The Bulwark, ought not to be part of the pile-on pro-lifers get from the rest of the culture by sending someone who disagrees with the cause, like Molly Jong-Fast, to cover the event. Because at the end of the day, this gives aid and comfort to the pro-abortion forces.\n\nAs I said, I take this criticism very much to heart. We are a new publication and even though we have published several pieces about abortion, our institutional bona fides are a recent vintage. So I understand and respect this criticism.\n\nBut while I\u2019m sympathetic to the argument, at the level of final judgment I disagree: The pro-life cause has gained a great deal of ground over the last 20 years, in part by not treating pro-choicers as pariahs, but by trying to persuade them, incrementally moving both the law and public opinion. We are not the side that tries to kick James Damore out for wrongthink. And that\u2019s a big part of why we\u2019ve been changing the culture of abortion.\n\nMy friends may disagree with this judgment in this particular case. They may be correct and I may be incorrect. But it seems to me that the pro-life movement is not so fragile that it cannot withstand the presence of someone with dissenting views. That strength comes not because of any person or advocacy group. It comes because this cause is right and reflects the truth of what it means to be human.\n\nOne final note: Over the last three years there\u2019s been a lot of reductionism on abortion, as if it\u2019s the only issue that matters and that all political calculations have to be made, at base, around it.\n\nIf this year\u2019s CPAC is to be believed, we\u2019re entering a period in which socialism will be the maximum question and everything about our politics will be reduced to the question of \u201cAre you willing to stop socialism, or not?\u201d\n\nYet socialism and abortion do not always go together. If you look at the social democracies of Europe, their abortion laws are nothing like America\u2019s: They are much, much stricter. The NARAL people would lose their ever-loving minds if America tried to impose, say, France\u2019s abortion restrictions.\n\nI often wonder what conservatives would choose if they were offered that bargain: Trade America\u2019s less-socialist, more-free-market-oriented compact for a restricted, European-style, socialist-democratic abortion regime. In 2015 (the most recent year for which we have reliable data) there were 638,169 abortions in America. What if we could cut that number in half\u2014or even by 20 percent\u2014but it meant transitioning to a European-socialist economic model? Would you take that deal? Would the people at CPAC?\n\nIt\u2019s a hypothetical, of course. America\u2019s aspirational socialists are not, in the main, offering this exchange. But the question is clarifying.\n\nSpeaking only for myself, I would take it in a heartbeat. And I\u2019m sure someone on Twitter will get mad about that, too."

    "text": "This post has been updated with a statement from the company.\n\nOne thing that people do on the Internet is they make fake images and pass them around as real, for fun. Why do they do this? Sometimes it is funny. Sometimes they are trying to troll people.\n\nThat is context for this tweet.\n\nIt appears to show that the globally trending #TrumpWon began in Russia \u2014 specifically, in St. Petersburg. There's resonance to that. When Adrian Chen of the New York Times explored the world of online Russian trolls, his search brought him back to an office building in that city. The image was quickly picked up on Twitter and passed around. But there's good reason to think it's not real.\n\nThe person who tweeted the image said he'd spotted it on TrendsMap.com, a site that catalogues Twitter trending topics. Here's what the map of Twitter trends around St. Petersburg looks like now.\n\nIf #TrumpWon trended there earlier, it isn't now. But there's no evidence it did start there.\n\nUpdate: A spokesperson for TrendsMap confirms that the map isn't theirs -- and that the hashtag started in the U.S., according to their data.\n\n\"This is certainly not from any of our tools and do not know of any tools that look this way,\" Kathy Mellett said in an email. \"Based upon our analysis, #TrumpWon primarily came from the US. There was an initial spike just after the debate followed by a much larger one a few hours later. In particular, around 97% of the initial spike of approximately 6,000 tweets came from the US.\" The next highest countries? Canada and the U.K.\n\nNotice for one thing that the map provided by @DustinGiebel doesn't look like the TrendsMap map. The map I posted above is from a premium account for the service; if there's another tool that overlays blue dots, I couldn't find it. What's more, the map in the tweet appears to be based on a Google Maps image, not one from TrendsMap. (Notice the city\u2019s name in both Cyrillic and Latin letters.) If the trend started from a handful of trolls in St. Petersburg, it's odd that they would be geographically distributed across the city instead of all in one location. It's odd that the graph would show a slowly, evenly increasing number of tweets from that location. (The axes are obscured, making it hard to tell what's being measured.)\n\nBut TrendsMap does show the timeline of #TrumpWon tweets in St. Petersburg \u2014 and they began well after the hashtag took off in Washington, for example. There was a spike as interest in the topic peaked globally, which is what you'd expect in a local region from something that's trending globally. (The graphs in other cities, like London, peaked at the same time. London, though, saw more sustained traffic on the hashtag.)\n\nTrendsMap's list of the top hashtags in the city for the past week doesn't include #TrumpWon, which could just mean that it wasn't as popular there as were some other hashtags. But it also suggests that it's unlikely that so many #TrumpWon hashtags originated in St. Petersburg that it created a global trend.\n\nWe know that online trolls were trying to game the politics of the debate, but that was American Reddit and 4chan users who were trying to move the online polls that sprang up after the debate was over. But this seems unlikely. Over Twitter, Chen told me that \"none of the trolls that I have catalogued tweeted #trumpwon,\" suggesting that if St. Petersburg trolls were tweeting the hashtag, it wasn't trolls that Chen has been tracking. Others reinforced that.\n\nNot sure if I buy \"Petersburg made the #TrumpWon tag go trending.\" A lot of activity seems to come from 1 account there. (@TeamTrumpRussia) \u2014 Aric Toler (@AricToler) September 27, 2016\n\nRemember, too, that Trump started using the phrase \"Trump Won\" in ads even before the debate ended. Most major news sites, including The Post, had big banner ads reading \"TRUMP WON\" in capital letters. The effort didn't need much help from a few trolls in Russia.\n\nBut, again, we only have this one image that suggests that's who was behind it in the first place. It plays nicely into the idea that Russian agents are doing their best to rig the election for Trump, but in this case, the evidence simply isn't there.\n\nThe lesson, as always, is this: Nothing on the Internet is real."

    "text": "Sources with links to the intelligence community report that Donald Trump is being investigated for trafficking underage girls into the United States for sexual abuse, under the guise of his shell modeling company, Trump Models.\n\nThese sources report that Trump is linked to a Russian-based human trafficking enterprise, where girls and women were kidnapped into sexual slavery. This includes underage girls and minors.\n\nThe human trafficking arrests made recently in Europe, and several human trafficking cases in the United States, are linked to the same paedophile ring, these sources say.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate make a contribution here. , there are buttons around the site, or you could\n\nFurthermore, the sex trafficking of girls and underage children is linked to the Russian government via the same internet data that links Hostkey, the Russian hackers of the American election, with Mir Telemakti. They all share a registrant address in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nSources report that this nominal internet services provider, Dragonara Alliance, is in fact a mere intranet, over which Russian organized crime sponsored by Vladimir Putin discusses the kidnap and rape of girls. Dragonara Alliance was traced back to various IP addresses shared by Hostkey and Mir Telemakti. An intranet needs publicly to exist, these sources say, as an IP provider, in order that its existence not cause questions. But the NSA is deep inside Dragonara Alliance\u2019s servers, and can read their packet data. It provided material assistance to Europol and Interpol in making recent arrests, these sources say.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s company, Trump Models, recently locked its account on Twitter. It has been listed as paying women slave wages, and Trump has been accused of bringing in girls illegally, making them work without visas for nothing and housing them 11 to a room.\n\nTrump Model Management recruited models as young as 14\n\nDespite the scrutiny, Trump Models has deleted its Instagram account. Sources report Trump cannot provide accounts showing Trump Models was ever a legitimate business. There are multiple public reports that the agency forced girls to work for slave wages. The Daily Beast\u2019s Michael Gross also reported that Donald Trump personally pimped out underage girls from parties at his own hotels. For this, Trump, and his children Don Jr, Eric and Ivanka Trump, all part of Trump International Hotels management, may be held liable, sources say.\n\nFurther, sources report that Smart jet Aviation LTD, which uses SmartJet.ru and Jetorama.com, is an aviation company used to ferry trafficked females around. Smart Jet purchased a lot of fuel and acts as a broker for private flights. Again, sloppy opsec had the company registered to the same PO Box as Hostkey in the British Virgin Islands. The Smart Jet Aviation registrants use a type of trolling familiar to the student of the Trump-Russia \u201cPO Box 3469\u201d address, the use of a Russian scientist as a pseudonym for the registrant. However, they were dumb enough to use an email address connected with \u201cbizarrebrain.com\u201d where they forgot to take the real name of the registrant, one Damir Valiullin, off the site. Damir links in the Panama Papers to Dennis Kolyago, who is a senior executive with a regional Russian fuel company. This may explain all Smart Jet Aviation\u2019s purchases of airline fuel for human trafficking.\n\nJetSmarter, a company linked to Donald Trump and the Russian mob, used to be called Smart Jets Inc in the United States, but it is not known if it is the same company as \u201cSmart Jet Aviation.\u201d\n\nJetSmarter maintains it is a legitimate business. Sources say it is under counterintelligence investigation for Russian mob activity. Its former CEO , Edward Barsky, was a mobster who has invested in Sunny Isles, Florida.\n\nBarsky was also executive chairman of local real-estate development company Verzasca Group, according to a 2015 press release issued by the company.\n\nAnd it is directly linked to Donald Trump through both Barsky and Mike Flynn and Ron Torossian. Researcher Louise Neu showed on Twitter that Torossian was a spokesman for Michael Cohen\u2019s partner, and also wrote the pro-Turkey op-ed attributed to Mike Flynn. Torossian was forced to amend his FARA earlier this year.\n\nDmitry Sorokin, the current COO of Smart Jet Aviation, is also listed on LinkedIn as the head of Red Square Holding. Red Square Realty is linked to Donald Trump\u2019s own Miami properties and to the Russian mob, as we have previously reported.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s PACs also accepted funding from companies linked directly to the Smart Jet Aviation and Hostkey P.O. Box.\n\nIs it a coincidence that Smart Jet Aviation, registered to the same PO Box as Hostkey, hackers of the Russian election, and Jet Smarter, BOTH share investors with Donald Trump\u2019s properties in Miami, Florida? Is it also a coincidence that JetSmarter used to be called \u201cSmart Jets\u201d in America?\n\nPossibly so. The company declined to comment. But what is definite is that Smart Jet Aviation is being investigated for human trafficking with Dragonara Alliance used for the communications; and Donald Trump is being investigated for human trafficking with Trump Models. JetSmarter is under investigation for Russian mob ties, and Smart Jet for trafficking girls into misery, rape and death. Industrialized child abuse has been carried out on behalf of Vladimir Putin. And for Donald Trump himself, a locked Twitter and deleted Instagram are not going to save him."

Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, said countries bring a blend of political, economic and military power to bear against adversaries.\n\nThe speech outlined what some Western analysts consider the signature strategy of Russia under President Vladimir V.

    "text": "NORFOLK, VA\u2014In an alarming case that has baffled and repulsed many, sources confirmed Tuesday that a severely deformed freak born without a penis has managed to live with the condition for over 26 years.\n\nThe bizarre, monstrous human specimen was reportedly born with no other noticeable maladies and has, amazingly enough, attempted to lead a normal, albeit severely impaired life despite possessing no male genitalia whatsoever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe first noticed something was off about three months into the pregnancy, and I was of course horrified,\u201d said Dr. Mark Joules, the obstetrician who delivered the grotesque\u2014some would say subhuman\u2014abhorrence of nature. \u201cYou could clearly see in the ultrasound that a penis and testicles were not developing as one would hope\u2014or at all, in fact\u2014and we immediately knew something was terribly, terribly wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad we caught it earlier, we most likely would have recommended that the pregnancy be terminated,\u201d Joules continued. \u201cBut it was unfortunately too late at that point, so we were forced to deliver the baby as planned and just pray that it could get by in that state. We did our best, but with such a horrible and incredibly crippling deformity, there wasn\u2019t much hope to be had.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, the sadly disfigured 26-year-old\u2019s quality of life has been greatly diminished due to such a condition. Sources said the abnormal, visibly blemished creature has been repeatedly passed over for employment opportunities, frequently gawked at and harassed on the street by total strangers, and has faced near constant discrimination for over two decades, all due to the horrific and debilitating birth defect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, many are reportedly unable to look past the glaring deformity and simply see the 26-year-old as a human being.\n\n\u201cWhoa, look at that,\u201d said 31-year-old onlooker Grant Megson, who, like many others, gawked at the freakish human anomaly while passing by on the sidewalk. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to stare, but honestly, it\u2019s hard not to. Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wish some of my buddies were here to see this,\u201d added Megson, smiling and taking one last look before continuing with his day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSources confirmed that, unfortunately, such cases are actually quite common, with roughly one in every two babies afflicted with the lifelong disfigurement.\n\nHowever, that is reportedly little consolation to the malformed specimen\u2019s father, who told reporters that a day doesn\u2019t go by in which he doesn\u2019t wish his child was born a normal, healthy baby with male genitalia.\n\n\u201cSadly, because the deformity is so obvious, our child was treated very differently from all the other kids,\u201d the father told reporters, admitting that he was incredibly upset and disappointed when he first learned that his baby would be born a freak, one to be mistreated and viewed as inferior its whole life. \u201cEven though the doctors explained all the incredible challenges and prejudice the poor thing would face, I don\u2019t think it really sunk in until after the birth, when I saw the disfigurement with my own eyes. You never want your child to have to grow up that way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut what can you do?\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m just thankful that my other two kids weren\u2019t born like that.\u201d"

    "text": "COLUMBUS, OH\u2014In an alarming trend that some are calling a failure of U.S. drug prevention policies, daily marijuana use increased nearly threefold this month among 26-year-old Gary.\n\nResearchers at the Department of Health and Human Services are attributing the spike in cannabis consumption to a number of troubling factors, including Gary- related underemployment, decreased motivation, and prolonged exposure to Josh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is very distressing, to say the least,\" said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who blamed the increase on a lack of programs designed to educate Gary about the dangers of marijuana. \"As a nation, it is vital that we learn how to talk to Gary about drugs\u2014and how to listen to what he's trying to tell us.\"\n\n\"We've failed to recognize warning signs such as boredom and a growing need to just chill out,\" Sebelius added. \"But we intend to use every resource at our disposal to meet our goal of cutting marijuana use among Gary by half over the next 10 years.\"\n\nA recent survey conducted by HHS suggests that the drug's recent popularity with Gary might be linked to his girlfriend Laura working longer hours lately, to his recent acquisition of a quarter ounce of weed, or to his growing belief that it is socially acceptable to be stoned as fuck all day long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to federal records, daily Gary marijuana use began at age 15 and rose steadily over the next two years, only to plummet dramatically in 2001 when Gary's mother discovered the remains of a joint in an Altoids container on his dresser.\n\nDespite the momentary decline, usage began creeping back up to previous levels almost immediately, with intake peaking in 2005 following the purchase of a sweet 3-foot glass bong.\n\n\"Our efforts to keep marijuana out of the hands of Gary have clearly been insufficient,\" said Benjamin Whitmore, a researcher with the National Institute on Drug Abuse who recently found evidence that Gary can easily obtain pot from that one guy who always scores the super dank shit with all the crystals. \"He already smoked his half of the bag he split with Kevin, and now he's dipping into the rest of it. We're looking at a full-blown, Gary-wide crisis here.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhitmore's study indicates that constantly being fried can have a variety of negative effects on Gary, including a sharp uptick in the viewing of crappy movies and a noted decrease in Pop-Tart reserves.\n\nIn addition, being so fucking stoned all the time can affect job productivity, with Gary often delivering pizzas to the wrong house, or just showing up in customers' living rooms without thinking to bring their orders.\n\nOne local marijuana expert confirmed that the drug has become a regular routine\u2014and even a lifestyle\u2014for Gary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Dude, he's been smoking up like crazy,\" roommate Chip Nichols said while carefully breaking apart a bud on the sleeve of Herbie Hancock's 1974 record Thrust. \"It's awesome. First thing each day he wakes and bakes, and then an hour later he's yelling that we've got to pack another bowl. He usually stops home between pizza deliveries to pull a couple tubes before driving back to work.\"\n\nContinued Nichols, \"Dude, he's been smoking up like crazy.\"\n\nNichols said that pot-smoking among Gary had steadily dropped off in 2009, reaching an all-time low early this February, a circumstance possibly connected to Laura's increasingly vocal disapproval of his habit and to Gary's dealer getting busted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite her criticism of federal policies that have failed to reverse the trend in Gary, Secretary Sebelius said the nation should be heartened by new reports that marijuana use has completely ceased among Chicago resident Erica, who recently got really high and totally freaked out while watching Starship Troopers."

MUOS-5 launched on an Atlas 5 June 24, and was scheduled to reach geostationary orbit July 3. [SpaceNews]\n\nA Soyuz carrying three people docked with the International Space Station early Saturday. The Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft docked with the Rassvet module at 12:06 a.m. Eastern Saturday, a little more than two days after launch from Baikonur. The spacecraft ferried to the station Anatoly Ivanishin, Takuya Onishi and Kate Rubins to the station for a six-month stay, joining the two Russians and one American already there. [SPACE.com]\n\nThe French space agency CNES supports an extension of the ISS but is skeptical about the cost benefits of reusable rockets. CNES President Jean-Yves Le Gall said Friday he expects the European Space Agency, the only ISS partner yet to endorse an extension of the station to 2024, to finally do so at a ministerial meeting in December. Le Gall said that the Ariane 6 vehicle under development now would be cost competitive if it was operating today, but said it wasn\u2019t clear that efforts by SpaceX and others to develop reusable systems would be able to lower launch costs. He also said he expected the European Commission to eventually approve plans by CNES to sell its stake in Arianespace to Airbus Safran Launchers, giving that joint venture a majority stake in the launch services provider. [SpaceNews]\n\nProviders of terrestrial and satellite broadband will face off at an FCC meeting this week. The Thursday meeting will discuss sharing of portions of Ka-band spectrum between satellite systems and proposed terrestrial 5G wireless systems. The chairman of the FCC, Tom Wheeler, has encouraged satellite companies to \u201cget on the train\u201d and cooperate in sharing agreements, even as satellite companies have argued for priority in those bands to protect their investments in systems that use them. ViaSat had has taken steps to support the FCC\u2019s approach, but warned last week the commission\u2019s plans \u201cputs new 5G operations ahead of licensed satellite.\u201d [SpaceNews]\n\nChina\u2019s second space lab module is at the spaceport for a launch in September.

Police in Baltimore said that Macauley was walking her dogs near her home in the city around 11 p.m. Friday night when she was stabbed. She was taken to a nearby hospital, where she died. Police said they did not have a suspect or a motive for the attack. Macauley had specialized in studying the economics of the space industry, in particular Earth observation. At the time of her death she was vice president for research and a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, and also served on the steering committee for the ongoing Earth sciences decadal study by the National Academies.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said Friday that Baikonur, in Kazakhstan, was a \u201ccommon project\u201d of the two countries, and would not be abandoned even as Russia makes use of its new spaceport at Vostochny in the Russian Far East. A long-term development plan for Baikonur should be complete by the end of this year, he said.

Spaceport Tucson will be a pad for launches of high-altitude balloons developed by World View, whose new headquarters are under construction just south of the airport. A Southwest Airlines manager said placing the spaceport next to the airport is a \u201cterrible idea\u201d that \u201cerodes safety.\u201d World View officials said the balloon launches will take place early in the morning and be woven into the airport\u2019s overall traffic flow, exiting controlled airspace within four minutes. [Arizona Daily Star]\n\nSpaceX has won approval from the FAA to place a historic rocket stage on display outside its headquarters. The FAA approved the plan for SpaceX to install the first stage that landed last December outside its Hawthorne, California, headquarters. The stage, nearly 50 meters tall, required the approval as SpaceX\u2019s headquarters is adjacent to Hawthorne Municipal Airport. The stage was the first the company landed, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk previously said he planned to put the stage on display rather than refly it. [Florida Today]"

How does something like this happen? Everything involved is huge and either slow or stationary. What does it take to fuck up in such a grand and preventable manner? It seems a drunk captain helps.\n\nHere, you watch for yourself:\n\nAt first I was wondering if, somehow, the crew just, uh, forgot they had those huge cranes on deck and thought they could somehow clear the bridge? That seemed pretty impossible, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe massive ship hit the bridge and caused some damage to itself and the lower part of the bridge, though thankfully nobody was injured. The ship then backed away, perhaps hoping nobody noticed, but the vessel was intercepted by the Korean Coast Guard (KCG).\n\nThe KCG questioned the crew about what the hell happened, and found that the captain had a blood alcohol level of 0.086 percent. In case you\u2019re not familiar with the blood alcohol limits for piloting cargo vessels, the maximum allowed is 0.03 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s legal to consume alcohol on a ship as long as you\u2019re not the one steering; as yet, it\u2019s not clear if the Cap\u2019n Drunk was at the helm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder an hour or so before hitting the bridge, the Seagrand hit a cruise ship and prior to impacting the bridge the coastal navigation service contacted the ship to warn them about running their big-ass ship into the bridge, but the captain reportedly didn\u2019t understand English well and may not have understood.\n\nI mean, even if your English is terrible you\u2019d think a panicked message from the port and a bridge filling up your view out the window might be enough to give a hint about what\u2019s going on, but, you know, dude was pretty drunk.\n\nThe captain was detained by authorities and the owners and operators of the ship, VostokMorService and LLC SK Grand Shipping have been contacted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn case you\u2019re worried, the 1,400 tons of iron pipes carried on the ship made it to the port of Busan just fine, though."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Michael Cohen provided a detailed account of a crucial and disputed element of his business dealings with President Trump in his testimony before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday. Cohen, who was Trump\u2019s longtime personal attorney and an executive at the president\u2019s real estate company up until he took office, said Trump did not explicitly tell him to lie to Congress about the scope of their efforts to build a skyscraper in Moscow.\n\n\u201cI lied to Congress [about] when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January of 2016. That was false. Our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign. Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates,\u201d he said.\n\nCohen went on to say Trump \u201cmade clear\u201d that he wanted Cohen to lie about the timing of the project without directly saying so. Cohen noted that Trump regularly \u2014 and falsely \u2014 said he had no business dealings in Russia both during personal conversations in 2016 and in appearances on the campaign trail.\n\nMichael Cohen, former personal attorney of President Trump, sits at the witness table waiting to testify before a House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing on Capitol Hill on Feb. 27, 2019. (Yahoo News photo Illustration; photos: AP, Getty) More\n\n\u201cIn conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there was no Russian business and then go on to lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nAdditionally, Cohen claimed that Trump\u2019s desire for him to lie was clear because the president\u2019s \u201cpersonal lawyers\u201d reviewed the statement he delivered to Congress in 2017. In that statement, Cohen stated he gave up on the Trump Tower Moscow project in late January 2016, when he determined that the \u201cproposal was not feasible for a variety of business reasons and should not be pursued further.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to know that Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow tower negotiations before I gave it,\u201d said Cohen.\n\nLast May, Yahoo News was first to report that prosecutors and congressional investigators had obtained extensive documentation showing Cohen pursued the project through the middle of 2016 and had likely lied to Congress. Cohen, who had a reputation as a fiercely loyal fixer for the president, was sentenced to three years in prison in December after pleading guilty to what a federal judge described as \u201ca veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct,\u201d including lying to Congress about the Moscow skyscraper project, and arranging payments to women who alleged they had had affairs with President Trump in an effort to suppress their stories during the campaign.\n\nCohen\u2019s detailed description of Trump\u2019s role in his congressional testimony comes in the wake of a report published by BuzzFeed last January attributed to two anonymous \u201cfederal law enforcement officials\u201d that claimed Trump \u201cdirected\u201d Cohen to lie to Congress. That report caused a huge stir because it indicated that Trump could himself be guilty of a crime, since many experts say encouraging false testimony before Congress is illegal. The office of special counsel Robert Mueller, which helped prosecute Cohen, quickly released a statement disputing the BuzzFeed story.\n\n\u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate,\u201d the statement said.\n\nCohen\u2019s congressional testimony is not the first time he has discussed Trump\u2019s role in his prior statement to Congress and said there was no specific directive for him to lie. In the guilty plea allocution that he delivered in court last November, Cohen suggested that he falsely said the project had concluded and did not have extensive involvement from Trump because he was familiar with the \u201cday-to-day political messaging\u201d that Trump and his advisers broadcast during the campaign, including \u201crepeated disavowals of commercial and political ties between [Trump] and Russia.\u201d In the allocution, which was probably reviewed by Mueller\u2019s team, Cohen referred to Trump as \u201cIndividual 1.\u201d"

    "text": "\u201cWhat has been challenging about this case and this investigation is that, as has been widely reported, certain activity has gone on for years,\u201d the prosecutor, Lorrin Freeman, said last week. \u201cThe more interviews you do, the more interviews you have to do.\u201d\n\nMs. Freeman, who is the Wake County district attorney and began investigating Mr. Dowless\u2019s activities in Bladen County after the local prosecutor recused himself, said on Wednesday that Mr. Dowless had been arrested in the morning and was taken to Raleigh for processing. Mr. Dowless\u2019s secured bond was set at $30,000, and he was ordered to avoid contact with anyone who was identified in the indictments.\n\nFour other people were also indicted and face charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and of illegally possessing absentee ballots. One of the four was also accused of falsely signing the voter certification on an absentee ballot.\n\nProsecutors could eventually seek additional charges against Mr. Dowless or his associates, especially in connection with the 2018 general election. The federal authorities have not said whether they are investigating Mr. Dowless.\n\nMr. Dowless has some familiarity with the criminal justice system, and his record includes felony convictions for perjury and fraud. But his background did not keep him from working for Mr. Harris, as well as other Democratic and Republican politicians who were seeking office in southeastern North Carolina.\n\n[Read: Inside a Fly-by-Night Operation to Harvest Ballots in North Carolina]\n\nThere, Mr. Dowless built a reputation as a savvy organizer of effective absentee ballot efforts that, at least sometimes, seemed to rely on criminal conduct and a network of workers with little legal knowledge but a need for quick cash. In 2017, just months after Mr. Dowless worked for one of Mr. Harris\u2019s rivals during a campaign for Congress, Mr. Harris hired him for his 2018 House bid. In doing so, Mr. Harris ignored the misgivings of one of his sons, who memorialized his concerns in an email that became public last week.\n\n\u201cThe key thing that I am fairly certain they do that is illegal is that they collected the completed absentee ballots and mail them all at once,\u201d John Harris wrote to his father in 2017."

    "text": "Exclusive: Multiple sources with links to the justice and intelligence communities report that Special Counsel Mueller has dozens of sealed indictments against suspects in the Trump Russia scandal. There are now several sealed indictments against Donald Trump personally. This site exclusively reported the first indictment returned against Trump in May, a RICO charge involving Felix Sater, Bayrock, the Trump Organization, and agents of the Russian state.\n\nCNN broke the news that Robert Mueller would be revealing the first charge, or charges, in the Trump Russia investigation in the last week of October. Their reporting did not specify which suspects would be charged first.\n\nThis article will attempt to summarize some of our reporting on evidence the Special Counsel has before him, and on existing sealed indictments. In a separate story, I will summarize which of my reports have been confirmed by the mainstream media.\n\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible. If you can help us, please donate.\n\nDonald Trump \u2013 indicted on RICO over the Felix Sater and Bayrock case, and on other charges which sources have requested we do not report.\n\nMike Flynn \u2013 indicted for failing to register under FARA, the Foreign Agents\u2019 Registration Act, as an agent of Turkey whilst National Security Advisor\n\nWhile we are able to report that Special Counsel Mueller is holding dozens of sealed indictments, many of which were returned while James Comey was Director of the FBI, we cannot report with specificity who is indicted on what charge other than the two above, because sources were not specific. We have reported on the investigations suspects are facing, and these are listed below.\n\nSources did not specify who was to be indicted under which offense. However, multiple sources did confirm that some categories of offense considered included, variously; espionage, a capital crime; obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice; violations of the Logan Act; lying to the FBI; failure to register under FARA; and RICO, not only in the matter of the Trump Organization, but also for the GOP as a body, taking Ambassador Kislyak\u2019s money at the GOP convention, where both Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan were intercepted on Kislyak\u2019s hot-miked phone.\n\nDonald Trump \u2013 RICO over Felix Sater, Bayrock, and other unnamed offenses. Mr. Trump is indicted. He is also under investigation for sexual abuse and human trafficking relating to Trump Models.\n\nMike Pence \u2013under investigation for lying to the FBI over Mike Flynn, conspiracy to obstruct justice over Flynn\u2019s ties to Turkey and Russia, violating the Logan Act, and other serious unnamed offenses that sources refused to specify.\n\nPaul Ryan \u2013 under investigation for accepting Russian money from Sergei Kislyak at the GOP Convention and subsequently admitting that he knew it was being washed into the GOP.\n\nRex Tillerson \u2013 under criminal state investigation by NY AG Schneiderman for Exxon stock fraud over the \u2018Wayne Tracker\u2019 emails.\n\nSteve Mnuchin \u2013 the Treasury Secretary is under investigation for espionage and money laundering relating to Russian money pumped into Trump\u2019s campaign. He was taped in Scotland by GCHQ, who have given the recordings to U.S. intelligence.\n\nMike Flynn \u2013 while we reported that Flynn was indicted for FARA failure under Turkey, he can expect charges for espionage. His work for Putin involved co-ordinating Putin\u2019s propaganda of hatred right across Europe as we reported. He additionally has been a knowing Russian asset since he was at the DIA. He used AI to coordinate Russian propaganda in the US election.\n\nMike Flynn Jr \u2013 also being investigated for espionage. His father had made a deal to spare the life of his son, we reported. That deal, separate sources said, was later nullified by the authorities because Flynn Jr. would not stop tweeting out divisive propaganda and hatred of the kind he propagated during the election, knowing it was from Russia.\n\nThe Republican Party as a body is under investigation for RICO for accepting Russian money. The GOP itself is being considered to be a corrupt organization under the RICO statutes. Sources were firm that the GOP, as it is presently known, may no longer exist after this investigation and a new party of the right may have to form. Sources did not say if charges or indictments had been returned against the party however.\n\nDonald J Trump Jr and Eric Trump are under investigation for, among other offenses, knowingly allowing and abetting the use of the Kelhios botnet to steal credit card information in Trump hotels, which was sold on the darknet, in collusion with the Russia mob and Peter Levashov. This is why Ivanka Trump was removed from Trump Hotel companies by her father. His attempt to exculpate her was considered risible by sources familiar with the matter.\n\nDonald J Trump Jr is on tape colluding with Russia in France before the election. He is being investigated for collusion with Russia over the meeting that was taped in Trump Tower.\n\n(These are not intended to be exclusionary. We are aware of other offenses the Trump sons and their father are being investigated for and are withholding reporting at the request of sources).\n\nIvanka Trump is being investigated for washing Russian money into Iran with her fraudulent Azerbijan hotel deal. She is under investigation for other activities about which we are preparing a separate story.\n\nEric Trump, Brad Parscale, Jared Kushner, Pyotr Levashov, Michael Cohen and Boris Epshteyn (among several others) are under investigation for espionage, money laundering, and other offenses for the activities of the Alfa, Spectrum and Silicon Valley Bank servers washing hacked voter databases and the stolen DNC \u2018Vertica\u2019 database to the Trump Server. The Kelhios botnet was used to propagate the hack.\n\nMichael Cohen is under investigation for money laundering and, along with Boris Ephsteyn, paying hackers on behalf of Mr. Trump. as suggested in the Steele dossier.\n\nPaul Manafort is under more additional investigations than we have time to list here, including FARA violations, money laundering, RICO, bribery, espionage, lying to the FBI, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. That list is not meant to be exhaustive.\n\nMitch McConnell is under investigation for violating the Logan Act by running his own foreign policy in Iran in defiance of President Obama, as well as for links to gun and drug runners linked to the MEK organization.\n\nJason Chaffetz is under investigation for tweeting Director Comey\u2019s letter, which was classified.\n\nDevin Nunes is under investigation for espionage. He is on SIGINT in Portugal colluding with Russia. He is also under investigation for obstruction of justice, for revealing earlier this year that \u201cone member of the transition team\u201d (which was Mr. Epshteyn) was under FBI investigation.\n\nSteve Bannon is under investigation for espionage for colluding with the Russian state. So are Nigel Farage and Dana Rohrabacher, who were taped by multiple Western nations on a fishing trip together and in the case of Mr. Farage on many other occasions.\n\nJulian Assange is under investigation for espionage. Nigel Farage acted as Trump\u2019s courier to Assange. Wikileaks are regarded as an arm of the Russian state.\n\nCarter Page is under investigation for espionage. The tape, or recording, of Donald Trump agreeing to change sanctions policy for hacking help, which he took to Moscow, is in the hands of Bob Mueller. The first FISA application made in June 2016, which named Page, Manafort, Epshteyn and Trump, was made over their conversation with Sergei Kislyak in the Mayflower Hotel in which Trump agrees to do this. The FISA warrant application failed, sources speculated, because Trump may not have known at that time that he was being taped.\n\nJeff Sessions is under investigation for espionage, obstruction of justice over the firing of Director Comey and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He has, however, co-operated with the authorities since Comey was fired and may have mitigated the penalties he would otherwise have incurred.\n\nWe have no doubt that this list is not exhaustive.\n\nRead more of our exclusive Trump Russia journalism by following the links to the side or in the text.\n\nPatribotics is very grateful for the support of our readers, which makes this effort possible.

    "text": "The Russian Embassy in the US took aim at America's F-35 stealth fighters on Friday in a threatening message apparently tweeted in response to an earlier speech by the chief of staff of the US Air Force.\n\n\"'If a Russia... ever was to see an F-35 inside its airspace', we would love to send Chief of Staff of the [US Air Force] Gen. David L. Goldfein 'message with two words' \u2014 'remember Vietnam,'\" the tweet read, adding, \"'An F-35 will never be alone.'\"\n\nThe cryptic message was accompanied by Vietnam War propaganda footage of Soviet missiles shooting down fighter jets to an operatic score, the lyrics for which reportedly were \"you can't take away the sky from Vietnam\" and \"you can't take the sun away from Vietnam,\" according to Foxtrot Alpha, which first reported this story.\n\nThe US lost 1,737 aircraft in the skies above Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos during the Vietnam War, according to Air Force Times.\n\nThe message is weird even for the Russian embassy, which has a history of posting similar tweeting tweets.\n\nThe tweet was a play on the words Goldfein had spoken during a talk at the Brookings Institution last Wednesday. He boasted about the successes of the F-35 during a recent air-combat exercise.\n\nRead more: US Air Force F-35s wrecked their enemies in mock air combat \u2014 even the new pilots were racking up kills against simulated near-peer threats\n\n\"If a China or a Russia or another adversary on the globe ever were to see a F-35 inside their airspace,\" Goldfein said. \"I would love to send them all messages with two words \u2014 'we're here.'\"\n\n\"It's not 'I'm here,'\" he added. \"An F-35 will never be alone.\"\n\nEmphasizing the importance of penetrating capabilities, Goldfein described the F-35 as a \"quarterback\" capable of relaying information to multiple force assets operating in enemy airspace, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\n\"We're here ... We've been watching you. We know what's going on, and we've already penetrated whatever the defenses you think you have,\" Goldfein said.\n\nThe Russians are apparently less than pleased with thought of US fighter jets operating in their airspace, thus the hostile tweet."

    "text": "I\u2019m for Brexit. As a Young Conservative in Wadhurst, I wanted to leave the EU. When John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, I saw it as a betrayal of such massive consequence I briefly joined the Labour Party \u2014 and was later forced to confess this indiscretion to Tory associations up and down the country. As a student at Oxford, I joined the Campaign for an Independent Britain, and formed lasting friendships with like-minded undergraduates for whom sovereignty was the first principle of patriotism and politics; everything else depended on being able to govern our own affairs. I am one of those Conservatives who, like the grassroots, cannot understand why so many MPs are so wedded to the idea of the EU. It is everything the Conservative rank and file oppose in three quarters of Conservative associations up and down the country. There was a hideously awkward moment in 2008 when, as a candidate in a \u201cworkshop\u201d (don\u2019t ask), I listened to Jane Ellison, selected for Battersea, give an answer on the EU that seemed far too soft. \u201cOooh no,\u201d I said helpfully, \u2018no don\u2019t say it like that \u2013 you\u2019ll sound like Ken Clarke.\u201d Her expression was icy. At the next tea break, an organiser pulled me aside. \u2018She was Ken Clarke\u2019s Chief of Staff,\u2019 he said.\n\nI campaigned fervently for Brexit on social media. I wrote my first New York Times Op-Ed in favour of Brexit, telling Americans Leavers were no racists. The night before the vote, I appeared on Channel Four\u2019s debate with Jeremy Paxman, debating Yvette Cooper. It was a ratings success. Yet when I left (in a cab with Toby Young and Julia Hartley-Brewer) I was pessimistic; polls said we\u2019d lose.\n\nWe didn\u2019t lose. Even as gloating Remainers wrote us off I was on the phone to my friend Dan Hannan. \u2018It\u2019s not over yet,\u2019 he said as I sat in a hotel in my pyjamas. \u2018There\u2019s something good going on in Sunderland\u2026. Our people at the count think it\u2019s looking good\u2026\u2019\n\nI tried to sleep. I had a TV appearance for Fox News, the sister company of my employers, booked early in the morning. When I woke up after three hours sleep, the news was so glorious that I barely needed a cup of tea to keep me awake. My cab driver to the studio was an immigrant from Pakistan; he told me he\u2019d voted Brexit. As the sun rose over the Thames, I was suffused with joy. There is no other word for it.\n\nSo I will lay my pro-Brexit bona fides against those of any person. They are rock solid.\n\nBut we need to delay Brexit \u2014 urgently. To say this is not to abandon principle or surrender to Remain. Before the end of this parliament, Britain should have left the EU. But we should do so on our own terms, and in our own time. Being pro-Brexit was about taking back control; not lifting our hands from the wheel because of an arbitrary date.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow is not the time for Britain to leave without a deal, when we would all prefer a deal \u2013 because some self-imposed clock has run out. That will not benefit Britain; it won\u2019t benefit the EU; the only person it would please is Vladimir Putin. Over the last two months, Russia has been demanding that we leave immediately. \u2018Theresa May must fulfil the will of the people,\u2019 Putin has insisted. Russian TV channel Ruptly pushed a Tommy Robinson-led march for \u2018immediate Brexit\u2019. \u201cStock up on popcorn,\u201d one Russian paper said; \u2018Theresa May\u2019s troubles won\u2019t make anyone sad in Moscow.\u2019 The BBC\u2019s Moscow correspondent noted their press welcoming the idea of an EU army: \u201cit\u2019s becoming clear Moscow sees it as a way of weakening NATO\u2019. That\u2019s right. Russia is openly cultivating its assets in the EU to weaken sanctions, and citing Brexit as a reason to do so.\n\nTheresa May, and our partners in Brussels, need more time to see if a technical solution to the Irish border backstop is feasible, as various EU mandarins have hinted. Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t; a delay in the leaving date, however, will allow the Treasury and other departments to implement and test procedures across government for leaving with or without a deal. We will be better prepared. It will allow the Prime Minister, and our allies in Europe, to negotiate without the arbitrary pressure of a random, unimportant date acting as emotional blackmail. It will let Britain negotiate deals outside the EU, whether we actually sign them now or later. It will mean small business has plenty of lead time and does not suffer an economic shock.\n\nWhile we keep the economy calm and carry on, a delay will also allow Parliament to require the UK intelligence community to produce a report on Russian influence in Brexit. There are far too many claims and counter-claims; US intelligence produced a report for President Obama on the 2016 election with classified and unclassified versions. While light on detail, the unclassified version at least told the public, officially, that Russia had interfered with the purpose of helping Donald Trump. UK citizens on both sides deserve a similar explanation from our security services. Whatever the conclusions, such a report would allow Parliament legislate protections against foreign interference in a future UK-wide vote, such as the next General Election.\n\nBritons are, by nature, pragmatists. We do not see ideology and facts as two opposing forces. Margaret Thatcher wanted to oppose what she saw as overarching trade union power, but she did not make a move immediately; she waited for years until she saw her moment. Churchill relied on correct weather conditions for Operation Dynamo, better known as Dunkirk; in the movie Zulu, surely close to every patriotic and conservative heart, Michael Caine (playing Lt. Gonville Bromhead, VC) shouts to his men \u2018Don\u2019t shoot until you see the whites of their eyes!\u201d\n\nThe tactical pause has never been a surrender. At this moment, a chaotic exit from the EU simply because of a deadline would be madness. Luciana Berger, a wonderful woman and MP, and six others, have left the Labour Party due to anti-Semitism; some Conservatives have left our party.\n\nFor Leavers, as well as for Remainers, this is bad timing. Theresa May, the grown-up in the room, should ask Brussels for a delay. As long as we leave the EU by the next election, I, and surely millions of Leave voters, will be content. If Brussels will not agree, we should simply revoke Article 50 and re-invoke it at the time of our own choosing.\n\nLast year, Russia attempted to kill Sergei and Julia Skripal, who were both under British protection. Putin\u2019s so-called \u2018soldiers\u2019 threw a perfume vial filled with Novichok into a charity bin, and killed Dawn Sturgess, a civilian, and a vulnerable British woman. Last week, trolls scaled Salisbury Cathedral and hung a Russian flag from it, and the Russian Embassy in London celebrated that act on social media.\n\nI am for Brexit. I was always for Brexit. I am still for Brexit. First and foremost I am for Britain, for her national security and her prosperity. We, as a nation, are not ready to leave the EU. We should do so in our own time and on our own terms, not those set in Moscow."

    "text": "Posted on February 24 2019\n\n\ufeffHappy Monday (eve)...go slay...\n\nSo my dear readers and now fomer twitter followers,\n\nI know it\u2019s been a hot minute. I am also very mindful that some of you might still be reeling by Twitter\u2019s (arguably capricious and arbitrary) decision to suspend my account. I want you to know that you are tougher than you know. That I have immense faith in your ability to see and do good. To lean in to the challenges facing our Democracy. And I\u2019m pretty sure you love America just as much as I do. And you know that the future of our Democracy is at risk.\n\nNotwithstanding I should probably come clean, I have always known that any twitter account I created or create is in fact living on borrowed time. In the past 25 months the same little gang of trolls just can\u2019t quit harassing Twitter users. The only logical conclusion is they are either being paid or they are just so insignifcunt (\ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffbSnort see what I did there) that they have nothing else better to do then tear random strangers down. Because that\u2019s being a true patriotic American...NYET.\n\nI am still not convinced that creating a new twitter account is the solution. If past is prologue, the likelihood that it puts another target on my back, not certain it\u2019s worth the effort. But you need to know I have lost count how many times the twitter trolls have fraudulently mass reported my accounts. Again I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s their pathetic end game, make sure I never use twitter again. I\u2019m still deliberating over if or when I create a new account, especially since it\u2019s linked to the PAC.\n\nAt this point I can share a few details, I spent today researching, fact finding and formulating a few viable plans in multiple venues...so there\u2019s that fun nugget. I also managed to do a few mundane things like laundry, pack my kiddos lunch and wash my baseboards. Yes I know baseboards, it\u2019s an Army Brat thing. But I do find I tend to decompress by cleaning. I could probably insert a raunchy joke here, but I\u2019ll refrain...knee pads...something something. In all seriousness those trolls kind of did me a favor, I needed to recalibrate. So taking my kiddos to see How To Train Your Dragon 3 and spending an ungodly amount of money on movie theater candy & video games. So I\u2019d like to extend my gratitude to my Twitter trolls, because of your fraudulent reporting of my account. you actually made today a super fun Spicy Family Day... Silver Lining, right?\n\nAlso it might take me a few weeks to see the plan come to fruition...in the absence of my daily prolific tweets and data dumps. Going forward I\u2019d like to help set your expectations:\n\nEach night at 9 or 10PM-ish daily blog of (sorry I\u2019m a little late with today\u2019s update):\n\n\ud83c\udf36WTF just Happened Today\ud83c\udf36\n\n\u201cWhite House to establish a panel to confront Climate Change\u201d\n\nPer WashPost, Senior Trump officials plan to establish an ad hoc panel of \u201cselect scientists\u201d the ad hoc designation means this group is not held to the same ethical and transparency standards as \u201cadvisory\u201d groups. What I find a tad bit interesting is this is a National Security Council initiative. Which oddly makes sense to me.\n\nWhat does NOT make sense to me is Trump once again surrounding himself with climate change deniers provided they are \u201csuper rich\u201d or hide their donations via a vessel like Climate Investigations Center (link here)\n\nPublic records show the coalition, which describes its mission as informing policymakers and the public of the \u201cimportant contribution made by carbon dioxide to our lives and the economy,\u201d has received money from far-right organizations and donors with fossil fuel interests. In 2017, according to federal tax filings obtained by the Climate Investigations Center, the group received $170,000 from the Mercer Family Foundation and more than $33,000 from the Charles Koch Institute.\n\nSee the ODNI January 29, 2019 National Threat Assessment Report, found here, specifically-ages 21-24\n\nCongressional Dems - Trump & North Korea:\n\nper Politico The Senate Democrats are effectively saying show us your diplomatic plan, your denuclearization plan, your foreign policy plan. You can not have a second summit and just wing it, again. Weird it\u2019s like Congress is demanding that the Trump Administration present a written report or offer some kind of actual transparency. It is so odd given how Sec Pompeio with a straight face lied to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper earlier today. I suppose that\u2019s a prerequisite to join the Trump Administration, one must be proficient with lying on National TV but if you can lie in Russia, that\u2019s an extra signing bonus.\n\nI\u2019m kidding, sort of.\n\nAs strong advocates for a diplomatic pathway to resolve the North Korea threat, we still believe there is a path forward for tough and principled diplomacy to secure, monitor, and verify the denuclearization of North Korea,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in a letter .\n\n.@SecPompeo contradicts @realDonaldTrump\u2019s tweet, tells @jaketapper he thinks North Korea is still a nuclear threat. https://t.co/9wqmWyD3oU \u2014 State of the Union (@CNNSotu) February 24, 2019\n\nAlso see pages 27-29 of the aforementioned ODNI January 29, 2019 National Threat Report See DNI Coat\u2019s Congressional Testimony from January 29, 2019 he laid out the facts and now Trump wants him gone.\n\nNorth Korea persistent threat, evading sanctions, zero evidence of denuclearization...\n\nNorth Korea generates revenue through overseas labor, cyber-theft operations, and illicit commercial exports of UN Security Council-prohibited goods. Throughout 2018, the United States and its allies observed North Korean maritime vessels using at-sea, ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum from third-country tankers to acquire additional refined petroleum as a way to mitigate the effects of UNSC sanctions.\n\nShould you be inclined this is an exhaustive research paper concerning North Korea and their nuclear capabilities, expansion, almost real time satellite images, in sum it\u2019s a complete repudiation of the Russian Propaganda that Trump & his administration continues to force feed Americans. Frankly I\u2019m sick of how Trump has normalized pathological lying. FFS we are talking about one of the most brutal and unpredictable regimes on the planet. Yet Trump wants to play grab-ass with Putin\u2019s play-toy because \u201cTrump believes Putin over our OWN Intelligence Community\u201d. I mean I guess it\u2019s hard for Putin to be simultaneously President of Two Countries.\n\nHell yes what I\u2019m actually saying is Donald Trump is so far up Putin\u2019s ass that if Putin farted Donald Trump would instantaneously have a facelift. Also why is Trump seemingly becoming Oranger by the day? Why does his skin look so damn blotchy that his pores are like actual sink holes on his fugly face? I mean has he not heard about the magical powers of Eastern European estheticians? I just find Trump to be repulsive. His voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard. His words, oh so many words, it\u2019s a like a two day old word salad drowning in Russian salad dressing. Served with a side of incompetence and compete with an extra helping of traitor-tots. I mean come on, have you ever looked at Trump, like really looked at him. Hard MoFo pass. Not enough booze, crushed up Ritalin. Apologies I digress\n\nMy goal is to give you a summary of the days events and what tomorrow might bring. This may include various Case/Filings etc. My goal is to provide you a short debrief of what occurred. Because let\u2019s be honest in the age of Trump the news is freaking exhausting. Furthermore at least 3 times a week I\u2019ll push a more in-depth entry on various topics I\u2019m researching.\n\n\ufeffMANIC MONDAY...strap in...\n\nAnd just remember these words from \u201cthe help\u201d\n\nYOU IS SMART\n\nYOU IS KIND\n\nYOU IS IMPORTANT\n\nNo matter what you need to believe in yourself and know that you have the strength to conquer anything that comes your way. If you stumble and fall, you need to take a depth breath and get back up. It\u2019s also wise to take a break. Unplug and spend some quality face to face time with people you care about. Self care is the best kind of preventative care. See ya on the flip side and trust me on this, do one random act of kindness tomorrow. It\u2019s good for your mind, body and soul xo Spicy"

    "text": "Metro\n\nWhere in the world does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez live?\n\nShe may be America\u2019s most famous freshman congresswoman, but in New York, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a virtual ghost.\n\nShe has no district office and no local phone number, unlike the state\u2019s three other freshman members.\n\nAnd it\u2019s unclear whether the 29-year-old lawmaker, who represents the Bronx and Queens, actually still lives in the Parkchester neighborhood that has been so closely tied to her rise \u2014 even though she won her upset victory over fellow Democrat Rep. Joe Crowley with accusations that his home in Virginia made him too Washington-focused to serve his district.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has used her deceased father\u2019s Bronx condo on her voter registration since 2012, and even posed in the one-bedroom Bronx flat for celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz in a Vogue magazine profile after her stunning November election. But The Post could find little indication she continues to live there.\n\nThe Post emailed Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman, Corbin Trent, four times with specific questions \u2014 which were all ignored. On Saturday, The Post reached Corbin by phone.\n\n\u201cWe will not be commenting,\u201d he said. Among the queries he refused to answer: Where does the congresswoman live?\n\nOn Saturday night, a staffer promised a Post reporter that Ocasio-Cortez would talk to him after a speaking event in Corona.\n\nDuring the event, two staffers were seen reading an early edition of this story on their phones.\n\n\u201cCome downstairs, I have to take a picture quick,\u201d the congresswoman then told the reporter after the event, instructing him to wait for her. Twenty minutes later, she ducked out a back door, jumped into a chauffeured SUV, and zoomed off.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was in New York City last weekend and this weekend, with appearances in Queens on both Saturdays \u2014 yet she was not seen coming or going from her Parkchester pad either day.\n\nHer apartment\u2019s next-door neighbor said she had never seen Ocasio-Cortez. Another neighbor, who has lived down the hall from the congresswoman\u2019s apartment for the last 40 years, said he\u2019d never seen her or her boyfriend, Riley Roberts, who has claimed the address as his own since last spring.\n\n\u201cI would have remembered,\u201d said the neighbor when shown a photograph of Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nWorkers at Jerry\u2019s Pizzeria, less than a block from her building, and at the local grocery store said she had never patronized their businesses \u2014 and a server at a nearby taqueria said the congresswoman had only come in to be filmed by news crews.\n\nA postal worker who delivers mail to the building said that in the last 10 years, he has only seen Ocasio-Cortez intermittently, and that several months\u2019 worth of mail regularly accumulates in the mailbox before anyone bothers to collect it. The worker said that Ocasio-Cortez and Roberts were the only ones getting mail at the address.\n\n\u201cJust because their names are on the box doesn\u2019t mean they live there,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd in 2017, when Ocasio-Cortez first filed paperwork to become a congressional candidate, she didn\u2019t even know what district she lived in, mistakenly declaring plans to run for neighboring District 15 before correcting the error days later.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, Ocasio-Cortez has rented a pad in a luxe building in the chic Navy Yard neighborhood, where studios start at $1,840 a month, according to the Washington Examiner.\n\nHer new digs feature gold-plated amenities like a rooftop infinity pool, a cycling studio with a dozen pricey Pelotons, men\u2019s and women\u2019s saunas, and a golf simulation lounge \u2014 but no affordable units for low-income residents, in spite of a local law that requires them, the news site reported.\n\nIn the eight months since Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s dramatic defeat of the long-serving Crowley in June\u2019s Democratic primary \u2014 a victory that all but guaranteed a general election win in the heavily Democratic District 14 \u2014 the congresswoman has failed to open a local office.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has made four trips to the city since she was inducted to Congress on Jan. 3, according to a Post review of published reports and social media. Those excursions featured five public events in her district \u2014 and three high-profile Manhattan appearances, including a Jan. 21 guest slot on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\nA district office \u201cmakes government immediately responsible and accountable to the citizens,\u201d said Jadan Horyn of Reclaim New York, a government watchdog group.\n\n\u201cConstituents need to know their representatives are working for them, and not for national prominence.\u201d\n\nThe space slated for Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s constituent office is in a new building in Jackson Heights.\n\nSuites in the building at 74-09 37th Ave. rent for about $40 per square foot. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office, on the third floor, is just under 5,000 square feet, which would bring the annual undiscounted rental price to $200,000 or nearly $17,000 a month.\n\nIn January, Ocasio-Cortez sought to blame the delay on a stubborn landlord at a different building where her predecessor Crowley maintained one of his two district offices.\n\n\u201cAlthough we attempted to take over our predecessor\u2019s lease, the landlord wanted to almost double rent\u201d from $7,800 to $15,000 per month, she tweeted Jan. 22 \u2014 without specifying which of Crowley\u2019s spaces she had hoped to inherit.\n\n\u201cThat spike would have meant less caseworkers for our community,\u201d she posted. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re making a new space with a family business!\u201d\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez neglected to mention that her rent would end up likely topping the cost of Crowley\u2019s former digs.\n\nWhen The Post visited last week, the congresswoman\u2019s office was still under construction, with workers building interior walls and installing drywall. A carpenter there said the work would probably take several more weeks to complete. A staffer said at a community board meeting that it would open March 4.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown if taxpayers or the landlord is paying for the extensive renovations.\n\nA spokesman for Cow Bay Contracting, the Nassau County construction company working on the office space, refused comment. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office refused to answer the question.\n\nIn the absence of a district office, and with no way to contact the rookie congresswoman, voters have resorted to desperate measures.\n\n\u201cConstituents come here and leave notes on the door,\u201d said the postal worker at her Parkchester apartment building last weekend. \u201cBut it\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Sydney Denmark\n\nRelated Video"

    "text": "Over 900 people in uniform from Estonia and allied countries took part in the parade dedicated to the 101st anniversary of the Republic of Estonia, held this year at Tallinn's Freedom Square.\n\nThe parade was led by Commander of the Estonian Defence Forces (EDF) Maj. Gen. Martin Herem and overseen by President Kersti Kaljulaid.\n\nAmong those represented in the parade were all branches of the EDF, the Estonian National Defence College (KV\u00dc\u00d5A), the Baltic Defence College, the Guard Battalion of the Military Police, the Headquarters Support and Signal Battalion of the Cyber Command, the 1st and Second Infantry Brigades, the Support Command, the Special Operations Command, the Tallinn District of the volunteer Estonian Defence League (Kaitseliit), and the Women's Voluntary Defence Organisation (Naiskodukaitse).\n\nOf Estonia's allies, Germany, Denmark, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and the United States all participated in the parade with colour guards of their own. Also present were British and Belgian units from NATO Battle Group Estonia as well as a unit from the United States Marines Corps (USMC).\n\nEquipment on display at the parade included the UK's Challenger tank, the AS-90 self-propelled howitzer, and the Piranha armoured vehicle of the Belgian Army. The planned military flyover was cancelled due to unsuitable weather conditions.\n\nMaj. Gen. Herem also delivered a speech at the parade, which ERR News has reproduced in full below.\n\n100 years ago, in the War of Independence\n\nHonourable President of the Republic,\n\nHonourable President of the Riigikogu,\n\nHonourable Prime Minister,\n\nYour Excellencies, Members of the Estonian Defence Forces and the Estonian Defence League,\n\nDear compatriots,\n\nOne hundred years ago, Pvt. Hugo Saalis fought among others for the independence of Estonia in the Estonian War of Independence. He described one of his battles to me as follows: \"We had given away most of our ammunition to the main front, where there was a shortage of it. However, at one point, we came face to face with the enemy... and threw stones at the buggers! Estonians maintained their positions that day.\"\n\nWith stones, if necessary \u2014 that is what fighting for our country was like then. Fighting for a country that had only existed in dreams thus far. In 1999, Hugo Saalis was happy with the Republic of Estonia, because our own state meant a great deal to him.\n\nToday, we are willing to do what Hugo Saalis and the rest did 100 years ago. Today, we no longer have to use stones, because our equipment has far exceeded it.\n\nAs our recent reservist training has shown, we are even more prepared than back in those days. Over 60% of those summoned participate in reservist training. Most of those who are absent, however, still know their obligations and inform the Estonian Defence Forces of their issues.\n\nThe countries whose reserve forces we have considered our role models for more than twenty years do not merely deem the participation rate of our reservist training satisfactory \u2014 they consider it good in terms of the degree and speed of citizen participation. As Commander of the Estonian Defence Forces, I can say that in terms of citizen preparedness \u2014 to take arms and defend their country \u2014 the Republic of Estonia is among the top of the world. However, I do not say this to highlight the great work of the servicemembers, but rather to emphasise the loyalty of our citizens. For instance, Igor Ahmedov \u2014 a crazy guy who travelled all the way from London when his country called.\n\nWe can dispute and sometimes even get into nasty fights about the development of our country on a daily basis. However, worldviews are set aside during reservist training, and people do not confront each other, but rather stand by one another in the name of their country. Perhaps the best example of this is the Estonian Defence League, which brings together dozens and even hundreds of Estonian citizens with different worldviews every weekend \u2014 as one force, in the defence of Estonia. The Estonian Defence League brought together over 9,000 such citizens last year during the training exercise Siil \u2014 people with different worldviews, and different nationalities, but all of them organised and working for the same cause.\n\nContributions from many\n\nI would like to thank all reservists and conscripts for their contribution! We also have to acknowledge the reservists' families and employers who have facilitated their participation in national defence \u2014 your contribution is essential and demonstrates the strength of our country. I will say this once more: thanks to you, we are prepared \u2014 on a global scale.\n\nI also invite all citizens of the Republic of Estonia to participate in national defence. Through conscription and reservist training. Or as a member of the Estonian Defence League, an assistant police officer, or a volunteer rescuer. Regardless of gender or physical abilities. I believe we can do even better. I believe that we are capable of utilising the free will of our citizens. In addition to the Song Festival, reservist training could be seen as something that unites us.\n\nHowever, we also have stronger alliances than the Republic of Estonia did at the time of the War of Independence. The allied troops stationed in Estonia today, a \u00c4mari, Tapa, and Tallinn, are not here just for show, and certainly not to frighten anyone; they are here for the military defence of the Republic of Estonia \u2014 should it ever be needed. The decisiveness and intentions of our allies have never been as clear as they are today.\n\nWe will witness another new development in making our region safer as early as this year. An international Division Headquarter is being established in \u0100da\u017ei, Latvia. Most of the staff will come from Latvia, Denmark and Estonia, but other countries will be contributing as well. This is a development that will bind the protection of Estonia and Latvia into one whole, making it part of the security of the entire Baltic Sea region.\n\nEstonia will also be holding three larger training events focussing on the practice of strengthening our Defence Forces.\n\nAnd we must never forget that our alliances are based on common values, which have been repeatedly confirmed at the cost of the lives of Estonian soldiers, as well as the lives of our allies.\n\nToday, here in Freedom Square, we can only see part of the troops that are ready to protect the freedom of Estonia, and our common values; the servicemembers who are standing under our flags, as well as the flags of our allies, only represent a small portion. A far greater force can watch from the sidelines today \u2014 and that force is you and your will, dear citizens of the Republic of Estonia.\n\nLong live the Republic of Estonia!"

Their denials have been debunked, Trump has contradicted his senior aides and sometimes his team has completely flipped its position.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election along with potential collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government. So far, six Trump associates have been charged, but nobody has been implicated in collusion. Trump adamantly denies collusion.\n\nPublic contradictions, walkbacks and flip-flops have become a hallmark of how Trump\u2019s team has responded to the Russia probe, which was launched in 2016 and is now in its third year.\n\nHere are the most consequential examples of Team Trump changing its story."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a virtual ghost.\n\nShe has no district office and no local phone number, unlike the state\u2019s three other freshman members.\n\nAnd it\u2019s unclear whether the 29-year-old lawmaker, who represents the Bronx and Queens, actually still lives in the Parkchester neighborhood that has been so closely tied to her rise \u2014 even though she won her upset victory over fellow Democrat Rep. Joe Crowley with accusations that his home in Virginia made him too Washington-focused to serve his district.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has used her deceased father\u2019s Bronx condo on her voter registration since 2012, and even posed in the one-bedroom Bronx flat for celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz in a Vogue magazine profile after her stunning November election. But The Post could find little indication she continues to live there.\n\nThe Post emailed Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman, Corbin Trent, four times with specific questions \u2014 which were all ignored. On Saturday, The Post reached Corbin by phone.\n\n\u201cWe will not be commenting,\u201d he said. Among the queries he refused to answer: Where does the congresswoman live?\n\nOn Saturday night, a staffer promised a Post reporter that Ocasio-Cortez would talk to him after a speaking event in Corona.\n\nDuring the event, two staffers were seen reading an early edition of this story on their phones.\n\n\u201cCome downstairs, I have to take a picture quick,\u201d the congresswoman then told the reporter after the event, instructing him to wait for her. Twenty minutes later, she ducked out a back door, jumped into a chauffeured SUV, and zoomed off.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was in New York City last weekend and this weekend, with appearances in Queens on both Saturdays \u2014 yet she was not seen coming or going from her Parkchester pad either day.\n\nHer apartment\u2019s next-door neighbor said she had never seen Ocasio-Cortez. Another neighbor, who has lived down the hall from the congresswoman\u2019s apartment for the last 40 years, said he\u2019d never seen her or her boyfriend, Riley Roberts, who has claimed the address as his own since last spring.\n\n\u201cI would have remembered,\u201d said the neighbor when shown a photograph of Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nWorkers at Jerry\u2019s Pizzeria, less than a block from her building, and at the local grocery store said she had never patronized their businesses \u2014 and a server at a nearby taqueria said the congresswoman had only come in to be filmed by news crews.\n\nA postal worker who delivers mail to the building said that in the last 10 years, he has only seen Ocasio-Cortez intermittently, and that several months\u2019 worth of mail regularly accumulates in the mailbox before anyone bothers to collect it. The worker said that Ocasio-Cortez and Roberts were the only ones getting mail at the address.\n\n\u201cJust because their names are on the box doesn\u2019t mean they live there,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd in 2017, when Ocasio-Cortez first filed paperwork to become a congressional candidate, she didn\u2019t even know what district she lived in, mistakenly declaring plans to run for neighboring District 15 before correcting the error days later.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, Ocasio-Cortez has rented a pad in a luxe building in the chic Navy Yard neighborhood, where studios start at $1,840 a month, according to the Washington Examiner.\n\nHer new digs feature gold-plated amenities like a rooftop infinity pool, a cycling studio with a dozen pricey Pelotons, men\u2019s and women\u2019s saunas, and a golf simulation lounge \u2014 but no affordable units for low-income residents, in spite of a local law that requires them, the news site reported.\n\nIn the eight months since Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s dramatic defeat of the long-serving Crowley in June\u2019s Democratic primary \u2014 a victory that all but guaranteed a general election win in the heavily Democratic District 14 \u2014 the congresswoman has failed to open a local office.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has made four trips to the city since she was inducted to Congress on Jan. 3, according to a Post review of published reports and social media. Those excursions featured five public events in her district \u2014 and three high-profile Manhattan appearances, including a Jan. 21 guest slot on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\nA district office \u201cmakes government immediately responsible and accountable to the citizens,\u201d said Jadan Horyn of Reclaim New York, a government watchdog group.\n\n\u201cConstituents need to know their representatives are working for them, and not for national prominence.\u201d\n\nThe space slated for Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s constituent office is in a new building in Jackson Heights.\n\nSuites in the building at 74-09 37th Ave. rent for about $40 per square foot. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office, on the third floor, is just under 5,000 square feet, which would bring the annual undiscounted rental price to $200,000 or nearly $17,000 a month.\n\nIn January, Ocasio-Cortez sought to blame the delay on a stubborn landlord at a different building where her predecessor Crowley maintained one of his two district offices.\n\n\u201cAlthough we attempted to take over our predecessor\u2019s lease, the landlord wanted to almost double rent\u201d from $7,800 to $15,000 per month, she tweeted Jan. 22 \u2014 without specifying which of Crowley\u2019s spaces she had hoped to inherit.\n\n\u201cThat spike would have meant less caseworkers for our community,\u201d she posted. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re making a new space with a family business!\u201d\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez neglected to mention that her rent would end up likely topping the cost of Crowley\u2019s former digs.\n\nWhen The Post visited last week, the congresswoman\u2019s office was still under construction, with workers building interior walls and installing drywall. A carpenter there said the work would probably take several more weeks to complete. A staffer said at a community board meeting that it would open March 4.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown if taxpayers or the landlord is paying for the extensive renovations.\n\nA spokesman for Cow Bay Contracting, the Nassau County construction company working on the office space, refused comment. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office refused to answer the question.\n\nIn the absence of a district office, and with no way to contact the rookie congresswoman, voters have resorted to desperate measures.\n\n\u201cConstituents come here and leave notes on the door,\u201d said the postal worker at her Parkchester apartment building last weekend. \u201cBut it\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Sydney Denmark\n\nRelated Video Video length 45 seconds :45 Ocasio-Cortez rips media for reporting on her new luxury high-rise Ocasio-Cortez rips media for reporting on her new luxury high-rise"

    "text": "The promise of a Green New Deal has become a galvanizing force in US politics, inspiring climate activists and building much-needed pressure behind a sweeping federal climate plan.\n\nBut the proposed environmental and economic policy package has contained a technical flaw from the start that\u2019s coming into sharper relief as interest groups seek to translate its high-minded ideals into nuts-and-bolts policies. Specifically, the early language sets the goal of meeting \u201c100% of national power demand through renewable sources,\u201d which in general usage excludes carbon-free sources like nuclear power and fossil-fuel plants equipped with systems to capture climate-affecting emissions.\n\nIn a letter to Congress last week, more than 600 environmental groups sought to define renewables even more narrowly, arguing that the ultimate proposal should also prohibit biomass and large-scale hydroelectric power. It adds that the groups\u2014including chapters of 350.org, the Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace USA\u2014will oppose any climate legislation that promotes market-based mechanisms like carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs.\n\nSign up for The Download Your daily dose of what's up in emerging technology\n\nThat suggests the entire nation should run on wind, solar, and maybe some geothermal electricity.\n\nIt\u2019s an absurd strategy for rapidly and affordably reaching the low-to-no-carbon energy system required to limit the threat of climate change. Everything we know from recent research indicates that nuclear, carbon capture, and hydropower are essential, and that carbon pricing could be among the most powerful tools for driving the transformation.\n\nThe group\u2019s letter cites the UN climate panel\u2019s latest report in calling for rapid and aggressive action to prevent 1.5 \u02daC of warming, but then it ignores the body\u2019s finding on how that can be done. The report, released in October, says most models that keep the world below that threshold depend on significant increases in nuclear power, hydroelectric, and fossil-fuel plants that capture emissions. And all of the analyses now require removing vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere this century, using biomass and carbon capture technologies.\n\nThe basic power sector problem is that if we exclude huge, steady sources of carbon-free electricity like nuclear, we'd have to build massive amounts of additional variable renewable generation and energy storage to bank enough electricity to keep the lights on during extended periods when the winds dip and sun dims. That substantially increases the costs and complexity of any energy overhaul.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t confront a crisis with a limited tool set,\u201d says Jesse Jenkins, a postdoctoral environmental fellow at Harvard, who has closely studied the costs and feasibility of varying approaches to decarbonization. \u201cYou throw everything you\u2019ve got at it.\u201d\n\nSuch an extremist take muddles the firm findings of science with fuzzier ideological rejections of non-natural things, and risks splitting loyalties on the left. Most of all, it loses sight of the stated goal: slashing carbon dioxide as much and as quickly as we possibly can.\n\nIt was conspicuous to some that several of the largest environmental groups didn\u2019t sign on to the letter, including the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Sierra Club. The New Republic reported that at least a few were specifically concerned about the restrictive language.\n\n\u201cAs long as organizations hold onto a rigid set of ideas about what the solution is, it\u2019s going to be hard to make progress,\u201d says David Hart, director of the Center for Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy at George Mason University. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what worries me.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also possible that a package as broad as the Green New Deal, which also includes a federal jobs guarantee, is hopelessly doomed in any scenario. Some argue that eliminating carbon emissions is going to be hard enough without entangling it amid a hodgepodge of other economic and environmental grievances.\n\nSuch a sweeping approach could narrow the coalition that ultimately supports it while \u201cplaying right into the hands of the strongest criticisms of environmentalism: that it\u2019s actually a vehicle for other social and economic goals,\u201d says Jesse Reynolds, an environmental law and policy fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nBut others believe the bold, broad, ambitious vision is precisely the strength of the Green New Deal, explaining why it so quickly became a rallying point after US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took it up as a congresswoman-elect late last year.\n\n\u201cCap-and-trade and cap-and-dividend don\u2019t really seem to inspire activism or excitement,\u201d says Leah Stokes, an assistant professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \u201cThe Green New Deal is redefining the problem in a way that makes it more accessible to the public, and helps them to get behind it and support it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s exactly zero chance the current Senate or the person occupying the White House would approve such an ambitious policy package. But its advocates hope it could frame the climate debate through the 2020 elections and stir citizens to push for the broader political shifts that could be required for real progress on energy and climate issues.\n\nSome had hoped we could defer the debate over the controversial technical and economic details that risk deflating these passions. But last week\u2019s letter shows that\u2019s not going to work."

    "text": "Posted on February 23 2019\n\n\ufeffDear Paul...it\u2019s far too late..\n\nAs many of you know the pundits, the court watchers, the news junkies thought we would have access to the Government\u2019s sentencing memo on Friday February 22, 2019 based on the previous Court order. So we sat and waited and refreshed our computer screens. I may or may not have cursed, a lot.\n\nGiven the counterproductive twitter drama that occurred yesterday, unfortunately I was a bit distracted. But I did refresh PACER browser and shortly after 11:45PM last night, I pretty much accepted that the highly anticipated sentencing memo would be delayed. This was affirmed by a Minute Order that was uploaded to the docket shortly after 10AM. I naturally assumed that we the public would see the Government\u2019s sentencing memo on Monday February 25, 2019. And then just like that the Judicial gods sent a gift. In doing so this offered me a much needed respite. Accordingly shortly after 2PM today, my phone alerted that there was a new filing on Manafort\u2019s DC docket. And then I took a moment, chugged a Red Bull put my glasses on and proceeded to cracking my knuckles.\n\nAbsent an active twitter account you should know that there will likely be a delay in getting information to you. I am sorry for that inconvenience but as the saying goes: \u201cit is what it is\u201d. You can thank the bitter troll group for fraudulently mass reporting my account, yet again. With any hope the substance of future blog entries will outweigh the delay.\n\n\ufeff\n\nManafort - decades long crime spree\n\nThe Government filed a redacted sentencing memo to the public docket, found here. In the absence of a viable twitter account, I am going to do my best to drill down on the 25 page filing.\n\nOne thing you should probably know is; a defendant\u2019s prior actions are a mitigating factor. Meaning a Judge can use those factors in consideration of sentencing. If a cooperating witness has fulfilled their \u201cend of\u201d the plea deal the Government will file a 5K1 motion. This informs the Court concerning the substantialness of a defendant\u2019s cooperation. This typically includes a downward spiral (less points). Sentencing can be tricky to understand. One pretty simple way I can explain sentencing guidelines; each offense is assigned a \u201cpoint\u201d and cumulatively the more points you have the greater your \u201cjudgement\u201d will be. Which is why most cooperating witness fully and forthrightly cooperate because the prosecutors use the 5K1 as leverage.\n\n\ud83c\udf36SpicyFiles Sidebar\ud83c\udf36\n\nShortly before Michael Cohen\u2019s \u201cjudgement\u201d (ps that\u2019s what occurs when a defendant is sentenced) I walked you through the only viable option I saw for him. It\u2019s known as Rule 35 (b). What you need to know is this is strikingly similar to the 5K1 motion & letter but with one huge distinction. Yes I know it\u2019s confusing. Rule 35(b) motion occurs post sentencing & judgement. Meaning Cohen really messed up, he didn\u2019t fully cooperate with the SDNY. My assumption is Cohen made a terrible miscalculation. He assumed that the Special Counsel\u2019s Office had more juice than the SDNY. As such Cohen faced a iron hammer of justice when the SDNY filed their sentencing memo, conversely the SCO was \u201cyes he assisted\u201d.\n\nAs a reminder in the middle of last week (I think on Tuesday or Wednesday) the Judge granted Cohen\u2019s request to delay his surrender date by 60 days. At the time Cohen was previously scheduled to voluntarily surrender to prison on March 6, 2019. Shortly after Cohen filed his motion, the Judge Ordered the surrender date of May 6, 2016. At which point the various chairs of Congressional committees \u201cre-announced\u201d hearing dates for Cohen. Shortly thereafter Cohen was spotted in DC, entering/exiting various Congressional Offices. My understanding based on open source reporting is, Cohen spent both Thursday & Friday behind closed doors with various Congressional staffers, for several hours. If you have ever had the great or unfortunate opportunity to prepared a witness for trial, arbitration or deposition, understand that this endeavor is not a \u201cwe are going to prep you over lunch\u201d. The fallacy that attorneys and/or support staff do not spend a significant time prepping their clients is an absolute canard. From personal experience much of the preparation is predicated on the complexity of the case, settlement or Congressional investigations.\n\nPreparing a witness is easily 6-18+ hours of preparation for every two hours of actual testimony. It\u2019s grueling, both physically and emotionally. As it should be. The main goal is to have the client fully prepared for tough questions and potential curve ball questions, as well as badgering questions. In a weird and cathartic way this actually desensitize the client to aggressive questions. Next week\u2019s Congressional hearings should be view as a \u201cmock trial\u201d...specifically in the House of Representatives.\n\nFor an easier analogy, perhaps thinking about Cohen\u2019s hearing(s) - the context below, will better assist you on how the hearing should go and what to expect.\n\nHouse Democrat = Prosecutor\n\nHouse Republicans = Trump\u2019s Attorneys\n\nCohen = \u201ccooperating witness\u201d \ufeff\n\nCross, Cross Examination & redirect\n\nAgain next week\u2019s congressional hearings are not an actual courtroom. However a decent arguement can be made that the hearings are in \u201cthe Court of Public Opinion\u201d. Now that the Democrats control the House, expect a substantive hearing. This is underscored by the House Oversight memo from last week. When this memo landed in my inbox, I\u2019ll admit it was straight up catnip. Lest we forget the \u201cofficial\u201d hearing memo, page 2 is exquisite. Coupled with Trump\u2019s public relations fubar that will be the (not) peace summit 2.0 where Trump once again proves to the global community he has no idea what actual bilat or trilat diplomacy really is.\n\nYou do the Crime. You do the time\n\nNow moving on to the Government\u2019s Sentencing Memo regarding Manafort\u2019s DDC Case. One page 1 the following recitation should be read for what it\u2019s intent. This sets forth a pretty damning predicate, that any leniency (remember prior acts) the Judge might consider is wholly without merit. The relevant facts as argued by the Government in both substance and meticulously detailed, highlight actions of Manafort\u2019s egregious decades long flouting of our laws. This should be a sobering reminder that this is WHO Donald Trump selected to be his campaign chairman. Based on previous court filings Manafort was in contact with the Trump Campaign, the Trump transition and the Trump administration. Also you may have forgotten but Rick Gates was in the Trump universe far longer than Manafort. Further most overlook the fact Tom Barrack hired Gates but terminated his employment shortly after the October 2017 indictment.\n\nManafort presents many aggravating sentencing factors and no warranted mitigating factor... Manafort committed an array of felonies for over a decade, up through the fall of 2018. Manafort chose repeatedly and knowingly to violate the law\u2014 whether the laws proscribed garden-variety crimes such as; tax fraud money laundering obstruction of justice and bank fraud, or more esoteric laws that he nevertheless was intimately familiar with, such as the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). His criminal actions were bold, some of which were committed while under a spotlight due to his work as the campaign chairman and, later, while he was on bail from this Court. emphasis added\n\nEven though Manafort entered in to a plea agreement and subsequently \u201ccooperated\u201d with the government. The September 14, 2018 Statement of Facts, leaves very little ambiguity. You can find on then Justice Department\u2019s Special Counsel\u2019s page, found here\n\nThe facts show that Manafort (while in custody) committed a litany of serious crimes. Witness tampering (as the Government correctly argues) under cuts the very core of our Judicial System. Manafort and Kilimnik conspired to change witness testimony. Which should be viewed for what it was: \u201can overt attempt to evade justice\u201d. What I found particularly interesting, the SCO drew back the curtains just a bit and for the first time we have actually affirmation that part of the SCO\u2019s is in fact related to our Country\u2019s National Security. But we also learn the long list of investigatory entities Manafort lies to. Not the least of which the Grand Jury, Members of Congress and to his own attorneys. The inclusion of \u201cpresents a grave risk of recidivism\u201d is the government essentially arguing, Manafort committed crimes while in custody and his likelihood to commit additional crimes should he be released is exponentially high.\n\nSee page 2 which reads in part:\n\n\u201c...component of the crimes of conviction and relevant conduct, extended to tax preparers, bookkeepers, banks, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice National Security Division, the FBI, the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, the grand jury, his own legal counsel, Members of Congress, and members of the executive branch of the United States government. In sum, upon release from jail, Manafort presents a grave risk of recidivism.\n\nAs some of you might recall in the early Spring of 2018, Manafort opted to waive venue, At the time I noted that I was certain this was a defense strategy. By forcing the Government into TWO judicial venues, my assumption was Manafort thought the \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d strategy was a gamble worth taking. I think we can all agree that Manafort failed to factor in was the totality of his actions to waive venue. In the EDVA case a jury of Manafort\u2019s peers found him guilty on numerous counts. Granted the Jury was ultimately hung on several counts, it doesn\u2019t negate the Jury\u2019s verdict. Case in point see page 3, as this directly impacts the plausibility and probably that the DC Judge will and can factor in Manafort\u2019s prior acts.\n\nAlso I would assume that some in the media will spin the Trump propaganda/disinformation that this has nothing to do with Trump and.or Russia. Understand that is NOT the case, the reason is Manafort\u2019s work in the Ukraine is tied to Russia. Furthermore Manafort committed some crimes while he was working for the Trump Campaign.\n\nManafort\u2019s two venue strategy essentially blew up, and pages 4-6 aggregate how much of a gamble Manafort took. Meaning now Manafort is a convicted Felon (EDVA), he committed additional crimes after his October 2017 Indictment. Which later resulted in multiple superseding indictments and ultimately in June of 2018 the DDC Judge remanded Manafort. Yet again even while in custody facing multiple superseding indictments, Manafort and Kilimnik committed additional crimes.\n\nThe scope of Manafort\u2019s decades long crime spree is stunning and vulgar. We are talking about a man who spent more than a decade committing crimes that ranged from Money Laundering, Loan & Wire Fraud. Lies about his lies. The Government aptly labels Manafort as a hardened criminal. I submit to you that Manafort isn\u2019t just a criminal, he\u2019s a mobbed up thug who acted in manner and means that he was above the law. It never made any sense to me why Manafort would act in such a deleterious manner beyond he already had assurances from Donald Trump that there would be a pardon(s) for Manafort provided he kept his mouth shut. The vvast majority of the Government\u2019s 25 page Filing is a recitation of the crimes.\n\nTo fully understand the conniving and sinister conduct by Manafort, the Special Counsel\u2019s Office highlights Manafort\u2019s conduct, specifically demonizing a Senior State Department official during the Obama Administration and then using that smear as leverage when he lobbied members of Congress. That\u2019s some mind bending Caligula nonsense. And granted one could argue but that\u2019s what lobbyists and law firms do all the time. I can personally tell you that is not the truth but Manafort was a creature of the Beltway and the DC Thunderdome full contact sport. The distinction here is Manafort\u2019s actions were premeditated and he was driven by greed. Meaning money talks and ethics walks.\n\nDC & CT Bar bye bye Paul\n\nWhat some may not have factored in is Paul J Manafort is or more precisely was (past tense) admitted into the DC and CT Bar. As of January 20, 2019 the DC Bar \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d by the DC Bar.\n\nManafort\u2019s DC Court of Appeals Bar was suspended is on an interim basis. As an officer of the Court upon the conviction of a serious crime in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Which should trigger (although it\u2019s not automatic) the \u201cBoard on Professional Responsibility\u201d to determine a factual funding that Manafort\u2019s crimes rise to the level of:\n\nthe crime[s] involve moral turpitude per se, it will recommend disbarment.\n\nIf you are curious, my assumption is, the following provisions of D.C. App. R. XI, section 10 are applicable:\n\nSECTION 10 (b) \u201c Serious Crime \u201d\u201d\n\n\u201cserious crime\" shall include (1) any felony, and (2) any other crime a necessary element of which, as determined by the statutory or common law definition of such crime, involves improper conduct as an attorney, interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, willful failure to file income tax returns, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft, or an attempt or a conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit a \"serious crime.\"\n\nYou can read the DC Bar status here, also fun fact I didn\u2019t know Kathleen Manafort was admitted in to the DC Bar Rule XI. Disciplinary Proceedings, here. Also fun fact let\u2019s say that Trump does pardon Manafort, the DC Bar can disbarr him based on the underlying facts of the case.\n\nOn January 19, 2019 the State of Connecticut Bar update Manafort\u2019s \u201cstanding\u201d. Concluding that Manafort notified the CT Bar that he has forfeited his Bar number. You can run a search in the CT Bar Database found here.\n\nHHD-CV-18-6103963-S: The Respondent [Manafort] resigned and waived the right to apply for readmission to the bar at any time in the future. The Respondent does not have clients within the state and does not maintain an IOLTA account, therefore a trustee will not be appointed.\n\nFor the record, the warning signs as it relates to Manafort have ALWAYS been there. His reputation in and around the Beltway have been known for many many years. The fact is Manafort built his reputation as a \u201chired gun\u201d until he was essentially black listed by the Beltway and K street. To which Manafort found employment overseas.\n\nAgain I can tell you in the early Spring of 2016 the Beltway was a flutter with: \u201cTrump hired who now...\u201d because I distinctly remember the whispers and exasperation at various social events. A perfect example of why Donald Trump\u2019s decision to listen to his long time friend Tom Barrack who not only advocated for but aggressively championed the hiring Manafort as a \u201csynergistic win-win...look you don\u2019t have to pay him...but you need his muscle to keep the RNC delegates in line\u201d. This July 26, 2016 CBS This Morning interview was the first \u201cred lights\u201d blinking moment\n\nOne issue that might get overlooked in the Government\u2019s DDC sentencing memo, they are specifically asking the Court to sentence Manafort \u201cconsecutively\u201d versus concurrently. That means the Government is petitioning the DDC Judge to issue a judgement to a term of imprisonment on top of what the EDVA Judgement. It is also worth noting the Government filed multiple exhibits with their sentencing memo, this link will take you to Exhibits A-F essentially Manafort\u2019s various indictments, EDVA trial exhibits, EDVA Jury verdicts and Manafort\u2019s Plea Deal along with other various court filings. Bottom line is the Government is (rightfully so) arguing that Manafort\u2019s decade long crime spree must be met with the proper and just judgement. Not to belabor the point, yes many of the crimes committed pre-dated his role as Donald Trump\u2019s Campaign Chairman but equally important Manafort committed crimes while he was Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, specifically loan fraud and tax evasion. Then of course like most criminals do, Manafort went on to commit a litany of other crimes after his indictments and remand.\n\nPardon me? No pardon me?\n\nDuring the February 8, 2019 House Judiciary hearing, then Attorney General Whitaker\u2019s Testimony was fiery and frankly rude on a multitude of occasions. The Congressional Testimony a lot of people overlooked the following exchanges (damn you twitter) so it seems worthwhile to remind you what Whitaker said about Pardons, potential Pardons and whether or not a sitting president could be indicted. Ultimately this will most likely land at the Supreme Court. As you know some on Twitter pivot to but the OLC memos. The fact is nothing our Constitution or CFRs or USC state a sitting president can NOT be indicted.\n\nRep Escobar\n\nhis exchange with Rep Swawell\n\nand then this crushing exchange with Rep Lieu.\n\nIt\u2019s all there in the public record. And if you do not think that Donald Trump who\u2019s continued in act in a lawless manner, what part of Donald Trump is a mobbed up thug is lost on you. The reality is Trump is literally running a criminal enterprise from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Trump and his legal team have repeatedly telegraphed to Manafort et al, that they just need to keep their mouths shut and they will be rewarded with a pardon. I argue that you are not paying attention. You can take this to the bank, if Manafort is arrrogant and stupid enough to accept a pardon then neither one of them have thought this through. Keep in mind that Donald Trump is a transactional criminal mobsters. He has rarely been held accountable for his decades of fraud, scams, money laundering and other untoward actions.\n\nWhereas Manafort\u2019s former business partner, Rick Gates kept up his end of his \u201cplea deal\u201d (found here) and continues to fully and forthrightly cooperate with the Government thus allowing him the semi-limited freedom to travel, provided he seeks permission from the Court, as evident in today\u2019s motion for permission to travel..\n\nAnd lastly, I am still waiting on the indictments of: Steve Calk, Tom Barrack, Jared Kushner, Donald Jr, Melanie (or Melania) Ivanka, Eric, Keith Davidson, Vin Weber, Tomy Fabrizio, etc..."

    "text": "I\u2019m for Brexit. As a Young Conservative in Wadhurst, I wanted to leave the EU. When John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, I saw it as a betrayal of such massive consequence I briefly joined the Labour party \u2013 and was later forced to confess this indiscretion to Tory associations up and down the country. As a student at Oxford, I joined the Campaign for an Independent Britain, and formed lasting friendships with like-minded undergraduates for whom sovereignty was the first principle of patriotism and politics; everything else depended on being able to govern our own affairs. I am one of those Conservatives who, like the grass roots, cannot understand why so many MPs are so wedded to the idea of the EU. It is everything the Conservative rank and file oppose in three-quarters of Conservative associations up and down the country. There was a hideously awkward moment in 2008 when, as a candidate in a \u2018workshop\u2019 (don\u2019t ask), I listened to Jane Ellison, selected for Battersea, give an answer on the EU that seemed far too soft. \u2018Oooh no,\u2019 I said helpfully, \u2018no don\u2019t say it like that \u2013 you\u2019ll sound like Ken Clarke.\u2019 Her expression was icy. At the next tea break, an organizer pulled me aside. \u2018She was Ken Clarke\u2019s Chief of Staff,\u2019 he said.\n\nI campaigned fervently for Brexit on social media. I wrote my first New York Times op-ed in favor of Brexit, telling Americans Leavers were no racists. The night before the vote, I appeared on Channel Four\u2019s debate with Jeremy Paxman, debating Yvette Cooper. It was a ratings success. Yet when I left (in a cab with Toby Young and Julia Hartley-Brewer) I was pessimistic; polls said we\u2019d lose.\n\nWe didn\u2019t lose. Even as gloating Remainers wrote us off I was on the phone to my friend Dan Hannan. \u2018It\u2019s not over yet,\u2019 he said as I sat in a hotel in my pajamas. \u2018There\u2019s something good going on in Sunderland\u2026Our people at the count think it\u2019s looking good\u2026\u2019\n\nI tried to sleep. I had a TV appearance for Fox News, the sister company of my employers, booked early in the morning. When I woke up after three hours sleep, the news was so glorious that I barely needed a cup of tea to keep me awake. My cab driver to the studio was an immigrant from Pakistan; he told me he\u2019d voted for Brexit. As the sun rose over the Thames, I was suffused with joy. There is no other word for it.\n\nSo I will lay my pro-Brexit bona fides against those of any person. They are rock solid.\n\nBut we need to delay Brexit \u2013 urgently. To say this is not to abandon principle or surrender to Remain. Before the end of this parliament, Britain should have left the EU. But we should do so on our own terms, and in our own time. Being pro-Brexit was about taking back control; not lifting our hands from the wheel because of an arbitrary date.\n\nNow is not the time for Britain to leave without a deal, when we would all prefer a deal \u2013 because some self-imposed clock has run out. That will not benefit Britain; it won\u2019t benefit the EU; the only person it would please is Vladimir Putin. Over the last two months, Russia has been demanding that we leave immediately. \u2018Theresa May must fulfill the will of the people,\u2019 Putin has insisted. Russian TV channel Ruptly pushed a Tommy Robinson-led march for \u2018immediate Brexit\u2019. \u2018Stock up on popcorn,\u2019 one Russian paper said; \u2018Theresa May\u2019s troubles won\u2019t make anyone sad in Moscow.\u2019 The BBC\u2019s Moscow correspondent noted their press welcoming the idea of an EU army: \u2018it\u2019s becoming clear Moscow sees it as a way of weakening NATO\u2019. That\u2019s right. Russia is openly cultivating its assets in the EU to weaken sanctions, and citing Brexit as a reason to do so.\n\nTheresa May, and our partners in Brussels, need more time to see if a technical solution to the Irish border backstop is feasible, as various EU mandarins have hinted. Maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t; a delay in the leaving date, however, will allow the Treasury and other departments to implement and test procedures across government for leaving with or without a deal. We will be better prepared. It will allow the Prime Minister, and our allies in Europe, to negotiate without the arbitrary pressure of a random, unimportant date acting as emotional blackmail. It will let Britain negotiate deals outside the EU, whether we actually sign them now or later. It will mean small business has plenty of lead time and does not suffer an economic shock.\n\nWhile we keep the economy calm and carry on, a delay will also allow Parliament to require the UK intelligence community to produce a report on Russian influence in Brexit. There are far too many claims and counter-claims; US intelligence produced a report for President Obama on the 2016 election with classified and unclassified versions. While light on detail, the unclassified version at least told the public, officially, that Russia had interfered with the purpose of helping Donald Trump. UK citizens on both sides deserve a similar explanation from our security services. Whatever the conclusions, such a report would allow Parliament legislate protections against foreign interference in a future UK-wide vote, such as the next General Election.\n\nBritons are, by nature, pragmatists. We do not see ideology and facts as two opposing forces. Margaret Thatcher wanted to oppose what she saw as overarching trade union power, but she did not make a move immediately; she waited for years until she saw her moment. Churchill relied on correct weather conditions for Operation Dynamo, better known as Dunkirk; in the movie Zulu, surely close to every patriotic and conservative heart, Michael Caine (playing Lt. Gonville Bromhead, VC) shouts to his men \u2018Don\u2019t shoot until you see the whites of their eyes!\u2019\n\nThe tactical pause has never been a surrender. At this moment, a chaotic exit from the EU simply because of a deadline would be madness. Luciana Berger, a wonderful woman and MP, and six others, have left the Labour party due to anti-Semitism; some Conservatives have quit our party too.\n\nFor Leavers, as well as for Remainers, this is bad timing. Theresa May, the grown-up in the room, should ask Brussels for a delay. As long as we leave the EU by the next election, I, and surely millions of Leave voters, will be content. If Brussels will not agree, we should simply revoke Article 50 and re-invoke it at the time of our own choosing.\n\nLast year, Russia attempted to kill Sergei and Julia Skripal, who were both under British protection. Putin\u2019s so-called \u2018soldiers\u2019 threw a perfume vial filled with Novichok into a charity bin, and killed Dawn Sturgess, a civilian, and a vulnerable British woman. Last week, trolls scaled Salisbury Cathedral and hung a Russian flag from it, and the Russian Embassy in London celebrated that aft on social media.\n\nI am for Brexit. I was always for Brexit. I am still for Brexit. First and foremost I am for Britain, for her national security and her prosperity. We, as a nation, are not ready to leave the EU. We should do so in our own time and on our own terms, not those set in Moscow."

That is where the cabinet\u2019s energy should be focused.\u201d\n\nMrs May\u2019s spokeswoman said the PM would be engaged in further talks in Brexit at an EU-League of Arab States summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. It will include a meeting with European Council president Donald Tusk.\n\nCable addresses Scots conference\n\nLiberal Democrat Leader Vince Cable will today announce that he will seek cross-party support for an amendment in the House of Commons calling for a People\u2019s Vote.\n\nSir Vince, pictured, who will address his party\u2019s Scottish Spring conference, echoed sentiments expressed by deputy leader Jo Swinson and Scottis leader Willie Rennie that the Independent Group of MPs will be invited to work with his party.\n\n\u201cFor months, I have been speaking with many of these now independent MPs,\u201d Sir Vince will say.\u201d We have much in common. For the good of our country, we will cooperate on areas of shared values, not least stopping Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s chaotic and damaging Brexit.\n\n\u201cThat is why I can announce Liberal Democrats will once again this week seek to secure cross-party support for an amendment in the House of Commons calling for a People\u2019s Vote, with the option to stay in the EU.\n\n\u201cWe cannot let Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn conspire to run down the clock. Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a People\u2019s Vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.\u201d\n\nWillie Rennie said he was \u201cfull of admiration\u201d for MPs who had already quit the two parties in recent days.\n\nBut he said some in Scotland were still to decide whether to do the same.\n\nIn his speech to the Scottish Lib Dem conference, he warned them that \u201cto miss this chance today will fill you with regret tomorrow\u201d.\n\nMs Swinson urged closer ties with the newly-formed Independent Group of rebel MPs, saying her party was \u201cexcited by this change\u201d and calling for them to fight together on shared values.\n\nBrexit spending soars past \u00a3100m\n\nThe UK government has spent \u00a3104m on Brexit consultancy fees Brexit, according to analysis by Tussell.\n\nAmong the firms supplyling the government with advice are Boston Consulting Group, PWC and Deloitte.\n\nSix companies each received a contract worth \u00a310m for \u201cCabinet Office Consultancy Support for EU Exit\u201d, according to the Crown Commercial Service.\n\nThe US-based Boston Consulting Group has received five contracts, worth \u00a314.2m, to work with the Cabinet Office, Departments for Environment, Exiting the European Union and Business.\n\nDave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the professional association for civil servants, said: \u201cThe eye watering figure of over \u00a3100m being spent on consultants will come as no surprise to civil servants who have been asked to prepare for Brexit following almost a decade of austerity that has seen the civil service shrink by almost a quarter.\u201d\n\nSee also:"

A fringe conservative minority is holding Congress hostage, extracting radical policy concessions over the will of the majority. And it\u2019s leading the nation to fiscal, environmental and moral ruin.\n\nMaybe you haven\u2019t heard this part: These dangerous conservatives are Democrats.\n\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\n\u201cI am talking about the radical conservatives in the Democratic Party,\u201d said Saikat Chakrabarti. \u201cThat\u2019s who we need to counter. It\u2019s the same across any number of issues\u2014pay-as-you-go, free college, \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d These are all enormously popular in the party, but they don\u2019t pass because of the radical conservatives who are holding the party hostage.\u201d\n\nNot long ago, this would have been an outlier position even among American liberals. Today, it\u2019s the organizing principle of a newly empowered segment of the Democratic Party, one with a foothold in the new Congress.\n\nChakrabarti is chief of staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the closest thing to a new celebrity Congress has had in years\u2014a 29-year-old former activist and bartender who, on the most recent Martin Luther King Day, sat on the same New York stage as the rapper Common, Black Panther director Ryan Coogler and MacArthur \u201cgenius award\u201d winner Ta-Nehisi Coates.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s Ocasio-Cortez who gets all the headlines, she arguably wouldn\u2019t be in Congress in the first place without the group Chakrabarti founded: Justice Democrats, a new, central player in the ongoing war for the soul of the Democratic Party. It was the Justice Democrats who recruited her in a quixotic campaign early on, providing a neophyte candidate with enough infrastructure to take down a party leader. And it is the Justice Democrats who see Ocasio-Cortez as just the opening act in an astonishingly ambitious plan to do nothing less than re-imagine liberal politics in America\u2014and do it by whatever means necessary.\n\nIf that requires knocking out well-known elected officials and replacing them with more radical newcomers, so be it. And if it ends up ripping apart the Democratic Party in the process\u2014well, that might be the idea.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be a war within the party.

But they also find themselves with real anxieties about their left flank for the first time in memory. Justice Democrats is one of a handful of groups that represent a new and restive spirit in the party, a Tea Party-like populist coalition of voters awakened by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 cannonball run in 2016 and united by their superprogressive politics and a millennial disdain for the establishment.\n\nNot all of their efforts have been successful\u2014of the slate of 2018 candidates Justice Democrats recruited, only Ocasio-Cortez won\u2014but they\u2019ve been undeniably disruptive, and unafraid to go after people on their own side of the aisle. Nervous members of the Democratic establishment and leadership are watching, asking: Could they hurt the party as it tries to leverage its first majority in years and defeat Trump in 2020? And do they even care?\n\n\n\n***\n\nFour years ago, Ocasio-Cortez was waitressing at a Union Square taqueria, Donald Trump was the host of a fading reality-TV franchise, and Chakrabati was a digital entrepreneur who had nothing at all to do with politics. He was living in the San Francisco Bay Area and working for a digital payment processing company when he suddenly, unexpectedly found himself electrified by a 73-year-old presidential candidate named Bernie Sanders. \u201cI liked what he was saying. He seemed like he was one of the people,\u201d Chakrabarti says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that he was a progressive, but that he really cared about building a movement around these ideas.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\nHe reached out to Claire Sandberg, the digital organizing director of the Sanders campaign, who was arranging \u201cBernstorms\u201d around the country, getting previously apolitical activists together to host phone banking and door-knocking parties.\n\nEventually, it became clear that Bernie wasn\u2019t going to win. But it felt clear to Chakrabati that the political revolution Sanders had stoked was close to coming to fruition. He began meeting with a small group of his fellow Sandersistas to figure out how to channel that energy in the next election.\n\nLike Chakrabarti, they were entirely from outside government, and mostly outside politics altogether. Corbin Trent was a political neophyte who\u2019d been volunteering for Sanders in Knoxville, Tennessee; when the food truck he owned burned down, he left Knoxville and joined the campaign in Vermont. Alexandra Rojas was a student in community college in Orange County, Calif., when Sanders announced his run \u2014 \u201cIt was the first time I got excited about politics,\u201d she said \u2014 and started volunteering on campus.\n\nToday, she\u2019s the executive director of Justice Democrats, and Trent, the group\u2019s co-founder and former communications director, is Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman. The group\u2019s current communications director and perhaps fiercest firebrand is Shahid, the only member in its leadership who had any experience in politics before the Sanders campaign.\n\nAs the 2016 primary got underway, Shahid was working at an immigrants rights legal aid group in Philadelphia; people would come in\u2014asylum seekers, undocumented immigrants\u2014and Shahid recalls telling them, day after day, to just keep watching CNN because Obama was bound to pass something clarifying their status sooner or later. \u201cIt was the most demoralizing, uninspiring time of my life,\u201d he said.\n\nDisappointed with Obama, Shahid got a job with the Working Families Party, which was all-in for Sanders, and after the election began trying to figure out how to make big systemic changes in politics, or \u201ccultureshifts\u201d\u2014not just winning arguments, but changing the terms of the whole debate.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that you bring moral questions to the public\u2019s attention, and have the public rally around it,\u201d he says. \u201cReframe the issue so that the choices are stark, and let the public decide rather than people in power.\u201d He points to how the \u201c99 percent\u201d became a buzzword after Occupy Wall Street; how Obama and Hillary Clinton eventually came to oppose the Keystone Pipeline after supporting it; how \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d quickly went from a fringy Twitter slogan to one embraced by mainstream Democrats. Either you favor ripping kids from their homes, or you don\u2019t. And if you don\u2019t, suddenly the policy choices aren\u2019t incremental: They\u2019re rather stark.\n\nThe group started meeting up even before the 2016 primary was over, and its members began looking ahead to the 2018 midterms\u2014figuring that any Democratic president would need a very different Congress to get anything done. Along with Cenk Uygur, the progressive activist and founder of the liberal media company The Young Turks, they started a group called Brand New Congress.\n\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\nThe original idea was thrilling in its ambition, if absurdly unworkable: They would create a slate to replace Congress entirely, recruiting 435 people across both parties to run for the House, while BNC would serve as the back office for all of them, handling mail, digital, and press.\n\nChakrabarti, Uygur and others saw the effort begin to founder under its own weight. And in the wake of Trump\u2019s shocking win, the notion of a nonpartisan effort to replace every member of Congress with some nonpolitical person didn\u2019t seem as important as creating the sharpest possible counterweight on the left. And so after the election, Chakrabarti, Trent, Rojas, Uygur and others split off to found Justice Democrats.\n\nThis time, the goal was far more modest: Push the Democratic party closer to Sanders\u2019 politics by challenging centrist Democrats in their primaries. The idea was to recruit 12 working-class candidates to confront incumbents, muster some of that Sanders-style populist energy on a local level and push incumbents to the left. If a couple of breaks went their way, they might even score an upset or two.\n\n\u201cAfter the election, was I mad at Donald Trump? I guess, kinda,\u201d said Uygur, who ended up leaving the group when a series of previously deleted misogynistic blog posts were unearthed. \u201cBut mainly I was mad at the Democratic Party for blowing it. How could you lose to this guy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to realize Democrats are never going to learn,\u201d he said, \u201cand that the only way to make a difference is to defeat the corrupt corporate Democrats. They get paid to lose. The corporate donor pays them to be weak, and pays Republicans to be strong.\u201d\n\nThe group didn\u2019t have many litmus tests for candidates they were willing to support, but they drew a few red lines. One was a ban on all corporate PAC money, something that soon became standard fare for 2018 candidates. On policy, if you weren\u2019t for Medicare for all, \u201cit usually meant you weren\u2019t our type of candidate,\u201d said Uygur.\n\nEven now, Justice Democrats is a shoestring operation. It has no headquarters, no major benefactors and raised less than $3 million in the 2018 cycle, mostly small dollar donations from people not used to much political giving. But it built a 300,000 strong email list by engaging with young activists on the ground and online.\n\nA typical \u201cbig donor\u201d to the group is Arden Buck, an 84-year-old retired research engineer in Colorado who gave $10,000 after receiving a windfall insurance payout. I found him through public fundraising records; when I asked him how he found about Justice Democrats, he said he saw them mentioned on MSNBC and that he was driven by concern about greenhouse gases and wanted to give money to groups that could use it the most. \u201cI am focused on climate change. If we don\u2019t take care of the environment, social justice is beside the point,\u201d he told me.\n\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\nFor all its passion, the group might have been just another voice in the political wilderness if it hadn\u2019t been for the success of Ocasio-Cortez. She had come to the founders\u2019 attention in 2016 when her brother, Gabriel, who had heard about Brand New Congress, nominated her to be one of its candidates. Chakrabarti was still with BNC, and he told Business Insider earlier this month that the group didn\u2019t really see her district as a likely target: It was occupied by Joe Crowley, the powerful 10-term incumbent from Queens, and seemed unwinnable. But after a few phone calls and a meeting, he had a different thought: \u201cHoly Crap. You are an incredible candidate.\u201d\n\nAs her race heated up, and it became clear that this 28-year-old was actually gaining ground on one of the most powerful Democrats in the House, Shahid encouraged the entire leadership of Justice Democrats to momentarily abandon their other efforts and go all in on running her campaign.\n\nThe challenge of running a young, underfunded working-class candidate became apparent early on. When Shahid joined Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign, she was still working four nights a week as a bartender in Manhattan. He would set up meetings with community leaders only to have Ocasio-Cortez say that she couldn\u2019t do them because they interfered with her work schedule.\n\n\u201cI would get so frustrated with her. \u2018You can\u2019t do this full-time bartending thing and run for Congress!\u2019 And she would say, \u2018What do you want me to do? I have to work.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey thought they were going to get 30 percent of the vote. Ocasio-Cortez would text Shahid excitedly whenever there was a report that Crowley had moved a little to the left\u2014embracing Medicare for all, for example. That was proof, as they saw it, that their mission was advancing. Shahid says he felt more than a twinge of regret for leading people on.\n\n\u201cWe would go to these fundraisers in the Bronx, and there would be ex-cops in the room and they would have tears in their eyes. It was a double thing for me. I had just come off the Bernie campaign and here AOC was, she was so fucking inspiring and so charismatic that grown men are crying and I would think to myself, \u2018We just have no chance here. Everyone is going to be so disappointed!\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nAt one level, Justice Democrats\u2019 strategy failed. Their original goal was to recruit 12 candidates, provide them with media, field and fundraising help as needed, and try to pick off a few vulnerable seats. Of those candidates, 11 lost.\n\nBut they also notched a success beyond anything they\u2019d planned for. Ocasio-Cortez took on one of the most powerful congressional Democrat not named Nancy Pelosi, and by a decisive margin, she unseated him\u2014shaking the party\u2019s power structure and getting nationwide attention for a democratic socialist newcomer who embodied nearly everything that thrilled young movement voters. Several other candidates they\u2019d endorsed, but weren\u2019t as closely involved with, also won, including Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar.\n\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\nThe Crowley defeat brought to mind Dave Brat\u2019s surprise 2014 victory in Virginia, taking out Republican majority leader Eric Cantor by primarying him from the right. Shahid looks back at the power of what a single race can do, recalling the Politico headline that ran at the time: \u201cEric Cantor Loss Kills Immigration Reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just one fucking race,\u201d he said. \u201cOne fucking race and suddenly immigration reform was dead.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders race had established the existence of a populist Democratic base eager to vote against its own party\u2019s establishment. Now there was an organization willing to lead the charge. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which started a decade ago as a liberal alternative to what it saw as its stodgy counterparts in Washington. \u201cEverybody is so concerned about clout and about relationships, and they have no relationships, so they just go for it, taking big chances.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Ocasio-Cortez, and for that matter Pressley, Tlaib and Omar don\u2019t hail from the traditional background in a body in which the median wealth is over $1 million is very much part of the point. As Ocasio-Cortez faces criticism for her bank account, her wardrobe and her supposed lack of knowledge of the details of policy, the strategy from Justice Democrats and her team has been to face it head on.\n\n\u201cOur theory is that when a working-class person wins, when a person without a political background wins, there is going to be a backlash\u2014you don\u2019t have experience, you don\u2019t know anything, you are dumb,\u201d said Shahid. \u201cAll of this happened with Ocasio.\u201d\n\nThis, as he sees it, is the culture shift, a way of turning the lens around to reveal the now stark choices. \u201cThat is an awesome story for people to see, because the way the D.C. media and the conservative media in particular tear into AOC around being a working-class person or a person of color or a Puerto Rican, I don\u2019t think the public likes it very much,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public sees a Cinderella story, a bartender who goes against the machine and wins. And you see the way she is dragged by the D.C. establishment and the media, we lean into it, as if to say, \u2018If that\u2019s what they think about her, what do you think they think about you?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Congress, fellow Democrats don\u2019t know quite what to make of AOC or the Justice Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s bark may not be as serious as her bite; although she livestreamed a sit-in of Pelosi\u2019s office, she also voted for her for Speaker and has been supportive of her fellow Democrats. It\u2019s not lost on her colleagues, however, that the group that helped vault her into place\u2014and who have two founders leading her office\u2014is the sworn enemy of the establishment she needs to work with.\n\n\u201cIn person, she is lovely and is trying to get along with her colleagues,\u201d said the House Democrat. \u201cBut she is going to have to navigate the fact it was the Justice Democrats who brought her to prominence, and their currency is going to be continue to shake up what they call the establishment and run primaries against people.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\nDavid Hopkins, a professor of political science at Boston College, says systematically targeting fellow Democrats really crosses a line in American politics. \u201cI mean, even the Freedom Caucus doesn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sort of know how stuff happens in Congress. It requires a lot of negotiation and compromise. Starting a bunch of internal fights within your party is not usually step one.\u201d\n\nSome people in Congress closely aligned with the group have publicly distanced themselves from any effort to cast a wide net of insurgent challenges. Ro Khanna, a second-term congressman from Silicon Valley who himself defeated an eight-term Democrat in a primary in 2016, sent Justice Democrats a direct message on Twitter to join the cause soon after they formed. The group considers him, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, to have been their closest allies in the last Congress; Khanna was the only sitting member of Congress to endorse Ocasio-Cortez. But today he said the party needs for all of its component parts to keep their eyes on the real prize. \u201cOur primary focus has to be stop Donald Trump, to defeat the Republicans, particularly in the Senate. That is the single most effective thing we can do to advance progressive politics,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cI have been encouraging our party to save our fire for Republicans rather than on intraparty disputes.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez herself has sent mixed messages on this score. According to a report in POLITICO, New Jersey Representative Frank Pallone, a moderate Democrat, fought with Ocasio-Cortez on her idea for a select committee on a Green New Deal in a closed-door meeting of Democrats in November. Rather than embrace the narrative of being a firebrand, Ocasio-Cortez, who hadn\u2019t yet been sworn in, denied the story was true. A few weeks later, POLITICO also reported that Ocasio-Cortez and allies were eyeing a primary challenge to Hakeem Jeffries, a young Brooklyn lawmaker who angered progressives in part for taking Joe Crowley\u2019s position in the leadership over the more liberal Barbara Lee in California. Ocasio-Cortez took issue with the story on Twitter, without denying it, lamenting that the article was \u201cprinted + distributed to **Congressional offices**\u201d and only later, when pressed by one of her followers, saying it wasn\u2019t accurate.\n\nJeffries\u2019 camp noted, pointedly, that the story didn\u2019t include an on-the-record denial from Ocasio-Cortez herself. They also told me she hadn\u2019t reached out to Jeffries herself to deny it. Jeffries himself was quoted citing the lyrics of Notorious B.I.G: \u201cSpread love, it\u2019s the Brooklyn way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat quote was sending a message,\u201d said one Jeffries supporter in New York. \u201cI am from Brooklyn. Don\u2019t fuck with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nFor now, it is still unclear where Justice Democrats will fit in among the various groups that emerged in big numbers out of the 2016 election, including Democratic Socialists of America, Indivisible, Brand New Congress, Swing Left and the Sunrise Movement, just to name a few. Justice Democrats made a bet that a single giant felled would rewrite the political landscape, and so far they have been proven right.\n\nThe Green New Deal, a joint production of Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement, has 45 co-sponsors and is embraced by several Democrats running for president. Justice Democrats helped galvanize support, getting 150 people to sit in at Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office just after the midterms.\n\nShahid, the group\u2019s spokesman, predicted that, besides further agitation on the Green New Deal, the group would attempt to push for free college and an end to mass incarceration. And to force some support, they won\u2019t be afraid to threaten primary challenges against anyone unwilling to sign on.\n\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\n\u201cWe already are a pariah in Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s about attention. Either it helps you gain leverage because people are scared of you or you lose leverage because people are annoyed with you. We will see.\u201d\n\nSo far, the results of this aggressive outside game are mixed, at best. Despite the group\u2019s success attracting support for the Green New Deal, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denied calls for a select committee on the idea. And 45 co-sponsors is a long way from the 218 needed to actually pass something.\n\n\u201cYou are not going to make 218 people in one session of Congress afraid,\u201d said Hopkins. \u201cHow much leverage does Ocasio-Cortez have? If she can wave her hand and endanger the reelection prospects of even pretty liberal members, then that is one thing. They may not like it, but they will be forced to get in line. But does she have that kind of power? If you take a shot and miss, you are very much likely going to be worse off than even if you didn\u2019t take a shot at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI view these outside groups like this skeptically. Are they trying to build a movement or start a riot?\u201d said Colin Strother, a Texas operative and an adviser to Representative Henry Cuellar, one of Justice Democrats\u2019 top targets in 2020. \u201cI never heard anything about Justice Democrats until a few weeks ago. Are the people running it political professionals? Groups like them, they come along for a cycle or two, they disappear and something else crops up in their place. Democrats do best when we keep our disagreements around the kitchen table instead of in the front yard where everybody can see.\u201d\n\nBuck, the Colorado donor, says he is thrilled with Ocasio-Cortez\u2014\u201cShe is fabulous\u201d\u2014but wary of what Justice Democrats want to do next. \u201cIt is little tricky. People without experience can shake things up, but I worry that they will be sitting ducks for the Republicans.\u201d\n\nAs they move into the next election cycle, their hope is that Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley, Tlaib and Omar form more of a unit, one in which they share staff, best practices and strategy, and care less about personal brand-building. Justice Democrats plans to provide cover with its 350,000-person email list and active social media feeds.\n\nLimited resources mean that playing in the presidential primary will be difficult, but the energized new left has already seen some of what were once considered its most outr\u00e9 ideas\u2014the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, Abolish ICE and free college\u2014become a central part of several likely presidential campaign platforms. Next cycle, members of the group plan to target from five to 10 House Democrats who occupy safe blue seats. Some names of the targets have already been floated out, like Henry Cuellar, but Sean McElwee, a liberal activist and co-founder of Data for Progress, where he works closely with Justice Democrats, listed a handful more who are vulnerable to a Crowley-sized challenge, including Kathleen Rice of Long Island, Jim Cooper of Nashville and Dutch Ruppersberger of Baltimore. (Shahid, asked if they were targets, declined to list any names.)\n\nStrother, the Texas operative, said people from outside Cuellar\u2019s South Texas district\u2014a place where guns and gas drilling are a way of life and an economic driver\u2014don\u2019t understand the absolutism. How, he asked, could a party that prides itself on being welcoming now try to kick apostates out of the tent?\n\nStory Continued Below This browser does not support the Ad element.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party went through a lot of these same fights after they won in 2010, and they were not well-served by them,\u201d he said, \u201cand the Democrats should learn that lesson.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiversity is one of the values of our party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have Muslims in our party, we have Buddhists in our party, we have Baptists in our party, we have everything under the sun in our party. We say you can worship what you want, you can love what you want and you can be what you want. Then how is it that we are going to tell people you can\u2019t think what you want?\u201d"

    "text": "This Robert Kraft story is not funny, because it\u2019s not really about Robert Kraft. It\u2019s about human trafficking and modern-day slavery, an international travesty that most of us tend to ignore because we can.\n\nPolice in Florida have charged Kraft, the Patriots owner, with two counts of soliciting prostitution at a strip-mall massage parlor in Jupiter, one of a number of men caught as a result of a six-month investigation into prostitution and human trafficking at massage parlors in several Florida counties. According to Treasure Coast Newspapers, police say \u201cwomen, many of them from China, lived inside [the parlor] and were not permitted to leave.\u201d\n\nSo, yeah: Save the eighth-grade jokes and the schadenfreude for the next time the Patriots lose in the playoffs. This is not about an old man getting a thrill. It\u2019s about the systematic and intentional destruction of lives for profit.\n\nAnd Robert Kraft allegedly played a role in that. The question for Kraft, and for the NFL: What role, exactly?\n\nA spokesperson for Kraft issued a statement saying \u201cwe categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.\u201d\n\nAstute readers will note that the statement did not deny that Kraft participated in a sex act in a massage parlor. It only denied \u201cillegal activity.\u201d This gives Kraft enough wiggle room that, if he has indeed been caught on camera engaging in sex with a massage-parlor worker, he can \u2026 um \u2026 argue it was consensual, I guess.\n\nThere are a couple possibilities:\n\n1. This was the greatest misunderstanding in the history of misunderstandings. It is hard to fathom a scenario in which a billionaire is allegedly caught on camera multiple times at a strip-mall massage parlor where prostitution is believed to have taken place, and he actually did nothing wrong. Why else would he even be there? Billionaires can afford masseuses who do home visits. But hey, Americans are innocent until proven guilty, except on Twitter. Kraft has a right to defend himself.\n\n2. Kraft is a horny old man who likes a thrill, and this was one way he got it. This seems more logical, but let\u2019s see where the story goes and what we learn.\n\nStill, if Kraft paid these women for sex, it\u2019s not just gross. It leads to more questions. Did he really think those women were working there voluntarily? Did he tell himself this was a victimless crime? Did he not know or care enough to ask himself whether these women were essentially sex slaves?\n\nAnd do you believe him?\n\nOnce the shock of getting arrested wears off, Kraft and an expensive legal team will try to accomplish a few simple objectives. First, he needs to find a way to end his legal case before it gets to trial, and without going to jail. He was charged with misdemeanor solicitation, so this seems like a distinct possibility.\n\nThen Kraft will probably accept his inevitable suspension from the NFL while still trying to convince the public that, while he made a mistake, it does not define him. This will likely include a statement about not being \u201cperfect\u201d and apologizing to \u201canybody who was disappointed\u201d and \u201cworking hard to earn back your trust.\u201d He will say whatever he has to say, and pay a sizable fine or make a big donation, as long as the NFL lets him keep the Patriots.\n\nThen Kraft will try to go back to being \u201cMr. Kraft\u201d again. And that\u2019s the problem here, when you get down to it. Most human-rights organizations say that tens of millions of people around the world are currently enslaved, and many of those are forced to be sex workers. They can\u2019t go back.\n\nAnd so if Kraft is indeed guilty of soliciting sex acts from slaves, he has a choice. He can publicly say how mortified he is that he participated, in any way, in something so vile, and he can put his money, time and status into addressing the epidemic. Or he can refuse to ever talk about it again. It just depends on whether he thinks this story is about human trafficking, or about Robert Kraft.\n\nQuestion or comment?

    "text": "ROME \u2014 Italy is the \u201ccenter of the political universe,\u201d according to former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nSpeaking to POLITICO during a tour of European capitals, the former aide to Donald Trump called Italy's League-5Star coalition government an \u201cexperiment that, if it works, will change global politics.\u201d\n\nBannon is in Europe to help ramp up a Brussels-based foundation, named the Movement, which aims to coordinate and advise right-wing populist parties campaigning in next spring\u2019s European Parliament election. Thus far, many of the Continent's far-right politicians have reacted cautiously to Bannon's advances.\n\nThe former Trump aide said that the Italian government is an experiment in uniting left and right. \u201cA populist party with nationalist tendencies like the 5Stars, and a nationalist party with populist tendencies like the League \u2026 it\u2019s imperative that this works because this shows a model for industrial democracies from the U.S. to Asia.\u201d\n\nThe Movement \u2014 which Bannon describes as a \"loose association\" of people, not a political party \u2014 was established in January of last year by Mischa\u00ebl Modrikamen, a Brussels lawyer and leader of a small right-wing party. Bannon began promoting it in July.\n\nBannon has praise for both sides of Italy's coalition government.\n\nThe League\u2019s Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s interior minister, has already joined, and during his trip to Rome Bannon also reached out to 5Stars leader Luigi Di Maio. According to two individuals with knowledge of the talks \u2014 one a person who has worked with Bannon and another a 5Star MP \u2014 Bannon and Di Maio met on Saturday and had a \u201cconstructive dialogue.\u201d The 5Stars are yet to decide whether they will endorse the project or not though.\n\nOn the face of it, the far-right base of the Movement (Bannon is also in talks with Germany\u2019s far-right AfD, Marine Le Pen's National Rally in France and Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Christian nationalist Fidesz party in Hungary) is far removed from the 5Stars' left-wing populism. Some of the party's MPs are worried it would alienate their voting base.\n\nNevertheless, Bannon has praise for both sides of Italy's coalition government. \u201cThroughout the entire world, you will not find two politicians that worked as hard as Salvini and Di Maio, for no money, leading their parties to these unbelievable victories and then stepped back and let someone else be the guy that goes to the G7, G20 and sits in the Oval Office with Trump \u2026 Nobody would do that,\u201d said Bannon, referring to the fact that the country's prime minister is Giuseppe Conte, a former law professor.\n\nFollowing Italy's general election in March, neither party would agree during negotiations about forming the coalition to the other's leader heading the government. Conte emerged as a compromise candidate.\n\nThe American political strategist said that he hoped the Italian model of bringing together populists on the left and right could be replicated both in the U.S. and the U.K. \u201cYou are going to have to compromise \u2026 On one side you have the guaranteed income, on the other the flat tax, both sides will get what they want and you\u2019ll move on from there,\u201d he said, referencing major domestic priorities of the 5Stars and League parties.\n\nBut he added that there could be \u201cno compromise on core values like migration and national sovereignty for the League and crony capitalism and transparency for the 5Stars.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Bannon spoke at Atreju, the far-right Brothers of Italy annual conference where he was greeted by a cheering crowd. \"Trump and Brexit and [the Italian general election in] March 2018 are all inextricably linked,\" Bannon told the audience, \"it\u2019s a rejection of the way things are and it\u2019s a way forward \u2026 it\u2019s the little guy saying 'we have a better idea' ... and the first thing is a rejection of what the elites have foisted on Western civilization.\u201d\n\nBannon went on to say Salvini and the Brothers of Italy, led by Giorgia Meloni, are the \"true disruptors,\" like Trump and former U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage before them. \u201cWhat Farage and UKIP were able to do in the U.K.; what Donald Trump and the Tea Party have started to execute in the U.S \u2026 The torch was passed to you.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Bannon will fly to Prague and Budapest where he is scheduled to meet far-right leaders including Orb\u00e1n.\n\nRead this next: Six siblings of Arizona congressman urge voters to boot him from office"

When Jason Chaffetz illegally revealed the letter James Comey had sent to the heads of the House and Senate intelligence committees, removing the \u2018classified\u2019 markings from the portion he tweeted out to the world, Gowdy wrote:\n\nFiat justitia ruat caelum \u2013 May Justice be Done though the Heavens fall.\n\nIt is in that noble spirit that Patribotics presents this report.\n\nTrey Gowdy\u2019s main donors are connected directly to Cambridge Analytica, the data company that targeted the US election, washing their Facebook and Twitter targeting with the stolen DNC Vertica database and with state voter rolls that were hacked. They also appear to be connected to direct funding of Democratic voter suppression and to the Kelhios botnet, which I have reported was both sent from command and control servers operating from Trump hotels, and was paid for by Boris Epshteyn on behalf of both Russia and Trump.\n\nPatribotics is very grateful for the support of our readers, which makes this effort possible. If you can help us please donate. There are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nMr. Gowdy\u2019s funding also connects the Russian hack and the RICO case on the GOP as a body neatly together.\n\nGowdy\u2019s main donors for the last two years include Great America PAC, which paid for \u201conline voter contact\u201d to various organizations. These include Media Bridge LLC, World Net Daily and Campaign Solutions:\n\nMedia Bridge LLC is, per its website, run by Shane Cory. He also takes responsibility for \u2018Renew America PAC\u2019 on Twitter. It hosts Liberty News Now dot com, which has in the past been hosted on what is a known \u201cCommand and Control\u201d malware server.\n\nRenew America PAC is ultimately run by the former Republican Senator Alfonse D\u2019Amato, who defended Russian hacking of the election and attacked the intelligence community in an article in December:\n\nDo not be fooled! This is nothing more than a cheap ploy by a couple of bad apples in the CIA and the intelligence community to manipulate what is being reported to the American public\u2026.. It\u2019s about time that someone stood up and criticized the intelligence community for the negligence and disrespect it showed to our elected officials and the American public.\n\nMr. Backer\u2019s firm, according to the UK\u2019s Telegraph, specializes in taking foreign contributions and hiding them:\n\n\u2026key supporters were prepared to accept illicit donations from foreign backers. Senior figures involved with the Great America PAC, one of the leading \u201cindependent\u201d groups organising television advertisements and grassroots support for the Republican nominee, sought to channel $2 million from a Chinese donor into the campaign to elect the billionaire despite laws prohibiting donations from foreigners.\n\nGreat America PAC also spent on Campaign Solutions and on WorldNetDaily for \u201cOnline Voter Contact\u201d.\n\nWorld Net Daily is a fake news pusher. The FBI investigated, on Election Day, for links to Russia, accounts and individuals pushing fake news about the election.\n\nCampaign Solutions worked with Cambridge Analytica when placing targeted ads on behalf of John Bolton; these are Robert Mercer supported entities. Cambridge Analytica is under FBI investigation and the SVB server, which sent its targeting to the Trump Server, was, we report, the subject of a FISA warrant obtained by James Comey on Oct 15, 2016. According to Ad Age, Campaign Solutions began working with this major target of Mueller\u2019s inquiry as far back as 2014:\n\nthe PAC and Campaign Solutions first worked with Cambridge Analytica during the 2014 midterms\n\nFurthermore, Trey Gowdy did not merely get a donation from a group that spent on Campaign Solutions. His main contributor, per the FEC, is from his \u201cE Donation 5 Account\u201d. The image of the form shows their mailing address, 117 North St. Asaph St, is the same as that of Campaign Solutions.\n\nThus, we can say that Trey Gowdy is directly receiving donations from PACs working with the Russian hackers of the US election. Whether Media Bridge LLC \u2013 the apparent boss Mr. Cory follows Roger Stone, Russia\u2019s RT.com and Wikileaks on Twitter, and at the time of writing he only follows 153 accounts \u2013\n\nis connected to \u201cMedia Bridge United\u201d and \u201cEU Mediabridge\u201d, both registered at the identical P.O. Box as Hostkey, the Russian Wikileaks hosts, remains to be seen, but doubtless Mr. Mueller will have questions. IP registered to these domains pumped out fake news videos laden with malware.\n\nRead more of our exclusive Trump Russia journalism here:"

[2015-05-01 14:01:26] <noll> yes, both Wired & Verge contained DDB\u2019s line of attack. how anyone could fall for OL says it all. expect submissions portal will face \u2013 [2015-05-01 14:02:37] <noll> \u2013 cyber attacks. must be one of, if not the most scrutinized area of cyberspace atm. [2015-05-01 14:03:55] <WikiLeaks> Greenberg is a partisan. Fraudulent to quote the narrative of such people without mentioning the OpenLeaks vaporware plot. [2015-05-01 14:29:48] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/594197325729378304 the OL \u2018quote\u2019 manages to contradict itself w/i three lines. which seems indicative of DDB.

[2015-05-01 15:31:17] <noll> good night Jen :o) [2015-05-01 15:51:46] <WikiLeaks> Someone tells us that DarkHorse doesn\u2019t play with others, so perhaps not her. [2015-05-01 15:56:59] <noll> understood, will drop it. [2015-05-01 16:23:54] <Matt Watt> Hey, have shared the nextgen link. Assume this group is for distro of important links? [2015-05-01 16:27:57] <WikiLeaks> Yes and advance notice of hostile twitter PR. [2015-05-01 16:30:03] <Matt Watt> Ok sounds good. [2015-05-01 16:49:45] <WikiLeaks> @SAWCSydney is also good [2015-05-01 16:55:05] <noll> not sure we can add b/c they don\u2019t follow us. can someone else? [DMConversationEntry] M added SAWC Sydney [2015-05-01 17:02:47] <Matt Watt> Sawcsydney is mainly automated tweets from their facebook page now, as is wikileaksparty. I will give Ian headsup re sawcsydney [2015-05-01 17:11:03] <noll> http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-dea-is-coming-under-congressional-scrutiny-for-buying-hacking-toolshttps://www.wikileaks.org/the-spyfiles.html [2015-05-01 17:38:50] <noll> re \u201cmore publications \u2013 free trade deals\u201d, TPP already feature of Sanders/ Clinton race, would be great to nudge campaigns into citing Wls. [2015-05-01 17:44:56] <WikiLeaks> We\u2019re doing well with TPP in US. [2015-05-01 17:45:12] <noll> also, great article by Kellie Tranter: http://kellietranter.com/2015/04/futility-regret/ [2015-05-01 17:48:57] <noll> yes. & looks like becoming major campaign issue w/ Clinton forced to follow Sanders lead \u201cto neutralize him\u201d: http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2015/5/1/pt_2_ralph_nader_on_bernie [2015-05-01 17:50:25] <WikiLeaks> We don\u2019t like tranter\u2019s article, much. Poor rhetoric and all Assange traffic in the cables was moved to intel channels are a result of\u2026 [2015-05-01 17:50:43] <WikiLeaks> \u2026Dorlings constant FOIAs. [2015-05-01 17:51:24] <WikiLeaks> It\u2019s meant well, but she gives the enemies points, which there is no need to do, high up, then burries ours. [2015-05-01 17:52:38] <WikiLeaks> e.g no need to faff about with grand jury to and fro. The US admits it, as of this year. End of argument. [2015-05-01 17:53:44] <WikiLeaks> No need to go into muddying speculations about absense of evidence in Australian FOIAd cables. US admits it and recently. [2015-05-01 17:54:36] <WikiLeaks> This \u2018detailitis\u2019 is a nasty disease that affects quite a few of our supporters and prevents them using the strongest point, straight up. [2015-05-01 17:59:01] <noll> haha we thought \u2018in case they leaked\u2019. agree re Grand Jury, we love detail, but yep, it\u2019s good to have the latest & strongest to hand, \u2013 [2015-05-01 18:01:16] <noll> \u2013 speaking of which, last third of article implies Wls ended w/ Manning, rather than coming full circle, as seen today. [2015-05-01 18:21:13] <noll> IoC\u2019s Mapping Media Freedom including \u201ccases of trolling & online abuse against journalists\u201d: https://www.indexoncensorship.org/europes-journalists-face-growing-climate-of-fear/ [2015-05-01 18:32:26] <WikiLeaks> Yes. Committee to Project Journalsts (CPJ), which is HQ\u2019d in NY, engages in detailing such horrors in Ecuador as cab drivers abusing\u2026 [2015-05-01 18:33:03] <WikiLeaks> \u2026journalists for being inaccurate sleaze bags thanks to Correa naming and shaming their articles. [2015-05-01 18:34:39] <noll> sleaze bags \u2013 turn on Fox News & watch the \u2018Mike\u2019 interview. [2015-05-01 18:36:28] <noll> think it\u2019s reaching the end. on that basis CPJ should investigate Correspondents Dinner. [2015-05-01 19:31:24] <noll> if this is end of cryptography, it\u2019s getting closer: http://phys.org/news/2015-04-scientists-critical-quantum.html [2015-05-02 05:52:25] <noll> Adri\u00e1n Lamo posting random \u201cthis is not\u201d legal advice for JA: https://www.quora.com/Is-the-House-Arrest-of-Wikileaks-founder-Julian-Assange-as-an-Unjust-Act/answer/Adri%C3%A1n-Lamo [2015-05-02 06:03:26] <Emmy B> Yes saw it, thank you! not sure I\u2019d like to engage with that horrid individual in twitter. [2015-05-02 06:04:33] <Emmy B> Going to Brighton tomorrow, will watch that comedy, see what it is all about, sent tweets to artist and asked permission to distribute [2015-05-02 06:05:22] <Emmy B> supportive flyers, he was most encouraging, let\u2019s see\u2026 I hope it will be a positive show \ud83d\ude42 [2015-05-02 06:16:53] <noll> some clips of his work. looks good & yep, likely to be positive. [2015-05-02 06:21:28] <Emmy B> *excited* [2015-05-02 06:54:04] <Emmy B> Reading above \u2018detailitis\u2019 LOL making up words \ud83d\ude00 [2015-05-02 07:00:05] <noll> Em, still traces of yahoo group where it was invented: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:RZ9AF65-Ea8J:https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/CriticalChain/conversations/topics/5538+&cd=15&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk [2015-05-02 07:06:32] <Emmy B> hahaha \ud83d\ude42 [2015-05-02 07:07:14] <Emmy B> (let me not start on fwlf !!!) [2015-05-02 08:16:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh good grief, that WLF tweet is patently absurd. How can anyone take then seriously? I guess I constantly underestimate people\u2019s stupidity. [2015-05-02 08:16:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> Them [2015-05-02 08:17:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> Enjoy the play, Emmy [2015-05-02 08:19:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> Re Lamo, is anyone still talking or listening to that <bleep>? [2015-05-02 08:20:36] <LibertarianLibrarian> Re the accusations about journalists in Ecuador, common attack, learned to ignore it. Correa is adored by his people & for good reason. [2015-05-02 08:21:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> His division of media into private, public, state is very interesting. One thing I really like is that media corps can\u2019t buy other business. [2015-05-02 08:23:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> I\u2019m a free market believer but we need media separate from those interests. [2015-05-02 08:23:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> Hehe, we needed separation of press & state as well as separation of church & state. [2015-05-02 08:25:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Anyway, fascinated by what Correa\u2019s doing in Ecuador. [2015-05-02 09:09:53] <Emmy B> Been reading some Greek political articles also turn their eyes to Ecuador regarding restructuring media as well as the debt issue. [2015-05-02 12:08:11] <WikiLeaks> It is a good time to spread Cameron, Osborne, Clegg, Milliband, Alex Salmond WL results. Try with \u201c-stratfor\u201d first [2015-05-02 12:39:04] <noll> backup account still isn\u2019t appearing in hashtags. [2015-05-02 12:43:26] <noll> obviously stratfor flooding results is well know, is there no way to have it just show the end of email chains? [2015-05-02 13:12:59] <WikiLeaks> No. [2015-05-02 13:13:22] <WikiLeaks> You can sort by date, reverse, to send the end of the chain first in rhe results list, though. [2015-05-02 13:54:38] <WISE Up Wales> Hi all. Can someone fill me in in 140 characters on the purpose of this group vs prev group and maybe benefits of this vs using IRC etc? Ta! [2015-05-02 14:00:21] <noll> hi Wales, for various reasons prev group is not secure enough. re IRC, this is more convenient, & semi-protected by Twitters privacy rules. [2015-05-02 14:12:27] <WISE Up Wales> OK, thanks H. Security issues were about who was on the list then? Never quite know who you\u2019re dealing with online I guess. I don\u2019t, anyway! [2015-05-02 15:09:15] <WikiLeaks> We can not assume that a twitter list is private. It\u2019s more that there were a few trollish people on the previous list, which make [2015-05-02 15:09:24] <WikiLeaks> having a useful conversation difficult. [2015-05-02 15:34:56] <Emmy B> I appreciate having the list, I hope we can do better work supporting in twitter as a result. [2015-05-02 15:35:13] <Emmy B> Goodnight everyone \ud83d\ude42 [2015-05-02 16:43:45] <noll> [redacted ad hominem attack against an editor] [2015-05-02 17:04:06] <noll> [redacted, third party information] [2015-05-02 17:10:10] <noll> gossip columnist that can only see gossip, or same \u2018nothing to see\u2019 used on cablegate, whatever. [2015-05-02 18:35:20] <WikiLeaks> Please see: https://twitter.com/wikileaks/with_replies [2015-05-02 18:40:16] <noll> https://twitter.com/hazelpress/status/594677683696574464 [2015-05-02 19:24:31] <noll> looks like PR\u2019s paycheck fishing, trying to draw CM into commenting. [2015-05-03 00:14:41] <WISE Up Wales> Hmm, this is complicated, not least cos it\u2019s not just artist [redacted, third party information] but also \u2018the man behind the idea\u2019 [redacted, third party information] http://anythingtosay.com/content/ [2015-05-03 00:18:57] <WikiLeaks> Their statement is that its from the moment of heroism, which makes sense, since no-one recognizes anything else. [2015-05-03 00:18:57] <WISE Up Wales> and [redacted, third party information] statement on the website (& a later short description) refers to \u201cBradley Chelsea Manning\u201d which is not the best. [2015-05-03 00:19:24] <WikiLeaks> Yes. They should fix that. [2015-05-03 00:20:13] <WikiLeaks> Although, if they want to tour the statue accross localities that are conservative, it makes sense to not draw attention to the sex issue. [2015-05-03 00:20:20] <WISE Up Wales> They probably wanted to avoid the issue being diverted off into trans-politics \u2013 ie Manning is in jail for the leaks not for being trans\u2026 [2015-05-03 00:21:00] <WISE Up Wales> but unless there\u2019s some acknowledgement, that\u2019s going to happen anyway, thanks to [redacted, third party information] and suchlike. [2015-05-03 00:22:13] <WikiLeaks> They probably thought Bradley Chelsea Manning was a good way of getting the popular name in, and the new one, and not getting diverted. [2015-05-03 00:22:55] <WikiLeaks> But that\u2019s going to happen regardless thanks to statist fake radicals. [2015-05-03 00:23:17] <WISE Up Wales> Using \u201cChelsea (formerly known as Bradley) Manning\u201d would be improvement. I think all the media i/vs with artist he\u2019s referred to Brad & he. [2015-05-03 00:23:59] <WikiLeaks> Why do you say you think that? [2015-05-03 00:24:14] <WikiLeaks> Is that based on recent interviews you have seen? [2015-05-03 00:24:55] <WISE Up Wales> Because I\u2019ve only seen a few interviews and those referred to Bradley and he. Don\u2019t have TV, don\u2019t watch a lot of vid of news reports [2015-05-03 00:25:47] <WISE Up Wales> but hope I\u2019m wrong! It\u2019s a big and ongoing problem. Can\u2019t even start having a conversation about Manning\u2019s situation without getting into.. [2015-05-03 00:26:01] <WikiLeaks> The gender issue really is vulgar. [2015-05-03 00:27:08] <WikiLeaks> 35 years in prison is just fine, provided CM can be called a \u2018she\u2019 by the guards. Horror. [2015-05-03 00:27:36] <WISE Up Wales> \u2026the trans issues immediately. It\u2019s a societal problem, how we place so much importance on gender. I just do what I can with it as it is. [2015-05-03 00:28:47] <WISE Up Wales> Gender identity politics is a nightmare. & a gift to the state, unfortunately. [2015-05-03 00:29:28] <WikiLeaks> Yes. Gender essentialism is regressive. [2015-05-03 00:30:58] <WikiLeaks> The whole fight was to liberate people from essentialism and understand that gender is a matrix of many biological signaling paths and.. [2015-05-03 00:32:14] <WikiLeaks> \u2026behaviors, each of which can have different strength accross individuals and societies. [2015-05-03 00:35:04] <WISE Up Wales> There\u2019s no liberation where the fight\u2019s ended up: now we\u2019ve \u2018the cotton ceiling\u2019 where blokes who say they feel like they\u2019re women\u2026 [2015-05-03 00:35:21] <WISE Up Wales> \u2026possibly only part time, complain that lesbians won\u2019t have sex with them! [2015-05-03 00:35:53] <WikiLeaks> To do away with binary \u2018he\u2019, \u2018she\u2019 as a stultifying simplfication and look at their unique values, skills and behaviors as an individual. [2015-05-03 00:35:57] <WISE Up Wales> Meantime, many men are now afraid to enter social centres around UK for fear of being attacked for their behaviour [2015-05-03 00:36:42] <WISE Up Wales> Yeah, a gender neutral pronoun would be v helpful. [2015-05-03 00:37:53] <WikiLeaks> \u201cthe prisoner\u201d has worked well for judges in our experience.

The important thing is to build alliances between all those who are oppressed, not divide [2015-05-03 00:40:27] <WikiLeaks> [redacted, third party information] A fake leftist, and a manipulative, predatory exhibitionist. [2015-05-03 00:41:26] <WISE Up Wales> Indeed.

Also, in my experience\u2026 [2015-05-03 00:47:36] <WISE Up Wales> \u2026it\u2019s important to clarify Chelsea/Bradley \u2013 you have to do it \u2013 or people think there are more than one person. Happened loads of times [2015-05-03 00:48:34] <WISE Up Wales> I think it\u2019s easy to forget when you know the story but many ppl simply don\u2019t, or only sketchiest details [2015-05-03 00:48:36] <WikiLeaks> We were being sarcastic with \u2018The Prisoner\u2019, pointing to this radical discovery of gender neutrality by hang\u2019em\u2019high judges. [2015-05-03 00:48:43] <WISE Up Action> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ao1yV7MGAnQ&feature=youtu.be [2015-05-03 00:50:32] <WISE Up Wales> Sarcasm doesn\u2019t travel easily on twitter! Or I\u2019m slow! :o) [2015-05-03 00:51:41] <WikiLeaks> Manning does have a Y chromosome and male genitalia. It\u2019s anglo-centric to suggest that an Italian should move into the subjective frame. [2015-05-03 00:52:18] <WikiLeaks> Doesn\u2019t help with anglo-left audiences but it does demonstrate their provincialism. [2015-05-03 00:54:20] <M> If Dormino had tried to create his own idea of what Manning would look as a female figure, he would have been attacked for that, too. [2015-05-03 00:56:27] <WikiLeaks> Yes. And it would have turned off audiences in most countries. [2015-05-03 00:57:56] <WikiLeaks> But they do need a little subpage to say how they\u2019ve been in contact with the manning camp so people can shutup the idiots with it. [2015-05-03 01:02:21] <WISE Up Action> Agree M and Wls [2015-05-03 01:03:02] <M> Agreed. Preferably sooner so they can kick it in the can before people pick it up and make a big hubbub about it. [2015-05-03 01:08:09] <WISE Up Action> Think it\u2019s clear that the artwork is from a \u2018historical\u2019 perspective. Dormino shouldn\u2019t need to explain, but if he did clarify this\u2026 [2015-05-03 01:08:42] <WISE Up Action> Would nullify the gender debate [2015-05-03 01:09:42] <WikiLeaks> The \u2018historical\u2019 aspect is explicity mentioned on the site. [2015-05-03 01:10:03] <WISE Up Wales> \u201cThe sculpture will show Chelsea Manning at the time when the facts took place. This is also motivated by the fact that the artist could not [2015-05-03 01:10:15] <WISE Up Wales> get enough portraits of her actual look to make a realistic portrait. All we are doing is to try and keep alive the public interest on this [2015-05-03 01:10:31] <WISE Up Wales> story. The story of three courageous persons. One women and two men.\u201d https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1856732911/anything-to-say-a-public-art-project-for-freedom/description [2015-05-03 01:12:02] <WISE Up Wales> But the 2nd sentence is bullshit. \u2018Actual look\u2019 would be meaningless in the context of this sculpture. [2015-05-03 01:13:25] <WISE Up Wales> Yeah, they could really do with the approval of CM to quote to detractors. [2015-05-03 01:13:50] <WikiLeaks> Her \u2018actual\u2019 look is the same as the look of the statue, anyway. [2015-05-03 01:15:57] <WikiLeaks> Did you notice @xychelsea dissing the Baltimore protesters? [2015-05-03 01:16:38] <WikiLeaks> \u201cI know deep down that this is not the answer #BaltimoreRiots\u201d [2015-05-03 01:17:42] <WikiLeaks> She\u2019s going to have to be careful with this new public face. It may well be a mistake. [2015-05-03 01:18:18] <M> I\u2019ve been a bit disappointed by the feed. I think her articles are a lot more powerful/interesting than her twitter feed. [2015-05-03 01:18:25] <WikiLeaks> Before everyone could project what they wanted onto her. [2015-05-03 01:19:02] <M> And there\u2019s been a lot of suspicion about the way the account is handled. She has confirmed it\u2019s her, but re how tweets/replies are relayed. [2015-05-03 01:19:50] <WikiLeaks> Yes. There\u2019s likely some not altogether bright \u201cPR advice\u201d from Fitzgibbeon on the statements. [2015-05-03 01:20:20] <WikiLeaks> The retweets are nearly all Fitzgibbon clients. [2015-05-03 01:26:29] <WISE Up Action> G, yeah think they could lose that second sentence and the statement would be stronger. Would be enough to rebut criticism. [2015-05-03 01:29:49] <WISE Up Action> Agree CM camp need to be careful with PR people coming in, picking up narrative. [2015-05-03 02:15:46] <Emmy B> Ultimately a piece of art speaks by itself. Because it is public art it is there calling for discussion. The narrative ok could do with a [2015-05-03 02:17:48] <Emmy B> little clarifying but essentially it is the piece of art that will speak by itself. Fascinating to read above perspectives \ud83d\ude42 [2015-05-03 08:42:22] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/conniptions/status/594886880656793602 Agree w/ everyone\u2019s points. thanks M, was looking for that last night. & yes, it could do w/ being on AtS website.

[2015-05-04 08:24:30] <Emmy B> could have lead to prejudice, evident from the arrogant disdain throughout her article. [2015-05-04 08:26:42] <Emmy B> 2. claimed Sony e-mails are of employees engaging in sony economic activity, they are not personal e-mails. Mentioned the argument that some [2015-05-04 08:28:11] <Emmy B> wish to see corporations get privacy rights as if they were individuals instead of being public institutions owned privately [2015-05-04 08:28:23] <Emmy B> . Claimed she reflected this view [2015-05-04 08:29:37] <Emmy B> 3. with regards to \u2018they engage in gossip\u2019 I said she shares views of others who claimed cablegate was libelous gossip, mentioned Erdogan [2015-05-04 08:30:08] <Emmy B> of course and asked if she was comfortable sharing a chair at the same table as Erdogan. [2015-05-04 08:31:49] <Emmy B> it doesn\u2019t matter, I must have been rude without realising\u2026 but i have not kept copy so maybe I don\u2019t recall everything correctly. [2015-05-04 09:16:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh, I doubt you were rude. I suspect they simply didn\u2019t like what you said. Too bad you didn\u2019t keep it. Could\u2019ve blogged it & then we could [2015-05-04 09:17:00] <LibertarianLibrarian> point out the Guardian\u2019s hypocrisy in what they allow in their comments. [2015-05-04 09:17:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> What you said all sounds rational and reasonable to me. [2015-05-04 09:17:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> But congrats on getting banned by the guardian, I\u2019d take that as an ironic compliment. LOL [2015-05-04 09:17:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> not banned, but you know what I mean. Censored?

[2015-05-05 17:31:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> I agree about the image. Besides, it represents who she was when she took action as a whistleblower and when she stood trial. That\u2019s part of [2015-05-05 17:31:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> Who she is today. [2015-05-05 17:33:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> This \u2018argument\u2019 over the statue title and gender image seems ridiculous at best & at worst an attempt to steal attention from the real [2015-05-05 17:33:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Purpose and message of the artwork. [2015-05-05 17:35:42] <LibertarianLibrarian> I don\u2019t like to see something that should be about human courage, integrity and truth be buried in an argument over how CM looks in it. [2015-05-05 17:37:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> Most public photos of her are as the soldier in uniform. [2015-05-05 17:38:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> There\u2019s this \u2018trans\u2019 twitter account that has been attacking courage to resist, wondering if that\u2019s a troll, not real. [2015-05-05 17:51:38] <WISE Up Action> Maybe,dunno.It\u2019s crap anyway. And the image is fine.I dont think the use of Bradley and he is OK tho.It\u2019s a very simple matter to correct it [2015-05-05 17:53:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, I agree re the use of \u2018he\u2019 and didn\u2019t she legally change her name? [2015-05-05 18:01:25] <LibertarianLibrarian> Regardless, she expressed her preference so that should be respected. But I think the artist meant well. It\u2019s an adjustment, I occasionally [2015-05-05 18:01:39] <LibertarianLibrarian> Forget and I try. [2015-05-05 18:05:54] <WikiLeaks> Part of the problem is that the person at that time was also a \u2018he\u2019 and also called \u2018bradley\u2019. [2015-05-05 18:06:49] <WISE Up Action> That\u2019s totally understandable of course \u2013 we all do. And yes, she legally changed her name over a year ago. I have just emailed thanking [2015-05-05 18:06:57] <WikiLeaks> There doesn\u2019t seem to be a word, \u2018heed\u2019, representing a past tense form.

Perhaps \u2018formerly Bradley\u2019 might work \u2013 yes, we don\u2019t really have good terms for [2015-05-05 18:09:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> gender changes. [2015-05-05 18:10:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> Or non-standard genders for that matter. [2015-05-05 18:11:00] <WISE Up Action> won the world boxing heavyweight championship? the historical record is Mohammed Ali (Cassius Clay) not the other way round. [2015-05-05 18:11:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, that makes sense and will very likely be the same for Chelsea. [2015-05-05 18:12:03] <WikiLeaks> FYI: https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=transvestite%2Ctranssexual%2Ctransgender&year_start=1800&year_end=2005&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Ctransvestite%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctranssexual%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctransgender%3B%2Cc0 [2015-05-05 18:14:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Interesting! A nice visualization of language evolving. [2015-05-05 18:17:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> And that represents a change in society & culture too, though there will always be some resistance. [2015-05-05 18:17:58] <WISE Up Action> Hah, well Chelsea prefers trans* (with a * OK?) It\u2019s a fucking minefield!! Lucky I noticed before we publd this http://wiseupaction.info/about-chelsea-manning/ [2015-05-05 18:19:55] <WikiLeaks> It may have legal and financial consequences. [2015-05-05 18:20:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yeah. I was just looking at medical terminology, represented by PubMed (Medline)\u2019s medical subject headings. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=Transgender [2015-05-05 18:20:35] <WikiLeaks> There was a huge debate over the definition of \u2018waterboarding\u2019, which used to be defined as a torture technique. That fight is documented\u2026 [2015-05-05 18:20:37] <WISE Up Action> it\u2019s just a matter of doing our best like with anything. What may? [2015-05-05 18:20:46] <WikiLeaks> \u2026in the WikiPedia history for the term. [2015-05-05 18:21:25] <WikiLeaks> Similarly, there\u2019s has been a big fight on as to whether our staff are journalists and as to whether WL is a media organization, becuase.. [2015-05-05 18:21:36] <WikiLeaks> \u2026it has legal and political consequences. [2015-05-05 18:21:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> Transgender added in 2013, formerly transsexualism from 2001-2012. [2015-05-05 18:23:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, and those consequences can be serious. [2015-05-05 18:25:52] <M> Transvestite always referred to cross-dressing rather than living as non-birth sex, I think. Eddie Izzard still calls himself transvestite. [2015-05-05 18:26:41] <WISE Up Action> Oh right. Well there\u2019s a world standard/protocol for treatment etc http://www.wpath.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=1352&pk_association_webpage=3947 [2015-05-05 18:27:08] <M> There\u2019s always Ed Wood\u2019s 1953 classic, \u201cGlen or Glenda\u201d: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vUoSPJm5w0 [2015-05-05 18:28:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Re defining journalists, I think the world is changing faster than the old definitions can keep up with, and the \u2018old guard\u2019 is trying\u2026 [2015-05-05 18:28:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> to hold onto what favors them, fighting inevitable change. [2015-05-05 18:30:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> That\u2019s true in a lot of areas today. My own field keeps playing with names, librarians, information specialists, informationists, etc. [2015-05-05 18:31:25] <LibertarianLibrarian> When I was at Vanderbilt, it would change every couple of years. When I left, we were \u2018knowledge management specialists\u2019 or some such. [2015-05-05 18:32:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> People have tremendous arguments over what we call ourselves, which I think is ridiculous, yet it does represent a massive shift in\u2026 [2015-05-05 18:33:15] <LibertarianLibrarian> What we do and how we do it. [2015-05-05 18:34:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> And if you don\u2019t stay up with the changes you rapidly become obsolete. [2015-05-05 18:34:55] <WikiLeaks> People should call themselves \u2018obsoletists\u2019 and be done with it. [2015-05-05 18:35:37] <LibertarianLibrarian> I think that\u2019s the same underlying fear of \u2018traditionalists\u2019 looking at new forms of journalism and media like Wikileaks and others. [2015-05-05 18:36:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> LOL! Yes, that\u2019s exactly what they are! And what they\u2019re afraid of. [2015-05-05 18:36:24] <WikiLeaks> There just a bunch of finks trying to protect their turf. [2015-05-05 18:37:43] <WikiLeaks> Really, we\u2019ve never encounted a profession with such responsibility and such incompetence. Each day they fly jumbo jets filled with entire.. [2015-05-05 18:38:17] <LibertarianLibrarian> Exactly. I see so much of that in academia. The territoriality and inflated egos are incredible. [2015-05-05 18:39:10] <WikiLeaks> ..nations. And each day they manoever according to whim, petty personal vendettas, sucking up or because they can\u2019t be arsed. [2015-05-05 18:39:44] <WikiLeaks> There\u2019s more deaths on the average journalists head than the average soldier, by a factor of a 100. [2015-05-05 18:41:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wouldn\u2019t doubt that. I was just complaining earlier today how giving a previously intelligent woman the title of \u2018Dean\u2019\u2026 [2015-05-05 18:41:56] <LibertarianLibrarian> Resulted in immediate deletion of brain function while simultaneously inflating the ego beyond proportion [2015-05-05 18:42:19] <WikiLeaks> If you want to see who someone really is, give them power. [2015-05-05 18:43:10] <WikiLeaks> There\u2019s a half dozen decent national security journalists in english, who the other 10,000 journalists in english detest.

Seen it happen close up. [2015-05-05 18:44:46] <WISE Up Action> So agree. The power and abnegation of responsibility of media is so damaging. Imagine the good that could be done! It\u2019s so depressing [2015-05-05 18:45:32] <WikiLeaks> Facebook have now directly intervened in the UK election. A sign of things to come.

[2015-05-06 13:34:42] <Emmy B> Only the trolls will jump on this. [2015-05-06 13:37:12] <Emmy B> there is another aspect to this too. Do all trans* ppl have to be \u2018outed\u2019 as such? only the person involved has the right to define/declare [2015-05-06 13:37:31] <Emmy B> express what they are. [2015-05-06 13:38:24] <Emmy B> this artistic expression (statue) does not represent CM as a person as much as an idea due to her action, which is for what she will be [2015-05-06 13:38:39] <noll> \u2013 we\u2019re not sure how to respond. / Em, group has \u2018existed\u2019 for *three days via few random fem\u2019 posts. & now this. it\u2019s not authentic. [2015-05-06 13:38:52] <Emmy B> remembered. [2015-05-06 13:39:13] <Emmy B> Well, if this is the case, we should take a look at them. [2015-05-06 13:39:23] <Emmy B> thanks! [2015-05-06 13:40:27] <WISE Up Action> Well that\u2019s true Emmy, but she has come out. And I think it\u2019s both but the person is integral to the idea you speak of. [2015-05-06 13:41:08] <noll> no fem\u2019 group serious enough to take that action would make Barbie mistake, or post such obviously contrived material. [2015-05-06 13:42:14] <WikiLeaks> The statue is a success. It\u2019s pictures are everywhere. The idiots will be seen as such. [2015-05-06 13:42:41] <noll> \u2013 going back to your comments, \u2013 we expect CM is very proud of who she was during that time. & others should be to.

[2015-05-06 13:49:30] <Emmy B> Strange spellings of phobia as \u2018foebia\u2019 in the domain name, what language is that? German? [2015-05-06 13:50:46] <Emmy B> ah! probably word play with Foe, I see\u2026 [2015-05-06 13:55:37] <WISE Up Action> This is the letter we sent earlier http://wiseupaction.info/letter/ [2015-05-06 13:56:28] <WISE Up Action> now replied affirming.

[2015-05-06 14:01:05] <noll> Wls, perhaps. it\u2019s not likely to excite serious fem/ trans activists, but then they\u2019re not ones jumping up & down in limelight. [2015-05-06 14:01:41] <WISE Up Action> Chelsea Manning Support Network. And that they agreed with the request and how it was formulated. Hah! Me We\u2019re making an attempt to update [2015-05-06 14:03:01] <noll> Em, agree, dressed up as anarchists posting buzzfeed.. it\u2019s laughable. [2015-05-06 14:04:07] <WISE Up Action> the whole site.So that will become a sep heading \u2018Chelsea Manning\u2019 on the menu. Other headings still to be written up \u2018JA\u2019 \u2018The Docs\u2019 etc [2015-05-06 14:08:58] <WikiLeaks> Yes. The German trans* activists are probably a CIA first mission test.

[2015-05-07 14:16:30] <noll> yes! surprising, looks like we\u2019re staying up. Greens + 1 :o) Lib Dems.. haha / Em, was only one Steinitz/ Anke: https://archive.is/Ysrgu [2015-05-07 14:18:01] <WikiLeaks> We\u2019d guess that the exit poll is flawed, but it\u2019s also possible that today\u2019s front pages + Torygraph emails shifted results. [2015-05-07 14:19:39] <Emmy B> thx H! I don\u2019t understand UK pol in the least! [2015-05-07 14:19:58] <WikiLeaks> Cameron is now 1/7 to be next PM for bookmakers. The smart money is on the Tories now. [2015-05-07 14:22:07] <noll> 2010\u2019s exit was close to dead on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2010_United_Kingdom_general_election#Exit_poll [2015-05-07 14:30:15] <noll> \u2013 but that only goes so far, labour\u2019s front bench has no weight to it, & major figures like ed balls/ miliband don\u2019t cut it at all. [2015-05-07 14:31:41] <WikiLeaks> Yes. That\u2019s well known. [2015-05-07 15:30:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> At least they have some slight variations in their parties and more than 2 potential options. I don\u2019t know the UK parties well, but it\u2019s [2015-05-07 15:30:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> Interesting [2015-05-07 15:31:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> Somehow my country has to find a way out of this \u20182 party\u2019 system which has devolved into evil #1 vs evil #2 & there\u2019s no real diff. [2015-05-07 15:57:15] <noll> SNP advance is stunning. since indyref London establishment has seemed set on federal UK, b/c after all, anything less is lost. [2015-05-07 16:13:02] <noll> Jen. there\u2019s also no substantial diff\u2019 here \u2013 labour tends feed fatcats & undo minimalist socialism w/ jawdropping economic incompetence. [2015-05-07 16:58:06] <noll> if conservative largest party, labour largest coalition? \u2013 media could effectively decide this. [2015-05-07 17:42:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> Guess I don\u2019t know the parties well enough. Just seems like there\u2019s more variety with Tories, Conservatives, Labour, Greens. [2015-05-07 17:43:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> Well, we technically have a Green party in some places, I think. Really, the only semi-viable 3rd party is Libertarians & I vote 4 them. [2015-05-07 17:45:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not that it\u2019s done much good. [2015-05-07 17:48:01] <noll> Andrew Marr \u2013 ultimate establishment journo is now forecasting federalism via bbc. / Jen, have to go back to 1908: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_governments [2015-05-07 17:51:55] <noll> \u2013 for last time 3rd party (Liberals) formed govt. but things looking interesting for future, & soon climate change w/ become huge factor.

[2015-05-07 18:19:48] <noll> labourites now blaming media bias \u2013 but it\u2019s a chicken & egg thing: leadership/ policies, could have followed SNP \u2018social\u2019 platform which \u2013 [2015-05-07 18:22:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> It\u2019s clear the Scottish independence movement isn\u2019t finished by a long shot. [2015-05-07 18:22:40] <noll> \u2013 powered past media. or, looked ahead & elected David Miliband & gone Blair 2.0. as it is we\u2019ve literally already forgotten their campaign. [2015-05-07 18:31:55] <noll> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/MurtazaGeoNews/status/596475088364503040 looks like Wls ally George Galloway is out. [2015-05-07 18:34:30] <noll> Jen, Marr has been very well briefed by Whitehall, stating SNP is \u201cunstoppable\u201d & Cameron will lead last UK \u2018as we know it\u2019 govt. [2015-05-07 18:52:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> Galloway seemed like a cool guy, or at least independent and unique. And always sad to see a WL supporter go out [2015-05-07 18:56:16] <LibertarianLibrarian> That\u2019s very interesting re the SNP. Definitely worth watching. There was likely to be a backlash given the closeness of the referendum\u2026 [2015-05-07 18:56:32] <noll> labour campaign in GGalloway\u2019s constituency was in complete disarray, but then they got it together & GG responded w/ v. negative campaign. [2015-05-07 18:57:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh, yeah, voters get sick of those kinds of campaigns. Not the best tactic. [2015-05-07 18:59:16] <WISE Up Action> Maybe SNP anti-austerity,anti-trident etc message winning so dramatically will have impact widening the parties, forcing some change [2015-05-07 19:00:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> There will have to be some adjustments made in response to big SNP win. They have certainly made a statement. [2015-05-07 19:02:39] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, GG is one of the few British politicians I\u2019ve heard of, so he was a strong voice. [2015-05-07 19:04:27] <noll> Jen, agree re GG. / Action, agree, if only labour had followed policies w/ decent front bench, & greens had CL leading. [2015-05-07 19:04:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> Who\u2019s CL?

Embarrassing! [2015-05-07 19:14:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> I\u2019m in the US, can\u2019t view the BBC iPlayer (which quite often irritates me as I do like some of their drama shows). [2015-05-07 19:18:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> My parents vote Green sometimes, but that party isn\u2019t significant here. Then again, I vote Libertarian & that\u2019s not much better. [2015-05-07 19:19:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> But I am hoping Vermont \u2018socialist\u2019 Bernie Sanders is going to give Clinton fits. Doubt I\u2019d vote for him, but he\u2019s a character & quite [2015-05-07 19:20:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> popular is some areas. [2015-05-07 19:20:54] <LibertarianLibrarian> Plus, he\u2019ll go after her, which I\u2019ll enjoy just because. [2015-05-07 19:22:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> Anyway, work night so off to sleep for me. Y\u2019all are up late, or is it early by now? G\u2019night, hope the final results aren\u2019t too bad 4 you. [2015-05-07 19:24:13] <noll> Jen, Sanders does look likely to push HC to left, but it\u2019ll only be skin deep. it\u2019s 3.23 am, we\u2019re staying up for results \u2013 as always :o/ [2015-05-07 19:24:26] <noll> night xx [2015-05-07 19:25:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Oh, she won\u2019t change; only Hillary matters to Hillary.

    "text": "(CNN) A Coast Guard lieutenant arrested last Friday on gun and drug charges allegedly wanted to conduct a mass killing.\n\nChristopher Paul Hasson, 49, of Silver Spring, Maryland, is alleged to be a white supremacist who had a hit list that included prominent Democratic politicians as well as several journalists from CNN and MSNBC. Hasson's case was first circulated by counterterrorism expert Seamus Hughes and the George Washington Program on Extremism.\n\nHasson's hit list includes Democratic politicians -- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Kamala Harris of California, as well as former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas -- as well as CNN journalists Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo and Van Jones and MSNBC's Chris Hayes, Ari Melber and Joe Scarborough.\n\nCourt documents say Hasson espoused extremist and white supremacist views and allege that he relied on the manifesto of Anders Breivik, a Norwegian who was convicted in 2011 of two terror attacks that killed 77 people.\n\nThe government says Hasson also stockpiled steroids and human growth hormone \"to increase his ability to conduct attacks,\" consistent with the directions in Breivik's manifesto.\n\nRead More"

    "text": "Andy Wigmore, the right-hand man to Arron Banks and Nigel Farage, has admitted that he has been questioned by Bob Mueller in regards to the Trump Russia inquiry.\n\nMr. Wigmore stated on Twitter that he spoken to Bob Mueller\u2019s team at the FBI\u2019s Field Office in Washington, DC. He posted a cheerful picture of himself wearing an FBI t-shirt taken at those offices, to me directly, on August 27th:\n\nAfter the Guardian reported that Nigel Farage was declared to be a \u2018person of interest\u2019 in the FBI\u2019s criminal investigation into Trump Russia collusion, matters appeared to go quiet, until this week a U.K MP, Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw, a former Culture Secretary, called for the Electoral Commission to examine whether Russia interfered in Brexit.\n\nIn the interim, Mr. Wigmore was interviewed by Robert Mueller\u2019s team (he said) and the FBI. It is important to note that these two are not the same thing. Mr. Mueller\u2019s team could have interviewed Wigmore at the FBI Field Office, the FBI could have interviewed him, or both could have done so separately.\n\nMueller fishing \u2013 he has to to save face he\u2019s desperate to pin anything, literally anything on Trump but he will fail and look a bellend [sic, British slang for \u2018idiot\u2019] too.\n\nWhen a user suggested to Wigmore that \u2018there was collusion, treason with Russia\u2019, Wigmore replied:\n\n\u201creally no there wasn\u2019t \u2013 but you believe what u want to \u2013 even Mueller realise he\u2019s looking stupid \u2013 he\u2019s pretty cross he\u2019s been sold a crock of shit and wants revenge on the leakers and recipients\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that I was \u201con a list\u201d he received from Julian Assange as a recipient of leaks and would therefore shortly be arrested by the FBI myself:\n\n\u201cYour name mentioned Loo Loo \u2013 hope you\u2019ve never seen or handled or even were told about leaks \u2013 your contacts about to drop you right in it\u2026\u201d\n\nHe further said that if Senator John McCain went down, \u201cso do you\u201d.\n\nI double checked with Wigmore that he had been interviewed, which he confirmed. He added again that Julian Assange had my name on a list of those who had \u2018handled stolen secrets\u2019 (with no discernible sense of irony). \u201cSee @ JulianAssange about to announce the secret leakers and who handled stolen secrets, saw your name going to prison!praying for you Loo\u201d, he said.\n\nMr. Wigmore also discussed my reporting that GCHQ taped Steve Mnuchin, Donald Trump and other members of their team in Scotland on June 24th, 2016, when, I report, the hacking deal was finalized.\n\nThat\u2019s right because it didn\u2019t happen \u2013 no Russian in Scotland apart from those that live there and interestingly not big Putin fans \u2013 lol. I speak with them often \u2013 one is National Olympic Committee of Russia shooting \u2013 shot with him many times stayed with him often in Scotland\n\nWigmore is, or was, an Olympic Ambassador for Belize in shooting. He refused to name the specific Russian. However, I had tweeted that Steve Mnuchin had been recorded by GCHQ in Scotland on June 24th, and Wigmore replied:\n\nI know the Russian you are talking about and they were definitely not in Scotland\u2026.they were in France LOL\n\nMr. Wigmore is dyslexic and therefore I am unsure whether he meant to use the singular or if it was a typo for \u2018Russians\u2019. I pointed out that I had not mentioned any Russians in my tweet about Mnuchin and Trump being recorded by GCHQ at Trump Turnberry. This exchange may be worth reproducing:\n\nMe: Andy, I didn\u2019t mention a given Russian.\n\nMr. Wigmore: I know exactly what you are referring to \u2013 you forget our company stuffed with ex @ gchq 5/6 SAS \u2013 not difficult dopey\n\nI followed up on Mr. Wigmore\u2019s assertion that Russians based in Scotland, connected to the Russian shooting team, were involved in the June 24th plot to hack America \u2013 something my article did not suggest \u2013 and was interested to read his defense of one Mr. Lisin using only his surname, as though the two were familiar with each other.\n\nMr. Wigmore adamantly proclaims his innocence in the hack of the American election by the Russians.\n\n*this reporter declares her interest in that Mr. Wigmore promised her an FBI Washington Field Office t-shirt, which she is keen to receive from him, though not at the apparent price of taking tea at Trump Towers.

    "text": "Vincent Tchenguiz, an Iranian-born British entrepreneur and property tycoon who until 2015 was the largest shareholder in the parent company of the scandal-hit data firm Cambridge Analytica, also played a prominent role in the founding stages of the controversial Israeli business intelligence company Black Cube, and provided it with vital funding, according to a 2013 Israeli lawsuit filed by lawyers for Tchenguiz.\n\nTchenguiz, whose family is of Iraqi-Jewish origin, fell out with the secretive Israeli company and its founders and sued it for fraud and other alleged offenses, seeking almost a million pounds in damages. The case, which received very little media coverage at the time, was ultimately settled out of court.\n\nBlack Cube, which was founded in 2011 and whose former honorary board president was the late Mossad chief Meir Dagan, has been at the center of considerable international press scrutiny in recent months.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nMany of the company\u2019s reported behind-the-scenes activities \u2014 including its work in Romania, its work on an election campaign in Hungary (where it denies involvement), its involvement in the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and its activities relating to the Iran nuclear deal, when it allegedly conducted a \u201cdirty ops\u201d campaign against former Obama administration officials \u2014 have made headlines worldwide.\n\nCambridge Analytica and its parent company SCL Group, too, have been the subject of intense media attention, with the FBI and US Justice Department reportedly investigating the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica over its role in the 2016 election campaigns of US President Donald Trump and other Republican politicians, including the harvesting and alleged illegal use of personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.\n\nBlack Cube \u2014 which calls itself a \u201cprivate intelligence agency\u201d and employs former members of Mossad and other Israeli intelligence units \u2014 has denied any links to Cambridge Analytica or any of its subsidiaries. (Last month, the British Parliament\u2019s Culture, Media and Sports Committee issued a report alleging that Black Cube had engaged in election-related hacking in Nigeria on behalf of SCL-linked companies, citing testimony it heard in March by Cambridge Analytica\u2019s former research director Christopher Wylie; however Wylie retracted this allegation in US Senate testimony in May, and it was also denied by Brittany Kaiser, who managed Cambridge Analytica\u2019s project in Nigeria, in written testimony to the British committee.)\n\nIn the 2013 lawsuit, which was filed days after Black Cube had sued Tchenguiz in the UK for breach of contract and unpaid bills, Tchenguiz\u2019s lawyers claim that their client played a prominent role in the founding stages of Black Cube, and provide documentation to support this assertion.\n\nIf Tchenguiz, SCL Group\u2019s largest shareholder until June 2015, indeed played a such a role in Black Cube in 2011-12, this sheds new light on two mysterious companies that are alleged to have been involved in political influence campaigns worldwide.\n\nThe 2013 Israeli lawsuit was brought by a private company, Vincos Ltd., of which Tchenguiz was the beneficial owner. In the suit, filed in Tel Aviv District Court, Tchenguiz claims that the setting up of Black Cube was partly his initiative.\n\n\u201cDefendants 3 and 4 [Black Cube founders Dan Zorella and Avi Yanus] entered into a contract with the plaintiff [Vincos Ltd.] according to which defendant 3, defendant 4 and the plaintiff agreed to jointly establish a company that provides business intelligence research,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nFurthermore, the lawsuit indicates that Tchenguiz provided vital early funding for Black Cube, with the option of making a larger investment at a later date. \u201cThe plaintiff intended to invest in the company in the future and agreed to fund various projects involved in the company\u2019s development, according to the cost plus business model whereby the defendants would have their costs covered by the plaintiff and receive an additional 15 percent on top of that,\u201d it states.\n\nIn addition, Tchenguiz allowed the UK branch of Black Cube to operate from a London office he owned for the nominal monthly rent of one British pound, the suit states.\n\nFor over a year, from December 2011 until December 2012, Black Cube prepared weekly reports for Tchenguiz, some of which were provided as exhibits in the lawsuit, describing the projects the company was working on and the number of hours it spent on each project. Every Sunday, company founders Zorella and Yanus spoke by phone with Tchenguiz or his representative, the complaint in the lawsuit claims. Tchenguiz was apprised of all the company\u2019s activities, documents attached to the lawsuit show, not merely those that concerned his own affairs \u2014 underlining the extent of his involvement in Black Cube.\n\nTchenguiz also helped the company apply for a grant from the Office of the Chief Scientist in the Israeli Economy Ministry, under a program that incentivizes entrepreneurs to develop dual-use military and civilian technologies for commercial export.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Economy Ministry refused to say whether Black Cube received the grant. (In an unrelated case reported last year by The Times of Israel, the Economy Ministry gave taxpayers\u2019 money totaling some $270,000 to a company at the heart of Israel\u2019s now-outlawed binary options industry in order to help it expand abroad, even though the ministry had been warned in advance that the binary options industry was blighted by fraud; the ministry failed for two years to publicize the grant, in breach of its legal obligations.)\n\nAccording to Israeli law, any Israeli company exporting technologies that involve military-related equipment, know-how or services must receive an export permit from the Defense Ministry. When queried in November 2017 by MK Tamar Zandberg (Meretz) as to whether Black Cube had sought and received such a permit, Avi Abuhatzera, an adviser to Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, replied, in a letter seen by The Times of Israel, that the Defense Ministry had asked Black Cube whether it was exporting military products or know-how that fall under the law\u2019s regulations. Black Cube had replied in the negative, Abuhatzera told Zandberg, and the Defense Ministry had concluded, on the basis of this reply, that the law requiring a military export permit did not apply to Black Cube.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s activities may have changed in the intervening years, documents filed in the 2013 lawsuit reveal that Black Cube applied for the Economy Ministry\u2019s Magnet/Meimad grant, which was specifically geared towards military exports abroad, and that the Defense Ministry may have even been a client of Black Cube at the time of the lawsuit.\n\n\u2018Not transparent enough\u2019\n\nOn March 23, 2013, Vincos Ltd., a British company owned by Tchenguiz, sued the defendants B.C. Strategy Ltd., also known as Black Cube Israel, its daughter company B.C. Strategy UK Ltd (Black Cube UK), the company\u2019s founders Zorella and Yanus, and an additional employee, in Tel Aviv District Court.\n\nTchenguiz accused the defendants of fraud, breach of contract and unlawfully enriching themselves. He sought \u00a3924,790 in damages.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Tchenguiz says he met Zorella in 2010 when the latter was an employee of a business intelligence firm called Businessscope. Businessscope was founded in May 2010 and its initial directors were Shai Schiller, Itay Yonat and Doron Dabby, later to be joined by Gadi Aviran, all of whom are well-known figures in Israel\u2019s WebInt (web intelligence) industry. (These latter four names are cited on the relevant Israeli corporate documents. Apart from the claims in the lawsuit, there is no evidence of which The Times of Israel is aware that Zorella was a Businessscope employee.)\n\nAccording to the complaint, a company owned by Tchenguiz held a 17 percent ownership stake in Businessscope. On March 10, 2011, when the British Serious Fraud Office raided Tchenguiz\u2019s home and office \u2014 on suspicions that he had conspired to cause the collapse of Iceland\u2019s Kaupthing Bank in 2008 \u2014 Tchenguiz turned to Businessscope, he said, and specifically to Dan Zorella, to help him fight the allegations.\n\nAfter a short period of dealing with Businessscope, according to the complaint, Tchenguiz felt the company was not being sufficiently transparent in its dealings with him.\n\nZorella had a short time before, on March 7, 2011, set up his own Israeli business intelligence company, which he called Zorella Ltd; he later changed its name to B.C. Strategy Ltd., aka \u201cBlack Cube.\u201d\n\nTchenguiz, according to the complaint, said he paid Businessscope \u00a321,000 to allow Zorella to work with Tchenguiz through this new company, Black Cube. Tchenguiz said he agreed to pay the operating expenses of Zorella\u2019s new company, starting in December 2011, plus 15 percent profits.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Vincos Ltd. paid Black Cube a total of \u00a3844,790 over a period of 13 months \u2014 from December 2011 till December 2012.\n\nTchenguiz and Zorella had agreed that Black Cube would do research into Kaupthing Bank \u2014 a project they had dubbed \u201cAthena\u201d \u2014 as well as seek out new projects and clients. Black Cube\u2019s work on behalf of Tchenguiz led the Serious Fraud Office to eventually in 2014 drop the case against him [paywall], pay millions of dollars in damages and publicly apologize to him.\n\nThroughout 2012, Vincos Ltd. received detailed weekly reports of Black Cube\u2019s activities and paid the company on the basis of these reports, according to Tchenguiz, who attached several pages of these reports to the complaint.\n\nAs asserted in the complaint, \u201cthe plaintiff periodically received from the defendants a detailed budget for the various projects Black Cube was involved in and the plaintiff paid the defendants on the basis of detailed descriptions of the company\u2019s expenses which they sent him. In addition, almost every Sunday there was a phone conversation between the plaintiff and defendants in which they detailed all the work and activity that Black Cube had undertaken over the past week and the plaintiff approved payments to the defendants on the basis of these presentations.\u201d\n\nIn addition, on February 4, 2012, Tchenguiz and B.C. Strategy signed an agreement, attached to the complaint, stating that for the next five years Tchenguiz had the option to acquire 49 percent of the company and to appoint himself as a director.\n\nAccording to the complaint, however, Tchenguiz began to suspect that Zorella and Yanus had padded their reports and charged him for work they had never done. This caused Tchenguiz to stop paying them and immediately halt negotiations over the option agreement. He then sent a letter to Israel\u2019s Economy Ministry saying he would no longer be investing in B.C. Strategy and was withdrawing his support for B.C. Strategy\u2019s application for a grant under the Magnet/Meimad program.\n\nOn March 8, 2013, Black Cube\u2019s lawyers sent Vincos a letter demanding payment of \u00a3336,708, and subsequently sued him in the UK, a development that was covered in the British press. Vincos sued the company in Israel on March 23, an event that received minimal media coverage. Both cases were ultimately settled out of court. In April 2013, the Guardian reported that Tchenguiz had settled his dispute with Black Cube and that \u201cthe terms of the deal were not disclosed but include an undertaking not to discuss further details with the media.\u201d\n\nTchenguiz\u2019s lawyers attached several pages of Black Cube\u2019s weekly reports [see link] to the complaint.\n\nSeveral of the names mentioned in these reports are still in the headlines in 2018, although there is not enough information available to determine the nature of Black Cube\u2019s association with these entities. For instance, Black Cube researched the Icelandic law firm Logos, whose managing partner Gunnar Sturluson was also a board member at the Icelandic firm FL Group, a company that has been in the media spotlight for being a heavy investor in several of Donald J. Trump\u2019s real-estate projects.\n\nOther questions raised by the reports include:\n\nWhy was Black Cube interested in Iran sanctions?\n\nWhat, if anything, did it have to do with an Egyptian gas deal?\n\nAnd did Black Cube do work for Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry, as the reports in the complaint suggest?\n\nSCL Group and Tchenguiz\n\nSCL Group and Cambridge Analytica are part of a tangled web of companies that even a UK parliamentary committee has struggled to map, as the committee explained in a report last month entitled \u201cDisinformation and \u2018fake news\u2019: Interim Report.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch effort has been expended in trying to untangle the complex web of relationships within what started out as the SCL (Strategic Communications Laboratories) group of companies, in which the founder Nigel Oakes and Alexander Nix have been involved, along with a myriad of changing shareholders,\u201d reads the report.\n\n\u201cChristopher Wylie told us, in March 2018, that everyone who worked for Cambridge Analytica was \u2018effectively\u2019 employed by SCL: \u2018When I started in June 2013, Cambridge Analytica did not exist yet. It is important for people to understand that Cambridge Analytica is more of a concept or a brand than anything else because it does not have employees. It is all SCL, it is just the front-facing company for the United States.'\u201d\n\nThe UK parliamentary committee cited a May 2017 chart created by investigative journalists Wendy Siegelman and Ann Marlowe that includes 30 companies interlinked within the SCL Group, but noted that the structure had since changed.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that from 2005 to 2015 Vincent Tchenguiz was SCL Group\u2019s largest shareholder. During this period, in 2014 and 2015, SCL Group held meetings with Lukoil, Russia\u2019s second-largest oil company, according to the New York Times. Lukoil is under US sanctions and has strong Kremlin ties.\n\nAlso in 2015, when Tchenguiz still owned shares in SCL Group, the company or one of its affiliates allegedly intervened in elections in Nigeria. In a section devoted to SCL Group, last month\u2019s UK parliamentary committee report stated that \u201cWe received disturbing evidence, some of which we have published, some of which we have not, of activities undertaken by the SCL-linked companies in various political campaigns dating from around 2010, including the use of hacking, of disinformation, and of voter suppression\u2026\u201c\n\nAccording to Wylie\u2019s testimony to the British parliamentary committee, when Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon (later Donald Trump\u2019s campaign director and White House chief strategist) were finalizing the establishment of Cambridge Analytica, \u201cthey got rid of Tchenguiz [as a shareholder in SCL Group]. The Mercer lawyers didn\u2019t like Tchenguiz\u2019s involvement. He had fairly sketchy business dealings that they didn\u2019t want to be associated with.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what business dealings Wylie was referring to. But UK Companies House filings reveal that Tchenguiz was for a time an investor in a company in which Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, who is wanted in the US for bribery and other allegations, was also an investor, as described by journalist Ann Marlowe.\n\nBlack Cube, in response to The Times of Israel\u2019s requests for comment, said in a statement: \u201cThis is an example of sensationalist reporting on Black Cube of absolutely no value. This story, which is from five years ago, has been dug up, twisted and is completely misleading the readers.\u201d\n\nVincent Tchenguiz\u2019s Consensus Business Group did not comment on its relationship with Black Cube but sent the following response with regard to SCL Group.\n\n\u201cConsensus Business Group invested in SCL in 2005 taking a 24% stake in the business. The investment was made on the basis that the company was intending to develop a major emergency response and strategic communication centre capability for clients.\n\n\u201cWhen SCL\u2019s business model failed, Consensus Business Group lost interest in the investment and began negotiating an exit from the business in 2013. It finally sold its stake back to SCL\u2019s management in 2015 at a loss.\n\n\u201cConsensus Business Group was a financial investor and not involved in the day to day management or operations of SCL. The investment in SCL was just one of many investments made by Consensus Business Group during the period from 2002 to 2008.\u201d\n\nSpies for hire\n\nIn July, Politico reported that Black Cube had secretly recorded representatives of Hungarian NGOs as part of a campaign to discredit the opposition in the run-up to Hungary\u2019s national elections. (Black Cube has denied involvement.)\n\nIn 2016, two Israeli Black Cube employees were arrested in Romania for harassing and spying on the country\u2019s anti-corruption czar and later pled guilty to the charges.\n\nBlack Cube was also hired by disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein to discredit women accusing him of sexual offenses including rape. (A Black Cube board member later apologized for Black Cube having worked on Weinstein\u2019s behalf.)\n\nOther players\n\nBlack Cube is not the only Israeli company that has come under fire for reportedly exporting military-grade spy tools and techniques to deep-pocketed international clients.\n\nIn May of this year, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported that a now-defunct Israeli company called Psy-Group was being investigated by the FBI in connection with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into alleged illegal interference in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nPsy-Group, which operated in Israel under the name Invop Ltd, was a self-styled leader in \u201cintelligence and influence\u201d which boasted in its marketing material of its covert techniques and capabilities. Its founder and co-owner Joel Zamel was reported by the New York Times in May to have met with Donald Trump Jr. three months before the November 2016 US presidential elections, offering to assist his father\u2019s campaign, and the company was reported to have drawn up \u201ca multimillion-dollar proposal for a social media manipulation effort to help elect Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, an Israeli company called NSO Group that sells software that can hack into smartphones has drawn media attention lately because its software was reportedly used to target human rights activists in Mexico and a dissident in the United Arab Emirates. (NSO Group did not respond to a Times of Israel request for comment.)\n\nDefensive Shield, another Israeli company that has reportedly exported Israeli military know-how to regimes abroad, is currently the subject of an ongoing Israeli police investigation over alleged corrupt practices abroad, police told The Times of Israel.\n\nThe Times of Israel is also aware of at least four Israeli military/intelligence companies that have overlapping ownership with now-outlawed fraudulent binary options companies.\n\nOne of Israel\u2019s staunchest critics of the unregulated activity of former Israeli military and intelligence personnel abroad is opposition MK Zandberg, the chair of the Meretz party, who wrote in a November 2017 Facebook post (Hebrew) that \u201cBlack Cube is part of an entire Israeli industry that exports the weapons, security know-how and training of Israeli security forces, and that crisscrosses the globe for dubious goals. We are aware of the involvement of Israelis in ethnic cleansing, persecution of citizens and spying on journalists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis shameful activity is made possible under the veil of extreme secretiveness justified by the prestigious halo of \u2018security.\u2019 But behind this veil we learn time after time there is just a lot of money that former generals are raking in at the expense of basic morality,\u201d she charged\n\nIn recent years, a shadowy spy-for-hire industry has sprung up in Israel, Dr. Avner Barnea, chairman of the Israeli Forum of Competitive Intelligence, told The Times of Israel in a phone interview, and it is giving legitimate Israeli companies a bad reputation.\n\nAlthough many of these firms describe what they do as business intelligence, it is anything but, he charged. \u201cCompetitive intelligence is completely different from the reported, alleged activity of companies like Black Cube and Psy-Group,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCompetitive intelligence is intelligence that companies need to make business decisions \u2014 whether to adopt a new technology, tweak their product or take other decisions to achieve and sustain competitive advantage. Our industry, through SCIP (the Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals Association), has a code of ethics and we never obtain information through illegal means or by impersonating someone we are not.\u201d\n\n\u2018No Israeli law enforcement\u2019\n\nBarnea described Black Cube, however, as a private investigation firm that, according to media reports, \u201cseeks out information that is not open source in a manner that is illegal. They impersonate people they are not, create fake websites, and use other dubious means.\u201d\n\n(Black Cube has denied any illegal activity, saying it \u201calways operates in full compliance of the law in every jurisdiction.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIn Israel it is against the law to impersonate someone else; you can face up to five years in prison for that,\u201d said Barnea. \u201cBut many of these companies do this.\u201d\n\nBlack Cube, said Barnea, applies the methods a state intelligence agency might use to combat terrorists or enemies to civilian life. Exacerbating the problem, said Barnea, is that Israeli police do nothing to curb this phenomenon. \u201cThere is no law enforcement in Israel, so companies can do anything they want,\u201d he said.\n\nIn November 2017, the Israeli Bureau of Private Investigators filed a complaint against Black Cube with the Israeli police, alleging that it was conducting private investigations without a license and gathering evidence, within Israel, using illegal means. Black Cube has denied the allegations.\n\nThe Times of Israel asked the Israel Police whether it was investigating Black Cube. A police spokesman replied that \u201cwe do not provide information about the existence or non-existence of police operations and we neither confirm nor deny that such operations are occurring.\u201d\n\nAsked why such intelligence companies for hire seem to have sprung up in Israel, Barnea replied, \u201cIsraelis learn some of these techniques in the army. Some Israel Defense Forces veterans are happy to share their expertise with people who pay them a lot of money. There is no law enforcement on the one hand, and a lot of money to be made on the other. \u201d"

    "text": "A veteran adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin says that Russia has abandoned its centuries-long hopes of integrating with the West and is bracing for a new era of geopolitical isolation.\n\nIn an article for Russia In Global Affairs magazine released on April 9 and titled The Solitude Of A Half-Blood, Kremlin aide Vladislav Surkov wrote that \"Russia's epic journey toward the West\" is over, marking an end to its \"repeated fruitless attempts to become a part of Western civilization\" over four centuries.\n\nRelations between Moscow and the West are at lows not seen since the Cold War, severely strained by issues including Russia's takeover of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, its role in Syria\u2019s seven-year conflict, and the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy in Britain last month.\n\nSurkov, 53, a longtime Putin aide who served as his top domestic-policy strategist for many years and currently works as the presidential adviser on Ukraine, wrote that the 2014 split with the West over Ukraine marked the beginning of a new era in which Russia faces \"100 years (200? 300?) of geopolitical solitude.\"\n\nRussia's seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in March 2014 and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine severely strained Moscow's ties with the West and led to U.S. and European Union sanctions that, together with a slump in global oil prices, sent the Russian economy into a two-year recession.\n\nThe Minsk accords, Western-backed cease-fire-and-peace deals signed in September 2014 and February 2015, have not ended the conflict in Ukraine's east, where fighting between government forces and separatists has killed more than 10,300 people.\n\nWith Russia's hopes of rapprochement growing dimmer as conflicts have flared with the West, the country is increasingly looking inward as well as eastward, rather than toward the West, Surkov said.\n\nHe cited the saying in Russia that the country has \"only two allies: the army and the navy.\"\n\n\"Solitude doesn't mean complete isolation,\" Surkov wrote, but he said Russia's openness would be limited in the future.\n\n\"Russia without doubt will engage in trade, attract investments, exchange know-how, and fight wars...compete and cooperate, cause fear, hatred, curiosity, sympathy, and admiration,\" Surkov wrote. \"But without false goals and self-denial.\"\n\nThe journey that Surkov said Russia had traveled to some degree mirrors the evolution of Putin's own outward attitude toward the West.\n\nPutin engaged with the West after his first election in 2000, but later grew increasingly critical of the United States, the EU, and NATO. He now frequently accuses them of shunning Moscow's offers of cooperation, fostering hostility, and trying to sideline and weaken Russia.\n\nSurkov's article was published three days after the United States imposed new sanctions on more than two dozen tycoons, security officials, and politicians thought to have close ties to Putin, in an attempt to punish Moscow for what the U.S. Treasury chief called \"malign activity around the globe.\"\n\nIt also followed rare criticism of Putin from U.S. President Donald Trump over Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nSurkov recalled what he said were futile attempts at Westernization by past Russian rulers, writing that Russia once attempted to imitate the United States and \"edge into the West.\"\n\nHe attributed Russia's fascination with joining the West to \"excessive enthusiasm\" by Russia's elite. But he said that fervor was now all but gone.\n\nSurkov, who was first deputy Kremlin chief of staff from 1999 to 2011, was the architect of \"managed democracy\" -- his term for a policy under which Putin tightened control over Russian politics and society in his first two terms, in 2000-08.\n\nHe has many interests outside or alongside politics and has written novels, essays, and song lyrics.\n\nIn the article, he describes Russia as a kind of \"mixed breed\" culture that incorporates elements of both the East and the West, like \"someone born of a mixed marriage.\"\n\n\"He is everyone's relative, but nobody's family. Treated by foreigners like one of their own, an outcast among his own people. He understands everyone and is understood by no one. A half-blood, a half-breed, a strange one,\" he wrote.\n\nHe said it was up to the Russian people whether Russia now becomes \"a loner in a backwater\" or \"an alpha nation that has surged into a big lead\" over other nations.\n\n\"It's going to be tough,\" he said, but Russia faces a long journey \"through the thorns to the stars.\"\n\n\"It'll be interesting,\" Surkov wrote. \"And there will be stars.\"\n\nWith reporting by AP and Interfax"

    "text": "The FBI and five other law enforcement and intelligence agencies have collaborated for months in an investigation into Russian attempts to influence the November election, including whether money from the Kremlin covertly aided President-elect Donald Trump, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe agencies involved in the inquiry are the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and representatives of the director of national intelligence, the sources said.\n\nInvestigators are examining how money may have moved from the Kremlin to covertly help Trump win, the two sources said. One of the allegations involves whether a system for routinely paying thousands of Russian-American pensioners may have been used to pay some email hackers in the United States or to supply money to intermediaries who would then pay the hackers, the two sources said.\n\nSHARE COPY LINK President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday delivered his first press conference since the November presidential election. Trump addressed his relationship with Russia and how he will handle his business once taking office.\n\nThe informal, inter-agency working group began to explore possible Russian interference last spring, long before the FBI received information from a former British spy hired to develop politically damaging and unverified research about Trump, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the inquiry.\n\nA key mission of the six-agency group has been to examine who financed the email hacks of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta.\n\nOn Jan. 6, the director of national intelligence released a declassified report that concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an influence campaign to \u201cundermine faith in the U.S. democratic process,\u201d damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s election prospects and bolster Trump\u2019s. The campaign included the hacking of top Democrats\u2019 emails and fake news distributed by Russian sources.\n\nThe president-elect, who will be inaugurated Friday, has said he believes Russia was involved with the hacking, and he has called allegations that he or his associates were involved a \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d and a \u201ccomplete and total fabrication.\u201d\n\nTrump has yet to say whether FBI Director James Comey will be retained. The rest of Trump\u2019s newly appointed intelligence and law enforcement chiefs will inherit the investigation, whose outcome could create national and international fallout.\n\nTrump's presidential transition team did not respond to a request for comment about the inquiry.\n\nRussia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017\n\nA key mission of the six-agency group has been to examine who financed the email hacks of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The London-based transparency group WikiLeaks released the emails last summer and in October.\n\nThe working group is scrutinizing the activities of a few Americans who were affiliated with Trump\u2019s campaign or his business empire and of multiple individuals from Russia and other former Soviet nations who had similar connections, the sources said.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies not only have been unanimous in blaming Russia for the hacking of Democrats\u2019 computers but also have concluded that the leaking and dissemination of thousands of emails of top Democrats, some of which caused headaches for the Clinton campaign, were done to help Trump win.\n\nTrump and Republican members of Congress have said they believe Russia meddled in the U.S. election but that those actions didn\u2019t change the outcome. However, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, a former chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that she believes that Russia\u2019s tactics did alter the election result.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee has opened its own investigation into Russia\u2019s involvement in the campaign. That panel will have subpoena power.\n\nOne of the allegations involves whether a system for routinely paying thousands of Russian-American pensioners may have been used to pay some email hackers in the United States or to intermediaries who would then pay the hackers, the two sources said.\n\nFBI Director Comey refused at a recent Senate hearing to comment on whether the bureau was investigating Russia\u2019s hacking campaign for possible criminal prosecutions. Spokespeople for the FBI, the Justice Department and the national intelligence director declined to comment.\n\nThe BBC reported last week that the joint inquiry was launched when the CIA learned last spring, through a Baltic ally, of a recording indicating the Russian government was planning to funnel funds aimed at influencing the U.S. election.\n\nAnother source of information was the former longtime British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, who was hired to gather opposition research about Trump for a Republican client and later a Democrat. Early last summer, Steele became alarmed about information he was receiving from a network of Russian sources describing a web of Trump\u2019s business relationships with wealthy Russians and alleged political ties to the Kremlin, according to two people who know him. These sources also declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nSteele\u2019s reports also alleged that Russian consulates in New York, Washington and Miami were used to deliver \u201ctens of thousands of dollars\u201d to Kremlin-hired operatives using fictitious names as if they were legitimate Russian-American pensioners. That \u201cruse\u201d was designed to give Russia \u201cplausible deniability,\u201d Steele\u2019s reports suggested. However, Russia does not operate a consulate in Miami.\n\nSteele, who had worked previously with the FBI and was well regarded, fed the bureau information in July and September suggesting collusion between Trump associates and Moscow in the hacking of Democratic computers, they said. Eventually, he met in Italy with an FBI official to share more information alleging that a top Trump campaign official had known about the hacking as early as last June, the sources said. About a month after the election, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona gave FBI Director Comey a copy of a 35-page compilation of Steele\u2019s reports.\n\nBuzzFeed posted the 35 pages of allegations online, acknowledging the report had obvious errors and had not been corroborated. Several news organizations, including McClatchy, had the document earlier but had resisted publishing any of the allegations because of the lack of verification.\n\nTrump and Putin have branded Steele\u2019s dossier as \u201cfake news.\u201d On Jan. 11, at his only news conference as president-elect, Trump dismissed it as \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201ccrap.\u201d On Tuesday, Putin accused soon-to-depart Obama administration officials of trying to undermine Trump\u2019s \u201clegitimacy,\u201d suggesting that the White House had released Steele\u2019s dossier. The Russian leader said those who had prepared the dossier were \u201cworse than prostitutes.\u201d\n\nSteele\u2019s information has been treated as unverified intelligence by the working group because most of it came from purported Kremlin leaks and virtually all of it is extremely difficult to corroborate, the people familiar with the investigation said.\n\nThe BBC reported that the FBI had obtained a warrant on Oct. 15 from the highly secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing investigators access to bank records and other documents about potential payments and money transfers related to Russia. One of McClatchy\u2019s sources confirmed the report.\n\nSusan Hennessey, a former attorney for the National Security Agency who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said she had no knowledge as to whether a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant had been issued in the investigation of Russian influence. However, she said such warrants were issued only if investigators could establish \u201cprobable cause\u201d that the target was a foreign power or its agent and that the surveillance was likely to produce foreign intelligence. She said the information in Steele\u2019s dossier couldn\u2019t have met that test.\n\n\u201cIf, in fact, law enforcement has obtained a FISA warrant, that is an indication that additional evidence exists outside of the dossier,\u201d she said.\n\nOne episode that Steele\u2019s reports described from multiple sources referred to a late-summer meeting in Prague between Russian government representatives and Michael Cohen, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, the president-elect\u2019s vast business operation. But the FBI has been unable to establish that Cohen was in Prague during that period, the two sources familiar with the working group said.\n\nCohen has denied ever traveling to the Czech Republic, although he told The Wall Street Journal that he did so in 2001.\n\nHaving a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only \"stupid\" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017\n\nFor months, Trump has voiced positive sentiments toward Putin. In early January, he tweeted that \u201conly \u2018stupid\u2019 people, or fools\u201d would think it\u2019s bad to have good relations with Russia.\n\n\u201cWhen I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!\u201d he tweeted last week.\n\nDuring the campaign in July, he displayed ignorance that Russian-backed separatists had invaded Crimea in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and he called on Russia to hack away to uncover thousands of emails that Clinton had never made public after using a private server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last July, Trump\u2019s campaign associates successfully changed the Republican Party\u2019s platform to weaken a provision advocating more military support for the Ukrainian government in its fight to defend itself against the Russian-backed incursion in Crimea.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the standard for obtaining a FISA warrant."

    ],
    "text": "Reporter\n\nGreg Miller is national security correspondent for The Washington Post, a winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the author of \u201cThe Apprentice: Trump, Russia and the Subversion of American Democracy.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t read intelligence reports and mixed up classified material with what he had seen in newspaper clips. He seemed confused about the structure and purpose of organizations and became overwhelmed when meetings covered multiple subjects. He blamed immigrants for nearly every societal problem and uttered racist sentiments with shocking callousness.\n\nThis isn\u2019t how President Trump is depicted in a new book by former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe. Instead, it\u2019s McCabe\u2019s account of what it was like to work for then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nThe FBI was better off when \u201cyou all only hired Irishmen,\u201d Sessions said in one diatribe about the bureau\u2019s workforce. \u201cThey were drunks but they could be trusted. Not like all those new people with nose rings and tattoos \u2014 who knows what they\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a startling portrait that suggests that the Trump administration\u2019s reputation for baseness and dysfunction has, if anything, been understated and too narrowly attributed to the president.\n\nThe description of Sessions is one of the most striking revelations in \u201cThe Threat,\u201d a memoir that adds to a rapidly expanding collection of score-settling insider accounts of Trump-era Washington. McCabe\u2019s is an important voice because of his position at the top of the bureau during a critical series of events, including the firing of FBI chief James Comey, the appointment of special counsel Robert S. Mueller, and the ensuing scorched-earth effort by Trump and his Republican allies to discredit the Russia probe and destroy public confidence in the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency. The work is insightful and occasionally provocative. The subtitle, \u201cHow the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump,\u201d all but equates the danger posed by al-Qaeda and the Islamic State to that of the current president.\n\nBut overall, the book isn\u2019t the comprehensive account McCabe was presumably capable of delivering. He seems reluctant to reveal details about his role in conflicts at key moments, rarely shedding meaningful new light on areas of the Trump-Russia-FBI timeline established by Mueller, news organizations and previous authors.\n\nMcCabe is a keen observer of detail, particularly when it comes to the president\u2019s pettiness. He describes how Trump arranges Oval Office encounters so that his advisers are forced to sit before him in \u201clittle schoolboy chairs\u201d across the Resolute Desk. Prior presidents met with aides on couches in the center of the room, but Trump is always angling to make others feel smaller.\n\nMcCabe was known as a taciturn figure in the bureau, in contrast to the more garrulous Comey. His book reflects that penchant for brevity, with just 264 pages of text. Even so, he documents the president\u2019s attempts to impair the Russia probe and his incessant attacks on the FBI, describing the stakes in sweeping, convincing language.\n\n\u201cBetween the world of chaos and the world of order stands the rule of law,\u201d McCabe writes. \u201cYet now the rule of law is under attack, including from the president himself.\u201d\n\nInevitably, the book includes disturbing new detail about Trump\u2019s subservience to Russian President Vladimir Putin. During an Oval Office briefing in July 2017, Trump refused to believe U.S. intelligence reports that North Korea had test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile \u2014 a test that Kim Jong Un had called a Fourth of July \u201cgift\u201d to \u201cthe arrogant Americans.\u201d\n\nTrump dismissed the missile launch as a \u201choax,\u201d McCabe writes. \u201cHe thought that North Korea did not have the capability to launch such missiles. He said he knew this because Vladimir Putin had told him so.\u201d\n\nMcCabe, of course, has some baggage that hurt the reputation he\u2019d built over 22 years at the bureau and raised questions about his credibility. He was accused by the FBI inspector general of making false statements about contacts with the media.\n\nMcCabe also has ample motivation to lash out at the president. He had been a target of Trump insults and taunts for nearly two years by the time he was fired, mainly because McCabe\u2019s wife, a pediatrician, had run for state office in Virginia with the financial backing of longtime Clinton ally and former governor Terry McAuliffe.\n\nTrump seized on the connection to insinuate that McCabe had stifled the bureau\u2019s probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2014 a claim debunked by internal FBI investigations. Trump seems never to have let go of the issue, even as he dangled the FBI director job before McCabe, sneering in one conversation that it \u201cmust have been really tough\u201d when McCabe\u2019s wife lost her race. \u201cTo lose,\u201d Trump said, driving the dagger further. \u201cTo be a loser.\u201d\n\nWhen McCabe was finally forced out, it was in the most petty fashion possible. He was fired just 26 hours before his own self-declared retirement date. Trump was gleeful. \u201cAndrew McCabe FIRED,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cA great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.\u201d\n\nBut for all of the understandable alarm and indignation that McCabe registers, he seems, like other Trump dissidents, never to have found reason or opportunity to stand up to the president. There are paragraphs in \u201cThe Threat\u201d that recount in detail McCabe\u2019s inner outrage \u2014 but no indication that those thoughts escaped his lips in the presence of Trump.\n\nWhat is it that makes otherwise proud public servants, Comey included, willing to subject themselves to Trump-inflicted indignities? Deference to the office? A determination to cling to power? A view of oneself as an indispensable institutional savior? At one point, McCabe puts his odds of getting the FBI director\u2019s position at \u201cone-in-ten-million,\u201d but he goes through a job interview with Trump that feels like a charade from the outset.\n\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of \u201cThe Threat\u201d is that it steers around scenes where McCabe might have provided more detail or insight. He is known to have had a series of tense interactions with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the aftermath of Comey\u2019s firing, each suspicious of his counterpart and convinced that the other should recuse himself from the Russia probe.\n\nMcCabe was also witness to secret conversations in which Rosenstein raised the possibility that officials should wear a wire in meetings with the president. You won\u2019t learn about any of that in \u201cThe Threat.\u201d\n\nMcCabe skims over the conduct of two of his FBI subordinates, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, whose text exchanges during an illicit affair included disparaging remarks about Trump and, when they were later revealed, fueled doubts about the organization\u2019s impartiality.\n\nWhen first confronted with the details of the Page-Strzok texts, McCabe was asked by the inspector general whether he knew that Page \u2014 his closest legal adviser \u2014 had had interactions with the press. McCabe said he didn\u2019t, though in fact he had authorized those contacts. In the book, he downplays that false testimony as a momentary mental lapse during a confusing conversation \u2014 which sounds a lot like the excuses offered by countless defendants who find themselves being prosecuted by the FBI for lying.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s disdain for Trump is rivaled only by his contempt for Sessions. He questions the former attorney general\u2019s mental faculties, saying that he had \u201ctrouble focusing, particularly when topics of conversation strayed from a small number of issues.\u201d\n\nLogs on the electronic tablets used to deliver the President\u2019s Daily Brief to Sessions came back with no indication he had ever punched in the passcode. The attorney general\u2019s views on race and religion are described as reprehensible.\n\nSessions \u201cbelieved that Islam \u2014 inherently \u2014 advocated extremism\u201d and ceaselessly sought to draw connections between crime and immigration. \u201cWhere\u2019s he from?\u201d was his first question about a suspect. The next: \u201cWhere are his parents from?\u201d\n\nMcCabe notes that he would like to \u201csay much more\u201d about his firing and questions of his candor toward other bureau officials, but that he is restrained from doing so because he is pursuing a lawsuit.\n\nThere is one area, however, in which he is considerably more forthcoming than Comey. He acknowledges that the bureau made major miscalculations in its handling of the Clinton probe in 2016 and its decision to discuss it publicly.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of policy, the FBI does everything possible not to influence elections,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn 2016, it seems we did.\u201d"

    "text": "The National Rifle Association\u2019s spokeswoman Dana Loesch denied that the organization had either received any significant money from Russia, or funneled that money into the Republican Party, in an exchange with this reporter on Twitter.\n\nMs. Loesch had gone on NRA TV to pour scorn on Claude Taylor, the Democratic activist whose \u2018Mad Dog Pac\u2019 funds billboards that counter Republican collusion with the Russian state. The PAC is among the first in American history to be founded and funded by ordinary people. Mr. Taylor is not a rich man; rather, he is a freelance photographer who volunteered at the Clinton White House and who, since 2017, has reported on Russia and Trump as a citizen journalist; I have co-authored three stories with him on Patribotics. Taylor and I broke the news that Donald Trump was under a sealed indictment last spring.\n\nAfter Ms. Loesch broadcast on NRA TV that Claude Taylor had named Mad Dog Pac after an alcoholic drink he has never heard of, I told her that Taylor had actually named the PAC for General Mattis, the non-partisan Marine Corps legend whose nickname is \u2018Mad Dog\u2019. Mr. Mattis is the Secretary of Defense under Donald Trump, and was reportedly considered by the Hillary Clinton campaign as a Vice President.\n\nLoesch then engaged me in a series of tweets which I reproduce below. Substantively, she denied outright that the National Rifle Association had received any money at all from Russia, aside from, as she put it, \u201c$2500 in expat dues\u201c.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nShe also denied that the NRA had sponsored Sheriff Dave Clarke\u2019s trip to Moscow, taken in December of 2015.\n\nOn April 17th, the NRA admitted to a handful of Russian contributors but stated the amount received totaled only $2500. Ten days later, CNN reported that the organization was \u201cbracing for an investigation\u201d over its funding via the Kremlin-linked banker Alexander Torshin, and was preserving documents. In January of this year, McClatchy DC\u2019s widely respected national security reporters Peter Stone and Greg Gordon said the FBI was investigating whether Torshin laundered Russian money through the NRA to assist Donald Trump and Republican candidates:\n\nThe FBI is investigating whether a top Russian banker with ties to the Kremlin illegally funneled money to the National Rifle Association to help Donald Trump win the presidency, two sources familiar with the matter have told McClatchy. FBI counterintelligence investigators have focused on the activities of Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of Russia\u2019s central bank who is known for his close relationships with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and the NRA, the sources said. It is illegal to use foreign money to influence federal elections.\n\nThe NRA trebled its support to Trump and Republicans in the last cycle versus to Mitt Romney in the prior Presidential cycle. The total of $55m it donated was given \u201cby an arm of the NRA not required to disclose its donors\u201d, Stone and Gordon reported.\n\nMs. Loesch also denied that the NRA\u2019s delegation to Moscow, which included Dave Clarke, was \u201cofficial\u201d. The trip was funded by Russia\u2019s state propaganda channel Russia Today, since required to register as agents of the Russian state under FARA by the DOJ. It included senior officials from the NRA and took place at the same time as General Mike Flynn and Jill Stein\u2019s dinner with Putin. The NY Daily News reported:\n\nTorshin is a longtime associate of the group and attended annual meetings for years, including its 2016 convention where he met with Trump Jr. and reportedly tried to set up a meeting with the candidate himself.\n\nHe also has his own Russian gun rights group and met with a delegation from the pro-gun lobbying group in late 2015, a party that included Trump-supporting former sheriff David Clarke.\n\nThe trip, which included meetings with a host of Russian government and business figures, coincided with former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s own trip to Moscow, which was paid for by state broadcaster RT.\n\nMs. Loesch\u2019s exchange with me is reproduced below:\n\n\"@maddogpac? You named your PAC after a liquor. This whole thing was started by some dude named Claude (@TrueFactsStated) who wears tortoise shell glasses\u2026Does he also own the @Crocs company? He's like the male version of Amy Poehler's I'm a Cool Mom from Mean Girls.\" \u2014@DLoesch pic.twitter.com/eNEDbFygsl \u2014 NRATV (@NRATV) June 2, 2018\n\nOh please, a group that holds the same position as Russia on gun rights. Get your house in order before starting drama elsewhere you silly person. \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) June 2, 2018\n\nThe conversation continued:\n\nLM: Oh please, Dana. You stopped caring about defending Constitutional rights when you sold the US government to the highest bidder; the Kremlin. Tell us, if Russia is so strict and oppressive with guns, why did you take so much of their money and launder it into the GOP, @ DLoesch?\n\n\u2026 You anti-gun folks sure are super sensitive and violent. LM: I\u2019m not anti-gun, in the right hands. I\u2019m anti-traitor. # NationalRussiaAssociation DL: You\u2019re anti-gun. LM: If you are referring to Christopher Steele, you can say his name; his work seems to have got you triggered. Can you tell us if @ NRA received Russian money and instructions from @ DeripaskaOleg on @ SheriffClarke\u2018s trip to Moscow, which you funded? DL: You\u2019re the one terribly triggered, all because of a few seconds of my commentary. I certainly was effective! I answered your question, but it wasn\u2019t what you wanted to hear \u00af\\_( \u30c4)_/\u00af LM: Dana, you\u2019re a spokeswoman for @ NRA. When we ask why \u201cyou\u201d laundered money into the @ GOP from Russia, we are asking about the NRA. I\u2019m asking you in your professional capacity as their spokeswoman. You\u2019re denying it for yourself? I asked about @ NRA. Answer the question, ma\u2019am\n\nDL: I answered several Tweets ago. Learn to read, ma\u2019am. Again, it wasn\u2019t what you wanted to hear so pretend it wasn\u2019t answered. So triggered.\n\nLM: No ma\u2019am, I asked if the NRA laundered money and you said \u201cI didn\u2019t\u201d. Nobody asked if you personally did. Did the National Rifle Association \u2013 not you personally \u2013 launder Russian money into the GOP? Answer the question. Ducking it is unbecoming to a markswoman.\n\nDL: My answer wasn\u2019t just for me. Are you one of those redacted names Fusion paid to push their Kremlin-sourced smears? I\u2019ve always wondered \u2026\n\nLM: Chris Steele isn\u2019t Fusion. His firm is called Orbis Business Intelligence. So you deny the @ NRA washed Russian money into @ GOP? Thanks for the answer, that\u2019s on the record. PS: The NRA seem scared of MI6. That\u2019s probably wise. # TrumpRussia\n\nDL: You deny that Fusion hired Steele? Or that he was later paid by a Feinstein staffer?\n\nDL : Right, as I said, they hired him. Everything is public and addressed, easily found with a simple online search \u2014 as fun as it is to pretend otherwise. As for Clarke, he never went on any official trip. Any other of your kooky anti-gun resistance theory questions, Louise?\n\nLM : So, Dana, as you say it wasn\u2019t an \u201cofficial\u201d trip and you\u2019ve only received $2500 from Russia, can you tell us why @ NRA is preserving records on its interactions with Alexander Torshin, the Putin-linked banker? Are you under law enforcement investigation?\n\nAt time of writing, Ms. Loesch had no further response. I will update the piece should she add any further denials or other comments on behalf of the NRA.\n\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible. Your support will help us to break more stories on Trump and Russia in 2018. Please consider a donation here."

    "authors": [
      "Louise Mensch"
    ],
    "text": "Earlier this week, Buzzfeed published a large number of emails relating to the Trump Tower Moscow deal that Donald Trump was trying to set up with Michael Cohen. Parts of them had been published before in the New York Times, but the completeness of this dump was certainly new. The online publication also provided a useful timeline at the side of its story.\n\nIt seems relatively clear that Felix Sater himself was a source, if not the source, on this story. An enormous number of emails were addressed to or from him, something that the publication does not seek to hide, choosing to redact only actual email addresses and phone numbers in many cases. The story did not get as much traction online as you might expect, a consequence perhaps both of the Office of the Special Counsel correcting its authors earlier assertion that it was in possession of apparently non-existent documents showing that Donald Trump ordered Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. One of the authors, Anthony Cormier, denied having personally seen these documents, whereas his co-author Jason Leopold said that they had both seen them. Cormier declined to explain when the discrepancy was put to him on \u2018Reliable Sources\u2019 and the anchor, Brian Stelter, did not follow up or press him on the point. This inconsistent explanation for the reporting, which was followed by mass firings at Buzzfeed, may have dampened reactions to what should have been another ostensibly huge story.\n\nThe social media hive mind pounced on the undisclosed elements of the releases, which involve VTB and, I suggest, implicate VEB \u2018off stage\u2019. But the lack of amazement, of celebration of Sater as a \u2018whistleblower\u2019, will not have pleased him. Surely Mr. Sater felt the need to get these documents out there \u2013 and to a friendly news site.\n\nFelix Sater\u2019s Relationship With Buzzfeed\n\nUnlike the controversial article which was corrected by Bob Mueller, where only Leopold claimed the authors saw the alleged documents at its heart, a story which can be mostly ascribed, therefore, to Leopold, Felix Sater is principally Anthony Cormier\u2019s friend and source. The pair\u2019s story \u201cTrump Moscow: The Definitive Story of How Trump\u2019s Team Worked The Russian Deal During The Campaign\u201d has a URL that shows it was filed by Cormier. Cormier is bylined on a frankly ridiculous story that seeks to defend Felix Sater as, get this, an \u2018American spy.\u2019\n\nIn the sprawling Trump-Russia investigation, one name constantly pops up: Felix Sater. In story after story, Sater is described as Donald Trump\u2019s former business partner, a convicted stock swindler who was born in the Soviet Union, worked in Russia, tried to win Trump a deal in Moscow, and even helped broker a Ukrainian peace plan that Vladimir Putin would have loved.\n\nBasically, he\u2019s portrayed as something just short of a Russian spy.\n\nEffectively, he has been a spy \u2014 but for the United States.\n\nThis is an hilariously bad piece of \u2018trust washing\u2019 that attempts to convince the public that the man who was conspiring with Putin to elect Trump, in his own words, is somehow one of the good guys. Sater was an FBI asset, a \u2018dangle\u2019 , never a spy. He bombastically, and falsely, stated that he caught Osama Bin Laden. But Cormier\u2019s was not the only piece of \u2018trust washing\u2019 on Sater. A concerted PR effort can be seen, without too much trouble, when one reviews other pieces trying to sanitize this two-bit mobster; they all follow the same lines: \u2018Hey, did you know that Felix Sater was an informant for the FBI?\u201d The conspiracy theorists Who What Why, a website run by Russ Baker, a man that said the Bushes did 9/11, have been desperately trying to spin for Sater, and at the same time, make the case that the fact he once informed for the FBI not only gives Sater a pass, but actually stops Mueller from prosecuting Trump. Just after Comey was fired in May of 2017, Baker published a story entitled \u201cWHY FBI CAN\u2019T TELL ALL ON TRUMP, RUSSIA\u201d, which tried to make the case that\n\nthe FBI\u2019s Russia investigation was compromised because it could interfere with the Bureau\u2019s objective of fighting organized crime originating in the former Soviet Union Sure, Jan\n\n\n\n\n\nand all because of Felix Sater, whom Who What Why then tried to whitewash in many more articles, always making the case that because the FBI trusted him once, he was somehow now inviolate. Sater pitched the line that he was a sacred, untouchable FBI informant to other outlets \u2013 who were, thankfully, more skeptical than Buzzfeed or Who What Why. The LA Times said for example that:\n\nSater\u2019s lawyer, Robert W. Wolf, gives his client more credit, saying he worked with \u201cnumerous U.S. national security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\u201d Sater says he helped hunt \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest enemies\u201d in Afghanistan and elsewhere. There is no independent verification of those assertions. Former CIA officials who worked in counter-terrorism and Russian affairs said they never heard of Sater and doubt his cloak-and-dagger claims of chasing down terrorists.\n\nSater laid relatively quiet after his triumphant Buzzfeed hagiography. Anthony Cormier, its author, had, without declaring it in the article, taken Mr. Sater out socializing to drinks and dinner parties in Manhattan before it was published. For Felix Sater, this partying appeared to be part of a strategy to use the media as his defense.\n\nSater was photographed hanging out with Sarah Ferguson in Australia, who did an exculpatory TV interview and wrote this nonsensical piece falsely characterizing Sater as an enemy of Trump\n\nSater did seem absolutely determined to ensure he was falsely portrayed as a cooperating witness, as a friend to the media and liberal establishments. Sater tried to get himself photographed hanging out with as many of the \u2018resistor\u2019 and media elite as possible.\n\nThank you Adam Davidson for inviting me to participate on your panel at New Yorker Festival, with great guests Ruth Marcus, David Barstow, and Michael Avenatti.\n\n\u2066@NewYorkerFest\u2069 \u2066@adamdavidson\u2069 \u2066@RuthMarcus\u2069 \u2066@DavidBarstow\u2069 \u2066@MichaelAvenatti\u2069 pic.twitter.com/l5QBJSqNLA \u2014 Felix Sater (@felixsater) October 7, 2018\n\nOnline, Sater boasted of his links to journalism and was, inexplicably, invited to speak at multiple journalism schools. His exchanges with this reporter were less cordial. When I pointed out to some of the alt-left whom they were hanging out with, Mr. Sater sent me a link to to the Buzzfeed piece authored by his social partner Mr. Cormier who had taken Sater to the dinner party. we were discussing.\n\nWith, er, Bill Clinton\n\nWith Gloria Allred\n\nWith a journalist from Australia\u2019s \u2018Four Corners\u2019 who wrote pieces and did interviews defending Sater\n\nWith Rachel Maddow\n\nWith the alt-left, pro Russia journalist David K Lion\n\nYahoo Broke the Trump Tower Moscow Story\n\nIt seems not unreasonable then to assume that the vast dumps of emails on Trump Tower came not from \u2018investigative journalism\u2019 but simply from Sater handing them over to be published by a friendly outlet. Cormier and Leopold received a great many plaudits for their story in May 2018, the \u201cdefinitive story\u201d of Trump Tower Moscow. In retrospect, however, the story was indeed definitive and exhaustive merely because Sater had given them his emails. The story, however, was not at all broken by Leopold and Cormier. The news that Trump Tower Moscow had gone on longer than admitted by Donald Trump or Michael Cohen was broken in an exclusive report by Yahoo News\u2019 Hunter Walker and Brett Arnold on May 16th.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nThe next day, Felix Sater dumped on their exclusive by giving the actual documents to Buzzfeed. It is clear from the Walker-Arnold piece that Sater admitted to them the documents existed, but only after they learned of their existence from multiple sources in Congress. The authors say Sater \u201cconfirmed\u201d to them what they had already learned through their reporting. It\u2019s also clear that they did not have possession of the emails.\n\nMultiple sources have described to Yahoo News the texts and emails with Cohen that Sater has provided to the government. Sater confirmed to Yahoo News that he provided all of his texts and emails with Cohen to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team as well as to the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate\u2019s Intelligence and Judiciary committees.\n\nThe emails and texts described to Yahoo News, which have not previously been made public\n\nAfter Yahoo\u2019s Walker and Arnold broke the news of these documents, Mr. Sater, who whatever his other shortcomings appears to have a flair for PR, worked with Cormier and Leopold so they could publish their much longer \u201cdefinitive\u201d Trump Tower Moscow piece. In retrospect, it is clear that this piece was based on Sater simply handing over his emails to the journalists. They quote extensively from them. Cormier and Leopold made a deeply ungenerous reference to Walker and Arnold\u2019s breaking of the news in their prologue:\n\nWhile fragments of the Trump Moscow venture have trickled out \u2014 most recently in a report last night by Yahoo News \u2014 this is the definitive story of the Moscow tower\n\nThe authors then attempt to pretend that their sources were \u2018two FBI agents\u2019 while not admitting that their actual source was, quite simply, their friend Felix Sater, who\u2019d given them the documents whose existence Walker and Arnold had discovered through independent, investigative reporting. It is important at this moment to understand that even while Sater was partying with the left and positioning himself as a media player, he was, throughout, shilling for Donald Trump and denying collusion with Russia. His actions were designed to damage, not support, Mueller\u2019s investigation. At the Manhattan dinner party to which Anthony Cormier took him, Sater posed with a bottle of wine labeled \u201cCollusion\u201d (yes, really) that he described as being \u201cweak, like the investigation\u201d. When he jumped into my conversation with somebody else and I replied \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you, traitor,\u201d Mr. Sater sent me a meme of a therapist asking an insane patient \u201cIs the Russian collusion in the room with us\u2026 right now?\u201d\n\nSater poses with a bottle of wine called \u2018Collusion\u2019\n\nWhen the independent journalist Wendy Siegelman noted Sater\u2019s intense PR blitz, Sater replied with a triumphant meme of Leonardo di Caprio \u2018So much more to come\u2019.\n\nWhat's the word for PR masquerading as news? Advertorial? the @felixsater media blitz continues in full force https://t.co/cCLS0t1SNT \u2014 Wendy Siegelman (@WendySiegelman) June 7, 2018\n\nWhy then is Mr. Sater now choosing to have all his emails published in such meticulous detail? The earlier \u201cdefinitive Trump Moscow\u201d story he sourced got most of the substance out. What could be the hurry now in terms of making sure every email sees the light of day?\n\nDoes Mueller\u2019s Mystery Case Involve Trump\u2019s RICO Indictment, and is Sater Running Scared?\n\nIn a previous article, I laid out the runners and riders for the Mueller \u2018mystery witness\u2019 case, where my own bet is that the subject is VEB. Whether I am right or wrong, Mr. Sater may agree with me that the subject is a Russian bank. Here are some things we can say for certain:\n\nThe case is very important, receiving certiorari in the Supreme Court \u2013 although clearly that may mean that the point of law, rather than the actors involved, are important The case impacts national security and is likely to involve important actors because, distinct from the \u2018importance via certiorari\u2019 point, the courthouse authorities took extraordinary steps to conceal the identity of the appellant from reporters The \u2018mystery case\u2019 entity and associated amicus briefs are, by definition, not the subject of this specific Mueller case. Mr. Mueller is trying to subpoena a witness in his case. The sovereign financial entity is not accused of a crime in this case. Its data, that it is resisting handing over, is merely \u2018witness evidence\u2019 to the crime committed by the completely unknown target of the case.\n\nPatribotics has reported exclusively that Donald Trump is personally indicted, under seal, on RICO charges along with Felix Sater, the Trump Organization and Bayrock.\n\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible. If you can help us, please donate.\n\nIs it possible that VEB, the state-run entity, is being subpoenaed for records that relate to some of Felix Sater\u2019s funders on the Trump Organization-Bayrock deal? VEB might have records on transfers made to VTB, the commercial Russian bank involved in the Bayrock deal; or to Sergei Kislyak, whom, Felix Sater\u2019s chosen messenger Jason Leopold reported,\n\nThe first Trump sealed indictment, I exclusively reported, had its genesis in a state Enterprise Corruption case from Eric Schneiderman, when he was the Attorney General of New York, I also reported that Schneiderman had had Trump Tower under state surveillance for well over a year \u2013 something that would not require a FISA warrant for AG Schneiderman to do. I reported, still further, that Paul Manafort, who promised \u2018cooperation\u2019 with the FBI before allowing a \u2018by consent\u2019 search of his apartment at Trump Tower, had lied to the FBI about what was there, cleaning out his apartment in advance and removing items to Florida.\n\nBloomberg reported with a clear-eyed view on Sater, Bayrock and Trump:\n\nIn that context, a troubling history of Trump\u2019s dealings with Russians exists outside of Russia: in a dormant real-estate development firm, the Bayrock Group, which once operated just two floors beneath the president\u2019s own office in Trump Tower.\n\nBayrock partnered with the future president and his two eldest children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, on a series of real-estate deals between 2002 and about 2011, the most prominent being the troubled Trump Soho hotel and condominium in Manhattan.\n\nDuring the years that Bayrock and Trump did deals together, the company was also a bridge between murky European funding and a number of projects in the U.S. to which the president once lent his name in exchange for handsome fees. Icelandic banks that dealt with Bayrock, for example, were easy marks for money launderers and foreign influence, according to interviews with government investigators, legislators, and others in Reykjavik, Brussels, Paris and London. Trump testified under oath in a 2007 deposition that Bayrock brought Russian investors to his Trump Tower office to discuss deals in Moscow, and said he was pondering investing there.\n\nOne of Bayrock\u2019s principals was a career criminal named Felix Sater who had ties to Russian and American organized crime groups. Before linking up with the company and with Trump, he had worked as a mob informant for the U.S. government, fled to Moscow to avoid criminal charges while boasting of his KGB and Kremlin contacts there, and had gone to prison for slashing apart another man\u2019s face with a broken cocktail glass.\n\nIn a series of interviews and a lawsuit, a former Bayrock insider, Jody Kriss, claims that he eventually departed from the firm because he became convinced that Bayrock was actually a front for money laundering.\n\nLet us then cross-reference this with some other facts. Has Mr. Sater got wind that, no matter how many public relations pieces he places with Buzzfeed or Newsweek, US intelligence does not regard him as \u201cAn American Spy\u201d and is about to unseal charges on him, personally, for RICO? My reporting is that the first sealed indictment on Donald Trump as a person is for RICO, that the Trump Organization is indicted as a corrupt organization, and that the specific case was that of Felix Sater and Bayrock. Sater\u2019s motivation might then have been to warn his masters in Russia of some of what Mueller has on them; or to lobby Trump for a pardon. This money laundering by Sater and Trump with the Trump Organization pre-dated the election campaign of 2016. But the pre-Mueller, personal indictment of Donald Trump, granted while he was President of the United States, \u2013 jointly reported here by myself and Claude Taylor, and the fact that this indictment was for RICO with Mr. Sater, Bayrock and the Trump Organization \u2013 a story to this reporter alone \u2013 has dominated debate long after that election. A terrified Mr. Sater now appears to be trying to hurt Bob Mueller\u2019s other cases with disclosures and to be lobbying Trump for a pardon he cannot give at the same time. This is not the sound of whistleblowing; it is the sound of a stuck pig, squealing.\n\nFelix Sater, like Carter Page, is desperate to disqualify the FISA warrants that covered Alfa Bank, Carter Page and Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here .

An enormous number of emails were addressed to or from him, something that the publication does not seek to hide, choosing to redact only actual email addresses and phone numbers in many cases. The story did not get as much traction online as you might expect, a consequence perhaps both of the Office of the Special Counsel correcting its authors earlier assertion that it was in possession of apparently non-existent documents showing that Donald Trump ordered Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. One of the authors, Anthony Cormier, denied having personally seen these documents, whereas his co-author Jason Leopold said that they had both seen them. Cormier declined to explain when the discrepancy was put to him on \u2018Reliable Sources\u2019 and the anchor, Brian Stelter, did not follow up or press him on the point. This inconsistent explanation for the reporting, which was followed by mass firings at Buzzfeed, may have dampened reactions to what should have been another ostensibly huge story.\n\nThe social media hive mind pounced on the undisclosed elements of the releases, which involve VTB and, I suggest, implicate VEB \u2018off stage\u2019. But the lack of amazement, of celebration of Sater as a \u2018whistleblower\u2019, will not have pleased him. Surely Mr. Sater felt the need to get these documents out there \u2013 and to a friendly news site.\n\nFelix Sater\u2019s Relationship With Buzzfeed\n\nUnlike the controversial article which was corrected by Bob Mueller, where only Leopold claimed the authors saw the alleged documents at its heart, a story which can be mostly ascribed, therefore, to Leopold, Felix Sater is principally Anthony Cormier\u2019s friend and source. The pair\u2019s story \u201cTrump Moscow: The Definitive Story of How Trump\u2019s Team Worked The Russian Deal During The Campaign\u201d has a URL that shows it was filed by Cormier. Cormier is bylined on a frankly ridiculous story that seeks to defend Felix Sater as, get this, an \u2018American spy.\u2019\n\nIn the sprawling Trump-Russia investigation, one name constantly pops up: Felix Sater. In story after story, Sater is described as Donald Trump\u2019s former business partner, a convicted stock swindler who was born in the Soviet Union, worked in Russia, tried to win Trump a deal in Moscow, and even helped broker a Ukrainian peace plan that Vladimir Putin would have loved.\n\nBasically, he\u2019s portrayed as something just short of a Russian spy.\n\nEffectively, he has been a spy \u2014 but for the United States.\n\nThis is an hilariously bad piece of \u2018trust washing\u2019 that attempts to convince the public that the man who was conspiring with Putin to elect Trump, in his own words, is somehow one of the good guys. Sater was an FBI asset, a \u2018dangle\u2019 , never a spy. He bombastically, and falsely, stated that he caught Osama Bin Laden. But Cormier\u2019s was not the only piece of \u2018trust washing\u2019 on Sater. A concerted PR effort can be seen, without too much trouble, when one reviews other pieces trying to sanitize this two-bit mobster; they all follow the same lines: \u2018Hey, did you know that Felix Sater was an informant for the FBI?\u201d The conspiracy theorists Who What Why, a website run by Russ Baker, a man that said the Bushes did 9/11, have been desperately trying to spin for Sater, and at the same time, make the case that the fact he once informed for the FBI not only gives Sater a pass, but actually stops Mueller from prosecuting Trump. Just after Comey was fired in May of 2017, Baker published a story entitled \u201cWHY FBI CAN\u2019T TELL ALL ON TRUMP, RUSSIA\u201d, which tried to make the case that\n\nthe FBI\u2019s Russia investigation was compromised because it could interfere with the Bureau\u2019s objective of fighting organized crime originating in the former Soviet Union Sure, Jan\n\n\n\n\n\nand all because of Felix Sater, whom Who What Why then tried to whitewash in many more articles, always making the case that because the FBI trusted him once, he was somehow now inviolate. Sater pitched the line that he was a sacred, untouchable FBI informant to other outlets \u2013 who were, thankfully, more skeptical than Buzzfeed or Who What Why. The LA Times said for example that:\n\nSater\u2019s lawyer, Robert W. Wolf, gives his client more credit, saying he worked with \u201cnumerous U.S. national security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\u201d Sater says he helped hunt \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest enemies\u201d in Afghanistan and elsewhere. There is no independent verification of those assertions. Former CIA officials who worked in counter-terrorism and Russian affairs said they never heard of Sater and doubt his cloak-and-dagger claims of chasing down terrorists.\n\nSater laid relatively quiet after his triumphant Buzzfeed hagiography. Anthony Cormier, its author, had, without declaring it in the article, taken Mr. Sater out socializing to drinks and dinner parties in Manhattan before it was published. For Felix Sater, this partying appeared to be part of a strategy to use the media as his defense.\n\nSater was photographed hanging out with Sarah Ferguson in Australia, who did an exculpatory TV interview and wrote this nonsensical piece falsely characterizing Sater as an enemy of Trump\n\nSater did seem absolutely determined to ensure he was falsely portrayed as a cooperating witness, as a friend to the media and liberal establishments. Sater tried to get himself photographed hanging out with as many of the \u2018resistor\u2019 and media elite as possible.\n\nOnline, Sater boasted of his links to journalism and was, inexplicably, invited to speak at multiple journalism schools. His exchanges with this reporter were less cordial. When I pointed out to some of the alt-left whom they were hanging out with, Mr. Sater sent me a link to to the Buzzfeed piece authored by his social partner Mr. Cormier who had taken Sater to the dinner party. we were discussing.\n\nWith, er, Bill Clinton\n\nWith Gloria Allred\n\nWith a journalist from Australia\u2019s \u2018Four Corners\u2019 who wrote pieces and did interviews defending Sater\n\nWith Rachel Maddow\n\nWith the alt-left, pro Russia journalist David K Lion\n\nYahoo Broke the Trump Tower Moscow Story\n\nIt seems not unreasonable then to assume that the vast dumps of emails on Trump Tower came not from \u2018investigative journalism\u2019 but simply from Sater handing them over to be published by a friendly outlet. Cormier and Leopold received a great many plaudits for their story in May 2018, the \u201cdefinitive story\u201d of Trump Tower Moscow. In retrospect, however, the story was indeed definitive and exhaustive merely because Sater had given them his emails. The story, however, was not at all broken by Leopold and Cormier. The news that Trump Tower Moscow had gone on longer than admitted by Donald Trump or Michael Cohen was broken in an exclusive report by Yahoo News\u2019 Hunter Walker and Brett Arnold on May 16th.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nThe next day, Felix Sater dumped on their exclusive by giving the actual documents to Buzzfeed. It is clear from the Walker-Arnold piece that Sater admitted to them the documents existed, but only after they learned of their existence from multiple sources in Congress. The authors say Sater \u201cconfirmed\u201d to them what they had already learned through their reporting. It\u2019s also clear that they did not have possession of the emails.\n\nMultiple sources have described to Yahoo News the texts and emails with Cohen that Sater has provided to the government. Sater confirmed to Yahoo News that he provided all of his texts and emails with Cohen to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team as well as to the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate\u2019s Intelligence and Judiciary committees.\n\nThe emails and texts described to Yahoo News, which have not previously been made public\n\nAfter Yahoo\u2019s Walker and Arnold broke the news of these documents, Mr. Sater, who whatever his other shortcomings appears to have a flair for PR, worked with Cormier and Leopold so they could publish their much longer \u201cdefinitive\u201d Trump Tower Moscow piece. In retrospect, it is clear that this piece was based on Sater simply handing over his emails to the journalists. They quote extensively from them. Cormier and Leopold made a deeply ungenerous reference to Walker and Arnold\u2019s breaking of the news in their prologue:\n\nWhile fragments of the Trump Moscow venture have trickled out \u2014 most recently in a report last night by Yahoo News \u2014 this is the definitive story of the Moscow tower\n\nThe authors then attempt to pretend that their sources were \u2018two FBI agents\u2019 while not admitting that their actual source was, quite simply, their friend Felix Sater, who\u2019d given them the documents whose existence Walker and Arnold had discovered through independent, investigative reporting. It is important at this moment to understand that even while Sater was partying with the left and positioning himself as a media player, he was, throughout, shilling for Donald Trump and denying collusion with Russia. His actions were designed to damage, not support, Mueller\u2019s investigation. At the Manhattan dinner party to which Anthony Cormier took him, Sater posed with a bottle of wine labeled \u201cCollusion\u201d (yes, really) that he described as being \u201cweak, like the investigation\u201d. When he jumped into my conversation with somebody else and I replied \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you, traitor,\u201d Mr. Sater sent me a meme of a therapist asking an insane patient \u201cIs the Russian collusion in the room with us\u2026 right now?\u201d\n\nSater poses with a bottle of wine called \u2018Collusion\u2019\n\nWhen the independent journalist Wendy Siegelman noted Sater\u2019s intense PR blitz, Sater replied with a triumphant meme of Leonardo di Caprio \u2018So much more to come\u2019.\n\nWhy then is Mr. Sater now choosing to have all his emails published in such meticulous detail? The earlier \u201cdefinitive Trump Moscow\u201d story he sourced got most of the substance out. What could be the hurry now in terms of making sure every email sees the light of day?\n\nDoes Mueller\u2019s Mystery Case Involve Trump\u2019s RICO Indictment, and is Sater Running Scared?\n\nIn a previous article, I laid out the runners and riders for the Mueller \u2018mystery witness\u2019 case, where my own bet is that the subject is VEB. Whether I am right or wrong, Mr. Sater may agree with me that the subject is a Russian bank. Here are some things we can say for certain:\n\nThe case is very important, receiving certiorari in the Supreme Court \u2013 although clearly that may mean that the point of law, rather than the actors involved, are important The case impacts national security and is likely to involve important actors because, distinct from the \u2018importance via certiorari\u2019 point, the courthouse authorities took extraordinary steps to conceal the identity of the appellant from reporters The \u2018mystery case\u2019 entity and associated amicus briefs are, by definition, not the subject of this specific Mueller case. Mr. Mueller is trying to subpoena a witness in his case. The sovereign financial entity is not accused of a crime in this case. Its data, that it is resisting handing over, is merely \u2018witness evidence\u2019 to the crime committed by the completely unknown target of the case.\n\nPatribotics has reported exclusively that Donald Trump is personally indicted, under seal, on RICO charges along with Felix Sater, the Trump Organization and Bayrock.\n\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible. If you can help us, please donate.\n\nIs it possible that VEB, the state-run entity, is being subpoenaed for records that relate to some of Felix Sater\u2019s funders on the Trump Organization-Bayrock deal? VEB might have records on transfers made to VTB, the commercial Russian bank involved in the Bayrock deal; or to Sergei Kislyak, whom, Felix Sater\u2019s chosen messenger Jason Leopold reported,\n\nThe first Trump sealed indictment, I exclusively reported, had its genesis in a state Enterprise Corruption case from Eric Schneiderman, when he was the Attorney General of New York, I also reported that Schneiderman had had Trump Tower under state surveillance for well over a year \u2013 something that would not require a FISA warrant for AG Schneiderman to do. I reported, still further, that Paul Manafort, who promised \u2018cooperation\u2019 with the FBI before allowing a \u2018by consent\u2019 search of his apartment at Trump Tower, had lied to the FBI about what was there, cleaning out his apartment in advance and removing items to Florida.\n\nBloomberg reported with a clear-eyed view on Sater, Bayrock and Trump:\n\nIn that context, a troubling history of Trump\u2019s dealings with Russians exists outside of Russia: in a dormant real-estate development firm, the Bayrock Group, which once operated just two floors beneath the president\u2019s own office in Trump Tower.\n\nBayrock partnered with the future president and his two eldest children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, on a series of real-estate deals between 2002 and about 2011, the most prominent being the troubled Trump Soho hotel and condominium in Manhattan.\n\nDuring the years that Bayrock and Trump did deals together, the company was also a bridge between murky European funding and a number of projects in the U.S. to which the president once lent his name in exchange for handsome fees. Icelandic banks that dealt with Bayrock, for example, were easy marks for money launderers and foreign influence, according to interviews with government investigators, legislators, and others in Reykjavik, Brussels, Paris and London. Trump testified under oath in a 2007 deposition that Bayrock brought Russian investors to his Trump Tower office to discuss deals in Moscow, and said he was pondering investing there.\n\nOne of Bayrock\u2019s principals was a career criminal named Felix Sater who had ties to Russian and American organized crime groups. Before linking up with the company and with Trump, he had worked as a mob informant for the U.S. government, fled to Moscow to avoid criminal charges while boasting of his KGB and Kremlin contacts there, and had gone to prison for slashing apart another man\u2019s face with a broken cocktail glass.\n\nIn a series of interviews and a lawsuit, a former Bayrock insider, Jody Kriss, claims that he eventually departed from the firm because he became convinced that Bayrock was actually a front for money laundering.\n\nLet us then cross-reference this with some other facts. Has Mr. Sater got wind that, no matter how many public relations pieces he places with Buzzfeed or Newsweek, US intelligence does not regard him as \u201cAn American Spy\u201d and is about to unseal charges on him, personally, for RICO? My reporting is that the first sealed indictment on Donald Trump as a person is for RICO, that the Trump Organization is indicted as a corrupt organization, and that the specific case was that of Felix Sater and Bayrock. Sater\u2019s motivation might then have been to warn his masters in Russia of some of what Mueller has on them; or to lobby Trump for a pardon. This money laundering by Sater and Trump with the Trump Organization pre-dated the election campaign of 2016. But the pre-Mueller, personal indictment of Donald Trump, granted while he was President of the United States, \u2013 jointly reported here by myself and Claude Taylor, and the fact that this indictment was for RICO with Mr. Sater, Bayrock and the Trump Organization \u2013 a story to this reporter alone \u2013 has dominated debate long after that election. A terrified Mr. Sater now appears to be trying to hurt Bob Mueller\u2019s other cases with disclosures and to be lobbying Trump for a pardon he cannot give at the same time. This is not the sound of whistleblowing; it is the sound of a stuck pig, squealing.\n\nFelix Sater, like Carter Page, is desperate to disqualify the FISA warrants that covered Alfa Bank, Carter Page and Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here .

VEB might have records on transfers made to VTB, the commercial Russian bank involved in the Bayrock deal; or to Sergei Kislyak, whom, Felix Sater\u2019s chosen messenger Jason Leopold reported,\n\nThe first Trump sealed indictment, I exclusively reported, had its genesis in a state Enterprise Corruption case from Eric Schneiderman, when he was the Attorney General of New York, I also reported that Schneiderman had had Trump Tower under state surveillance for well over a year \u2013 something that would not require a FISA warrant for AG Schneiderman to do. I reported, still further, that Paul Manafort, who promised \u2018cooperation\u2019 with the FBI before allowing a \u2018by consent\u2019 search of his apartment at Trump Tower, had lied to the FBI about what was there, cleaning out his apartment in advance and removing items to Florida.\n\nBloomberg reported with a clear-eyed view on Sater, Bayrock and Trump:\n\nIn that context, a troubling history of Trump\u2019s dealings with Russians exists outside of Russia: in a dormant real-estate development firm, the Bayrock Group, which once operated just two floors beneath the president\u2019s own office in Trump Tower.\n\nBayrock partnered with the future president and his two eldest children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, on a series of real-estate deals between 2002 and about 2011, the most prominent being the troubled Trump Soho hotel and condominium in Manhattan.\n\nDuring the years that Bayrock and Trump did deals together, the company was also a bridge between murky European funding and a number of projects in the U.S. to which the president once lent his name in exchange for handsome fees. Icelandic banks that dealt with Bayrock, for example, were easy marks for money launderers and foreign influence, according to interviews with government investigators, legislators, and others in Reykjavik, Brussels, Paris and London. Trump testified under oath in a 2007 deposition that Bayrock brought Russian investors to his Trump Tower office to discuss deals in Moscow, and said he was pondering investing there.\n\nOne of Bayrock\u2019s principals was a career criminal named Felix Sater who had ties to Russian and American organized crime groups. Before linking up with the company and with Trump, he had worked as a mob informant for the U.S. government, fled to Moscow to avoid criminal charges while boasting of his KGB and Kremlin contacts there, and had gone to prison for slashing apart another man\u2019s face with a broken cocktail glass.\n\nIn a series of interviews and a lawsuit, a former Bayrock insider, Jody Kriss, claims that he eventually departed from the firm because he became convinced that Bayrock was actually a front for money laundering.\n\nLet us then cross-reference this with some other facts. Has Mr. Sater got wind that, no matter how many public relations pieces he places with Buzzfeed or Newsweek, US intelligence does not regard him as \u201cAn American Spy\u201d and is about to unseal charges on him, personally, for RICO? My reporting is that the first sealed indictment on Donald Trump as a person is for RICO, that the Trump Organization is indicted as a corrupt organization, and that the specific case was that of Felix Sater and Bayrock. Sater\u2019s motivation might then have been to warn his masters in Russia of some of what Mueller has on them; or to lobby Trump for a pardon. This money laundering by Sater and Trump with the Trump Organization pre-dated the election campaign of 2016. But the pre-Mueller, personal indictment of Donald Trump, granted while he was President of the United States, \u2013 jointly reported here by myself and Claude Taylor, and the fact that this indictment was for RICO with Mr. Sater, Bayrock and the Trump Organization \u2013 a story to this reporter alone \u2013 has dominated debate long after that election. A terrified Mr. Sater now appears to be trying to hurt Bob Mueller\u2019s other cases with disclosures and to be lobbying Trump for a pardon he cannot give at the same time. This is not the sound of whistleblowing; it is the sound of a stuck pig, squealing.\n\nFelix Sater, like Carter Page, is desperate to disqualify the FISA warrants that covered Alfa Bank, Carter Page and Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here .

They need to be stopped,\u201d Lerner claimed, without acknowledging that heavily armed Israeli occupation forces have no business invading the cities and lives of Palestinians.\n\n\u201cThey should be stuffed into a small cage?\u201d Lineker shot back, referring to a disturbing sequence in the video in which several handcuffed boys appear to be confined inside a wire box.\n\nLineker stood his ground as Lerner and other trolls accused him of justifying \u201cterror\u201d and implied he may be anti-Semitic.\n\nIn 2015, Lineker also came under attack when he tweeted about Israeli abuses of Palestinian human rights.\n\nOn Tuesday, Palme d\u2019Or-winning director Ken Loach \u2013 a long-time supporter of Palestinian rights \u2013 tweeted his backing for Lineker\u2019s stance.\n\nWell said @GaryLineker - every responsible person should share your response. https://t.co/10dyAuobGP \u2014 Ken Loach (@KenLoachSixteen) December 12, 2017\n\nIsrael\u2019s damage control operatives will have their hands full, not just with Lineker but with other celebrities who feel more comfortable breaking taboos around supporting Palestinian rights.\n\nLast week, following Donald Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, supermodel Bella Hadid commented to her 16 million Instagram followers that \u201cWatching the news and seeing the pain of the Palestinian people makes me cry for the many many generations of Palestine.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing the sadness of my father, cousins and Palestinian family that are feeling for our Palestinian ancestors makes this even harder to write,\u201d Hadid added.\n\nNot content with merely posting her views online, Hadid joined a protest in London last Friday organized by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.\n\nPHOTO: Supermodel Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) marches with protesters in solidarity with Palestine in London this evening. pic.twitter.com/OR5QFp3aPf \u2014 The IMEU (@theIMEU) December 8, 2017\n\nAnd actors Tilda Swinton and Mark Ruffalo; musicians Roger Waters, Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno; and designer Vivienne Westwood were among more than 100 artists who spoke out against Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem.\n\nTilda Swinton, Mark Ruffalo, Roger Waters, Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno are among dozens of writers, musicians and actors who have condemned Donald Trump\u2019s move to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. https://t.co/23QtC2PpVD pic.twitter.com/mIGUMmtyVJ \u2014 PACBI (@PACBI) December 12, 2017\n\nIn a letter published by The Guardian, the artists state that Trump \u201cseeks to achieve through a declaration what Israel has been trying to do for 50 years through force of arms: to erase Palestinians, as a political and cultural presence, from the life of their own city.\u201d\n\nActress Alia Shawkat, best known for playing Maeby F\u00fcnke in the TV comedy Arrested Development, tweeted, \u201cJerusalem is sacred. Trump\u2019s decision will not be overlooked. Palestine will not be forgotten.\u201d\n\nShe added the hashtag #BDS \u2013 boycott, divestment and sanctions.\n\njersusalem is sacred. Trumps decision will not be overlooked. Palestine will not be forgotten. #BDS \u2014 Alia Shawkat (@ShawkatAlia) December 7, 2017\n\nShe also retweeted a call for a protest outside the White House, as well as a viral photo of Palestinian teenager Fawzi al-Juneidi blindfolded and surrounded by more than a dozen heavily armed Israeli soldiers.\n\nEven American mainstream comedian Bette Midler took an online swipe at Trump, tweeting out a satirical cartoon in which the president is informed by an aide that \u201cThe Palestinians have just recognized Dallas, Texas, as the capital of Mexico.\u201d\n\nMidler\u2019s intervention may be an example of a Trump effect: some journalists and public figures appear more willing to be critical on an issue when the unpopular president supports it.\n\nOf course these are not the first celebrities to use their fame to bring attention to Palestine \u2013 and many who signed the Guardian letter have long records of solidarity \u2013 but there\u2019s no doubt that many others stay silent because of career concerns or to avoid attacks from Israel lobby groups.\n\nThere are signs, however, that it\u2019s getting a little easier.\n\nIn The Nation this week, Dave Zirin revisits the two National Football League players who took a public stance for Palestine earlier this year.\n\nMichael Bennett and Kenny Stills \u201cmade global news in February when they refused to take part in a trip to Israel organized by the Netanyahu government, after first agreeing to attend,\u201d Zirin writes.\n\nAlong with other players, they \u201cbacked out after learning about the propagandistic nature of the trip and being profoundly moved by parallels between the situation for Black Americans in places like Ferguson and the Palestinian carceral existence in Gaza.\u201d\n\nZirin sees this as an important moment: \u201cIt has long been assumed in sports \u2013 not to mention in media more broadly \u2013 that even recognizing the humanity of the Palestinian people, let alone criticizing the Israeli occupation, is a political third rail.\u201d\n\nYet both have been nominated for the NFL Man of the Year Award.\n\nThat no disastrous consequences befell the NFL players \u2013 in a year when Colin Kaepernick paid a very high price for his activism against racist violence by US police \u2013 is notable.\n\nPeople are losing their fear of standing with Palestine, and that\u2019s another worrying sign for Israel lobby leaders who lamented in a secret report earlier this year their failure to stem the \u201cimpressive growth\u201d and \u201csignificant successes\u201d of the BDS movement."

    "text": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top House Democrats condemned anti-Semitism Monday and called on freshman Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar to apologize for tweets that many viewed as anti-Semitic.\n\n\u201cAnti-Semitism must be called out, confronted and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception,\u201d read a statement signed by the speaker and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Majority Whip James Clyburn, Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, caucus chair Hakeem Jeffries and caucus vice chair Katherine Clark.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman Omar\u2019s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel\u2019s supporters is deeply offensive. We condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cAs Democrats and as Americans, the entire Congress must be fully engaged in denouncing and rejecting all forms of hatred, racism, prejudice and discrimination wherever they are encountered.\u201d\n\nThe statement did not say whether Omar would be disciplined or lose committee assignments.\n\nOn Sunday night, Omar tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins baby,\u201d suggesting House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California was financially motivated to defend Israel, as McCarthy has said he would take action against Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) for being critical of the Jewish state.\n\nMcCarthy had said that statements by Omar and Tlaib crossed the line into anti-Semitism and were worse than the racist rhetoric coming from GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who\u2019s been stripped of his committee assignments.\n\nBut McCarthy recently faced accusations of anti-Semitism himself.\n\nBefore the midterms, he tweeted that voters shouldn\u2019t let billionaires Mike Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer \u2014 who are all Jewish \u2014 buy the election.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow Soros, Steyer, and Bloomberg to BUY this election! Get out and vote Republican November 6th. #MAGA,\u201d he wrote in a tweet condemned as anti-Semitic, and which he later deleted.\n\nIn another Sunday night tweet, Omar answered a journalist who had questioned on Twitter who the Michigan Democrat \u201cthinks is paying American politicians to be pro-Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAIPAC!\u201d Omar replied, name-dropping the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nThe group spent about $3.5 million on lobbying in 2018, a small fraction of what many other lobbyists spent.\n\nThese tweets were met with an immediate backlash by some of her peers on both sides of the aisle.\n\nStaten Island Rep. Max Rose tweeted Sunday night, \u201cCongresswoman\u2019s Omar\u2019s statements are deeply hurtful to Jews, including myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo sick & twisted,\u201d wrote Long Island Rep. Lee Zeldin. \u201cThis continued anti-Semitic trope from Omar is grossly wrong. There should be NO home in US politics, college campuses, or halls of Congress for ANY of this garbage. Now she tweets that if Members of Congress support Israel then they were bought off by Jews.\u201d\n\nOn Monday the letter went out to Democratic leadership, while the statements of contempt kept coming.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply disappointing and disturbing to hear Representative Ilhan Omar\u2019s (MN) choice of words in her exchange with a journalist yesterday, wherein she appears to traffic in old anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money,\u201d said Manhattan Rep. Jerry Nadler in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile of course our nation\u2019s leaders are free to debate the relative influence of a particular organization on our country\u2019s policy-making process, or the factors that make our system of governance imperfect, there is an expectation of leaders \u2014 particularly those with a demonstrated commitment to the cause of justice and equality \u2014 that they would be extremely careful not to tread into the waters of anti-Semitism or any other form of prejudice or hate,\u201d Nadler continued. \u201cRep. Omar failed that test of leadership with these comments.\u201d\n\nBut not every lawmaker smacked Omar for her tweets.\n\nRep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Monday morning that he didn\u2019t view Omar\u2019s comments as anti-Semitic.\n\n\u201cWe ought to be careful not to construe in that anything other than a concern about the fact that money has undue influence on political decision-making,\u201d Kildee said.\n\nAnd while former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, who married a Jewish man, first said that \u201cwe should expect all elected officials, regardless of party, and all public figures to not traffic in anti-Semitism,\u201d she expressed that she would call Omar\u2019s office to set up a dialogue between the two.\n\nOn Twitter, Omar agreed to meet.\n\n\u201cChelsea \u2014 I would be happy to talk. We must call out smears from the GOP and their allies. And I believe we can do that without criticizing people for their faith,\u201d Omar wrote. \u201cI look forward to building an inclusive movement for justice with you.\u201d"

They forgot state law,\u2019 one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matters discussed.\n\nThe RICO case \u2013 specifically, \u2018Enterprise Corruption\u2019, the name given in New York state law, formed the basis of the existing sealed indictment against Donald Trump presently at the Eastern District Court of Virginia. FISC retains some jurisdiction, but what precisely, sources did not specify.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nThe way in which Attorney General Schneiderman\u2019s state case became a Federal indictment was reported exclusively by me at Patribotics. RICO and Enterprise Corruption cases are typically principally on financial and other crimes such as money laundering, corruption and so forth. However, in this case, there were also national security implications, which is why FISC took jurisdiction of the case from Schneiderman once it was determined that it touched upon Federal issues. Mr. Schneiderman dismissed his case at state level in order that his evidence should form the basis of a federal case. As a state Attorney General, Schneiderman did not need a judge\u2019s permission to do this.\n\nThe existence of the sealed indictment against Donald Trump was reported by Claude Taylor and me exclusively for Patribotics.\n\nThere will be more on this breaking story later today."

    "text": "Facebook\u2019s massively lucrative advertising model relies on tracking its one billion users\u2014as well as the billions on WhatsApp and Instagram\u2014across the web and smartphone apps, collecting data on which sites and apps they visit, where they shop, what they like, and combining all that information into comprehensive user profiles. Facebook has maintained that collecting all this data allows the company to serve ads that are more relevant to users\u2019 interests. Privacy advocates have argued that the company isn\u2019t transparent enough about what data it has and what it does with it. As a result, most people don\u2019t understand the massive trade-off they are making with their information when they sign up for the \u201cfree\u201d site.\n\nOn Thursday, Germany\u2019s Federal Cartel Office, the country\u2019s antitrust regulator, ruled that Facebook was exploiting consumers by requiring them to agree to this kind of data collection in order to have an account, and has prohibited the practice going forward.\n\n\u201cFacebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted collection and assigning of non-Facebook data to their Facebook user accounts,\u201d FCO president Andreas Mundt said in a statement announcing the decision.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with their conclusions and intend to appeal so that people in Germany continue to benefit fully from all our services,\u201d Facebook wrote in a blog post responding to the ruling. The company has one month to appeal. If it fails, Facebook would have to change how it processes data internally for German users, and could only combine the data into a single profile for a Facebook account with that user's explicit consent.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a lack of competition, users accepting terms of service are often not truly consenting. The consent is a fiction.\u201d Lina Khan, Open Markets\n\n\u201cThis is significant,\u201d says Lina Khan, an antitrust expert affiliated with Columbia Law School and the think tank Open Markets. She notes that authorities haven\u2019t done a good job of articulating why privacy is an antitrust issue. Here, the German regulator makes it clear. \u201cThe FCO\u2019s theory is that Facebook\u2019s dominance is what allows it to impose on users contractual terms that require them to allow Facebook to track them all over,\u201d Khan says. \u201cWhen there is a lack of competition, users accepting terms of service are often not truly consenting. The consent is a fiction.\u201d\n\nAccording to the FCO, Facebook had 32 million monthly active users in Germany at the end of last year, amounting to a market share of more than 80 percent. The regulator argues this dominance gives it jurisdiction to oversee the company\u2019s data collection practices.\n\n\u201cAs a dominant company Facebook is subject to special obligations under competition law. In the operation of its business model the company must take into account that Facebook users practically cannot switch to other social networks,\u201d said Mundt. \u201cThe only choice the user has is either to accept the comprehensive combination of data or to refrain from using the social network. In such a difficult situation the user\u2019s choice cannot be referred to as voluntary consent.\u201d\n\nThe FCO further argues that Facebook used its vast data collection to build up its market dominance, creating a feedback loop wherein people have no choice but to use the site and allow it to track them, which makes the site even more dominant and entrenches its privacy violations.\n\n\u201cThe Bundeskartellamt [FCO] underestimates the fierce competition we face in Germany, misinterprets our compliance with GDPR and undermines the mechanisms European law provides for ensuring consistent data protection standards across the EU,\u201d Facebook wrote in response to the ruling. They cite Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube as direct competitors, hoping to illustrate that there isn\u2019t lack of competition, and therefore the FCO has no standing to apply rules based on Facebook\u2019s dominance. \u201cPopularity,\u201d they write, \u201cis not dominance.\u201d\n\nThe FCO disagreed, explaining that Snapchat, YouTube, and Twitter serve totally different functions from Facebook, and therefore can\u2019t be seen as viable alternatives to the service.\n\nAntitrust regulators used to consider data and privacy outside their purview. The old philosophy held that antitrust was concerned with price, and if a product was free then consumers couldn\u2019t be harmed, says Maurice Stucke, antitrust expert and law professor at the University of Tennessee. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is those myths are being largely discredited.\u201d\n\nThe most remarkable part of the ruling is the way it makes clear that privacy and competition are inextricably intertwined. \u201cOn the one hand there is a service provided to users free of charge. On the other hand, the attractiveness and value of the advertising spaces increase with the amount and detail of user data,\u201d Mundt said. \u201cIt is therefore precisely in the area of data collection and data use where Facebook, as a dominant company, must comply with the rules and laws applicable in Germany and Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first instance where [regulators] are saying that because [a company has] such market power that consent is not freely given,\u201d says Stucke.\n\nThe FCO ruling explains that the harm to users from Facebook\u2019s data collection is not in cost but in \u201closs of control.\u201d \u201cThey are no longer able to control how their personal data are used. They cannot perceive which data from which sources are combined for which purposes with data from Facebook accounts and used e.g. for creating user profiles,\u201d the FAQ on the ruling reads. That combining of data gives it a \u201csignificance the user cannot foresee.\u201d\n\nThat fact is underscored by people\u2019s ignorance of Facebook data practices. Roughly 74 percent of American Facebook users surveyed recently by the Pew Charitable Trusts did not know that Facebook maintained profiles about their interests. Fifty-one percent of those surveyed said they weren\u2019t comfortable with the practice.\n\nBut Facebook says that tracking people makes the services safer and better, and that the FCO misses how much the company has done in order to comply with the General Data Protection regulation passed by the European Union in 2018.\n\nThe FCO\u2019s ruling, however, directly addresses the GDPR, writing that under its principles Facebook has \u201cno effective justification for collecting data from other company-owned services and Facebook Business Tools or for assigning these data to the Facebook user accounts.\u201d (Facebook Business Tools here can be anything from the Like and Share buttons that appear all over the internet, and which allow Facebook to track you on sites it doesn\u2019t own, to analytic tools Facebook provides businesses.) In other words, in addition to being anticompetitive in its view, the FCO believes Facebook hasn\u2019t proven that data collection and bundling is in the best interest of every consumer and that its sites couldn\u2019t function without it.\n\nIf Facebook loses the appeal, then Germany will become a grand experiment in whether the surveillance economy is actually essential to the operation of social media. Other Europeans and Americans may demand they are given the same option. \u201cThis ruling is really an icebreaker. Icebreakers break through the ice in order to lead the path for other vessels to follow,\u201d says Stucke.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories"

    "text": "I\u2019d like to put a human face \u2014 my own \u2014 to the risk posed by GOP gamesmanship on the Mueller investigation.\n\nSometime last year, I went to the FBI and provided information on a person whom I had come to believe had played a significant role in the Russian election attack on the US. Since that time, a number of public events have made it clear I was correct.\n\nI never in my life imagined I would share information with the FBI, especially not on someone I had a journalistic relationship with. I did so for many reasons. Some, but not all, of the reasons are:\n\nI believed he was doing serious harm to innocent people\n\nI believed (others agreed) that reporting the story at that time would risk doing far more harm than good\n\nI had concrete evidence he was lying to me and others, including but not limited to other journalists\n\nI had reason to believe he was testing ways to tamper with my website\n\nI believed that if the FBI otherwise came to understand what kind of information I had, their likely investigative steps would pose a risk to the privacy of my readers\n\nTo protect the investigation, I will not disclose this person\u2019s true identity or the identity and/or role I believe he played in the attack. Nor will I disclose when I went to the FBI. I did so on my own, without subpoena; I did that in an effort to protect people who have spoken to me in confidence and other journalists. Largely because this effort involved a number of last minute trips to other cities, I spent around $6K of my own money traveling to meet with lawyers and for the meeting with the FBI.\n\nI always planned to disclose this when this person\u2019s role was publicly revealed. But I\u2019m doing so now for two reasons. First, I think the public deserves to see the text he sent me at 3:15 PM on November 9, 2016.\n\nThe substance of the text \u2014 that the Trump team started focusing on Syria right after the election \u2014 has been corroborated and tied to their discussions with Russia at least twice since then. Most importantly, in his statement to Congress, Jared Kushner explained his request for a back channel with the Russians by describing an effort to cooperate on Syria.\n\nThe Ambassador [Sergei Kislyak] expressed similar sentiments about relations, and then said he especially wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria, and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his \u201cgenerals.\u201d He said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration. He said the generals could not easily come to the U.S. to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation. General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines. I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn.\n\nLess credibly, in the days after Mike Flynn pled guilty, an inflammatory Brian Ross report was corrected to reveal that \u201cshortly after the election\u201d Trump asked Flynn personally to work with Russia on Syria (Ross left ABC yesterday but as far as I understand the corrected story stands).\n\nRetired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn has promised \u201cfull cooperation\u201d in the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation and, according to a confidant, is prepared to testify that Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians, initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria. [snip] The source said Trump phoned Flynn shortly after the election to explicitly ask him to \u201cserve as point person on Russia,\u201d and to reach out personally to Russian officials to develop strategies to jointly combat ISIS.\n\nThe text sent to me matches both those reports \u2014 indeed, it makes it clear that \u201cshortly after the election\u201d means just over 14 hours after polls closed. But the text doesn\u2019t come from anyone, like Kushner or Flynn, inside the Trump team. It comes from someone who, I believe, had already done real damage to the United States as part of the Russian attack. That person understood the cooperation with Syria in terms of the US backing Bashar al-Assad, not in terms of fighting ISIS.\n\nI\u2019m making this public now because a David Ignatius report Thursday maps out an imminent deal with Russia and Israel that sounds like what was described to me within hours of the election. This deal appears to be the culmination of an effort that those involved in the Russian attack worked to implement within hours after the election.\n\nThe other reason I\u2019m disclosing this now is to put a human face to the danger in which the House Republicans are putting other people who, like me, provided information about the Russian attack on the US to the government.\n\nSeveral times since I first considered sharing information with the FBI, I\u2019ve asked my attorney to contact the FBI to tell them of what I perceived to be a real threat that arose from sharing that information. One of those times, I let law enforcement officers enter my house without a warrant, without me being present.\n\nMy risk isn\u2019t going to go away \u2014 indeed, going public like this will surely exacerbate it. That\u2019s to be expected, given the players involved.\n\nBut I\u2019m a public figure. If something happens to me \u2014 if someone releases stolen information about me or knocks me off tomorrow \u2014 everyone will now know why and who likely did it. That affords me a small bit of protection. There are undoubtedly numerous other witnesses who have taken similar risks to share information with the government who aren\u2019t public figures. The Republicans\u2019 ceaseless effort to find out more details about people who\u2019ve shared information with the government puts those people in serious jeopardy.\n\nI\u2019m speaking out because they can\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nIt infuriates me to observe (and cover) a months-long charade by the House GOP to demand more and more details about those who have shared information with the government, at least some of whom were only trying to prevent real damage to innocent people, all in an attempt to discredit the Mueller investigation. As someone who has worked to rein in dragnets for over a decade, I\u2019m all the more disgusted to see so many lifelong cheerleaders of surveillance pretend to care now.\n\nI only came to be convinced slowly about Russia\u2019s role in the attack and I have been skeptical of the Steele dossier from the day it was published. That said, I obviously do not like Donald Trump \u2014 though I\u2019m no Hillary fan, either. But my decision to share information with the FBI had nothing to do with my dislike for Donald Trump. It had to do with the serious damage that someone else I believed to be involved in the Russian attack \u2014 someone I had been friendly with \u2014 was doing to innocent people, almost all of those people totally uninvolved in American politics.\n\nThis investigation is not, primarily, an investigation into Donald Trump. It\u2019s an investigation into people who attacked the United States. It\u2019s time Republicans started acting like that matters.\n\nOn Thursday night, I reached out to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office to inquire whether I could post this without damaging the investigation. After sharing the specific language from the passages I felt might pose the biggest concern, last night at 10:15, I was informed they, \u201ctake no position\u201d on my posting it."

    "text": "RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 As Virginia Governor Ralph Northam faces increasing pressure to resign over a racist photograph from his 1984 medical school yearbook, the man who would take his place -- Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax -- is responding to accusations of his own.\n\nThe allegation involves an unsubstantiated claim of sexual assault against Fairfax during the Democratic National Convention in 2004. The claim was posted Sunday night on the same website that first published the racist photo from Gov. Northam's yearbook.\n\nFairfax told reporters Monday that the 2004 encounter with a woman was consensual and he called the accusation of misconduct \"a smear.\"\n\nThe Washington Post, as well as our sister station WUSA9 in Washington D.C., have known about the claim for months, but were not able to corroborate the allegations.\n\n\u201cLt. Governor Fairfax has an outstanding and well-earned reputation for treating people with dignity and respect,\u201d read the statement released on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHe has never assaulted anyone \u2013 ever \u2013 in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nA post on the conservative website Big League Politics went live just as the Super Bowl ended late Sunday. Allies of the likely heir apparent to embattled Gov. Northam called the development a clear smear tactic, as Fairfax's profile rises.\n\n\"This is part of the sad and dark politics that the Lt. Governor has dedicated himself to helping Virginia and the nation rise above,\" the overnight statement read.\n\n\"The Lt. Governor will take appropriate legal action against those attempting to spread this defamatory and false allegation.\"\n\nWUSA9 is refraining from publishing further details of the claim, as key elements have not been able to be verified. Broad outlines of the claim are only being published after Fairfax's office released an official statement now in public view.\n\nThe Washington Post said Monday that it was approached by the woman in 2017, carefully investigated, but never published the accusation.\n\nThe Post said the woman had not told anyone about it, the account could not be corroborated, Fairfax denied it and the Post was unable to find other allegations against him.\n\nThe development unfolded hours before Northam is scheduled to hold a meeting with top staff members in Richmond, when a possible resignation will be discussed.\n\nFive officials with direct knowledge of the continuing deliberations said state lawmakers will hold off on removing Northam through untested mechanisms in Virginia's constitution, in order to avoid escalating tensions.\n\nThirty-nine-year-old Justin Fairfax could become Virginia's second African-American governor is Gov. Northam steps aside. The first was Douglas Wilder, who served from 1990 to 1994.\n\nFairfax is best known in Virginia for excusing himself from the Senate chamber during tributes offered to Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson on the state's Lee-Jackson Day.\n\nRELATED: Virginia's Lieutenant Governor protests Lee-Jackson day\n\nWUSA9 in Washington D.C. and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

    "text": "Which is the institution at the heart of Bob Mueller\u2019s \u2018mystery case\u2019 and why does it matter so much?\n\nBob Mueller does not leak. His team does not leak. The subject bank might leak, of course, but we are unlikely to find out, before the case is unsealed, who the mystery reluctant witness is. The leading possibilities, however, are all disastrous for Donald Trump and Jared Kushner. I am not a betting woman, but if I were, I should put a few roubles on Vnesheconombank or VEB, for reasons I explain below.\n\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible. If you can help us, please donate.\n\nThe Qatar Investment Authority\n\nThe analyst Marci Wheeler has been arguing that the mystery entity is the Qatar Investment Authority, whom Jared Kushner, I have suggested, was attempting to extort for money for his building at 666 Park Avenue. This is a popular theory and may well be true. Chris Geider reported that the Corporation was served the subpoena at its US offices.\n\nOnline detectives are trying to game out the institution\u2019s name from the redactions.\n\nWheeler pointed out that the QIA\u2019s New York offices are \u2018a two minute walk from Trump Towers\u2019. She notes that Qatar previously refused to give evidence on Jared Kushner to Mueller, for fear of Trump\u2019s retaliation. NBC News reported last year:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Qatari officials gathered evidence of what they claim is illicit influence by the United Arab Emirates on Jared Kushner and other Trump associates, including details of secret meetings, but decided not to give the information to special counsel Robert Mueller for fear of harming relations with the Trump administration, say three sources familiar with the Qatari discussions.\n\nHowever, the story goes on:\n\n\u201cOn the topic of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation: Qatar has not been approached nor has it considered approaching the Special Counsel\u2019s Office or any entity within the United States Government,\u201d said [Qatar\u2019s Ambassador to the US] Al Thani.\n\nHowever, the evidence described is not banking evidence primarily, and is not attributed to a bank but to diplomats \u2018familiar with Qatari internal discussions\u2019. As written, I suggest that this story is closer to my own theory that there is audio of Mr. Kushner or his representatives attempting to extort Qatar to invest in 666 Park Avenue, before changing US foreign policy against them when they refused.\n\nThe most important argument against the Qatar theory, I would argue, is that it is Robert Mueller who is bringing the case. Mueller is not bringing peripheral cases. His mandate is to investigate collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the election. Where he discovers other crimes arising, he can prosecute, but he has chosen not to do so. Michael Cohen\u2019s nonsense with Stormy Daniels and Trump was passed off to SDNY. Maria Butina\u2019s case was not a Bob Mueller case, not directly: as the DoJ website puts it:\n\nThe investigation into this matter was conducted by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office. The case is being prosecuted by the National Security Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia and the National Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nTherefore, the RDIF\u2019s involvement with Kirill Dimitriev in the Seychelles, and Qatar\u2019s refusal \u2013 at least initially \u2013 to comply with Jared Kushner\u2019s attempts at extortion \u2013 although deeply corrupt, and involving many of the personae who attacked our election, most of what we know about those institutions in public reporting occurred after the election was over. It is more likely that Mr. Mueller would hand such investigations to other divisions of the DOJ for prosecution.\n\nThe Russian Direct Investment Fund or the Central Bank of Russia\n\nThese are both state owned enterprises; they both might claim sovereign immunity; they both carry out business in the United States, and they are both connected to Mueller\u2019s inquiry. Alexander Torshin, the mentor of unregistered Russian agent Maria Butina, who admitted conspiring against the United States, is a Deputy Governor of Russia\u2019s Central Bank. It doesn\u2019t get more \u201csovereign wealth\u201d than that. I have reported that Russian money was washed into the GOP during the campaign with the connivance of the NRA, and that the FBI have recordings of this being discussed with multiple GOP bigwigs, including the former Speaker Paul Ryan and then Chairman of the GOP Reince Priebus. Certainly, with Butina in custody, the FBI would be interested in her efforts on Russia\u2019s behalf with Torshin. Mitigating against this, though, is the point that Butina\u2019s case is with the National Security Division, not Mueller.\n\nThe RDIF, or Sovereign Wealth Fund, suggested by some analysts, is also an attractive possibility. It could make an argument based on sovereignty, and it intersects with Mueller very firmly as we see Erik Prince being tasked by Mike Flynn and Jared Kushner; George Nader, the pedophile aide to the Crown Prince of the UAE and \u2018Mr. Fixit\u2019 who set up this meeting had done some data work for Trump during the election. However, again, the largest headlines for this matter are about things that occurred after the election of Trump, and Mueller\u2019s own prosecutions seem to be very tightly focused on his specific case; Russians attacking the US election and Americans lying to law enforcement or Congress about colluding with those Russians. Furthermore I have not been able easily to find offices in America for the Central Bank of Russia or the RDIF, although they may exist.\n\nThe Marcy Wheeler theory of Qatar would mean, if sustained, that Mueller was looking to them for evidence of a crime committed by Kushner \u2013 which Trump would be complicit in, changing US foreign policy for a bribe. The RDIF or Central Bank of Russia again, at the simplest level \u2013 considering this is a Mueller case \u2013 would mean Mueller was looking for data from financial arms of the Russian state implying criminal acts during the transition, and possibly relating to George Nader\u2019s data efforts. The last candidate, my own best guess, would be by far the worst news for Donald Trump. It was a bank whose boss was brought to Trump Tower at the request of the Russian Ambassador; it is a bank whose supervisory chairman is the actual Russian Prime Minister. If Mueller believes that VEB, Vnesheconombank, is holding evidence that links the Trump campaign to collusion with the Russian state, then the consequences for Donald Trump and those around him in the campaign are incalculably bad.\n\nMy Theory \u2013 Vnesheconombank\n\nVnesheconombank also fits the facts as we know it: the entity is a fully state-owned bank, it employs a legal team who have worked in Russian interests before, it will have \u2018commercial interests\u2019, it is wholly owned by the state (this detail ruled out Sberbank and Alfa Bank) and \u2018Country A\u2019 has argued that it would be required to violate its own laws by complying with Mueller\u2019s subpoena. This could refer to Russian data protection laws making it illegal for Russian banks to transfer data on Russian citizens without their consent outside of Russia, fitting better than the RDIF or the Central Bank.\n\nVnesheconombank also has offices in New York City, at 777 Third Avenue.\n\nWas Bob Mueller serving up a subpoena to Russia\u2019s Vnesheconombank at its offices on Third Avenue?\n\nVnesheconombank has perhaps the single greatest claim to \u201csovereign immunity\u201d outside of the Central Bank of Russia. As the New York Times reported in early 2017:\n\nVnesheconombank, or VEB, is no normal bank. It is wholly owned by the Russian state. It is intertwined with Russian intelligence. And the Russian prime minister is, by law, the chairman of its supervisory board.\n\nFamously, Sergey N. Gorkov, its chief, a former Russian spy, met with Jared Kushner during the transition. Now, one might argue that this is also part and parcel of post-election corruption, but the visit had several elements that tie it in to pre-election collusion as well; it was publicly tied to the lifting of sanctions, a key element, I have reported, and Chris Steele first reported, of the Trump-Russia \u201chacking help for sanctions lifting\u201d deal.\n\nVEB has quietly kept up appearances on Wall Street in the event that sanctions would be lifted, according to interviews with American bankers and former government officials\u2026.Mr. Gorkov met with bankers at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and another, unidentified American financial institution. Goldman Sachs bankers also tried to arrange a meeting but ultimately had a scheduling conflict. The meetings, which are not prohibited by sanctions, were confirmed by three people briefed on the discussions but unauthorized to speak publicly about them\n\nNow, such activity would certainly fall squarely within the government\u2019s case filings that speak of, as a concurring opinion in the case put it, \u2018the government\u2019s theory turned only on the \u201cconsiderable business\u201d of a U.S. office of the Corporation\u2019. Furthermore, the Gorkov-Kushner visit gave two different explanations for the reason that Kushner and Gorkov met with each other. The Trump White House, according to the New York Times, said \u201c[Ambassador] Kislyak requested the meeting and that \u201cMr. Kushner was acting in his capacity as a transition official.\u201d\u2019\n\nSuch an explanation, along with Kushner\u2019s attempt to establish a new \u201cbackchannel\u201d to Russia, would fall firmly within Mueller\u2019s criminal investigation. Sergei Kislyak met Republicans, including Trump, Priebus and Ryan, at the RNC, and discussed with them how to wash Russian money to the campaign. Kislyak also met Jeff Sessions, who then lied about it, causing him to be forced to recuse from this investigation. And Kislyak, Trump, Manafort and Epshteyn, I reported, were taped at the Mayflower hotel using Sergei Kislyak\u2019s hot-miked phone, discussing Carter Page taking an offer to Moscow; sanctions relief in exchange for hacking help.\n\nMr. Manafort, according to the Steele Dossier, was using Carter Page as his \u201cintermediary\u201d to Russia. Manafort was present at the Donald Trump Jr. meeting in Trump Tower.\n\nKushner\u2019s own explanation was contradicted by VEB.\n\nBut VEB said Mr. Gorkov had met with Mr. Kushner, who was still running his family\u2019s real estate company, to discuss business.\n\nThat would be because VEB, as representing the Russian state, could not do foreign policy business with Kushner while Obama was still President. It could also be that Gorkov offered Kushner a bribe, not directly through VEB, but via VTB or other companies with which they did business. It is more likely that Mueller would be interested in collusion with the Russian state during the election than corruption after it; nonetheless the fact that Kushner and VEB conflicted in their statements will surely be of interest to Mueller.\n\nFor all these reasons, and others which relate to the FISA warrants on two Russian banks which I first reported in October 2017 \u2013 reasons that I shall detail in my next piece \u2013 I believe that it is most likely that Vnesheconombank is the subject of the Mueller subpoena.

    "text": "I hope in this piece to clear up some confusion relating to the specific FISA warrants that covered Mr. Manafort. In order to get to the good stuff first, I am first providing the FISA warrant timeline for Trump Russia, and then offering analysis as to how I draw the conclusions within it.\n\nThe Treason Timeline\n\nAll links are my own exclusive reporting, which I hope other journalists will ethically acknowledge, as I they confirm my stories, except where noted in the text.\n\nJune: FISA warrant sought and denied on Page, Trump, Manafort and Epshteyn\n\nJune 9th: Treasonmeeting in Trump Tower. Exclusive by the New York Times. Paul Manafort\u2019s phone hot-miked by GCHQ. Audio and notes of the meeting recovered and given to CIA and NSA. FBI does not listen, no FISA warrant.\n\nJune 24th: Scot 24, the Treasonmeeting 2, takes place in Scotland, where Donald Trump finalizes the details of how Cambridge Analytica will launder hacked data from state voter databases and the DNC\u2019s Vertica databases with AI targeting, in order to win the election. It is the day after Brexit, where Russia and Cambridge Analytica had employed similar techniques in Britain\n\nJuly 6-8: Carter Page takes tape of Trump promising overturning sanctions for help with hacking to Moscow. There is no FISA warrant on Page in July, but multiple foreign intelligence services, including at least the UK, Ukraine and Germany, had hacked and hot-wired Page\u2019s phone.\n\nJuly 18-22nd: the GOP Convention. Sergei Kislyak is taped offering dirty Russian money to the entire GOP. Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan are among two of those taped accepting it. The FBI places the entire GOP under a RICO investigation. No FISA warrant is needed for these intercepts as U.S. persons were gathered under \u201cincidental collection\u201d\n\n\u201cLate July\u201d: \u2013 James Comey states his counterintelligence campaign into Trump and Russia begins. It is also a criminal inquiry, he says.\n\nSummer: (But on or after late July) The Washington Post exclusively reports that Carter Page is made the subject of a FISA warrant \u201cin the summer\u201d. We cannot say for sure that the warrant was granted in July.\n\nBetween late July and October, Carter Page doubtless yielded evidence obtained under FISA that servers from Alfa Bank and SVB Bank are instrumental to the hack on the election. Because no warrant is sought on those banks until mid October.\n\nOctober 7th: the DNI reports that the Russian state hacked the DNC, and that this was authorized by the highest levels of the Russian government; and that a \u2018private Russian company had breached 22 states voter databases.\n\nOctober 15th: \u2013 FISA warrants are granted for \u201cAny US Person\u201d connected to two Russian banks, Alfa and SVB Bank, the latter of which has a deal with Sberbank, suspected of money laundering and financial offenses relating to Trump and Russia\n\nI note with caution, because one author of the Washington Post piece, Ellen Nakashima, has been very wrong before when she uncritically reported as a fact what Mike Pence told her on Mike Flynn \u2013 that he was not under FBI investigation \u2013 that the Post stated that Page was the only direct FISA named target granted in 2016:\n\nPage is the only American to have had his communications directly targeted with a FISA warrant in 2016 as part of the Russia probe, officials said.\n\nIf, and I emphasize IF, the Post was correct on that detail, then Manafort is likely to have been under FISA surveillance based on the two FISA warrants I reported on Nov 7th, concerning SVB Bank and Alfa Bank and their servers\u2019 communications with the Trump Tower and Spectrum Health servers (it was in fact one warrant per bank, I have learned). As a reminder, those warrants were issued for \u201cany US person\u201d in respect of the money laundering offenses ascribed to those two banks.\n\nThe October 15th warrant also allowed the FBI to listen for the first time to the intercepts taken by Five Eyes from Manafort\u2019s phone of the Treasonmeeting on June 9th, and to hear the tapes of Carter Page\u2019s meetings in Moscow in early July, provided by friendly foreign intelligence. My story said:\n\nWhile the Times story speaks of metadata, sources suggest that a FISA warrant was granted to look at the full content of emails and other related documents that may concern US persons\u2026.The warrant was sought, [sources] say, because actionable intelligence on the matter provided by friendly foreign agencies could not properly be examined without a warrant by US intelligence as it involves \u2018US Persons\u2019 who come under the remit of the FBI and not the CIA.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s tweets would tend to confirm this theory \u2013 that the Manafort FISA surveillance was carried out under the warrant covering \u201cany US person\u201d in respect to the money laundering of two Russian banks \u2013 with his breathless tweets of March 3rd, in which he stated that just before \u201cthe very sacred election [sic]\u2019 \u201cmy phones\u201d were tapped. Mr. Manafort lives in Trump Tower.\n\nIs it legal for a sitting President to be \u201cwire tapping\u201d a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! Note that I reported Manafort was on a failed application in June.\n\nHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tweets certainly fit with the FISA\u2019s granted on October 15th.\n\nI\u2019d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!\n\nLet it be noted that Trump was criminally obstructing justice here, revealing evidence in an ongoing criminal case. I had reported the existence of FISA warrants, not what Director Comey did with them. At that time, I had no knowledge of how Director Comey implemented the permission he received from the court, or on whom.\n\nNov 8th, 2016 \u2013 CNN exclusively reported that on election day, the FBI was monitoring how Russia influenced and orchestrated social media accounts to hack the election, this includes Facebook and Twitter\n\nDecember 10, 2016 \u2013 The Washington Post exclusively reports that the FBI and the CIA differed to lawmakers over Russia\u2019s motives\n\nDuring a similar Senate Intelligence Committee briefing held the previous week, the CIA\u2019s statements, as reflected in the letter the lawmakers now held in their hands, were \u201cdirect and bald and unqualified\u201d about Russia\u2019s intentions to help Trump, according to one of the officials who attended the House briefing. \u2026 The FBI official\u2019s remarks to the lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee were, in comparison, \u201cfuzzy\u201d and \u201cambiguous,\u201d suggesting to those in the room that the bureau and the agency weren\u2019t on the same page, the official said.\n\nDecember 16 \u2013 five days later, the Washington Post exclusively reports the FBI is now in agreement with the CIA that Russia was trying to help Trump. The authors blame lawmakers for giving them a false report of what took place in the House Intelligence Committee:\n\nFBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the White House, officials disclosed Friday, as President Obama issued a public warning to Moscow that it could face retaliation. New revelations about Comey\u2019s position could put to rest suggestions by some lawmakers that the CIA and the FBI weren\u2019t on the same page on Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s intentions.\n\nSources familiar with events speculated that yet another FISA warrant may have been obtained in December between the House hearing and the report of the 16th, allowing the FBI to examine the packet data, or messaging, transferred between the Spectrum Health server and SVB and Alfa Bank\u2019s two servers. Because the Spectrum server could have been transmitting health data information, these sources say, legal protections were higher for it than for the Trump Tower server.\n\nAs I exclusively reported, the FBI then discovered that the servers were washing money but also data laundering \u2013 targeting the hacked state registration, and DNC Vertical databases, with Cambridge Analytica\u2019s chosen propaganda, and their analytics, to help Mr. Trump cheat his way to the White House.\n\nPatribotics is grateful to supporters that make our work possible. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nAnalysis of FISA and Paul Manafort\n\nIn November, 2016, I broke the story of the FBI\u2019s investigation into Trump and Russia, contradicting the New York Times (and I, not the New York Times, was correct).\n\nIn that piece, published on the eve of the election, I reported that there was a failed application to the FISA court in June 2016 which named Donald Trump and three of his associates. I later reported exclusively that these names were Boris Epshteyn, Carter Page and Paul Manafort.\n\nSome commentators online have suggested my reporting of November was incorrect because a FISA warrant was later granted on Carter Page. However, they were mistaken. The June application on Manafort, Trump, Page and Epshteyn was denied, since it featured Mr. Trump. Sources familiar with the matter have speculated that the tape of Donald Trump that Carter Page took to Moscow, wherein he discusses changing sanctions policy in return for help with hacking the election, may have been recorded without Trump\u2019s consent at the Mayflower Hotel, when all four men were discussing the matter with Sergei Kislyak, Russia\u2019s then Ambassador to the United States. As I exclusively reported, Mr. Kislyak\u2019s phone was hot-miked throughout by an exploit placed upon it by a Five Eyes nation.\n\nIndeed, James Comey testified in April that his counter-intelligence operation into the Trump campaign began in late July, 2016. Therefore, no FISA warrant allowing the FBI access to US persons in this respect had been granted in June 2016.\n\nCOMEY: It\u2019s hard to say because I don\u2019t how much longer it will take. But we\u2019ve been doing this \u2014 this investigation began in late July, so for a counterintelligence investigation that\u2019s a fairly short period of time.\n\nOther outlets have reported that Carter Page and Paul Manafort were under prior FISA warrants. However, these warrants need renewal. Because the June application, which included both men along with Epshteyn and Trump was rejected, there was no FISA warrant in place for a Trump-Russia investigation until, per Director Comey, late July.\n\nIt may be that FISA warrants were granted on both Page and Manafort in late July; we know one was granted on Page in the summer, because of the Washington Post\u2019s exclusive. Late July would post-date Page\u2019s trip to Moscow with the tape of Trump, and coincides with, or immediately post-dates, the GOP Convention, July 18-21 in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nI exclusively reported at Patribotics that Sergei Kislyak was hot-miked at the GOP Convention agreeing to wash money into the GOP; that the entire GOP was thereafter under a RICO case, and that Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, was on intercepts with Kislyak agreeing to accept dirty Russian money into the campaign. No FISA warrant would have been needed for this recording, as Ambassador Kislyak is a foreign national. The U.S. persons on those tapes were collected under \u2018incidental collection\u2019.\n\nIt is quite probable therefore that Page certainly, and possibly also Manafort, were directly targeted in a warrant dated \u201clate July\u201d , after the GOP Convention concluded and they were taped with the Ambassador.\n\nAlthough the next story was reported by me earlier, the event it describes was later \u2013 October, 2016. Knowing, from the recordings made of Sergei Kislyak at the Convention, that Trump, Ryan and Reince Priebus had all agreed to accept laundered Russian money to assist in hacking and influencing the election, James Comey then sought FISA warrants on how this was being done \u2013 through Alfa Bank, which sent Trump Russia\u2019s money, and SVB Bank, which had its own server, communicating with the Trump and Spectrum Health servers, and which sent the Trump campaign the Cambridge Analytica targeting for the hacked state voter databases, which, I exclusively reported, the Trump and Spectrum servers were washing hourly with Alfa Bank.\n\nI reported that the two FISA warrants on SVB Bank and Alfa Bank granted by FISC to the FBI to surveil \u2018any US person\u2019 in conjunction with financial and banking offenses that connected to Russia were granted in October.\n\nthe FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October \u2026. The FISA warrant was granted in connection with the investigation of suspected activity between the server and two banks, SVB Bank and Alfa Bank. However, it is thought in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any \u2018US person\u2019 connected to this investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as his media surrogates.\n\nPaul Wood of the BBC later clarified that date as October 15th. Wood also confirmed my reporting that the FISA warrants covered Trump and the three associates I later named as Page, Manafort and Epshteyn:\n\nOn 15 October, the US secret intelligence court issued a warrant to investigate two Russian banks\u2026. ultimately, the investigation is looking for transfers of money from Russia to the United States, each one, if proved, a felony offence. A lawyer- outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case \u2013 told me that three of Mr Trump\u2019s associates were the subject of the inquiry. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear this is about Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nMcClatchy DC later confirmed Wood\u2019s exclusive that a six-agency financial task force had begun earlier than the FBI\u2019s specific counter-intelligence and criminal investigation; it also confirmed the FISA warrant.\n\nThe BBC reported that the FBI had obtained a warrant on Oct. 15 from the highly secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing investigators access to bank records and other documents about potential payments and money transfers related to Russia. One of McClatchy\u2019s sources confirmed the report.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Comey appears to have chosen his language carefully. Although he dates a targeted Trump-Russia counterintelligence investigation from July, 2016, which, I presume, was when his first FISA warrant was granted in connection with Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia specifically, his later testimony also said that he became aware of Russians hacking America\u2019s politics in late summer 2015:\n\nBURR: Okay. When did you become aware of the cyber intrusion? COMEY: The first cyber \u2014 there was all kinds of cyber intrusions going on all the time. The first Russian-connected cyber intrusion I became aware of in the late summer of 2015.\n\nI shall have more on what Director Comey described there in a later story.\n\nI have, however, also reported that Mr. Manafort\u2019s phone was hot-miked in an exploit placed upon it by GCHQ (other nations had also hacked Mr. Manafort\u2019s phone) and that not only did it record everything at the Treasonmeeting on June 9th, but that the \u2018notes\u2019 on Mr. Manafort\u2019s phone were taken from this exploit and that the FBI and Justice Department have those notes and recordings.\n\nThis complements my prior reporting. Until he obtained his FISA warrant in October on the two banks, Director Comey could not listen to the evidence that other US intelligence agencies had heard long before.\n\nHowever (again), I reported exclusively in the spring that at least six FISA warrants had been granted in Trump-Russia. Sources close to the matter indicate that at the Treasonmeeting, the Russians present used the word \u2018adoption\u2019 as fairly obvious code for \u2018sanctions\u2019.\n\nCNN\u2019s story may inadvertently mislead readers, although it is correct in its reporting as written. It states:\n\nThe FBI wasn\u2019t listening in June 2016, the sources said, when Donald Trump Jr. led a meeting that included Manafort, then campaign chairman, and Jared Kushner, the President\u2019s son-in-law, with a Russian lawyer who had promised negative information on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThat is precisely right, but GCHQ and other allied nations were listening, and once a broader FISA warrant was obtained, this recorded evidence was passed to the FBI. The notes taken from Mr. Manafort\u2019s phone were also obtained from this same exploit. Precisely like Sergei Kislyak, Paul Manafort, had he only known it, was \u2018wearing a wire\u2019 throughout the 2016 campaign. The FBI only reviewed that evidence once a FISA warrant covering Manafort was obtained. CNN\u2019s story says of the audio that exists in that respect:\n\nTwo of these sources, however, cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive.\n\nI am not sure whether CNN\u2019s sources have filled them in on, or are aware, of the entire picture. But I note that in December \u2013 which is after October, as the eagle-eyed among you will note \u2013 the FBI suddenly appeared to \u201cchange its mind\u201d over whether Russian hacking into the election, propaganda warfare, and so on, was done to benefit Donald Trump directly. Having not joined the CIA and NSA in their assessment of this, the FBI suddenly turned around and said \u201cYes, we agree the Russians were trying to help Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nThis is because, sources with knowledge believe, without certainty, that a further FISA warrant was obtained in December for the FBI to examine evidence the NSA had provided on encrypted communications, passed by iodine Xfer transfer, between the Russian bank servers and servers within Trump Tower and Spectrum Health, the company connected to Betsy De Vos and her brother Erik Prince. That was a refinement of the October warrant, because a health care company was used by the traitors since health data has high levels of protection under US law. To examine the packets \u2013 what was being sent to Moscow \u2013 the FBI had to demonstrate to the FISC court, which they successfully did in December, that what was being sent back and forth was not in fact \u2018health data\u2019 on Americans, but rather was encrypted messages between the traitors of the Trump campaign and their paymasters in Moscow.\n\nAs soon as that FISA warrant was granted, and James Comey was able legally to read the messages that the CIA and NSA already knew about, the FBI \u201csuddenly\u201d changed its mind on Russia\u2019s intentions with Trump. As I reported on Nov 7th, 2016, when breaking the story of the FBI\u2019s investigation into Trump and Russia, Director Comey was always concerned from the start of his work to ensure that criminal prosecutions had a basis of evidence that was legally obtained and legally read by the FBI."

    "text": "Which is the institution at the heart of Bob Mueller\u2019s \u2018mystery case\u2019 and why does it matter so much?\n\nBob Mueller does not leak. His team does not leak. The subject bank might leak, of course, but we are unlikely to find out, before the case is unsealed, who the mystery reluctant witness is. The leading possibilities, however, are all disastrous for Donald Trump and Jared Kushner. I am not a betting woman, but if I were, I should put a few roubles on Vnesheconombank or VEB, for reasons I explain below.\n\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible. If you can help us, please donate.\n\nThe Qatar Investment Authority\n\nThe analyst Marci Wheeler has been arguing that the mystery entity is the Qatar Investment Authority, whom Jared Kushner, I have suggested, was attempting to extort for money for his building at 666 Park Avenue. This is a popular theory and may well be true. Chris Geider reported that the Corporation was served the subpoena at its US offices.\n\nOnline detectives are trying to game out the institution\u2019s name from the redactions.\n\nWheeler pointed out that the QIA\u2019s New York offices are \u2018a two minute walk from Trump Towers\u2019. She notes that Qatar previously refused to give evidence on Jared Kushner to Mueller, for fear of Trump\u2019s retaliation. NBC News reported last year:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Qatari officials gathered evidence of what they claim is illicit influence by the United Arab Emirates on Jared Kushner and other Trump associates, including details of secret meetings, but decided not to give the information to special counsel Robert Mueller for fear of harming relations with the Trump administration, say three sources familiar with the Qatari discussions.\n\nHowever, the story goes on:\n\n\u201cOn the topic of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation: Qatar has not been approached nor has it considered approaching the Special Counsel\u2019s Office or any entity within the United States Government,\u201d said [Qatar\u2019s Ambassador to the US] Al Thani.\n\nHowever, the evidence described is not banking evidence primarily, and is not attributed to a bank but to diplomats \u2018familiar with Qatari internal discussions\u2019. As written, I suggest that this story is closer to my own theory that there is audio of Mr. Kushner or his representatives attempting to extort Qatar to invest in 666 Park Avenue, before changing US foreign policy against them when they refused.\n\nThe most important argument against the Qatar theory, I would argue, is that it is Robert Mueller who is bringing the case. Mueller is not bringing peripheral cases. His mandate is to investigate collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the election. Where he discovers other crimes arising, he can prosecute, but he has chosen not to do so. Michael Cohen\u2019s nonsense with Stormy Daniels and Trump was passed off to SDNY. Maria Butina\u2019s case was not a Bob Mueller case, not directly: as the DoJ website puts it:\n\nThe investigation into this matter was conducted by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office. The case is being prosecuted by the National Security Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia and the National Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nTherefore, the RDIF\u2019s involvement with Kirill Dimitriev in the Seychelles, and Qatar\u2019s refusal \u2013 at least initially \u2013 to comply with Jared Kushner\u2019s attempts at extortion \u2013 although deeply corrupt, and involving many of the personae who attacked our election, most of what we know about those institutions in public reporting occurred after the election was over. It is more likely that Mr. Mueller would hand such investigations to other divisions of the DOJ for prosecution.\n\nThe Russian Direct Investment Fund or the Central Bank of Russia\n\nThese are both state owned enterprises; they both might claim sovereign immunity; they both carry out business in the United States, and they are both connected to Mueller\u2019s inquiry. Alexander Torshin, the mentor of unregistered Russian agent Maria Butina, who admitted conspiring against the United States, is a Deputy Governor of Russia\u2019s Central Bank. It doesn\u2019t get more \u201csovereign wealth\u201d than that. I have reported that Russian money was washed into the GOP during the campaign with the connivance of the NRA, and that the FBI have recordings of this being discussed with multiple GOP bigwigs, including the former Speaker Paul Ryan and then Chairman of the GOP Reince Priebus. Certainly, with Butina in custody, the FBI would be interested in her efforts on Russia\u2019s behalf with Torshin. Mitigating against this, though, is the point that Butina\u2019s case is with the National Security Division, not Mueller.\n\nThe RDIF, or Sovereign Wealth Fund, suggested by some analysts, is also an attractive possibility. It could make an argument based on sovereignty, and it intersects with Mueller very firmly as we see Erik Prince being tasked by Mike Flynn and Jared Kushner; George Nader, the pedophile aide to the Crown Prince of the UAE and \u2018Mr. Fixit\u2019 who set up this meeting had done some data work for Trump during the election. However, again, the largest headlines for this matter are about things that occurred after the election of Trump, and Mueller\u2019s own prosecutions seem to be very tightly focused on his specific case; Russians attacking the US election and Americans lying to law enforcement or Congress about colluding with those Russians. Furthermore I have not been able easily to find offices in America for the Central Bank of Russia or the RDIF, although they may exist.\n\nThe Marcy Wheeler theory of Qatar would mean, if sustained, that Mueller was looking to them for evidence of a crime committed by Kushner \u2013 which Trump would be complicit in, changing US foreign policy for a bribe. The RDIF or Central Bank of Russia again, at the simplest level \u2013 considering this is a Mueller case \u2013 would mean Mueller was looking for data from financial arms of the Russian state implying criminal acts during the transition, and possibly relating to George Nader\u2019s data efforts. The last candidate, my own best guess, would be by far the worst news for Donald Trump. It was a bank whose boss was brought to Trump Tower at the request of the Russian Ambassador; it is a bank whose supervisory chairman is the actual Russian Prime Minister. If Mueller believes that VEB, Vnesheconombank, is holding evidence that links the Trump campaign to collusion with the Russian state, then the consequences for Donald Trump and those around him in the campaign are incalculably bad.\n\nMy Theory \u2013 Vnesheconombank\n\nVnesheconombank also fits the facts as we know it: the entity is a fully state-owned bank, it employs a legal team who have worked in Russian interests before, it will have \u2018commercial interests\u2019, it is wholly owned by the state (this detail ruled out Sberbank and Alfa Bank) and \u2018Country A\u2019 has argued that it would be required to violate its own laws by complying with Mueller\u2019s subpoena. This could refer to Russian data protection laws making it illegal for Russian banks to transfer data on Russian citizens without their consent outside of Russia, fitting better than the RDIF or the Central Bank.\n\nVnesheconombank also has offices in New York City, at 777 Third Avenue.\n\nWas Bob Mueller serving up a subpoena to Russia\u2019s Vnesheconombank at its offices on Third Avenue?\n\nVnesheconombank has perhaps the single greatest claim to \u201csovereign immunity\u201d outside of the Central Bank of Russia. As the New York Times reported in early 2017:\n\nVnesheconombank, or VEB, is no normal bank. It is wholly owned by the Russian state. It is intertwined with Russian intelligence. And the Russian prime minister is, by law, the chairman of its supervisory board.\n\nFamously, Sergey N. Gorkov, its chief, a former Russian spy, met with Jared Kushner during the transition. Now, one might argue that this is also part and parcel of post-election corruption, but the visit had several elements that tie it in to pre-election collusion as well; it was publicly tied to the lifting of sanctions, a key element, I have reported, and Chris Steele first reported, of the Trump-Russia \u201chacking help for sanctions lifting\u201d deal.\n\nVEB has quietly kept up appearances on Wall Street in the event that sanctions would be lifted, according to interviews with American bankers and former government officials\u2026.Mr. Gorkov met with bankers at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and another, unidentified American financial institution. Goldman Sachs bankers also tried to arrange a meeting but ultimately had a scheduling conflict. The meetings, which are not prohibited by sanctions, were confirmed by three people briefed on the discussions but unauthorized to speak publicly about them\n\nNow, such activity would certainly fall squarely within the government\u2019s case filings that speak of, as a concurring opinion in the case put it, \u2018the government\u2019s theory turned only on the \u201cconsiderable business\u201d of a U.S. office of the Corporation\u2019. Furthermore, the Gorkov-Kushner visit gave two different explanations for the reason that Kushner and Gorkov met with each other. The Trump White House, according to the New York Times, said \u201c[Ambassador] Kislyak requested the meeting and that \u201cMr. Kushner was acting in his capacity as a transition official.\u201d\u2019\n\nSuch an explanation, along with Kushner\u2019s attempt to establish a new \u201cbackchannel\u201d to Russia, would fall firmly within Mueller\u2019s criminal investigation. Sergei Kislyak met Republicans, including Trump, Priebus and Ryan, at the RNC, and discussed with them how to wash Russian money to the campaign. Kislyak also met Jeff Sessions, who then lied about it, causing him to be forced to recuse from this investigation. And Kislyak, Trump, Manafort and Epshteyn, I reported, were taped at the Mayflower hotel using Sergei Kislyak\u2019s hot-miked phone, discussing Carter Page taking an offer to Moscow; sanctions relief in exchange for hacking help.\n\nMr. Manafort, according to the Steele Dossier, was using Carter Page as his \u201cintermediary\u201d to Russia. Manafort was present at the Donald Trump Jr. meeting in Trump Tower.\n\nKushner\u2019s own explanation was contradicted by VEB.\n\nBut VEB said Mr. Gorkov had met with Mr. Kushner, who was still running his family\u2019s real estate company, to discuss business.\n\nThat would be because VEB, as representing the Russian state, could not do foreign policy business with Kushner while Obama was still President. It could also be that Gorkov offered Kushner a bribe, not directly through VEB, but via VTB or other companies with which they did business. It is more likely that Mueller would be interested in collusion with the Russian state during the election than corruption after it; nonetheless the fact that Kushner and VEB conflicted in their statements will surely be of interest to Mueller.\n\nFor all these reasons, and others which relate to the FISA warrants on two Russian banks which I first reported in October 2017 \u2013 reasons that I shall detail in my next piece \u2013 I believe that it is most likely that Vnesheconombank is the subject of the Mueller subpoena.

    "text": "It\u2019s been a strange two and a half years. From the first allegations, in July, 2016, of Russian meddling in the U.S. election campaign to the arrest of President Donald Trump\u2019s former adviser Roger Stone last week, many of us who write about Russia professionally, or who are Russian, have struggled to square what we know with the emerging narrative. In this story, Russia waged a sophisticated and audacious operation to subvert American elections and install a President of its choice\u2014it pulled off a coup. Tell that to your average American liberal, and you\u2019ll get a nod of recognition. Tell it to your average Russian liberal (admittedly a much smaller category), and you\u2019ll get uproarious laughter. Russians know that their state lacks the competence to mount a sophisticated sabotage effort, that the Kremlin was even more surprised by Trump\u2019s election than was the candidate himself, and that Russian-American relations are at their most dysfunctional since the height of the Cold War. And yet the indictments keep coming.\n\nReader, I think I\u2019ve finally figured it out. I don\u2019t mean that I\u2019ve figured out whether Russians influenced the outcome of the American election\u2014I doubt even the Robert Mueller investigation will be able to answer that question. I mean that I\u2019ve figured out how to think about what we know and not go crazy. The answer lies in the concept of the Mafia state. (And, no, I\u2019m not invoking the Mob because Stone encouraged an associate to behave like a character from \u201cThe Godfather Part II,\u201d as detailed in his indictment.)\n\nAs journalists who usually cover American politics have connected the dots of the story of Russian interference, those of us who normally write about Russia have cringed. Early on, it was common to point out that Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, who is now under arrest, worked for Viktor Yanukovych, who is often characterized as the \u201cpro-Russian President of Ukraine.\u201d In fact, there was no love lost between Putin and Yanukovych. After he was run out of town, during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, Yanukovych did seek refuge in Russia, but during his tenure as President he was an unreliable partner for Putin at best. Perhaps more to the point, he\u2019s a crook and a brute. He served time for robbery and assault before he became a politician, and he is wanted in Ukraine for treason, mass murder, and embezzlement. A visitor to Ukraine can take a tour of Yanukovych\u2019s palace, famous for its marble, crystal, immense scale, and a life-size solid-gold sculpture of a loaf of bread. Manafort made a career of working for the corrupt and the crooked. That in itself tells us little about Russia or its role in the 2016 campaign.\n\nWe cringed at headlines that claimed to have established a connection between the Kremlin and Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer who was at the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, and Manafort. Veselnitskaya represents a Russian company, Prevezon Holdings Ltd., which was investigated in New York for money laundering, and Veselnitskaya has been charged with lying to prosecutors about her working relationship with the Russian prosecutor general\u2019s office. Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York claim that Veselnitskaya collaborated with a lawyer in the Russian prosecutor\u2019s office to draft exculpatory documents for Prevezon. In media coverage, her e-mailing with a lawyer in the Russian prosecutor\u2019s office was portrayed as evidence of a direct line to Putin, suggesting that she met with Trump\u2019s campaign officials as his emissary. To me, it read as a lot of bluster on the part of a minor operator. From all the available evidence, and contrary to her sales pitch, Veselnitskaya did not have any dirt to offer on Hillary Clinton. To the extent that Veselnitskaya had established connections to high-level Russian officials, they were the kind that are necessary for a lawyer to be at all effective in a corrupt system.\n\nWe cringed at the characterization of the Russian online influence campaign as \u201csophisticated\u201d and \u201cvast\u201d: Russian reporting on the matter\u2014the best available\u2014convincingly portrayed the troll operation as small-time and ridiculous. It was, it seems, fraudulent in every way imaginable: it perpetrated fraud on American social networks, creating fake accounts and events and spreading falsehoods, but it was also fraudulent in its relationship to whoever was funding it, because surely crudely designed pictures depicting Hillary Clinton as Satan could not deliver anyone\u2019s money\u2019s worth.\n\nWhat we are observing is not most accurately described as the subversion of American democracy by a hostile power. Instead, it is an attempt at state capture by an international crime syndicate. What unites Yanukovych, Veselnitskaya, Manafort, Stone, WikiLeaks\u2019s Julian Assange, the Russian troll factory, the Trump campaign staffer George Papadopoulos and his partners in crime, the \u201cProfessor\u201d (whose academic credentials are in doubt), and the \u201cFemale Russian National\u201d (who appears to have fraudulently presented herself as Putin\u2019s niece) is that they are all crooks and frauds. This is not a moral assessment, or an attempt to downplay their importance. It is an attempt to stop talking in terms of states and geopolitics and begin looking at Mafias and profits.\n\nThe Hungarian sociologist B\u00e1lint Magyar, who created the concept of the \u201cpost-Communist mafia state,\u201d has just finished editing a new collection of articles called \u201cStubborn Structures: Reconceptualizing Post-Communist Regimes\u201d (to be published by C.E.U. Press early this year). In one of his own pieces in the collection, using Russia as an example, Magyar describes the Mafia state as one run by a \u201cpatron\u201d and his \u201ccourt\u201d\u2014put another way, the boss and his clan\u2014who appropriate public resources and the institutions of the state for their private use and profit. When I talked to Magyar on the phone on Monday, he told me that Trump is \u201clike a Mafia boss without a Mafia. Trump cannot transform the United States into a Mafia state, of course, but he still acts like a Mafia boss.\u201d Putin, on the other hand, \u201cis a Mafia boss with a real Mafia, which has turned the whole state into a criminal state.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cthe behavior at the top is the same.\u201d\n\nThe Mafia state is efficient in its own way. It does not take over all state institutions, but absorbs only the ones necessary for extracting profit. Some structures therefore continue to work as though they were part of a normal state. This may explain why we saw the official Russian foreign-policy establishment preparing, in the lead-up to the 2016 election, for a working relationship with the presumed Hillary Clinton Administration.\n\nWhen we think about a normal state, Magyar told me, \u201cthe assumption is that the state acts in the public interest, and if that doesn\u2019t happen, that\u2019s a deviation.\u201d That is true of how we think about democracies but also, to a large extent, of how we think about dictatorships as well: the dictator positions himself as the arbiter and sole representative of the national interest. A Mafia state, on the other hand, acts only in the personal profit-seeking interests of the clan. \u201cThat\u2019s not a deviation,\u201d Magyar said. \u201cIt\u2019s a substantive, structural characteristic of the state. The state itself, at the top, works as a criminal organization.\u201d\n\nWhen members of the American media cover the story of Russian meddling, they implicitly portray Russia as a normal state, and the influence operation as an undertaking of the state aimed at furthering Russia\u2019s national interests. This strikes Russians as absurd. By the measure of national interest, the Trump Presidency has been disappointing for Russia. Most of what Trump has given the Russian state has come through inaction: he has barely reacted to continued Russian aggression in Ukraine; he has failed to support NATO; and he has said that the U.S. will withdraw from Syria, although it looks like the withdrawal is unlikely to be fast or total. At the same time, diplomatic relations between Russia and the U.S. have deteriorated to the point of near-total dysfunction, and, despite considerable foot-dragging by the White House, the U.S. has continued to impose new sanctions on Russia.\n\nBy the metrics of a Mafia state, though, the Trump Presidency has yielded great results for Russia. A Mafia boss craves respect, loyalty, and perceived power. Trump\u2019s deference to Putin and the widespread public perception of Putin\u2019s influence over Trump have lifted Putin\u2019s stature beyond what I suspect could have been his wildest dreams. As happens in a Mafia state, most of the benefit accrues to the patron personally. But some of the profit goes to the clan. Over the weekend, we learned that the Treasury Department has lifted sanctions on companies that belong to Oleg Deripaska, a member of Putin\u2019s \u201ccourt\u201d who once lent millions of dollars to Manafort. If a ragtag team employed by or otherwise connected to the Russian Mafia state tried to aid a similar collection of crooks and frauds to elect Trump\u2014as it increasingly looks like they did\u2014then the Deripaska news helps explain their motivations. The story is not that Putin is masterminding a vast and brilliant attack on Western democracy. The story, it appears, is that the Russian Mafia state is cultivating profit-yielding relationships with the aspiring Mafia boss of the U.S. and his band of crooks, subverting democratic institutions in the process."

    "text": "According to ABC News, the \u2018blocked numbers\u2019 Donald J Trump Jr called about his meeting with the Russian FSB asset Natalia Veselnitskaya include Howard Lorber. Donald Trump is gloating about this on Twitter this morning:\n\nJust out: The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. They were made to friends & business associates of Don. Really sad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2019\n\nThe trouble Messers. Trump and Trump Jr have about this revelation is that Howard Lorber fits extremely neatly into what we know about Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s collusion with the Russian state. A name not much floated in the mainstream press after 2016, but familiar to followers of the citizen journalism research group #TeamPatriot on Twitter, Lorber was a major contributor to the \u2018Trump Victory\u2019 Fund, and, more significantly, he was linked to Trump Moscow, and to Michael and Bryan Cohen.\n\nThe best mainstream reporting we have on Lorber is Josh Rogin\u2019s piece of August 2016 for the Washington Post. Rogin made it clear that that Lorber was tied to Russia in general and Trump Tower Moscow in particular. Rogin\u2019s piece also dwells on the fact that Lorber brought Trump to Russia as far back as 1996, and was an initial mover of the Trump Moscow project.\n\nBusinessman and investor Howard Lorber already donated $100,000 to the Trump Victory fund, has been named as one of Trump\u2019s \u201cbest friends\u201d and even appeared once on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d He is also president and chief executive of the Vector Group, a holding company that has various business interests in Russia. In 1996, Lorber brought Trump to Moscow to look for opportunities for Trump to lend his famous name to development projects there\u2026.\n\nAt that time, Trump and Lorber were discussing Trump building a huge luxury residential tower in Moscow as part of a project owned by a subsidiary of Lorber\u2019s firm.\n\nMichael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea of lying to Congress about Trump Tower Moscow, and Rudy Giuliani\u2019s disastrous admission that negotiations on the project had gone on \u2018until November\u2019 of 2016, make the Lorber name, in connection with Don Jr, extraordinarily significant.\n\nThe facts suggest that whatever Donald Trump Jr said to Mr. Lorber when he called him on this occasion, that the Russian meeting about offering dirt on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2013 part of the Russian government\u2019s support for Trump, as Don Jr was told \u2013 the call was placed to Lorber by Don Jr because Lorber was going to help launder Russian financial help into the Trump campaign.\n\n\ufeffPatribotics is grateful for the readers who make our reporting possible. Your support helps us break stories and analyze all the key events on Trump and Russia. Please consider a donation here\n\nWhen I broke the story that the FBI were investigating the Trump campaign on Nov 7th, 2016, I reported that the FISA was targeted on \u2018two Russian banks\u2019 but covered \u2018any US person\u2019 in relation to these specific activities. For that, one may read \u2018packet data\u2019, as what was being sent between the Trump Tower server and Alfa Bank involved US persons to do with the campaign. The warrants in some way also sought permission for the FBI to listen to \u201cintelligence provided by friendly foreign agencies\u201d on US persons, I reported.\n\nBoth the Guardian and the BBC subsequently said that my accounts of the FISA warrant, and the turning down of James Comey\u2019s attempts in the summer to obtain a FISA warrant on Carter Page, Boris Epshteyn, and Paul Manafort, were correct. (The Guardian took two separate stories to do so; first they acknowledged that my account of the failed summer FISA applications on Trump campaign personnel was correct, and later, that my account of the granted FISA targeted on the two Russian banks was correct.)\n\n\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Paul Wood reported in January 2017. His piece was much wider than my own. Here are some of the relevant passages:\n\nAt the same time a joint taskforce, which includes the CIA and the FBI, has been investigating allegations that the Russians may have sent money to Mr Trump\u2019s organisation or his election campaign\u2026. a joint intelligence and law enforcement taskforce has been looking at allegations that the Kremlin paid money to his campaign through his associates.\n\nHoward Lorber donated to Trump Victory; Howard Lorber was instrumental in Trump Tower Moscow.\n\n(This joint Taskforce was separately reported by McClatchyDC.)\n\nWood\u2019s seminal piece continues:\n\nThe former MI6 agent\u2019s report detailed alleged attempts by the Kremlin to offer Mr Trump lucrative \u201csweetheart deals\u201d in Russia that would buy his loyalty.\n\nAgain, this sounds much like Trump Tower Moscow, started by Howard Lorber, about which Michael Cohen pled guilty about lying to Congress?\n\nLast April, the CIA director was shown intelligence that worried him. It was \u2013 allegedly \u2013 a tape recording of a conversation about money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign.\n\nAs I have reported, this intelligence was supplied by Estonia\u2019s world-class intelligence agency, Teabeamet. When the history of Trump Russia is eventually written, Teabeamet\u2019s role will loom large.\n\nMichael Cohen lied about Trump Tower Moscow, Howard Lorber started Trump Tower Moscow \u2013 surely real estate will be seen as a major vehicle by which Russia both laundered money to Trump and had its money laundered by Trump. Michael Cohen, according to the Wall Street Journal, purchased an apartment he had no real means to buy while the developers \u2013 including Lorber \u2013 held the note:\n\nMichael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer who is under federal investigation, bought a $6.7 million apartment in April in a new Manhattan skyscraper that is being developed by two of Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime friends, according to people familiar with the transaction.\n\nLocated at 111 Murray Street in Manhattan\u2019s Tribeca neighborhood, the project is being developed by a partnership of real estate companies Fisher Brothers, Witkoff and New Valley. New Valley is headed by Howard Lorber, a real estate developer and longtime friend of Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Cohen financed the purchase by securing a $3.5 million short-term mortgage from the developers, rather than getting financing from a bank, according to public records. While developers occasionally offer to finance purchases in their projects, such developer financing is unusual in Manhattan, real-estate attorneys say.\n\nHoward Lorber defended Trump paying no taxes in 2016. He was also singled out by Trump in his victory speech in his New York primary in April 2016 \u2013 exactly the time that Estonian intelligence were passing the \u2018money laundering\u2019 tape to the director of the CIA.\n\nBut there is more. Howard Lorber, according to reporting, is also involved with Douglas Elliman. (Yes, I know, I enjoy their listings too). Lorber\u2019s company Vector Group is the parent company of the famous real estate broker. Cohen\u2019s younger brother, Bryan, was reported to have received $7m in payments after he started working for Elliman, and thereby Howard Lorber, from a Ukranian \u201cagribusiness. \u201c\n\n\n\nIt was Bryan Cohen\u2019s father in law, Alex Oronov, who died after arranging Michael Cohen\u2019s meeting with Ukranian pro-Putin politician Andrey Artemenko and Felix Sater. Oronov was shown to have an apartment in Trump Hollywood. Buzzfeed News\u2019s Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier rubbished the reporting of Oronov\u2019s death as suspicious:\n\nSome commentators have drawn a link between Oronov and the president by noting that Oronov owns property in Trump Hollywood, a condo tower in South Florida. But the Trump Organization has no connection to sales in that development, which merely leases the Trump name.\n\nSadly the Trump Organization did not get the Leopold-Cormier memo, as it quite literally lists Trump Hollywood as among its \u2018Real Estate Portfolio\u2019, devoting an entire page to it on the organisation\u2019s website.\n\nAlex Oronov, father in law of Howard Lorber employee Bryan Cohen, lived here at some time before his untimely death.\n\nIf the Trump Tower meeting was \u2018a bust\u2019, as NSA veteran John Schindler has argued \u2013 the Russian side expected a commitment on sanctions, Don Jr and Paul Manafort expected immediate dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2013 it makes no difference to the Trump-Russia prosecutorial path. The attempt to collude and intent to collude is what counts. A call placed by Don Jr to Howard Lorber on a blocked number fits the idea that Russia was offering incentives, including money laundering via Trump Tower Moscow. It fits the description in the GRU\u2019s indictment by Mueller of multiple failed attempts to deliver the DNC emails to Wikileaks starting in June 2016:\n\nAfter failed attempts to transfer the stolen documents starting in late June 2016, on or about July 14, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, sent Organization 1 an email with an attachment titled \u201cwk dnc link1.txt.gpg.\u201d\n\nThe Lorber-Cohen-Trump Moscow connection is extremely strong, and it ties Donald Trump Jr directly to the events described in the Steele Dossier.\n\nIt was reported that Spanish intelligence had intercepted Alexander Torshin\u2019s calls to the money launderer Alexander Romanov and \u2018Mr Trump\u2019s son\u2019 \u201cshould be concerned\u201d. While most reporting concentrated on the NRA donor and Russian agent Maria Butina\u2019s mentor Mr. Torshin, it is worth noting what Romanov was convicted of. His money laundering was done through property purchases \u2013 exactly what Mr. Lorber specializes in.\n\nIf nothing of substance happened at the opening meeting, but Donald J Trump Jr believed he was going to get \u201cdirt on Clinton\u201d and Russia believed they were going to get \u201csanctions relief\u201d, Don Jr\u2019s call to Lorber may be seen as something suggested by those present to get the ball rolling in terms of Russian money to the campaign. We will have another post shortly on the Mueller Mystery Case and what it means to Don Jr.\n\nLet\u2019s finish by noting that Donald Trump threw his own son under the bus on Twitter. Howard Lorber is first and foremost Trump Sr\u2019s friend, but his dad described Lorber only in terms of knowing Junior. Patribotics own earlier reporting was not that anybody called Donald Trump, but that Donald Trump directly called into a Trump Tower meeting with Russians \u2013 whether it was this meeting or another, sources did not specify.\n\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here .

Buzzfeed News\u2019s Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier rubbished the reporting of Oronov\u2019s death as suspicious:\n\nSome commentators have drawn a link between Oronov and the president by noting that Oronov owns property in Trump Hollywood, a condo tower in South Florida. But the Trump Organization has no connection to sales in that development, which merely leases the Trump name.\n\nSadly the Trump Organization did not get the Leopold-Cormier memo, as it quite literally lists Trump Hollywood as among its \u2018Real Estate Portfolio\u2019, devoting an entire page to it on the organisation\u2019s website.\n\nAlex Oronov, father in law of Howard Lorber employee Bryan Cohen, lived here at some time before his untimely death.\n\nIf the Trump Tower meeting was \u2018a bust\u2019, as NSA veteran John Schindler has argued \u2013 the Russian side expected a commitment on sanctions, Don Jr and Paul Manafort expected immediate dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2013 it makes no difference to the Trump-Russia prosecutorial path. The attempt to collude and intent to collude is what counts. A call placed by Don Jr to Howard Lorber on a blocked number fits the idea that Russia was offering incentives, including money laundering via Trump Tower Moscow. It fits the description in the GRU\u2019s indictment by Mueller of multiple failed attempts to deliver the DNC emails to Wikileaks starting in June 2016:\n\nAfter failed attempts to transfer the stolen documents starting in late June 2016, on or about July 14, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, sent Organization 1 an email with an attachment titled \u201cwk dnc link1.txt.gpg.\u201d\n\nThe Lorber-Cohen-Trump Moscow connection is extremely strong, and it ties Donald Trump Jr directly to the events described in the Steele Dossier.\n\nIt was reported that Spanish intelligence had intercepted Alexander Torshin\u2019s calls to the money launderer Alexander Romanov and \u2018Mr Trump\u2019s son\u2019 \u201cshould be concerned\u201d. While most reporting concentrated on the NRA donor and Russian agent Maria Butina\u2019s mentor Mr. Torshin, it is worth noting what Romanov was convicted of. His money laundering was done through property purchases \u2013 exactly what Mr. Lorber specializes in.\n\nIf nothing of substance happened at the opening meeting, but Donald J Trump Jr believed he was going to get \u201cdirt on Clinton\u201d and Russia believed they were going to get \u201csanctions relief\u201d, Don Jr\u2019s call to Lorber may be seen as something suggested by those present to get the ball rolling in terms of Russian money to the campaign. We will have another post shortly on the Mueller Mystery Case and what it means to Don Jr.\n\nLet\u2019s finish by noting that Donald Trump threw his own son under the bus on Twitter. Howard Lorber is first and foremost Trump Sr\u2019s friend, but his dad described Lorber only in terms of knowing Junior. Patribotics own earlier reporting was not that anybody called Donald Trump, but that Donald Trump directly called into a Trump Tower meeting with Russians \u2013 whether it was this meeting or another, sources did not specify.\n\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here .

    "text": "Special counsel Robert Mueller had spent nine months on the job with little evidence that he was focusing on his original mandate: to investigate Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOn Friday, a stunning new court document from Mueller changed that.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMueller\u2019s detailed indictment against 13 Russian nationals and a trio of Russian entities for illegal election activities, largely favoring then-candidate Donald Trump, sent a powerful signal that his team of prosecutors and FBI agents never took their eye off their initial directive of uncovering Russia\u2019s fingerprints on the election \u2014 even as outsiders had shifted their focus to the second-order question of whether President Trump might have tried to obstruct justice.\n\nThe May 17 order from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein appointing Mueller as special counsel to lead the FBI\u2019s Russia probe called the move part of the Justice Department\u2019s effort \u201cto ensure a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\u201d\n\nAnd that was the core question Mueller returned to Friday, with an indictment that detailed a Russian \u201cinformation warfare\u201d operation that sowed dissent and confusion among American voters to the benefit of Trump and the detriment of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s described in this indictment is the heart of the matter,\u201d said William Jeffress, a Washington-based white-collar attorney who represented Richard Nixon after he left the White House.\n\nTrump and his attorneys signaled in the hours after the indictment\u2019s release that they were vindicated by where it stopped. \u201cVery happy,\u201d the president\u2019s personal lawyer, John Dowd, told POLITICO. Trump himself celebrated on Twitter, saying that Mueller\u2019s showed that his campaign \u201cdid nothing wrong - no collusion!\u201d\n\nBut veterans of criminal investigations said the president\u2019s celebration may be premature.\n\nWhile the indictment says three Trump campaign officials may have played \u201cunwitting\u201d roles in the specific Russian election interference it describes, the document draws no broader conclusions about any potential Trump campaign ties to the Kremlin \u2014 which has been alleged to take many different forms beyond the focus of Friday\u2019s charges.\n\nAnd they noted that Mueller\u2019s latest move appears to establish the critical basis to charge American co-conspirators in the Russian election effort. Before Friday, it was unclear what crimes any U.S. persons might have been aiding or abetting. Now, a legal framework exists for criminal charges against Americans \u2014 including ones who do not show up in Friday\u2019s court document.\n\nThe indictment mentions conspirators both known and \"unknown\" to the grand jury, legal experts noted.\n\n\u201cThis language is purposeful,\u201d said Elizabeth de la Vega, a former assistant U.S. attorney from the Northern District of California. \u201cIt unmistakably indicates there is much more to the story.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of a conspiracy indicting parties \u2018known and unknown\u2019 as a Matroyshka doll,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are many more layers to be successively revealed over time.\u201d\n\nJoyce Vance, a former U.S. Attorney from Northern Alabama, said Mueller\u2019s indictment now sends the signal that he believes it\u2019s a federal crime for a foreign national to try and interfere in a U.S. election.\n\n\u201cThat means any American who met with Russians in an effort to receive election assistance, also committed a crime,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd any efforts to cover that conduct up would be a very serious obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s indictment also puts an exclamation point on findings from the U.S. intelligence community that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election, both to disrupt the U.S. political system and out of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s longstanding animus for Clinton.\n\nWhile Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on those findings \u2014 Trump said during one October 2016 presidential debate that the hackers stealing Democratic emails \u201ccould be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds\u201d \u2014 the indictment presented evidence specific enough to form the basis of federal criminal charges.\n\n\u201cFrankly, Trump is the only one who says there\u2019s no meddling. This lays it out chapter and verse,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former federal prosecutor who served as a deputy to the mid-2000s federal investigation into the leak of former CIA operative Valerie Plame\u2019s identity.\n\nSeveral Democrats said Friday that Mueller\u2019s latest indictment should put to rest claims that the notion of Russian election interference is some kind of hoax, and freshly underscores the need for Mueller to complete his investigation with full political independence.\n\nTrump himself is under investigation for his attempts to tamp down the original probe, including the May 2017 firing of FBI Director James Comey \u2014 a move which prompted Rosensetein to appoint Mueller. More than 20 current and former White House aides have already met with Mueller as part of his wider inquiry \u2013 former Trump strategist Steven Bannon had multiple interviews earlier this week with the special counsel \u2014 and Mueller is seeking to ask Trump himself about the subject.\n\nMeanwhile, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates are facing multiple charges \u2014 including money laundering and failing to register as foreign agents for lobbying work unrelated to the 2016 election. The federal judge overseeing the case has suggested a trial could start in the fall, though it\u2019s unclear if that will happen. CNN reported on Thursday that Gates is talking with Mueller\u2019s office about a plea deal in exchange for his cooperation. POLITICO has not been able to independently confirm that report.\n\nFriday\u2019s shift to the Russians\u2019 social media campaign to influence voter behavior is unlikely to play out in the same way as the Manafort-Gates case given the defendants are all foreign nationals.\n\n\u201cHow are you actually going to do anything against these guys if they all stay hidden in Russia?\u201d said Clint Watts, a former FBI agent and expert on Russian disinformation.\n\nMueller\u2019s rollout Friday also came with an added wrinkle: a rare press conference to announce the charges from Rosenstein, the No. 2 official at DOJ who has supervising authority over Mueller and the whole Russia case. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation after charges that he provided inaccurate accounts of his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. while serving as a key surrogate and adviser for the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nTrump has fumed over Rosenstein\u2019s handing of the Russia investigation. But the optics of Friday\u2019s press conference showed the deputy attorney general squarely in charge of the investigation. They also aligned with Rosenstein\u2019s previous claims that he was aware of and closely monitoring the special counsel investigation, which some Republican critics have portrayed as unmanaged and out of control.\n\n\u201cThe window for Trump to fire Mueller or Rosenstein is now closed,\u201d de la Vega said. \u201cIt is painted shut.\u201d\n\nBut Randall Samborn, a former assistant U.S. attorney and spokesman on the Plame investigation, said he is not convinced that the deputy attorney general\u2019s job is safe.\n\n\u201cIt could cut either way,\u201d Samborn said. \u201cIt gives them protection from naysayers on Capitol Hill but it may even put him in more jeopardy in the eyes of the president and his allies, who now see him in concert with Mueller. You can see this as both helping and hurting the longevity at the same time.\u201d\n\nAs they digested Friday\u2019s findings, Democrats and legal experts said it had piqued their interest in what other Americans might turn up in what are presumed to be more indictments on the way from the special counsel.\n\n\u201cThe next step obviously is for the grand jury to decide whether there were any U.S. persons who are part of the conspiracy,\u201d said Jeffress, who represented I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, a senior George W. Bush White House aide ultimately charged in the Plame case.\n\n\u201cI suspect their names will be known to us soon,\u201d New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.\n\nJosh Gerstein contributed reporting."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The Department of Justice announced that a grand jury in the District of Columbia today returned an indictment presented by the Special Counsel\u2019s Office. The indictment charges thirteen Russian nationals and three Russian companies for committing federal crimes while seeking to interfere in the United States political system, including the 2016 Presidential election. The defendants allegedly conducted what they called \u201cinformation warfare against the United States,\u201d with the stated goal of \u201cspread[ing] distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis indictment serves as a reminder that people are not always who they appear to be on the Internet,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. \u201cThe indictment alleges that the Russian conspirators want to promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed. The Department of Justice will continue to work cooperatively with other law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and with the Congress, to defend our nation against similar current and future schemes. I want to thank the federal agents and prosecutors working on this case for their exceptional service. And we received exceptional cooperation from private sector companies like Facebook, Oath, PayPal, and Twitter.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to the allegations in the indictment, twelve of the individual defendants worked at various times for Internet Research Agency LLC, a Russian company based in St. Petersburg, Russia. The other individual defendant, Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin, funded the conspiracy through companies known as Concord Management and Consulting LLC, Concord Catering, and many subsidiaries and affiliates. The conspiracy was part of a larger operation called \u201cProject Lakhta.\u201d Project Lakhta included multiple components, some involving domestic audiences within the Russian Federation and others targeting foreign audiences in multiple countries.\n\n\n\nInternet Research Agency allegedly operated through Russian shell companies. It employed hundreds of persons for its online operations, ranging from creators of fictitious personas to technical and administrative support, with an annual budget of millions of dollars. Internet Research Agency was a structured organization headed by a management group and arranged in departments, including graphics, search-engine optimization, information technology, and finance departments. In 2014, the agency established a \u201ctranslator project\u201d to focus on the U.S. population. In July 2016, more than 80 employees were assigned to the translator project.\n\n\n\nTwo of the defendants allegedly traveled to the United States in 2014 to collect intelligence for their American political influence operations.\n\n\n\nTo hide the Russian origin of their activities, the defendants allegedly purchased space on computer servers located within the United States in order to set up a virtual private network. The defendants allegedly used that infrastructure to establish hundreds of accounts on social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, making it appear that the accounts were controlled by persons within the United States. They used stolen or fictitious American identities, fraudulent bank accounts, and false identification documents. The defendants posed as politically and socially active Americans, advocating for and against particular political candidates. They established social media pages and groups to communicate with unwitting Americans. They also purchased political advertisements on social media.\n\n\n\nThe Russians also recruited and paid real Americans to engage in political activities, promote political campaigns, and stage political rallies. The defendants and their co-conspirators pretended to be grassroots activists. According to the indictment, the Americans did not know that they were communicating with Russians.\n\n\n\nAfter the election, the defendants allegedly staged rallies to support the President-elect while simultaneously staging rallies to protest his election. For example, the defendants organized one rally to support the President-elect and another rally to oppose him\u2014both in New York, on the same day.\n\n\n\nOn September 13, 2017, soon after the news media reported that the Special Counsel\u2019s Office was investigating evidence that Russian operatives had used social media to interfere in the 2016 election, one defendant allegedly wrote, \u201cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity.... So, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with my colleagues.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe indictment includes eight criminal counts. Count One alleges a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States, by all of the defendants. The defendants allegedly conspired to defraud the United States by impairing the lawful functions of the Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of State in administering federal requirements for disclosure of foreign involvement in certain domestic activities.\n\n\n\nCount Two charges conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud by Internet Research Agency and two individual defendants.\n\n\n\nCounts Three through Eight charge aggravated identity theft by Internet Research Agency and four individuals.\n\n\n\nThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged unlawful activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nEveryone charged with a crime is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in court. At trial, prosecutors must introduce credible evidence that is sufficient to prove each defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, to the unanimous satisfaction of a jury of twelve citizens.\n\n\n\nThe Special Counsel's investigation is ongoing. There will be no comments from the Special Counsel at this time."

    "text": "The unsealing of an indictment charging Zhu Hua (\u6731\u534e), aka Afwar, aka CVNX, aka Alayos, aka Godkiller; and Zhang Shilong (\u5f20\u58eb\u9f99), aka Baobeilong, aka Zhang Jianguo, aka Atreexp, both nationals of the People\u2019s Republic of China (China), with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft was announced today.\n\nThe announcement was made by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman for the Southern District of New York, Director Christopher A. Wray of the FBI, Director Dermot F. O\u2019Reilly of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) of the U.S. Department of Defense, and Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.\n\nZhu and Zhang were members of a hacking group operating in China known within the cyber security community as Advanced Persistent Threat 10 (the APT10 Group). The defendants worked for a company in China called Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company (Huaying Haitai) and acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security\u2019s Tianjin State Security Bureau.\n\nThrough their involvement with the APT10 Group, from at least in or about 2006 up to and including in or about 2018, Zhu and Zhang conducted global campaigns of computer intrusions targeting, among other data, intellectual property and confidential business and technological information at managed service providers (MSPs), which are companies that remotely manage the information technology infrastructure of businesses and governments around the world, more than 45 technology companies in at least a dozen U.S. states, and U.S. government agencies. The APT10 Group targeted a diverse array of commercial activity, industries and technologies, including aviation, satellite and maritime technology, industrial factory automation, automotive supplies, laboratory instruments, banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, computer processor technology, information technology services, packaging, consulting, medical equipment, healthcare, biotechnology, pharmaceutical manufacturing, mining, and oil and gas exploration and production. Among other things, Zhu and Zhang registered IT infrastructure that the APT10 Group used for its intrusions and engaged in illegal hacking operations.\n\n\u201cThe indictment alleges that the defendants were part of a group that hacked computers in at least a dozen countries and gave China\u2019s intelligence service access to sensitive business information,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. \u201cThis is outright cheating and theft, and it gives China an unfair advantage at the expense of law-abiding businesses and countries that follow the international rules in return for the privilege of participating in the global economic system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is galling that American companies and government agencies spent years of research and countless dollars to develop their intellectual property, while the defendants simply stole it and got it for free\u201d said U.S. Attorney Berman. \u201cAs a nation, we cannot, and will not, allow such brazen thievery to go unchecked.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealthy competition is good for the global economy, but criminal conduct is not. This is conduct that hurts American businesses, American jobs, and American consumers,\u201d said FBI Director Wray. \u201cNo country should be able to flout the rule of law \u2013 so we\u2019re going to keep calling out this behavior for what it is: illegal, unethical, and unfair. It's going to take all of us working together to protect our economic security and our way of life, because the American people deserve no less.\"\n\n\u201cThe theft of sensitive defense technology and cyber intrusions are major national security concerns and top investigative priorities for the DCIS,\u201d said DCIS Director O\u2019Reilly. \u201cThe indictments unsealed today are the direct result of a joint investigative effort between DCIS and its law enforcement partners to vigorously investigate individuals and groups who illegally access information technology systems of the U.S. Department of Defense and the Defense Industrial Base. DCIS remains vigilant in our efforts to safeguard the integrity of the Department of Defense and its enterprise of information technology systems.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations in the Indictment unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:\n\nOverview\n\nZhu Hua (\u6731\u534e), aka Afwar, aka CVNX, aka Alayos, aka Godkiller, and Zhang Shilong (\u5f20\u58eb\u9f99), aka Baobeilong, aka Zhang Jianguo, aka Atreexp, the defendants, both nationals of China, were members of a hacking group operating in China known within the cyber security community as the APT10 Group, or alternatively as \u201cRed Apollo,\u201d \u201cCVNX,\u201d \u201cStone Panda,\u201d \u201cMenuPass,\u201d and \u201cPOTASSIUM.\u201d The defendants worked for Huaying Haitai in Tianjin, China, and acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security\u2019s Tianjin State Security Bureau. From at least in or about 2006 up to and including in or about 2018, members of the APT10 Group, including Zhu and Zhang, conducted extensive campaigns of intrusions into computer systems around the world. The APT10 Group used some of the same online facilities to initiate, facilitate and execute its campaigns during the conspiracy.\n\nMost recently, beginning at least in or about 2014, members of the APT10 Group, including Zhu and Zhang, engaged in an intrusion campaign to obtain unauthorized access to the computers and computer networks of MSPs for businesses and governments around the world (the MSP Theft Campaign). The APT10 Group targeted MSPs in order to leverage the MSPs\u2019 networks to gain unauthorized access to the computers and computer networks of the MSPs\u2019 clients and to steal, among other data, intellectual property and confidential business data on a global scale. For example, through the MSP Theft Campaign, the APT10 Group obtained unauthorized access to the computers of an MSP that had offices in the Southern District of New York and compromised the data of that MSP and certain of its clients involved in banking and finance, telecommunications and consumer electronics, medical equipment, packaging, manufacturing, consulting, healthcare, biotechnology, automotive, oil and gas exploration, and mining.\n\nEarlier, beginning in or about 2006, members of the APT10 Group, including Zhu and Zhang, engaged in an intrusion campaign to obtain unauthorized access to the computers and computer networks of more than 45 technology companies and U.S. government agencies, in order to steal information and data concerning a number of technologies (the Technology Theft Campaign). Through the Technology Theft Campaign, the APT10 Group stole hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data and targeted the computers of victim companies involved in aviation, space and satellite technology, manufacturing technology, pharmaceutical technology, oil and gas exploration and production technology, communications technology, computer processor technology, and maritime technology.\n\nIn furtherance of the APT10 Group\u2019s intrusion campaigns, Zhu and Zhang, among other things, worked for Huaying Haitai and registered malicious domains and infrastructure. In addition, Zhu, a penetration tester, engaged in hacking operations on behalf of the APT10 Group and recruited other individuals to the APT10 Group, and Zhang developed and tested malware for the APT10 Group.\n\nThe MSP Theft Campaign\n\nIn furtherance of the MSP Theft Campaign, Zhu, Zhang, and their co-conspirators in the APT10 Group engaged in the following criminal conduct:\n\nFirst, after the APT10 Group gained unauthorized access into the computers of an MSP, the APT10 Group installed multiple variants of malware on MSP computers around the world. To avoid antivirus detection, the malware was installed using malicious files that masqueraded as legitimate files associated with the victim computer\u2019s operating system. Such malware enabled members of the APT10 Group to monitor victims\u2019 computers remotely and steal user credentials.\n\nSecond, after stealing administrative credentials from computers of an MSP, the APT10 Group used those stolen credentials to connect to other systems within an MSP and its clients\u2019 networks. This enabled the APT10 Group to move laterally through an MSP\u2019s network and its clients\u2019 networks and to compromise victim computers that were not yet infected with malware.\n\nThird, after identifying data of interest on a compromised computer and packaging it for exfiltration using encrypted archives, the APT10 Group used stolen credentials to move the data of an MSP client to one or more other compromised computers of the MSP or its other clients\u2019 networks before exfiltrating the data to other computers controlled by the APT10 Group.\n\nOver the course of the MSP Theft Campaign, Zhu, Zhang, and their co-conspirators in the APT10 Group successfully obtained unauthorized access to computers providing services to or belonging to victim companies located in at least 12 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The victim companies included at least the following: a global financial institution, three telecommunications and/or consumer electronics companies; three companies involved in commercial or industrial manufacturing; two consulting companies; a healthcare company; a biotechnology company; a mining company; an automotive supplier company; and a drilling company.\n\nThe Technology Theft Campaign\n\nOver the course of the Technology Theft Campaign, which began in or about 2006, Zhu, Zhang, and their coconspirators in the APT10 Group successfully obtained unauthorized access to the computers of more than 45 technology companies and U.S. Government agencies based in at least 12 states, including Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. The APT10 Group stole hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data and information from the victims\u2019 computer systems, including from at least the following victims: seven companies involved in aviation, space and/or satellite technology; three companies involved in communications technology; three companies involved in manufacturing advanced electronic systems and/or laboratory analytical instruments; a company involved in maritime technology; a company involved in oil and gas drilling, production, and processing; and the NASA Goddard Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In addition to those victims who had information stolen, Zhu, Zhang, and their co-conspirators successfully obtained unauthorized access to computers belonging to more than 25 other technology-related companies involved in, among other things, industrial factory automation, radar technology, oil exploration, information technology services, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and computer processor technology, as well as the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nFinally, the APT10 Group compromised more than 40 computers in order to steal sensitive data belonging to the Navy, including the names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, salary information, personal phone numbers, and email addresses of more than 100,000 Navy personnel.\n\n* * *\n\nZhu and Zhang are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison.\n\nThe maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the assigned judge. The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nThe case was investigated by the FBI, including the New Orleans, New Haven, Houston, New York, Sacramento, and San Antonio Field Offices; DCIS; and the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Berman and Mr. Demers praised the outstanding investigative work of, and collaboration among, the FBI, DCIS, and NCIS. They also thanked the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Connecticut, and the Department of Defense\u2019s Computer Forensic Laboratory for their assistance in the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Sagar K. Ravi of the Southern District of New York\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit is in charge of the prosecution, with assistance provided by Trial Attorney Matthew Chang of the National Security Division\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section."

    "text": "Enter \"The Donald.\"\n\nDonald Trump \u2014 famous businessman, famous reality TV star, famous rich person, famous hair \u2014 told the world in a speech from New York City on Tuesday that he will run for president of the United States in 2016, something he's talked about for decades but had never formally done.\n\nSee also: Donald Trump Got Tricked Into Retweeting an Image of Serial Killers\n\nSo he's for real this time. We think. It's kind of strange to say, since Trump's political persona has been one of pure bluster until this point. To show you what we mean, we've detailed his history of almost candidacies, below.\n\n1988\n\nImage: Wilbur Funches/Associated Press\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of supporters in the presidential primary state of New Hampshire in 1987, Trump lambasted Japan and said Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is a \"son of a bitch...like nobody's ever seen,\" but said he would not be running for president. He had also drafted an \"open letter\" to America, which was printed in the form of a full-page ad in various newspapers.\n\n2000\n\nImage: Ed Bailey/Associated Press\n\nTrump quit the Republican Party for the Reform Party ahead of the 2000 election. If he ran for president that year, he said media mogul Oprah Winfrey would be a great running mate. Trump said he could be president because, as a casino mogul, he understood the bad times and the better times.\n\nDuring this same election cycle, Trump proposed a huge one-time tax levied on the wealthy that he said would instantly erase the nation's debt.\n\n2004\n\nImage: Ed Bailey/Associated Press\n\nAhead of the 2004 race, Trump said he was \"very seriously\" considering a run. Very seriously.\n\n2008\n\nImage: Eric Jamison /Associated Press\n\nTwo years before, in 2006, there was much hype surrounding a possible Trump bid for New York governor. That (please contain your surprise) didn't happen. But Trump did mention he could run for office in the future. While he didn't specifically mention the White House this time around, The New York Post reported that Trump was thinking about running as an independent in 2008.\n\n2012\n\nImage: Bill Clark/Associated Press\n\nTrump was all about running in 2012 until he, you know, backed out again.\n\nHe tried over and over to drum up the idea that President Barack Obama\u2014his would-be opponent\u2014wasn't even born in the U.S. That was disproved, but Trump isn't one to bow his head in the face of things like official birth certificates. Though he withdrew his bid, Trump did so while saying he still thought he would \"be able to win the primary and, ultimately the general election.\"\n\nIf he was that confident while not running four years ago, just imagine his confidence now.\n\n2016\n\nThis time, in 2016, Trump says he is serious. To prove this, he launched his campaign with a speech that touched on China, cartels and Tom Brady, and in which he declared himself a \"very rich\" man who does not need your lobby money, thank you very much."

    "title": "Brooklyn Couple Arrested for Immigration Fraud Scheme",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging William Jacobsen and his wife Marta Medvedeva with conspiring, and aiding and abetting others, to enter into sham marriages with foreign nationals for the purpose of obtaining lawful permanent residency in the United States. The defendants were also charged with evading United States immigration laws by making materially false statements in immigration applications, affidavits and other documents. The defendants\u2019 initial appearances were held this afternoon before United States Magistrate Judge Vera M. Scanlon.\n\nRichard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI), announced the charges.\n\n\u201cOur immigration process is not for sale. The defendants\u2019 scheme to game the system and reap ill-gotten profits by promoting sham marriages is not only criminal, it is an affront to those individuals who abide by the rules to obtain permanent residency in the United States lawfully,\u201d stated United States Attorney Donoghue. \u201cToday\u2019s charges send the clear message that this Office and our partners at the FBI will not tolerate such activity.\u201d\n\nAs alleged in the complaint, between approximately November 2016 and January 2019, Jacobsen and Medvedeva identified and recruited U.S. citizens who were willing to enter into sham marriages with foreign nationals. The foreign nationals paid the defendants approximately $30,000 for their services, and a portion of the fee was then passed on to the U.S. citizen spouses for their participation in the fraud. The defendants also coached the couples on how to successfully pass immigration interviews and provided misleading or false documentation needed during various steps in the immigration process.\n\nDuring several recordings and communications, Jacobsen and Medvedeva discussed the details of their scheme, including the number of participants they had available to participate in the \u201cfake\u201d marriages (as characterized by Jacobsen), payment of approximately $10,000 to the U.S. citizens for their services, and the coaching and training the couples would receive to pass the required immigration interviews. In one recorded conversation, Jacobsen explained to a confidential source posing as a potential U.S. citizen spouse:\n\nThe hardest part is getting married. The easy part is the [immigration] interview, because I know the questions they\u2019re gonna ask you. That\u2019s why everyone comes here, because they want training. Everybody\u2019s looking for training. When I do it, it\u2019s a five minute interview. You go with the lawyer, you\u2019re in there for an hour, hour and a half. I\u2019ve been doing it for fifteen years \u2026. This is the easy part. The hardest part is the marriage, cause both sides are nervous, they have to go there and kiss each other.

At this rate, he should be ready to reveal his findings about the first 96 hours of the Trump campaign by 2020.\u201d Justice Department sources also cautioned people following the investigation not to get too excited about it ending with bombshell arrests, and estimated that it would likely lead to indictments for only 10-12 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nAdvertisement"

    "text": "By Jay McKenzie\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Little Moscow deserves more attention.\n\nIn 1995, two significant events occurred in Trump\u2019s life, both of which are weighing quite heavily on the nation of late. We learned about the first event in October 2016, barely more than a month away from Election Day. The New York Times published information detailing the $916 million loss Trump took on his 1995 income tax returns in the wake of (primarily) his mismanagement of his Atlantic City casinos.\n\nThe second event in 1995 is likely a direct result of the first. Trump insulated himself from his own bankruptcies. In fact, he actually made significant profits in the process, but his employees and investors weren\u2019t so lucky. After seeing the damage Trump left in his wake, willing investors and partners in any future business with Trump were hard to find. Trump needed to resuscitate his ailing brand, and the opportunity presented itself in the form of Gil and Michael Dezer who were headquartered in the Miami metropolitan area. Together, the three of them began buying up oceanfront land in the Sunny Isles, Florida. They\u2019ve been building condominiums there ever since.\n\nDezer Development and Trump\n\nWhen asked, Gil Dezer makes sure to put any reporters at ease regarding Dezer Development and Trump\u2019s vetting process regarding the sale of their condos. In 2013, he told The Nation, \u201cWe do make sure we know our customer by asking for personal information at the time of signing the contract. We also make sure that anyone buying with an LLC proves to us that they are the rightful owner of that LLC and we check again at closing to make sure that we are still dealing with the same person at the time of delivering title.\u201d\n\nHowever, given Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, it\u2019s worth mentioning that surrounding Trump and Dezer HQ, there\u2019s been a growing Russian physical and monetary presence, especially so after the housing market crashed in 2008. According to Gil Dezer, in 2008 buyers defaulted on 900 Trump apartments, and it wasn\u2019t until 2011 that the Trump buildings began making a profit again. This was made possible largely through their partnership with Elena Baronoff, an Uzbekistani who immigrated from the Soviet Union in the 1980s. She recruited Russian buyers throughout Europe and brought them to Miami to buy Trump and Dezer properties.\n\nThe extent of Russian money tied to Trump\u2019s Florida properties\n\nReuters reported in March of 2017 that individuals with Russian passports or address have bought at least $98.4 million worth of property in seven Trump-branded luxury towers in southern Florida. In 2008, the year buyers defaulted on 900 Trump apartments, Dmitry Rybolovlev bought Trump\u2019s home in Palm Beach, Florida for $95 million. Only four years earlier, Trump paid $41 million for the property. Despite this large expenditure, Rybolovlev never lived at the property.\n\nPatribotics is expanding our journalism. Thank you for supporting our work. To donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nAn area clouded in secrecy\n\nThe problem with trying to understand Rybolovlev\u2019s motives is the same issue we encounter when sifting through Trump\u2019s business dealings and any Russian influence over him\u2014a lack of transparency. No, Trump hasn\u2019t released his tax returns, and no, it is not immediately possible to identify where illegal activity may be occurring. However, the not knowing in and of itself is made possible through a lack of transparency the GOP is more than happy to allow to continue.\n\nMoney laundering and mob influence has been rampant in southern Florida for decades. Lack of awareness isn\u2019t the issue. The problem is that any attempts to pass legislation curtailing this behavior have been struck down by Republican politicians and lobbyists. This is true whether we\u2019re talking about DC or Florida. Only a few days ago in Washington, House Republicans again rejected a bill forcing Donald Trump to release his tax returns. Turning a blind eye to Trump\u2019s business dealings neither proves or disproves knowledge of guilt by either Trump or those voting against this bill. It simply shows that both the GOP and Trump have a shared understanding. They would rather turn a blind eye to possible corruption or foreign influence, rather than be forced to explain the truth.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies in Florida, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Governor Rick Scott, have taken a similar direction as it relates to possible corruption in southern Florida. We cannot say what they do or do not know. We do know the two have spent $240 million on private lawyers since their time in office began in 2011. We know little details of why such an amount was spent, partly because of Florida\u2019s lax regulations on oversight. Bondia and Scott are not legally required to report this information to the state\u2019s chief legal officer. It\u2019s unsurprising then that they never did so.\n\nNew York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is a man on a mission\n\nOn Wednesday, June 7, 2017 the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York arrested Diego Gabisonia and thirty-two other defendants on charges related to a RICO conspiracy. Also this past week, the business partner of Michael Cohen\u2014Trump\u2019s personal attorney since 2006\u2014the \u201ctaxi king\u201d Gene Freidman was arrested in New York on tax charges. Schneiderman stated that Freidman failed to pay the state $5 million. As of June 9th, Schneiderman is investigating the Eric Trump Foundation as a result of a recent revelation in Forbes that Eric funneled $100,000 in donations from the charity into revenue for the Trump Organization.\n\nWhy Diego Gabisonia\u2019s recent arrest may be relevant to Trump\n\nNew York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has a long history of investigating Trump\u2019s various business enterprises. While I\u2019m sure Trump will readily call it all a witch hunt, Schneiderman certainly appears to believe there is something \u2018there\u2019 there based on his recent efforts against Trump associates. Was Diego Gabisonia arrested for this very reason? It\u2019s possible, considering his boss, Roman Bokeria, is closely tied to Trump, especially Trump\u2019s Florida investments in \u201cLittle Moscow.\u201d\n\nThe Miami connection\n\nTrump\u2019s initial connection to Russian investors, Elena Baronoff, was diagnosed with leukemia in 2014, and she died a year later. Gil Dezer admitted, \u201cNo one has filled her shoes.\u201d However, interested Russian buyers have continued to invest in Trump\u2019s properties in Sunny Isles. At least one person who has attempted to fill Baronoff\u2019s shoes is Roman Bokeria, chief executive of Miami Red Square Realty. Bokeria is the listing agent on Trump-branded condominiums currently for sale in Sunny Isles, Florida (above, left). Red Square has a staff of at least 15 Real Estate Specialists, many of whom are Russian speakers. Diego Gabisonia is one such employee, and he\u2019s now facing charges in New York related to RICO conspiracy and Conspiracy to commit wire fraud\n\nTo understand how this all could be related, I must mention another name: Max Slyusarchuk, the President and CEO of A & D Mortgage. Slyusarchuk\u2019s company describes itself as offering domestic and foreign borrowers with significant down payments an opportunity to benefit from loans that fall outside certain limits set by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. According to their website, A & D \u201cprovides an alternative to our clients to those loans that they couldn\u2019t close somewhere else, yet without have[sic] to resort to hard money loans.\u201d\n\nRoman Bokeria\u2019s Miami Red Square Realty is partnered with Max Slyusarchuk\u2019s A & D Mortgage, seen here:\n\nAll parties claim to be thorough on their vetting process of new clients, which would be reassuring if there were proof of this, but the evidence is difficult to find. Both companies having associates linked to the Russian mob also throws any claims of legality into question. In addition to Diego Gabisonia, another individual in the area with supposed mob ties is Alex Sorsher.\n\nAlex Sorsher is listed as a company officer for hundreds of businesses in the area; one such company is Liberty Tax Service. It appears he acts in many cases as an accountant.\n\nThe interesting bit is here: Alex Sorsher has been in the past and possibly remains an employee of Max Slyusarchuk at A & D Mortgage.\n\nThese hundreds of companies linked to Sorsher often have few company officers and little, if any, actual business activity. They appear to be the types of companies you would setup if you were looking to launder large amounts of money. One such business linked to Sorsher, Eurasia Technology Group Inc, may prove to be the most significant.\n\nThe importance isn\u2019t necessarily the business itself, as there\u2019s little evidence the company is conducting any, but rather the addresses it has listed. The location given in New York is an office in the Empire State Building, near Trump Tower New York. The second location is Hallandale, Florida, close to the Trump Grande and Dezer Developments in Sunny Isle, Florida.\n\nNone of the information I\u2019ve presented proves any of these players have committed any crimes, but that\u2019s the defense Trump has used his entire life to avoid conviction. Laws are meant to protect the very fabric of our democracy which Trump appears to be waging war with daily. To put it simply, with more stringent laws, whether or not crimes have taken place would be much easier for either side to prove.\n\nAs it is, we\u2019re left with an area with a large population of Russian immigrants who have invested in a small strip of land belonging to Donald Trump. The local area, consisting of Broward and Miami-Dade counties, has a long history of mob ties, going all the way back to almost a century ago. Donald Trump campaign associates Roger Stone and Michael Caputo live in Miami. Caputo, in fact, was on a panel in May with Max Slyusarchuk discussing Trump, Russia and sanctions relating to the 2016 election.\n\nIs it possible these facts are all unrelated coincidences? Sure, it\u2019s possible, but I think given the magnitude of all this information, the American people deserve to know more. My hope is that my work will lead more citizens and journalists to start looking."

    "text": "Sources with links to the intelligence community report that Donald Trump is being investigated for trafficking underage girls into the United States for sexual abuse, under the guise of his shell modeling company, Trump Models.\n\nThese sources report that Trump is linked to a Russian-based human trafficking enterprise, where girls and women were kidnapped into sexual slavery. This includes underage girls and minors.\n\nThe human trafficking arrests made recently in Europe, and several human trafficking cases in the United States, are linked to the same paedophile ring, these sources say.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate make a contribution here. , there are buttons around the site, or you could\n\nFurthermore, the sex trafficking of girls and underage children is linked to the Russian government via the same internet data that links Hostkey, the Russian hackers of the American election, with Mir Telemakti. They all share a registrant address in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nSources report that this nominal internet services provider, Dragonara Alliance, is in fact a mere intranet, over which Russian organized crime sponsored by Vladimir Putin discusses the kidnap and rape of girls. Dragonara Alliance was traced back to various IP addresses shared by Hostkey and Mir Telemakti. An intranet needs publicly to exist, these sources say, as an IP provider, in order that its existence not cause questions. But the NSA is deep inside Dragonara Alliance\u2019s servers, and can read their packet data. It provided material assistance to Europol and Interpol in making recent arrests, these sources say.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s company, Trump Models, recently locked its account on Twitter. It has been listed as paying women slave wages, and Trump has been accused of bringing in girls illegally, making them work without visas for nothing and housing them 11 to a room.\n\nTrump Model Management recruited models as young as 14\n\nDespite the scrutiny, Trump Models has deleted its Instagram account. Sources report Trump cannot provide accounts showing Trump Models was ever a legitimate business. There are multiple public reports that the agency forced girls to work for slave wages. The Daily Beast\u2019s Michael Gross also reported that Donald Trump personally pimped out underage girls from parties at his own hotels. For this, Trump, and his children Don Jr, Eric and Ivanka Trump, all part of Trump International Hotels management, may be held liable, sources say.\n\nFurther, sources report that Smart jet Aviation LTD, which uses SmartJet.ru and Jetorama.com, is an aviation company used to ferry trafficked females around. Smart Jet purchased a lot of fuel and acts as a broker for private flights. Again, sloppy opsec had the company registered to the same PO Box as Hostkey in the British Virgin Islands. The Smart Jet Aviation registrants use a type of trolling familiar to the student of the Trump-Russia \u201cPO Box 3469\u201d address, the use of a Russian scientist as a pseudonym for the registrant. However, they were dumb enough to use an email address connected with \u201cbizarrebrain.com\u201d where they forgot to take the real name of the registrant, one Damir Valiullin, off the site. Damir links in the Panama Papers to Dennis Kolyago, who is a senior executive with a regional Russian fuel company. This may explain all Smart Jet Aviation\u2019s purchases of airline fuel for human trafficking.\n\nJetSmarter, a company linked to Donald Trump and the Russian mob, used to be called Smart Jets Inc in the United States, but it is not known if it is the same company as \u201cSmart Jet Aviation.\u201d\n\nJetSmarter maintains it is a legitimate business. Sources say it is under counterintelligence investigation for Russian mob activity. Its former CEO , Edward Barsky, was a mobster who has invested in Sunny Isles, Florida.\n\nBarsky was also executive chairman of local real-estate development company Verzasca Group, according to a 2015 press release issued by the company.\n\nAnd it is directly linked to Donald Trump through both Barsky and Mike Flynn and Ron Torossian. Researcher Louise Neu showed on Twitter that Torossian was a spokesman for Michael Cohen\u2019s partner, and also wrote the pro-Turkey op-ed attributed to Mike Flynn. Torossian was forced to amend his FARA earlier this year.\n\nDmitry Sorokin, the current COO of Smart Jet Aviation, is also listed on LinkedIn as the head of Red Square Holding. Red Square Realty is linked to Donald Trump\u2019s own Miami properties and to the Russian mob, as we have previously reported.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s PACs also accepted funding from companies linked directly to the Smart Jet Aviation and Hostkey P.O. Box.\n\nIs it a coincidence that Smart Jet Aviation, registered to the same PO Box as Hostkey, hackers of the Russian election, and Jet Smarter, BOTH share investors with Donald Trump\u2019s properties in Miami, Florida? Is it also a coincidence that JetSmarter used to be called \u201cSmart Jets\u201d in America?\n\nPossibly so. The company declined to comment. But what is definite is that Smart Jet Aviation is being investigated for human trafficking with Dragonara Alliance used for the communications; and Donald Trump is being investigated for human trafficking with Trump Models. JetSmarter is under investigation for Russian mob ties, and Smart Jet for trafficking girls into misery, rape and death. Industrialized child abuse has been carried out on behalf of Vladimir Putin. And for Donald Trump himself, a locked Twitter and deleted Instagram are not going to save him."

    "text": "Patribotics hopes to expand our reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nExclusive: Sources with links to the intelligence community now confirm that a tape exists of Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, discussing how Russian money could be funneled without detection to target GOP campaigns, including Ryan\u2019s.\n\nThese sources report that Mr. Ryan is also on tape discussing how he can best use and disseminate Wikileaks material that was hacked from the DNC by Russia in order to win both his own election and election for Trump.\n\nFurther, sources say, the tape of Mr. Ryan discussing his knowledge of Russia funding the GOP that has previously been published in the Washington Post is in fact a small fragment of a much more damaging tape.\n\nPatribotics exclusively broke the news of that tape one week before it was released in the mainstream media. In this story of May 11th I reported:\n\nOn Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, normally third in the line of succession, I can report as fact that sources say that Ryan has been legally intercepted, and is on tape, admitting that he knew Russian money was being laundered into the Republican party. Without co-operation pending resignation Ryan may find himself swept up into a RICO prosecution involving the apparatus of the Republican party who accepted laundered Russian money.\n\nA week later Adam Entous at the Washington Post printed his exclusive report on the partial content of that tape.\n\nMy sources had clarified, at the time, that this tape was not the same as I had heard previously, namely, that Paul Ryan was directly on tape at the GOP convention discussing money laundering with the Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Reince Priebus was on tape doing so, these sources said.\n\nSeparate sources with links to the intelligence community and justice departments now confirm that there are at least two tapes of Speaker Ryan discussing Russian money, however. One is the tape whose existence I reported and which the Washington Post published. The second, however, is indeed of Ryan speaking with Kislyak at the convention. Sources report that there is signals intelligence, or SIGINT, of Paul Ryan discussing Russian money reaching the GOP and being covered up through companies using the ruling on Citizens United. Further, there is signals intelligence connecting Ryan to discussions on how best to use hacked data from Wikileaks to benefit Trump\u2019s campaign and his own as well as the GOP in general.\n\nSources with links to the intelligence community report a widespread belief that Mr. Ryan is being forced to act sympathetic towards Trump and dismissive of the Russian probe because Russia holds kompromat upon him. There is anger, these sources say, amongst rank and file intelligence agents at Paul Ryan\u2019s gross defense of Trump and rank misstatements of Director Comey\u2019s bombshell testimony. Affirmation that Paul Ryan is on tape discussing Wikileaks and Russian money laundering with Sergei Kislyak at the GOP convention \u2013 as well as the extensive further tapes that exist of the Washington Post discussion where Ryan admits knowledge of the conspiracy to wash Russian money \u2013 may have been passed on in detail in order to remind the Speaker that if Russia holds kompromat on him so does the United States, and he may wish to reconsider his position before constantly defending treason by Donald Trump."

Now some of those lawmakers are turning the tables on her and are discussing recruiting a primary challenger to run against the social media sensation.\n\nAt least one House Democrat has been privately urging members of the New York delegation to recruit a local politician from the Bronx or Queens to challenge Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhat I have recommended to the New York delegation is that you find her a primary opponent and make her a one-term congressperson,\u201d the Democratic lawmaker, who requested anonymity, told The Hill. \u201cYou\u2019ve got numerous council people and state legislators who\u2019ve been waiting 20 years for that seat. I\u2019m sure they can find numerous people who want that seat in that district.\u201d\n\nThe New York delegation has eyed Ocasio-Cortez with skepticism ever since last summer when the 29-year-old self-described democratic socialist shocked the political world and defeated then-Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) in what many thought would be a sleepy primary race. Crowley, a Queens powerbroker and affable House Democratic Caucus chairman, had been considered a possible future Speaker.\n\nMany New York and Congressional Black Caucus lawmakers were also furious with Ocasio-Cortez after a recent Politico report stated she and the grass-roots group aligned with her, Justice Democrats, were considering backing a primary challenge to fellow New York Democrat Hakeem Jeffries Hakeem Sekou JeffriesDemocrats face balancing act with Mueller report demands Graham: Trashing Trump is not the way to honor McCain New Mexico Dems brace for crowded race to succeed Udall MORE, a Black Caucus member and establishment insider who succeeded Crowley as caucus chairman.\n\nBoth Ocasio-Cortez and Justice Democrats have denied the report, but the group of insurgent progressives has vowed to target centrist Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) and is eyeing other potential 2020 targets.\n\nFor now, New York Democratic lawmakers are playing nice with Ocasio-Cortez and her 2.6 million Twitter followers and say no one in the Empire State\u2019s delegation is currently contemplating backing a primary challenger against her.\n\n\u201cWe are going to see what happens. Generally for me, I\u2019m giving folks the benefit of the doubt, the presumption of innocence. You might say one thing before you get in here, and then after you get to meet folks, you see what happens and how the body works \u2026 things are different, so we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Rep. Gregory Meeks Gregory Weldon MeeksTime for a change for America's new middle class Bernie 2020 has Democrats petrified Dem rep: Sanders should register as a Democrat MORE (D-N.Y.), whose district includes part of Queens, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cI can only tell you that the times I\u2019ve spoken to her, and at the times she\u2019s been at the New York delegation meetings, she\u2019s been cooperative and wants to be a team player. That\u2019s what she said, so you gotta take her at her word until something changes,\u201d Meeks added.\n\nJeffries, the No. 4 House Democrat who some say could someday become Speaker, insisted none of his House colleagues have approached him to run a primary challenger against Ocasio-Cortez. In fact, the 48-year-old Jeffries said, delegation members this month lobbied Democratic leadership to grant Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s request that she be appointed to the House Financial Services and the Oversight and Reform committees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that is something the New York delegation would contemplate. As you can see, we are totally united behind each other. \u2026 The New York delegation sticks together,\u201d Jeffries told The Hill. He said Ocasio-Cortez denied the news report that she was backing a challenger to him, \u201cso there was nothing to work through. I haven\u2019t seen a primary candidate emerge, so I assume when she denied it, she was correct that there was nothing to it.\u201d\n\nNo potential challengers to Ocasio-Cortez have yet emerged. But one New York political insider noted that the Queens and Bronx district is home to many ambitious pols who are close to Crowley and don\u2019t like that a political outsider took his seat.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s pissing off a lot of people and has probably made a lot of enemies. \u2026 A lot of people who are furious with her are Joe\u2019s allies, including some named Crowley,\u201d said the insider, referring to Crowley\u2019s cousin, Elizabeth Crowley, a former New York City councilwoman. \u201cShe is a woman. She\u2019s been moving more to the left. She would be someone interesting.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Crowley, 41, did not return a request for comment, but she has previously said she\u2019s eyeing a bid for Queens borough president in 2021. She lives in a neighboring Queens district.\n\nFor her part, Ocasio-Cortez doesn\u2019t seem particularly worried about a primary challenge. With her newfound fame, she will be a force of nature and fundraising powerhouse in the 2020 cycle; as a political newcomer in 2018, she raised an astounding $2 million last cycle and had more than $400,000 cash on hand, according to campaign finance reports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOf all people, Ocasio-Cortez would not complain if she gets a primary challenger, her spokesman said.\n\n\u201cWe believe in primaries as an idea. We\u2019re not upset by the idea of being primaried. We are not going to go out there being anti-primary \u2014 they are good for party,\u201d said Corbin Trent, a campaign spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez and a co-founder of Justice Democrats.\n\n\u201cIf voters in the district feel that they can be better represented, that will be their choice on primary day,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn the meantime, we\u2019re going to be doing our dead-level best to make sure we are representing the needs and the will of our constituents.\u201d\n\nJustice Democrats spokesman Waleed Shahid predicted a lopsided defeat for whoever tries to take on Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\u201cConsidering she\u2019s more popular and well-known than some of the Democratic presidential contenders, I think whoever challenges her will lose by huge margins,\u201d Shahid said. \u201cIt\u2019s a quick way for some D.C. and Wall Street consultants to make some easy money.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Black Caucus members she has rubbed the wrong way. Ocasio-Cortez, whose mother was born in Puerto Rico, has also annoyed members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus by targeting one of their own: Cuellar. Earlier this month, she appeared in a Justice Democrats promotional video with her spokesman, Corbin, and her chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, touting a program recruiting progressive insurgents to run for Congress.\n\nJustice Democrats is currently searching for a progressive to launch a primary challenge against Cuellar. Hispanic Caucus members aren\u2019t happy about those efforts but say they are taking a wait-and-see approach before intervening with Ocasio-Cortez, who joined the caucus this month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to protect our members and we\u2019re going to protect our own. Full stop,\u201d said centrist Rep. Pete Aguilar Peter (Pete) Ray AguilarLeft flexes muscle in immigration talks Immigration groups press for pairing Dreamer benefits with border security Lawmakers haggling over border dollars much lower than Trump's demand MORE (D-Calif.), a former whip for the Hispanic Caucus. \u201cThere are plenty of [swing] races and seats that we can play in, and we want to devote our resources to that.\u201d"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "From Catering to Cartel -Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Troll Factory\n\n@SaysDana Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jan 7\n\nOriginal Twitter Thread created on May, 27, 2017 by @SaysDana\n\nVitamins are considered essential nutrients because, acting together, they perform many useful roles. Kremlin caterer, Yevgeny Prigozhin does the same for his master, Vladimir Putin. Yevgeny is just one of an inner circle of point men who carry out essential functions for Putin and are richly rewarded in return. Perhaps that is why the chef turned billionaire, Yevgeny Prigozhin, chose to name his yacht St. Vitamin and his jet M-Vita. He is also believed to have fueled the Russian bot campaign to sway political opinion and thus influence the 2016 US election via another of his businesses, The Internet Research Agency (IRA).\n\nEarly Years in Prison\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin\n\nPrigozhin was born in 1961 to Violetta Prigozhin in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). He enjoyed sports and cross-country skiing growing up, but it is known from publicly available information that on 29 November 1979 in Leningrad\u2019s Kuybyshev court, Prigozhin was convicted of theft, for which he was put on probation. Just two years later, he received a custodial prison sentence from the Zhdanov court for more serious crimes. In 1988, Prigozhin was pardoned, and in 1990 released from a penal colony.\n\nWhile in prison, his mother remarried. His step-father helped him set up a business selling hot dogs, establishing a grocery store chain and investing in restaurants. It would be his restaurants that attracted elites in St. Petersburg including officials from the city and the federal government and the man who was to become his greatest supporter, Vladimir Putin.\n\nHospitality Success\n\nInteresting information, but not confirmed, is that Putin\u2019s grandfather was allegedly a cook for Lenin and then Stalin \u2014 both of whom may have been poisoned. Yevgeny Prigozhin, it seems, may not cook at all, but being in the position of being \u201cPutin\u2019s Chef\u201d, surely gives him access to both friends and enemies. Putin and Prigozhin met in 2001 when Vladimir Putin was hosting French President, Jacques Chirac at Prigozhin\u2019s New Island floating restarant. Putin entertained President George W. Bush at the same restaurant in 2002. By the following year, Prigozhin had a successful catering and restaurant business, often personally serving his elite clients.\n\nGeorge W. Bush with Putin, 2002\n\nPrigozhin serving Vladimir Putin\n\nThis success helped him receive the catering contract for Dmitry Medvedev\u2019s presidential inauguration and his relationship with Putin won his company, Concord Management & Consulting a government catering contract worth $1.4 Billion. This contract was to feed all Moscow\u2019s schoolchildren and 90 per cent of the Russian Military.\n\nPrigozhin talking with Medvedev\n\nHowever, as far as programs go, many schoolchildren and their parents repeatedly complained about the poor quality of the food provided, which was neither tasty nor fresh. In autumn 2011, protesting parents blocked a lorry bringing food from Concord to a local school. The children refused breakfast and lunch and complained to their parents of stomach upsets, leading them to go to school and monitor the quality of the food themselves. Prigozhin suffered no consequences.\n\nConcord Management continued to grow and expand. The two year Defense contract helped him acquire his first yacht, the St. Vitamin and a Raytheon Hawker 800 jet, the M-Vita. The family boasted on social media about their high lifestyle.\n\nM-Vita\n\nSt. Vitamin\n\nIn 2013, the new Russian Defense Minister did not renew the contract reducing Prigozhin\u2019s income to ~$704 million. The same year, Prigozhin branched into other endeavors and Russian journalists in Russia discovered that he not only operated but owned, The Internet Research Agency also known as \u201cThe Troll Factory\u201d.\n\nServing Propaganda on a Plate\n\nThe Internet Research Agency was located in St. Petersburg\u2019s Olgino region. Staff worked up to 12 hour shifts, writing social media posts and comments praising Russian authorities, while criticizing opposition. Approximately 400 people worked in the building, writing to prepared scripts.\n\nThe IRA provided additional propaganda services. In 2013, three months before Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich was overthrown, the news agency Kharkov, was founded in Ukraine and opened a branch in Crimea. The news agency advocated pro-Russian positions well before the violence began in eastern Ukraine. According to the Nvaya Gazeta newspaper, Yevgeny Prigozhin financed Kharkov.\n\nIn 2014, Anonymous International hackers corroborated that Prigozhin\u2019s company Concord Management & Consulting was financing the IRA and leaked emails to BuzzFeed News. Later, it was revealed online that the IRA approved payments to Prigozhin\u2019s catering firm.\n\nContracts with Russia Military\n\nBy 2015, Prigozhin began expanding his military contracts. Companies like Agaat LLC, Nordenergo, Teplosintez, Teplosnab, TCS and Proftehuslugi were all associated Prigozhin\u2019s Concord Management and Consulting company. Prigozhin\u2019s CEO of Concord Management, Dmitry Utkin, is the founder of Wagner Group, a private military contractor.\n\nProsecutors in Russia\u2019s Central Military District soon took an interest in the procured contracts and determined that these companies were not licensed to work at military sites. The prosecutors had no way to revise the rules and contract decisions and many of these contracts remain in place today.\n\nAnti-Corruption Investigations\n\nAccording to Alexey Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation, there were eight, not five, firms in this group that won procurement contracts from the military worth $607 million. Prosecutors are investigating only five of the companies, where senior management comprises former police officers. According to the news website Fontanka, they are all connected to the firm, Megaline, associated with Prigozhin\u2019s Concord Management and Consulting.\n\nhttps://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/200133125\n\nLawsuits against Yandex\n\nIn May 2016, after being stopped by police while in his motorcade, Prigozhin\u2019s bodyguard manhandled a police office while being videotaped. St. Petersburg police brought charges against his bodyguard and decided to proceed with them. The following day, Prigozhin brought 15 lawsuits against the Internet search engine, Yandex, seeking to use the new Russian law on \u201cthe right to be forgotten\u201d, which obliges search engines to respond to citizens\u2019 requests to remove results linking to \u201cillegal, inaccurate, or irrelevant information\u201d about that individual. Prigozhin demanded that Yandex delete links to Novaya Gazeta\u2019s report at the \u201ctroll factory\u201d and Fontanka\u2019s report about this business empire in Military communities, including, specifically, his state contracts with the Defence Ministry. Prigozhin also wanted removal of an article about military communities published on the Ukrainian new website Apostrof, with the headline \u201cOn Putin\u2019s Thieving Chef\u201d. He later dropped all suits.\n\nPrigozhin funding Group Wagner \u2014 a Quasi-Private Military Company (PMC)\n\nGroup Wagner is an outwardly private company, but is supported by the military and controlled by the state. Payments received by Group Wagner are much higher than received by other private security companies, leading to speculation of Kremlin Support, according to an official close to the Russian Defence Ministry. Russian defence analyst Ivan Konovalov, along with Prigozhin, helped create the idea and funding for the group.\n\nUnconfirmed reports say that Group Wagner in Molkino was disbanded by 2015. The company, set up in 2014, is led by retired Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Utkin, formerly of Russian special forces 2nd Spetnazbrigade and current CEO of Concord Management and Consulting.\n\nRussian military aircraft have transported this private force to Syria and pictures of the company, show equipment used only by Russian special forces.\n\nCourtesy of EA Worldview\n\nMoscow\u2019s Mercenaries in Syria\n\nSometime around 2010, Putin suggested that \u201csuch companies are a way of implementing national interests without the direct involvement of the state\u201d. In 2013, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri Rogozin floated the idea of setting up a PMC with state backing. However, there was still resistance within the Defence Ministry.\n\nThe Russian government is still considering making PMC\u2019s legal. If this happens, groups like Wagner, technically private, but acting as the arms of the Russian state, will be more widespread.\n\nUpdate: Sanctions and charges\n\nIn 2016, the US Treasury sanctioned Prigozhin, for having \u201cextensive business dealings\u201d with the Russian Defence Ministry. The US actions bar American individuals or companies from dealing with sanctioned people or companies.\n\nOn February, 16, 2018, Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency, Concord Management, another related company, and other connected Russian individuals were indicted by a US grand jury. Prigozhin was charged with funding and organizing operations for the purpose of interference with the US political and electoral processes, including the 2016 presidential election, and other crimes including identity theft. The US took a stand against propaganda and Russian meddling in US elections.\n\nSources: Ilya Zhegulev in Moscow for Meduza translated from Russian by Kevin Rothrock. 13 June 2016; Thomas Grove and Paul Sonne for The Wall Street Journal. 20 Dec 2016; Niklas Eklund, Jorgen Elfving for the Eurasia Daily Monitor. 22 March 2017; Mark Galeotti for War on the Rocks. 5 April 2016; Alexandra Garmazhapova for Yevgeny Prigozhin: Caterer to the Kremlin. 31 July 2014; (OpenDemocracy) https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/alexandra-garmazhapova/yevgeny-prigozhin-%D1%81aterer-to-kremlin\n\nContributors:\n\nTwitter \u2014 @911Corlebra777, @mopeng; Original Writing Date: April 16, 2017; Twitter Thread Date: May 2017; 2nd Rewrite of THREAD here: https://twitter.com/SaysDana/status/876811195897978880\n\nEditor: Kathy Davis\n\nThank you to K.

    "text": "Sources linked to the intelligence community say that Donald Trump accepted laundered Russian money which, through shell companies, supported Russian hackers as they attacked America \u2013 and then supported Wikileaks and Julian Assange as he published the results of those hacks.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s link to the hack on the US election appears to be far more direct than anybody thought \u2013 with Russian money, washed into his campaign, paying for Russian hackers who attacked both state voter registration databases and the DNC. Trump also appears to have had direct personal knowledge of the propaganda botnet used by Russia.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nAs I previously reported exclusively on Patribotics in three earlier pieces, the first of which was an exclusive by Laurelai Bailey, Peter Chayanov (one of his many aliases) is a Russian hacker who owns a hacking and spamming company called Hostkey. Upon being outed on Twitter by myself, Bailey and @OpFerguson, Chayanov deleted his account.\n\nHostkey was revealed firstly to have provided Wikileaks servers in Russia one week before the DNC emails were published, and secondly, to have been given Wikileaks SSL keys, allowing the tracking of any readers of the site, and allowing Putin to deanonymize any past or present leakers or whistleblowers who supplied Julian Assange with documents.\n\nThis, of course, makes Assange far more than a publisher \u2013 he is now a supplier of intelligence to the Russian state.\n\nHowever, I also reported exclusively here that Hostkey had provided the \u201cservers from a Russian company\u201d which the USIC stated on Oct 7th, 2016, had attacked voter registration databases in American states. Hostkey, Russia and Chayanov were therefore directly linked to Vladimir Putin, and had both hacked and published material on Russia\u2019s behalf.\n\nI further reported exclusively that the Alfa Bank \u2013 Trump Tower server link was \u201cwashing\u201d both the state voter databases and data from the DNC\u2019s \u201cVertica\u201d database.\n\nToday, however, I can also report that Ocean Way Capital, in Florida, which is the shell company that itself hosts Hostkey.com and all its servers, is linked to Russian-Ukranian money laundering to Donald Trump via a series of shell companies based in the British Virgin Islands. Ocean Way Capital Corporation was dissolved there along in April 24th, 2016 \u2013 around the same time that, according to the BBC\u2019s Paul Wood, the then director of the CIA heard a tape from Estonian intelligence about Russian money being laundered to the Trump campaign.\n\nOcean Way Capital Corporation (linked to Chayanov directly) was the owner of hostkey.ru.\n\nAnd in August of 2016, Ocean Way Capital LLC, the owner of hostkey.com, was set up in Florida. Other shell companies mentioned in the BVI Gazette of April 2016 included Ontera, a fake company that laundered millions in Russian-Cypriot money; Fortune Trump Holdings and three other Trump companies, including these two: Trump Overseas Ltd and Trump Star Investments Ltd.\n\nRun either through google, however, and no, zero, real records come up, either using \u201cLtd\u201d or \u201cLimited\u201d. We do get this odd looking thing:\n\nThe apparently fake shell companies sit in the listing alongside another, Ontera, which according to an exclusive report by a Czech investigative journalist, was a fake company used solely to wash Russian money through Cypriot banks.\n\nFor now, however, let us return to how Ocean Way Capital Corporation links to both Hostkey, and to Russians, the Seychelles and Cyprus.\n\nThe registrant address of Ocean Way Capital Corporation links to a company found in the Panama Papers.\n\n.\n\nThis in turn, links to a web of companies including Moscrip Limited in the Seychelles, where Erik Prince is said to have met a Russian agent with links to Vladimir Putin. It is also linked to Istanova Investments a Cypriot company that appears to trace to Oleg Deripaska and members of his family. More importantly, one holding company linked to the registrant address of Ocean Way Capital Corporation traces back to a Russian national, registered the UK \u2013 Sergey Ovchinnikov. He is listed at the Russian Academy of Sciences. He is listed along with a Cypriot. Cyprus and Russia are notorious, of course for money laundering.\n\nLastly: oh google, you are too kind."

    "text": "UPDATED: The Associated Press announced that the Special Prosecutor appointed to investigate Eric Schneiderman for alleged assault will bring no charges.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The special prosecutor appointed to investigate allegations that former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman physically abused women said Thursday that she has closed the case without bringing criminal charges. Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas announced her decision in a brief statement. She said investigators did an \u201cexhaustive review\u201d and she personally interviewed each woman who had accused Schneiderman of assault.\n\nGovernor Cuomo appointed Singas over Cyrus Vance, the District Attorney for Manhattan because there was a conflict of interest. Schneiderman was investigating Vance for corruption in his failure to prosecute both Harvey Weinstein and Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the latter two having donated to Vance\u2019s campaign. Although Weinstein was not a direct donor to Vance, his lawyer David Boies was:\n\nVance has also faced criticism for accepting a $10,000 donation from David Boies, an attorney who has represented Weinstein, in August 2015, according to campaign financial disclosure forms from the New York State Board of Elections.\n\nBy contrast, Eric Schneiderman had filed a civil lawsuit against Weinstein as State AG, even as his office criminally investigated Vance\u2019s dereliction of duty. As we have exclusively reported, Schneiderman was a major player in the fight against Russia. Schneiderman began a case at state that would wind up as a Federal RICO indictment against Donald Trump; and Schneiderman had Trump Tower under state surveillance for more than a year preceding Trump\u2019s election as President.\n\nPatribotics relies on your help to keep going! If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you can make a contribution here. We are so grateful to the readers who support our work!\n\nThe Associated Press wrongly reports that Mr. Schneiderman did not deny the allegations of assault at the time.\n\nSchneiderman at the time didn\u2019t deny the allegations, but implied in a statement that his conduct was either welcomed or was not as the women described.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Schneiderman did firmly deny the allegations. The New York Times quoted his statement as saying:\n\nserious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me\u2026 I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex\n\nSchneiderman admitted to what he described as consensual role-playing with the accusers, who were his long-term romantic partners. Like Al Franken, he apologized for causing emotional pain to women, but did not admit any legal wrongdoing, which, like Franken, he denies. As our original report details below, both Schneiderman\u2019s and Franken\u2019s accusers were tied to Roger Stone.\n\nOriginal Story Continues Below\n\nExplosive revelations that women who accused former New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of physically abusing them during long-term dating relationships, decided to take their stories to Michael Cohen and Donald Trump instead of to the police, have been further complicated by the discovery that both the accusers, and the authors and publication that carried the anti-Schneiderman story, may also have been linked to Roger Stone \u2013 just as Al Franken\u2019s accuser Leanne Tweeden was.\n\nTwitter user @Inesie reported on the night Scheiderman resigned, that Stone\u2019s \u201chuman backchannel\u201d to Wikileaks, Randy Credico, had hosted Jennifer Gonnerman on his radio show in 2016.\n\nThanks for reminding me \u2014 Randy Credico (@Credico2016) May 8, 2018\n\nRoger Stone was a guest on the same show with Ms. Gonnerman. Mr. Credico evidently knows both Stone and Gonnerman well:\n\nMr. Credico hosted Gonnerman most recently in late January of 2017.\n\nCredico\u2019s association with Gonnerman goes back several years, according to his Twitter feed. In 2015, he credited her for helping him change drug laws:\n\n@NewYorker Miss Gonnerman had a major role in changing those laws..she deserves a lot of credit \u2014 Randy Credico (@Credico2016) August 24, 2015\n\nThe unverified story in the New Yorker that accused Mr. Scheiderman acknowledged that Ms. Gonnerman, a friend of accuser Tanya Selvaratnam, was a key figure in setting up the report:\n\nSenna advised Selvaratnam to retrieve her belongings from his apartment. On November 3, 2017, she did so, with another friend\u2014Jennifer Gonnerman, a staff writer at this magazine. As they carried her things outside, they talked about the fact that Selvaratnam couldn\u2019t possibly be the only woman who had seen this side of Schneiderman. Gonnerman asked her who else he had dated. Selvaratnam knew of one former girlfriend\u2014not Manning Barish\u2014and described where she had worked. The next day, Gonnerman happened to run into a male friend who had once worked with the former girlfriend. Gonnerman asked him if he\u2019d ever known anyone who had dated Schneiderman. He said yes: a close friend of his had. Without divulging anything, Gonnerman asked, \u201cSo how did that work out?\u201d He answered, \u201cHe used to spit on her and slap her during sex.\u201d Gonnerman told Selvaratnam about the other victim. \u201cShe was very traumatized,\u201d Gonnerman recalls. \u201cOn the one hand, she was relieved to learn it had happened before, but on the other it was, like, \u2018Why hasn\u2019t anyone stopped him?\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn Twitter, one of the co-authors of the piece accusing Schneiderman, Jane Mayer, denied that sources had any links to Trump and Cohen\n\nJust to be clear: not one source for our story on Schneiderman has any ties to Trump or Michael Cohen. Our sources all are deeply opposed to Trump and deeply disappointed that Schneiderman let them and their Cause down.\n\nThis is self-evidently false, in that Ms. Gonnerman\u2019s ties to Stone are a tie to Trump; Mr. Stone was official Trump campaign staff.\n\nOne of the accusers named in the story, Michelle Manning Barish, had a long history of making anti-Clinton tweets. One of her tweets linked a facebook post showed that she deleted the phrase \u201cI know the family\u201d when posting about the Russian mobster Tamir Sapir and Trump Soho.\n\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers \u2013 you make our reporting possible. Your support will help us to break more stories on Trump, Russia and Mueller\u2019s investigation. Please consider a donation\n\nAfter the false accusations by Gonnerman and Manning Barish, separate \u201caccusers\u201d of Schneiderman\u2019s were revealed to have worked with Trump and Cohen.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Federal Marshals Execute Seizure Warrants At Trump Tower\n\nDonald Trump Sealed Indictment Started With Eric Schneiderman\n\nExclusive: Schneiderman Had Trump Tower Under State Surveillance"

    "text": "America had barely a morning to digest dramatic Democrat successes before Donald Trump fired Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, and appointed his Chief of Staff Matt Whitaker, a foe of the Russia probe. Mr Trump\u2019s latest attempt to derail his own prosecution is not going at all well. But rather than recap the many tribulations of Trump\u2019s putative Acting Attorney General \u2013 whether Whitaker\u2019s appointment is even legal is being questioned \u2013 here are some key points on Mueller\u2019s endgame:\n\nMueller\u2019s next indictments may not be for Russian collusion\n\nWhy he may reveal all indictments on the substance over a day or two\n\nThere are dozens of indictments, with the number ranging from 30 to over a hundred\n\nWe report that Trump is indicted, but the indictments we describe are not for collusion with Russia in the election \u2013 such indictments may also exist but we have no knowledge of that, either way\n\nMike Pence, sources say, will not become President;\n\nChatter is that Roger Stone, Michael Cohen and Donald Trump Jr\u2019s time in the barrel is coming, but that chatter has been around for at least one month at time of writing\n\nNobody knows when Mueller will release the Red, White And Blue Wave of indictments on the substance (but it will be awesome when he does)\n\nThe First Indictments May Not Be for Russian Collusion\n\nWe could see Donald J. Trump Jr being indicted for lying to the FBI over the meeting he arranged with Russian Intelligence operative Natalia Vetselkinaya. We might see Tad Devine or Tony Podesta indicted for failing to register under FARA for Ukraine. We might even see Jared Kushner indicted over false declarations on his SF-86, including omitting his attendance at the Trump Tower meeting between Don and the Kremlin, or for lying to the FBI.\n\nEven after initial revisions, the form failed to include a June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya he attended at Trump Tower accompanied by Donald Trump Jr. and Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort.\n\nMueller\u2019s pattern has been to indict Americans only on these ancillary offenses, and a great many mainstream journalists have taken this to mean that Mueller does not see any collusion with Russia. Blake Hounsell, the editor of Politico, published \u2018Confessions of a Russiagate Skeptic\u2018 making this point about every indictment thus far.\n\nAs Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, noted after the deal became public, prosecutors usually prefer to charge participants in a conspiracy with charges related to the underlying crime. \u2026Flynn pleaded guilty only to lying to the FBI, which Bharara surmised that might mean Mueller didn\u2019t have much on him\n\nHounsell later published \u2018Why I\u2019m No Longer a Russiagate Skeptic\u2019 but the title did not match the text; in the later piece, he insists again that Trump only *wanted* to collude:\n\nThere were certainly sporadic, repeated attempts by some on or around the campaign to collaborate, but we don\u2019t know if, or how, those flirtations were consummated\u2026. We might never get clear evidence that Trump made a secret deal with the Kremlin. It would be great to see his tax returns, and perhaps Mueller has evidence of private collusion that we have yet to see\n\nThis is, of course, nonsense that downplays all the public evidence we have so far; Donald Trump Jr met with people billing themselves as coming from the Russian government and offering dirt on Clinton. Jared Kushner asked the Russian Ambassador for a digital \u2018backchannel\u2019 inside the Russian embassy while Obama was still President. Carter Page announced Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State in Moscow before Trump announced him to America \u2013 and he was under a FISA warrant when he did so. The NRA took an extra $100m in cash in the 2016 cycle and gave it to the GOP, with Maria Butina being indicted.\n\n@realDonaldTrump will win the election & is more popular than Obama in 2008, AI system finds #MAGA3X @FieldofFight https://t.co/zfIT25Usdc \u2014 General Flynn (@GenFlynn) October 28, 2016\n\nTrump\u2019s children and surrogates colluded with Assange and Wikileaks directly. Erik Prince, Flynn and Kushner arranged a \u2018backchannel\u2019 meeting in the Seychelles with a representative of the Russian government. The FBI is continuing to investigate the Trump-Alfa server. The CIA blocked Kushner from a TS/SCI clearance. The ousted KT McFarland wrote to Mike Flynn that Russia had \u2018just elected Trump\u2019. All of these things, just the headlines, indeed, illustrate ample collusion with the Russian state. Guccifer 2 was the GRU, using a pun; Trump\u2019s collaboration with Peter Thiel\u2019s MAGA 3X memetic warfare pac, coordinated with the GRU, was openly tweeted; and so on and so forth.\n\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here . We need your help to keep going!\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\nHounsell\u2019s tosh about \u2018sporadic\u2019 collaboration, some variant of \u2018sure they wanted to collaborate, but did they?\u2019 has been everywhere in American media. \u201cRoger Stone Sold Himself To Trump\u2019s Campaign As a Wikileaks Pipeline. Was He?\u201d said the New York Times. \u201cPage hasn\u2019t been accused of any wrongdoing\u201d, wrote the Washington Post, after it was known that Carter Page was the subject of a FISA warrant, confirming that a judge agreed Page might be an agent of a foreign power. Clint Watts, a former FBI agent whose expertise was in counterterrorism and not counterintelligence, testified to Congress that Trump was a mere \u201cuseful idiot\u201d who had only unwittingly collaborated with Russia.\n\n(In forthcoming days, Patribotics will review the case against Trump, including pointers the mainstream media have omitted to cover.)\n\nAnd at his next rally, Trump did exactly that. The tweet was sent to Trump campaign counsel Michael Cohen, and his social media director Dan Scavino, while Carter Page was in Moscow\n\nWhy Won\u2019t Mueller\u2019s First Indictments Be for Russian Collusion? Isn\u2019t That What He\u2019s Looking For? And When Will He Get to the Main Event?\n\nThis is much more simple than the \u2018because he\u2019s got bupkis\u2019 theory advanced by Mr. Hounsell and co. The indictments for Russian collusion are of Donald Trump and members of his campaign. They were coordinated between members of the campaign staff and the Trump family. Mueller cannot reveal one case on Russian collusion without effectively unsealing many others. It is likely, therefore, that over a single day, or a couple of days, Mueller\u2019s office will reveal all the indictments on the substance in a single day.\n\nHow Many Indictments Are There?\n\nLast fall, this blog broke the news that Mueller had \u2018dozens of sealed indictments\u2019. This week, John Schindler, speaking to separate intelligence sources \u2013 although we do not know who each other\u2019s sources are, his description of his sources does not match the role played by mine \u2013 confirmed that Mueller has \u2018dozens of sealed indictments\u2019 and I presume that now this has risen to substantively above what I reported. At that time, sources described a touch over two dozen sealed indictments but were not specific. The same sources later said there were \u2018plenty more\u2019 after my story was published. Sources did not specify a number. My guess is that it will be close to a hundred, if not more, but the only thing I know for sure is that there are many more indictments than 24, with the language used by sources suggesting at minimum over 30.\n\nIs Donald Trump Indicted For Colluding With Russia?\n\nI am not sure. The at least three counts against him in indictments I report on this blog are not for collusion with Russia in the election, and were obtained either before Mueller was appointed, or just afterwards. One of those is for RICO, with the Trump Organization and Felix Sater over the Bayrock case. The other at least two counts were for an entirely separate offense. While I know what this offense is, sources will not presently allow me to report it; it is not strictly about actions taken with Russia, nor is it a sexual offense.\n\nI would happily bet many imaginary rubles that Mr. Trump will be indicted on some offenses of collusion with Russia \u2013 collusion is not a specific crime, but the term covers a whole range crimes committed while colluding, such as espionage, seditious conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, failing to register under FARA, misprision of a felony, election offenses, etc. However, I have no sourcing that Trump is indicted on these charges and am unlikely to get any; the closer we get to showtime, the less sources want to talk.\n\nTrump may be indicted or in trouble for his payoff to Stormy Daniels, a case pursued by Michael Avenatti, but it is unlikely that this would be allowed to interfere with the Russia investigation. Revealing openly that the President can be indicted for such a minor matter \u2013 at least in comparison \u2013 as paying off a woman with campaign funds \u2013 would impact reporting on the more serious sealed indictments against Trump. For that reason I doubt it will happen before the main Russia cases are unsealed \u2013 but of course that could be wrong.\n\nWill Mike Pence be President?\n\nSources said last year that Pence is likely to be indicted on a scandal that happened while he was the Governor of Indiana. They refused to say whether or not he would also be indicted for colluding with Russia, but, last year, these sources said that they did not expect Pence to become President. He would resign, in return for consideration in regards to his case. However, Pence might insist upon it until he is convicted, raising constitutional questions similar to those surrounding Whitaker; could Pence swear the Oath of Office in good faith given what will be revealed about the Trump campaign of which he was a part?\n\nWill Nancy Pelosi become the first woman President?\n\nNo, not technically unless she runs for the office. The Constitution mandates that the Speaker of the House becomes Acting President (not President) if both the President and the Vice-President are removed. Speaker Pelosi has said that she does not plan to serve long in her second bite of the Congressional Apple. Trump is expected to fight his impeachment, not because he thinks he can get out of it, sources say, but because it is literally the only play he has left. Impeachment in the House will not be immediate and then the trial in the Senate will take its time. It is possible that Pelosi might succeed as Acting President before 2020, and if not her, then her successor as Speaker.\n\n\n\nOne very interesting wrinkle in the law as I read it is that the line of succession to the Presidency (after the President Pro Tem of the Senate) is in control of the Democratic House when it comes to impeachment. The line of succession eligible to assume the acting Presidency shall apply\u2026\u2026\n\nonly to officers not under impeachment by the House of Representatives at the time the powers and duties of the office of President devolve upon them\n\nThat would, if I read it correctly, mean that a Democratic House anticipating Trump\u2019s removal after conviction by the Senate could, should Speaker Pelosi not wish to assume the office, impeach others implicated in Russian collusion, such as Pompeo and Mnuchin, without needing their impeachment confirmed by the Senate. The next in line would be Jim Mattis, the Secretary of Defense.\n\nWhen Will the Indictments Be Unsealed?\n\nAnybody who claims to know is lying, unless they are suspects and have been directly informed by the FBI or the Office of the Special Counsel. It is clear from public reporting that Don Trump Junior thinks he will be indicted. There has been chatter for some time that an indictment of Roger Stone is forthcoming. As discussed above, these indictments may well not be earth-shattering, but for minor offenses only tangentially related to the Russia investigation. Mueller\u2019s team is prepared for, sources told me last year, \u2018at least three years\u2019 of indictments coming not merely for Trump, his three eldest children, Jared Kushner and the rest of his campaign colluders, but also for Americans who knowingly worked with Russia to influence an election. The cost of Mueller\u2019s investigation will be huge.\n\nMueller is not likely to want to be seen as partisan or as making a statement. If the \u2018Red, White, and Blue Wave\u2019 of major Trump Russia indictments does not come very soon, then it must be likely the OSC will hold it until next year. We can expect some major name fireworks from conspirators who are not Americans \u2013 look for Julian Assange to be expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy, and held on no bail in one of Her Majesty\u2019s most unpleasant prisons. For the same reasons as outlined in this piece, the UK\u2019s domestic-facing intelligence service MI5 (James Bond is MI6) is likely to hold back on what they know of Assange\u2019s work with Russia in the first instance, as the details of any espionage prosecution would reveal details of cases and indictments that Mueller is keeping under seal. Sources also say that the proof that Michael Cohen was in Prague is close to being given to journalists trusted by NATO intelligence. We will report more on this in another story.\n\nPlease support us with a donation if you can!\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers.

    "text": "The part played by Wikileaks in the Edward Snowden saga is an important one. The pivotal role of Julian Assange and other leading members of Wikileaks in getting Snowden from Hawaii to Moscow, from NSA employment to FSB protection, in the late spring of 2013 is a matter of record.\n\nFor years there have been questions about just what Wikileaks actually is. I know because I\u2019ve been among those asking. Over two years ago, little more than two weeks after Snowden landed in Moscow, I explained my concerns about Wikileaks based on my background in counterintelligence. Specifically, the role of the Russian anti-Semite weirdo Israel Shamir, a close friend of Assange, in the Wikileaks circle merited attention, and to anyone trained in the right clues, the Assange group gave the impression of having a relationship with Russian intelligence. As I summed up my position in July 2013, based on what we knew so far:\n\nIt\u2019s especially important given the fact that Wikileaks is playing a leading role in the Snowden case, to the dismay of some of Ed\u2019s admirers and even members of his family. Not to mention that Snowden, as of this writing, is still in Moscow. One need not be a counterintelligence guru to have serious questions about Shamir and Wikileaks here. It may be a much bigger part of the story than it appears to the naked eye.\n\nEvidence that Wikileaks is not what it seems to be has mounted over the years. Assange\u2019s RT show didn\u2019t help matters, neither did the fact that, despite having claimed to possess secret Russian intelligence files, Wikileaks has never exposed anything sensitive, as they have done with the purloined files of many other countries. To say nothing of Assange & Co. taking unmistakably pro-Russian positions on a host of controversial issues. Questions logically followed.\n\nNow answers are appearing. It\u2019s long been known that Wikileaks, by their own admission, counseled Ed Snowden in June 2013 to leave Hong Kong and head to Moscow. Contrary to the countless lies propagated by Snowden Operation activists, Snowden\u2019s arrival in Russia was his choice; it had nothing to do with canceled passports in Washington, DC.\n\nAn important gap has been filled this week by Julian Assange, who admitted that Snowden going to Moscow was his idea. Ed wanted to head to Latin America, Julian asserted, especially Ecuador, whose London embassy Assange has been hiding out in for years on the lam from rape changes in Sweden. As Assange explained, \u201cHe preferred Latin America, but my advice was that he should take asylum in Russia despite the negative PR consequences, because my assessment is that he had a significant risk he could be kidnapped from Latin America on CIA orders. Kidnapped or possibly killed.\u201d\n\nOnly in Russia would Ed be safe, Julian counseled, because there he would be protected by Vladimir Putin and his secret services, notably the FSB. One might think that seeking the shelter of the FSB \u2014 one of the world\u2019s nastiest secret police forces that spies on millions without warrant and murders opponents freely \u2014 might be an odd choice for a \u201cprivacy organization.\u201d But Wikileaks is no ordinary NGO.\n\nWhy Assange knew Russia would take in Snowden \u2014 it could be a big political hassle for Moscow \u2014 is a key question that any counterintelligence officer would want answered. Was Julian speaking on behalf of the FSB or did he just \u201cknow\u201d Ed could obtain the sanctuary plus protection he sought?\n\nJust as telling is the recent report on Assange\u2019s activities in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, where it turns out Ecuadorian intelligence has been keeping tabs on him. Which is no surprise given the PR mess Assange has created for Ecuador with his on-going antics.\n\nEspecially interesting is the revelation that, while holed up in London, Assange \u201crequested that he be able to chose his own Security Service inside the embassy, suggesting the use of Russian operatives.\u201d It is, to say the least, surpassingly strange that a Western \u201cprivacy advocate\u201d wants Russian secret police protection while hiding out in a Western country. The original Spanish is clear: Assange \u201chabr\u00eda sido la elecci\u00f3n de su propio Servicio de Seguridad en el interior de la embajada, llegando a proponer la participaci\u00f3n de operadores de nacionalidad rusa.\u201d\n\nWhy Assange wants FSB bodyguards is a question every journalist who encounters Julian henceforth should ask. Until he explains that, Wikileaks should be treated as the front and cut-out for Russian intelligence that it has become, while those who get in bed with Wikileaks \u2014 many Western \u201cprivacy advocates\u201d are in that group \u2014 should be asked their feelings about their own at least indirect ties with Putin\u2019s spy services.\n\nP.S. For those familiar with espionage history, there is a clear precedent for such an arrangement. In 1978 the magazine Covert Action Information Bulletin appeared to expose the secrets of US and Western intelligence. Its editor was Phil Agee, a former CIA officer who had gotten into bed with Cuban and Soviet intelligence; think of Agee as the Snowden of the pre-Internet era. CAIB was in fact founded on the direction of the KGB and for years served as a conduit for Kremlin lies and disinformation that seriously harmed Western intelligence. While CAIB presented itself as a radical truth-telling group, in actuality it was a KGB front, though few CAIB staffers beyond Agee knew who was really calling the shots. One suspects much the same is happening with Wikileaks.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been granted his permanent security clearance, a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday, ending a period of uncertainty that had fueled questions about whether Mr. Kushner was in peril in the special counsel investigation.\n\nMr. Kushner is a senior presidential aide with a prominent role in Middle East diplomacy. But his F.B.I. background checks dragged on for a year and became one of many political distractions for the White House. Even some inside the administration suspected that Mr. Kushner\u2019s delay reflected legal problems on the horizon.\n\nThe permanent clearances make Mr. Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, eligible to view some of the United States\u2019 most closely guarded secrets, including the daily intelligence briefing that Mr. Trump receives and the delicate intelligence on the Israelis and the Palestinians that former diplomats said can be valuable in negotiations. Top-secret clearances are typically required for people viewing foreign intelligence or sitting in on high-level White House meetings.\n\nWhite House officials were adamant that the lengthy process was not unusual for a government official who has a complicated financial history and many foreign contacts. But with the special counsel investigating some of Mr. Kushner\u2019s meetings with Russian officials, it left open the question of whether investigators had uncovered evidence that made him a security threat."

    "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 25, 2019, 1:14 AM GMT / Updated Jan. 25, 2019, 3:17 AM GMT By Laura Strickler, Ken Dilanian and Peter Alexander\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Jared Kushner's application for a top-secret clearance was rejected by two career White House security specialists after an FBI background check raised concerns about potential foreign influence on him \u2014 but their supervisor overruled the recommendation and approved the clearance, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nThe official, Carl Kline, is a former Pentagon employee who was installed as director of the personnel security office in the Executive Office of the President in May 2017. Kushner's was one of at least 30 cases in which Kline overruled career security experts and approved a top-secret clearance for incoming Trump officials despite unfavorable information, the two sources said. They said the number of rejections that were overruled was unprecedented \u2014 it had happened only once in the three years preceding Kline's arrival.\n\nThe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the information, said the Trump White House attracted many people with untraditional backgrounds who had complicated financial and personal histories, some of which raised red flags.\n\nKushner's FBI background check identified questions about his family's business, his foreign contacts, his foreign travel and meetings he had during the campaign, the sources said, declining to be more specific.\n\nThe White House office only determines eligibility for secret and top-secret clearances. As a very senior official, Kushner was seeking an even higher designation that would grant him access to what is known as \"sensitive compartmented information,\" or SCI. That material makes up the government's most sensitive secrets, including transcripts of intercepted foreign communications, CIA source reporting and other intelligence seemingly important for Kushner, whose job portfolio covers the Mideast and Mexico.\n\nThe CIA is the agency that decides whether to grant SCI clearance to senior White House officials after conducting a further background check.\n\nAfter Kline overruled the White House security specialists and recommended Kushner for a top-secret clearance, Kushner's file then went to the CIA for a ruling on SCI.\n\nAfter reviewing the file, CIA officers who make clearance decisions balked, two of the people familiar with the matter said. One called over to the White House security division, wondering how Kushner got even a top-secret clearance, the sources said. Top-secret information is defined as material that would cause \"exceptionally grave damage\" to national security if disclosed to adversaries.\n\nThe sources say the CIA has not granted Kushner clearance to review SCI material. That would mean Kushner lacks access to key intelligence unless President Donald Trump decides to override the rules, which is the president's' prerogative. The Washington Post reported in July 2018 that Kushner was not given an \"SCI\" clearance. CIA spokesman Timothy Barrett said, \"The CIA does not comment on individual security clearances.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the same: \"We don't comment on security clearances.\"\n\nNBC News was unable to reach Kline for comment. Kushner's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, had no comment.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, D.-Md., chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said in a statement that the NBC News report raised questions he hopes to answer as part of his investigation, announced this week, into how the Trump administration has handled security clearances.\n\n\u201cThe system is supposed to be a nonpartisan determination of an individual\u2019s fitness to hold a clearance, not an ad hoc approach that overrules career experts to give the president\u2019s family members access to our nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets,\u201d he told NBC News.\n\n\"What you are reporting is what all of us feared,\" said Brad Moss, a lawyer who represents persons seeking security clearances. \"The normal line adjudicators looked at the FBI report \u2026 saw the foreign influence concerns, but were overruled by the quasi-political supervisor.\"\n\nThe sources said they did not know whether Kline was in communication with senior political White House officials. They say he overruled career bureaucrats at least 30 times, granting top-secret clearances to officials in the Executive Office of the President or the White House after adjudicators working for him recommended against doing so.\n\nKline left the White House personnel security office at least a week ago and is now back at the Department of Defense, according to the Pentagon press office.\n\nThe reasons for denying a clearance can include debts, a criminal past or questions about foreign entanglements. Anything in a person's background that could make them vulnerable to blackmail can be a factor.\n\nKushner's application followed the normal path for security clearance. It passed a \"suitability review\" in the White House and then went to the FBI for a background investigation.\n\nFollowing the FBI investigation, the case went back to the White House office of personnel security, where a career adjudicator reviewed the FBI information, including questions about foreign influence and foreign business entanglements, the sources said.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing current and former U.S. officials familiar with intelligence reports on the matter, reported last February that officials in at least four countries had privately discussed ways they could manipulate Kushner by taking advantage of his complex business arrangements, financial difficulties and lack of foreign policy experience.\n\nAmong those nations discussing ways to influence Kushner to their advantage, according to the current and former officials, were the United Arab Emirates, China, Israel and Mexico, the Post reported.\n\nOn the basis of potential foreign influence, the adjudicator deemed Kushner's application \"unfavorable\" and handed it to a supervisor.\n\nThe supervisor agreed with the \"unfavorable\" determination and gave it to Kline, the head of the office at the time, who overruled the \"unfavorable\" determination and approved Kushner for \"top secret\" security clearance, the sources said.\n\n\"No one else gets that kind of treatment,\" Moss said. \"My clients would get body slammed if they did that.\"\n\nSources also told NBC News career employees of the White House office disagreed with other steps Kline took, including ceasing credit checks on security clearance applicants. The sources said Kline cited a data breach at the credit reporting firm Equifax.\n\nKline is the subject of an October 2018 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint viewed by NBC News that was filed by Tricia Newbold, a current employee. Newbold has a rare form of dwarfism and the complaint alleges Kline discriminated against her because of her height.\n\nHer complaint states that, in December 2017, Kline moved security files to a new location that was too high and out of her reach and told her, \"You have people, have them get you the files you need; or you can ask me.\"\n\nTricia Newbold has filed an EEOC complaint against Carl Kline, alleging he discriminated against her because of her height.\n\nHer attorney, Ed Passman, told NBC News, \"My client has been subjected to ongoing discrimination by a ruthless supervisor who was destroying the personnel security division by granting security clearances over the objections of civil servant recommendations.\"\n\nIn a letter to her family obtained by NBC News, Newbold described Kline's behavior toward her as \"aggressive,\" involving \"emotional and psychological abuse\" starting in July 2017, a few months after he took over the office.\n\nIn the same letter, Newbold wrote that she also had serious concerns about how Kline \"continuously changes policy\" and makes \"reckless security judgments.\" She added that Kline's decisions \"if disclosed, can cause embarrassment and negative attention to the administration.\"\n\nNewbold raised concerns about Kline's behavior with her second level supervisor regarding his \"hostility and integrity,\" according to the EEOC complaint.\n\nThe Executive Office of the President investigated Newbold\u2019s claims from the EEOC complaint. Newbold's attorney is now waiting to hear if his client will be granted a hearing."

    "text": "Spy vs. Spy, El Chapo Edition\n\nEl Chapo was obsessed with spying on his lovers.\n\nWith the help of his IT specialist, the Mexican drug lord would supply them with what he called his \u201cspecial phones\u201d\u2014devices that had been infected with the commercial spyware Flexispy. With that program installed, the phones became surveillance tools for the narcotrafficker born Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera.\n\nFor weeks, jurors in a federal courtroom in Brooklyn have heard evidence against Guzm\u00e1n, who has been charged with running a global, multibillion-dollar drug empire as the head of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel.\n\nIn recent days the trial has taken a turn toward techno-thriller as the prosecution brought Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s former IT specialist to the stand, where he detailed how he set up an encrypted telephone system for El Chapo, supplied him with commercial spyware to spy on lovers and lieutenants, and then turned the whole system against him.\n\nFor longtime observers of technology and espionage, the Chapo trial has turned into a parable of our times.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental lesson is that technology makes accessing this information easier and cheaper. It\u2019s just too easy to get ahold of this stuff,\u201d said Stewart Baker, a former general counsel at the National Security Agency. \u201cWe are going to see people get access to private information more easily.\u201d\n\nGuzm\u00e1n also delighted in infecting his underlings\u2019 phones with spyware. He would call up his lieutenants and hang up, then activate the microphones of an infected device to hear what his subordinates had to say when their boss wasn\u2019t in the room, according to courtroom testimony.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n\u2019s IT specialist, Christian Rodr\u00edguez, says he first supplied his boss with 10 devices infected with Flexispy, and then another 40, providing him with a powerful tool to monitor his employees and lovers. The software was installed on phones belonging to his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, and at least two girlfriends.\n\nIn 2010, the FBI approached Rodr\u00edguez and flipped him, which allowed the bureau to infiltrate El Chapo\u2019s communications network. Rodr\u00edguez installed monitoring software on the encrypted phone system and provided federal agents with usernames and passwords for Chapo\u2019s Flexispy accounts.\n\nIn testimony this week, prosecutors have presented a series of highly incriminating, embarrassing conversations. The material presented in court includes details of drug transactions and conversations about shootouts. With El Chapo\u2019s wife in the audience, prosecutors read aloud from his text-message conversations with his lovers.\n\n\u201cYou are the most important person to me, I love you,\u201d Chapo wrote to one of his girlfriends, for whom an FBI agent claimed El Chapo had arranged liposuction.\n\nFlexispy is marketed by a Thai company and has been widely abused by jealous spouses to track their partners, as Vice reported in 2017.\n\nBut Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s \u201cspecial phones\u201d represent just one half of the tech story unfolding in Brooklyn. With his trial generating international headlines, the Israeli spyware firm NSO Group has gotten in on the action with a well-timed marketing ploy, telling the Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman that its Pegasus software was used by Mexican authorities to track down Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nThat software is best known for its role in intercepting the communications of human rights activists around the globe, including in Mexico, where it has been deployed against journalists reporting on the drug trade and cartel violence, among other. Pegasus has been detected in some 45 countries, and it most recently gained attention for its use against Saudi activists critical of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nBut the Israeli company is now cashing in on a rare bit of good PR, in an attempt to shift the conversation around its flagship product to its usefulness in fighting crime. The company argues that its technology is a key tool to combat crime, though human rights activists argue that the company has insufficient controls in place to ensure that it is not also used against members of civil society.\n\nThe use of NSO\u2019s technology in capturing El Chapo has featured in the company\u2019s marketing materials since at least 2017, but now it is making its executives available for interviews to an influential Israeli journalist in what appears to be a carefully calculated public relations maneuver.\n\nSo far, no material has emerged in the trial to corroborate that account, so NSO\u2019s claims should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nBut if they \u201creally were valuable in catching El Chapo, you shouldn\u2019t begrudge them a victory lap,\u201d Baker, the former NSA attorney, said."

    "title": "Ecuador Will Imminently Withdraw Asylum for Julian Assange and Hand Him Over to the U.K. What Comes Next?",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The consequences of such an agreement depend in part on the concessions Ecuador extracts in exchange for withdrawing Assange\u2019s asylum. But as former Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa told The Intercept in an interview in May, Moreno\u2019s government has returned Ecuador to a highly \u201csubservient\u201d and \u201csubmissive\u201d posture toward Western governments.\n\nA source close to the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry and the president\u2019s office, unauthorized to speak publicly, has confirmed to The Intercept that Moreno is close to finalizing, if he has not already finalized, an agreement to hand over Assange to the U.K. within the next several weeks. The withdrawal of asylum and physical ejection of Assange could come as early as this week. On Friday, RT reported that Ecuador was preparing to enter into such an agreement.\n\nMoreno\u2019s itinerary also notably includes a trip to Madrid, where he will meet with Spanish officials still seething over Assange\u2019s denunciation of human rights abuses perpetrated by Spain\u2019s central government against protesters marching for Catalonian independence. Almost three months ago, Ecuador blocked Assange from accessing the internet, and Assange has not been able to communicate with the outside world ever since. The primary factor in Ecuador\u2019s decision to silence him was Spanish anger over Assange\u2019s tweets about Catalonia.\n\nEcuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno traveled to London on Friday for the ostensible purpose of speaking at the 2018 Global Disability Summit (Moreno has been using a wheelchair since being shot in a 1998 robbery attempt). The concealed actual purpose of the president\u2019s trip is to meet with British officials to finalize an agreement under which Ecuador will withdraw its asylum protection of Julian Assange, in place since 2012; eject him from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London; and then hand over the WikiLeaks founder to British authorities.\n\nIt is thus highly unlikely that Moreno \u2014 who has shown himself to be willing to submit to threats and coercion from the U.K., Spain, and the U.S. \u2014 will obtain a guarantee that the U.K. not extradite Assange to the U.S., where top Donald Trump officials have vowed to prosecute Assange and destroy WikiLeaks.\n\nThe central oddity of Assange\u2019s case \u2014 that he has been effectively imprisoned for eight years despite never having been charged with, let alone convicted of, any crime \u2014 is virtually certain to be prolonged once Ecuador hands him over to the U.K. Even under the best-case scenario, it appears highly likely that Assange will continue to be imprisoned by British authorities.\n\nThe only known criminal proceeding Assange currently faces is a pending 2012 arrest warrant for \u201cfailure to surrender\u201d \u2014 basically a minor bail violation that arose when he obtained asylum from Ecuador rather than complying with bail conditions by returning to court for a hearing on his attempt to resist extradition to Sweden.\n\nThat offense carries a prison term of three months and a fine, though it is possible that the time Assange has already spent in prison in the U.K. could be counted against that sentence. In 2010, Assange was imprisoned in Wandsworth Prison, kept in isolation for 10 days until he was released on bail; he was then under house arrest for 550 days at the home of a supporter.\n\nAssange\u2019s lawyer, Jen Robinson, told The Intercept that he would argue that all of that prison time already served should count toward (and thus completely fulfill) any prison term imposed on the \u201cfailure to surrender\u201d charge, though British prosecutors would almost certainly contest that claim. Assange would also argue that he had a reasonable, valid basis for seeking asylum rather than submitting to U.K. authorities: namely, well-grounded fear that he would be extradited to the U.S. for prosecution for the act of publishing documents.\n\nBeyond that minor charge, British prosecutors could argue that Assange\u2019s evading of legal process in the U.K. was so protracted, intentional, and malicious that it rose beyond mere \u201cfailure to surrender\u201d to \u201ccontempt of court,\u201d which carries a prison term of up to two years. Just on those charges alone, then, Assange faces a high risk of detention for another year or even longer in a British prison.\n\nCurrently, that is the only known criminal proceeding Assange faces. In May 2017, Swedish prosecutors announced they were closing their investigation into the sexual assault allegations due to the futility of proceeding in light of Assange\u2019s asylum and the time that has elapsed.\n\nThe far more important question that will determine Assange\u2019s future is what the U.S. government intends to do. The Barack Obama administration was eager to prosecute Assange and WikiLeaks for publishing hundreds of thousands of classified documents, but ultimately concluded that there was no way to do so without either also prosecuting newspapers such as the New York Times and The Guardian, which published the same documents, or creating precedents that would enable the criminal prosecution of media outlets in the future.\n\nIndeed, it is technically a crime under U.S. law for anyone \u2014 including a media outlet \u2014 to publish certain types of classified information. Under U.S. law, for instance, it was a felony for the Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius to report on the contents of telephone calls, intercepted by the National Security Agency, between then-national security adviser nominee Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, even though such reporting was clearly in the public interest since it proved Flynn lied when he denied such contacts.\n\nThat the Washington Post and Ignatius \u2014 and not merely their sources \u2014 violated U.S. criminal law by revealing the contents of intercepted communications with a Russian official is made clear by the text of 18 \u00a7 798 of the U.S. Code, which provides:\n\n\u201cWhoever knowingly and willfully communicates \u2026 or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes \u2026 any classified information \u2026 obtained by the processes of communication intelligence from the communications of any foreign government \u2026 shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nBut the U.S. Justice Department has never wanted to indict and prosecute anyone for the crime of publishing such material, contenting themselves instead to prosecuting the government sources who leak it. Their reluctance has been due to two reasons: First, media outlets would argue that any attempts to criminalize the mere publication of classified or stolen documents is barred by the press freedom guarantee of the First Amendment, a proposition the Justice Department has never wanted to test; second, no Justice Department has wanted as part of its legacy the creation of a precedent that allows the U.S. government to criminally prosecute journalists and media outlets for reporting classified documents.\n\nBut the Trump administration has made clear that they have no such concerns. Quite the contrary: Last April, Trump\u2019s then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo, now his secretary of state, delivered a deranged, rambling, highly threatening broadside against WikiLeaks. Without citing any evidence, Pompeo decreed that WikiLeaks is \u201ca non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia,\u201d and thus declared, \u201cWe have to recognize that we can no longer allow Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us.\u201d\n\nThe longtime right-wing congressman, now one of Trump\u2019s most loyal and favored cabinet officials, also explicitly rejected any First Amendment concerns about prosecuting Assange, arguing that while WikiLeaks \u201cpretended that America\u2019s First Amendment freedoms shield them from justice \u2026 they may have believed that, but they are wrong.\u201d\n\nPompeo then issued this bold threat: \u201cTo give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets is a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for. It ends now.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Attorney General Jeff Sessions has similarly vowed not only to continue and expand the Obama Justice Department\u2019s crackdown on sources, but also to consider the prosecution of media outlets that publish classified information. It would be incredibly shrewd for Sessions to lay the foundation for doing so by prosecuting Assange first, safe in the knowledge that journalists themselves \u2014 consumed with hatred for Assange due to personal reasons, professional jealousies, and anger over the role they believed he played in 2016 in helping Hillary Clinton lose \u2014 would unite behind the Trump Justice Department and in support of its efforts to imprison Assange.\n\nDuring the Obama years, it was a mainstream view among media outlets that prosecuting Assange would be a serious danger to press freedoms. Even the Washington Post editorial page, which vehemently condemned WikiLeaks, warned in 2010 that any such prosecution would \u201ccriminalize the exchange of information and put at risk\u201d all media outlets. When Pompeo and Sessions last year issued their threats to prosecute Assange, former Obama Justice Department spokesperson Matthew Miller insisted that no such prosecution could ever succeed:\n\nFor years, the Obama Justice Department searched for evidence that Assange actively assisted Chelsea Manning or other sources in the hacking or stealing of documents \u2014 in order to prosecute them for more than merely publishing documents \u2014 and found no such evidence. But even that theory \u2014 that a publisher of classified documents can be prosecuted for assisting a source \u2014 would be a severe threat to press freedom, since journalists frequently work in some form of collaboration with sources who remove or disclose classified information. And nobody has ever presented evidence that WikiLeaks conspired with whoever hacked the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta email inboxes to effectuate that hacking.\n\nBut there seems little question that, as Sessions surely knows, large numbers of U.S. journalists \u2014 along with many, or perhaps most, Democrats \u2014 would actually support the Trump Justice Department in prosecuting Assange for publishing documents. After all, the DNC sued WikiLeaks in April for publishing documents \u2014 a serious, obvious threat to press freedom \u2014 and few objected.\n\nAnd it was Democratic senators such as Dianne Feinstein who, during the Obama years, were urging the prosecution of WikiLeaks, with the support of numerous GOP senators. There is no doubt that, after 2016, support among both journalists and Democrats for imprisoning Assange for publishing documents would be higher than ever.\n\nIf the U.S. did indict Assange for alleged crimes relating to the publication of documents, or if they have already obtained a sealed indictment, and then uses that indictment to request that the U.K. extradite him to the U.S. to stand trial, that alone would ensure that Assange remains in prison in the U.K. for years to come.\n\nAssange would, of course, resist any such extradition on the ground that publishing documents is not a cognizable crime and that the U.S is seeking his extradition for political charges that, by treaty, cannot serve as the basis for extradition. But it would take at least a year, and probably closer to three years, for U.K. courts to decide these extradition questions. And while all of that lingers, Assange would almost certainly be in prison, given that it is inconceivable that a British judge would release Assange on bail given what happened the last time he was released.\n\nAll of this means that it is highly likely that Assange \u2014 under his best-case scenario \u2014 faces at least another year in prison, and will end up having spent a decade in prison despite never having been charged with, let alone convicted of, any crime. He has essentially been punished \u2014 imprisoned \u2014 by process.\n\nAnd while it is often argued that Assange has only himself to blame, it is beyond doubt, given the grand jury convened by the Obama Justice Department and now the threats of Pompeo and Sessions, that the fear that led Assange to seek asylum in the first place \u2014 being extradited to the U.S. and politically persecuted for political crimes \u2014 was well-grounded.\n\nAssange, his lawyers and his supporters always said that he would immediately board a plane to Stockholm if he were guaranteed that doing so would not be used to extradite him to the U.S., and for years offered to be questioned by Swedish investigators inside the embassy in London, something Swedish prosecutors only did years later. Citing those facts, a United Nations panel ruled in 2016 that the actions of the U.K. government constituted \u201carbitrary detention\u201d and a violation of Assange\u2019s fundamental human rights.\n\nBut if, as seems quite likely, the Trump administration finally announces that it intends to prosecute Assange for publishing classified U.S. government documents, we will be faced with the bizarre spectacle of U.S. journalists \u2014 who have spent the last two years melodramatically expressing grave concern over press freedom due to insulting tweets from Trump about Wolf Blitzer and Chuck Todd, or his mean treatment of Jim Acosta \u2014 possibly cheering for a precedent that would be the gravest press freedom threat in decades.\n\nThat precedent would be one that could easily be used to put them in a prison cell alongside Assange for the new \u201ccrime\u201d of publishing any documents that the U.S. government has decreed should not be published. When it comes to press freedom threats, such an indictment would not be in the same universe as name-calling tweets by Trump directed at various TV personalities.\n\nWhen it came to denouncing due process denials and the use of torture at Guant\u00e1namo, it was not difficult for journalists to set aside their personal dislike for Al Qaeda sympathizers to denounce the dangers of those human rights and legal abuses. When it comes to free speech assaults, journalists are able to set aside their personal contempt for a person\u2019s opinions to oppose the precedent that the government can punish people for expressing noxious ideas.\n\nIt should not be this difficult for journalists to set aside their personal emotions about Assange to recognize the profound dangers \u2014 not just to press freedoms but to themselves \u2014 if the U.S. government succeeds in keeping Assange imprisoned for years to come, all due to its attempts to prosecute him for publishing classified or stolen documents. That seems the highly likely scenario once Ecuador hands over Assange to the U.K."

We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\"\n\n\"We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,\" the report adds.\n\nThe much-anticipated report, ordered by President Barack Obama last month, was expected to shed new light on what intelligence officials and members of Congress have said is \"conclusive evidence\" that Russia was not just behind hacking the Democratic National Committee servers, but also directly involved in releasing tens of thousands of emails from top Democratic Party officials. But while the 25-page report drew damning conclusions of Russia's motivations for meddling in the US elections, and highlighted the misinformation campaign that attempted to influence US voters, it did not provide evidence for those conclusions.\n\nPrivate cybersecurity companies have long published detailed reports on the Russian group known as Fancy Bear which they believe was behind the hacks, though they said it was impossible to prove whether the group had been in direct communication with Wikileaks. Those reports have provided far more forensic evidence than that which was made public in the declassified intelligence report issued Friday.\n\nOn Friday morning, President-elect Donald Trump again sought to throw cold water on the intelligence assessment, telling the New York Times that as the FBI had not examined the DNC servers for themselves, they could not draw conclusions about the hack. Trump based his observation on a BuzzFeed News report, which revealed that the FBI had not been able to access the DNC servers.\n\nBut he shifted his tone and released a statement seeming to acknowledge new evidence that foreign spies had hacked the DNC after his briefing Friday afternoon by Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., FBI Director James Comey, and other intelligence officials.\n\n\u201cWhile Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee,\" Trump said, \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\"\n\n\n\nHe also reiterated the point in two early morning tweets on Saturday.\n\n"

    "text": "A note from the editors Why we took down the Tom White story\n\nAfter careful review, Salon's editors have decided to take down from our Web site an article titled \"Tom White played key role in covering up Enron losses\" that we published on Aug. 29. We took this unusual step because we have come to the conclusion that we can no longer stand by the story in its entirety. Though we have corroborated most of the reporting in the article, some unanswered questions remain.\n\nSpecifically, we have been unable to independently confirm the authenticity of an e-mail from former Enron executive and current Army Secretary Thomas White that was quoted in the article.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAlthough Salon reviewed key supporting documents before publishing the article, we felt compelled to further investigate the story two weeks ago. At that time, we received a phone call from an editor at the Financial Times informing us that several paragraphs of the story, which was written by freelance writer Jason Leopold, had previously appeared in a February story in his paper.\n\nWe reviewed the complaint, discovered that it was legitimate, and posted a correction notice as soon as we were able to confirm the details. As we reported in that notice, \"Leopold ... told Salon that he accidentally copied the passages while writing his own story, and never noticed the error during the editing of the story, or after it was published.\"\n\nWhatever its basis, this sort of plagiarism is a serious breach of journalistic trust, and caused us to go back over every detail and aspect of the original article. Our review led us to take this latest step.\n\nSalon apologizes to its readers. We remain committed to upholding the highest standards of careful journalism -- and, wherever questions or problems do arise, to correcting them promptly and fairly.\n\n-- The editors of Salon"

    "text": "In this file photo taken in January 2017, a man enters the Treasury Department building in Washington, D.C. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA senior Treasury Department employee was charged Wednesday with leaking to a reporter confidential government reports about the financial transactions of Trump associates and others under scrutiny in the special counsel\u2019s probe of Russian election interference.\n\nThe charges reflect the latest move in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to punish leakers within the government. Earlier this week, a former senior Senate staffer pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents in a separate leak investigation.\n\nThe Treasury case centers on a dozen stories published by BuzzFeed News that described suspicious activity reports, or SARs, which are generated by banks when a financial transaction may involve illegal activity.\n\nProsecutors charged Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards with the unauthorized disclosure of suspicious activity reports and conspiracy. The charges were filed in federal court in New York but she made her first court appearance in Northern Virginia.\n\nEdwards, 40, lives outside Richmond and works as a senior adviser at the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, often referred to as \u201cFinCEN.\u201d At a brief court appearance in Alexandria, she was released on $100,000 bond and instructed to appear next month in court in New York. She was also prohibited from speaking to anyone at FinCEN or accessing any FinCEN equipment.\n\nHer lawyer, Peter Greenspun, declined to comment.\n\nGeoffrey S. Berman, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Edwards \u201cbetrayed her position of trust by repeatedly disclosing highly sensitive information.\u201d\n\nThe stories cited in the criminal complaint filed against Edwards match the headlines, wording and information contained in BuzzFeed News stories, though the court papers did not identify the news organization by name.\n\nThose stories often focused on suspicious activity reports related to key figures in the investigation being conducted by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Russian diplomats and other Trump associates.\n\n[Special cousel ready to dismiss counts against Paul Manafort, prepares for sentencing]\n\nOne of the stories published in September included financial transactions involving Rob Goldstone, a British music publicist who helped arrange a meeting between senior Trump advisers and a Russian lawyer in 2016 that has been a focus of the investigation.\n\nGoldstone in an email called it \u201coutrageous\u201d that his \u201cpersonal and private regular banking details were leaked to Buzzfeed in order to create a salacious story.\u201d\n\n[How a British music publicist ended up in the middle of the Russia storm]\n\nThe last BuzzFeed story cited in the charging documents was published on Monday, again drawing largely on information from SARs reports.\n\nAbout 2 million suspicious activity reports were filed in 2017 by banks, money service businesses, casinos and others, according to FinCEN officials. On their own, suspicious activity reports often do not mean very much. But taken with other evidence, they can help guide investigators to specific transactions that might involve financial crimes.\n\nThe 18-page criminal complaint details a search of Edwards\u2019s phone and a flash drive she possessed, on which FBI agents say they found a lengthy digital trail of her interactions with the reporters, in which she shared SARS reports.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the files were saved to a folder on the flash drive entitled \u2018Debacle \u2014 Operation-CF,\u2019 and sub-folders bearing names such as \u2018Debacle\\Emails\\Asshat\u2019,\u201d the complaint stated. \u201cEdwards is not known to be involved in any official FinCEN project or task bearing these file titles or code names.\u201d\n\nThe flash drive files \u201cappear to contain thousands of SARs, along with other highly sensitive material relating to Russia, Iran, and the terrorist group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,\u201d the complaint charges.\n\nWhen FBI agents questioned Edwards on Tuesday, she initially denied having contacts with the reporter whose name appears on the stories at issue, then \u201cchanged her account, and admitted that on numerous occasions, she accessed SARs on her computer, photographed them, and sent those photographs to Reporter-1\u201d using an encrypted application on her phone, according to the complaint.\n\nThe court filing said Edwards referred to herself as a whistleblower in the interview, but added while she had previously filed a whistleblower complaint related to her work, that did not involve the SARs disclosures.\n\nThe court documents also indicate the FBI has investigated one of Edwards\u2019s bosses, an associate director of FinCEN, noting that person exchanged 325 text messages with the reporter in question during the month when the first story appeared citing SARs reports.\n\nThe boss, referred to in court papers as Edwards \u201cco-conspirator,\u201d was not identified in court papers. People familiar with the case identified the person as Kip Brailey. Brailey did not respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday.\n\nA FinCEN spokesman said Edwards has been placed on administrative leave and declined to comment about Brailey.\n\nA BuzzFeed spokesman declined to comment.\n\nRosalind S. Helderman and Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report."

    "text": "UPDATE: Sources with links to the intelligence community have now confirmed that this theory is accurate, and I am therefore upgrading this story from my theory to a factual report.\n\nOnce I announced on Twitter and elsewhere that this theory was validated by sources, data scientists who had been examining the server data began to re-examine it in the light of this statement. @TeaPainUSA on Twitter, who knows his data science, collaborated with some other patriot data scientists on Twitter and off to produce this crucial report explaining how Alfa\u2019s server laundered the data.\n\nOriginal:\n\nHere is my theory of how Donald Trump will be impeached, and scores of people around him jailed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just money laundering \u2013 it was \u201cdata laundering\u201d.\n\nMy theory is based on public reporting, to which I will link in the text. Here it is:\n\nAlfa Bank is a front for Russian intelligence. Along with Dimitry Firtash, a Russian agent of influence, it owns Cambridge Analytica, the data targeting company used by Trump\u2019s campaign. It also owns SCL, the propaganda company responsible for what has been termed \u201cfake news\u201d but was actually real propaganda co-ordinated by Russian intelligence.\n\nCambridge Analytica and SCL use Facebook data they had no right to acquire, illegally stolen by a Russian spy working at Cambridge, to build an unbeatable target database of propaganda.\n\nIn the closing days of the election, the Russian state hacked into the voter rolls of the United States. Russian intelligence did this in order that they could provide this information to Alfa Bank in order to use Cambridge Analytica\u2019s targeting, and SCL\u2019s propaganda, in order precisely to target voters and tip them to Trump.\n\nPaul Manafort, who had always worked for and with the Trump campaign and who never left the campaign, relayed messages to Trump based on this stolen voter database information married to Cambridge Analytica and SCL targeting.\n\nBoth Manafort and Trump knew that this targeting information was based on stolen voter databases.\n\nThe Alfa Bank server in Trump Tower provided fresh evidence for the granting of the FISA warrant, I reported. (this is a fact). However, the warrant was broader than merely looking at the server metadata. It explicitly covered US persons caught up in the inquiry and explicitly covered the right for the FBI to read intercepts and hear tapes and other materials on US persons, related to this inquiry, already existing and provided by intelligence from a Baltic state ally, which report was Estonia. [Editor \u2013 this is a correction from my earlier wrong report of Lithuania].\n\nI believe the Alfa Bank server was sending back to Russia information on the hacked voter databases and how they could be micro-targeted.\n\nJust before the election, Manafort, who worked with Firtash and Alfa Bank, told Trump to go and campaign in Michigan. Public polling showed that Trump had no chance in Michigan.\n\nI believe, in summary:\n\nA Russian spy stole the Facebook data of hundreds of millions of Americans\n\nFrom that data, Russia crafted propaganda messages via SCL and targeted them by Cambridge Analytica\n\nBoth of these were owned by Alfa Bank and Firtash, Russian agent and boss of Manafort;\n\nIn order to perfect the social media targeting Russia hacked the electoral voter databases of various key American states:\n\nThis information was fed back to Manafort and Cambridge Analytica / SCL via the means of the bank server in Trump Tower;\n\nManafort and Trump used terrifyingly accurate micro-targeting obtained firstly by Facebook theft but secondly by Russia obtaining the exact demographic profiles of voters through hacks of US state databases and passing it back to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThis theory, if true, would directly connect the Russian state with the Trump campaign and mean that Trump colluded with Russian spies who were hacking America. He will be impeached for it.\n\nThere is much more Trump has done, but the Russian voter database hacks \u2014> to Cambridge Analytica \u2014> to SCL \u201cfake news\u201d to target the election \u2014-> with Trump\u2019s knowledge via Manafort \u2013 is the single most direct proof of Trump\u2019s collusion with America\u2019s enemies.\n\nFurthermore and as a coda,\n\nI believe, although to what Chris Steele might call a \u2018low confidence\u2019 level, that Roger Stone was communicating with Guccifer2 who hacked the DNC and Podesta, and that these releases had not worked. I believe that whoever Stone\u2019s \u201cgo-between\u201d to Wikileaks was, that person worked for or with Cambridge Analytica/SCL / Alfa Bank , and that person passed on the message that precise targeting and propaganda would be needed to win the election, hence the hacking of the voter databases and the messaging that went back into them.\n\nI have a pretty strong idea who this person and his backers are, and I shall be passing it to UK intelligence.\n\nLastly, following our exclusive reporting that Wikileaks is a Russian front who, days before the DNC hack, not only bought Russian servers, but gave their SSL keys to a Russian hacker Peter Chayanov, meaning he could see \u2013 and the FSB could see \u2013 everything on the Wikileaks site, including the IP address of any foolish Americans \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d to Wikileaks (like Chelsea Manning), meaning Putin could blackmail them, I will assume that Chayanov is Guccifer2; that he was collaborating with Stone and Manafort both directly and indirectly; and that he worked with Russian state hackers to attack US voter databases.\n\nAnd, to quote Jim Carrey in \u2018Liar, Liar,\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s the game!\u201d\n\nNow I will list the reporting on which this theory is based. I will address \u201cMoscow Mike Misha Flynn\u201d and the Cambridge University spy ring in another post \u2013 I have learned the hard way that too much information just shuts people down (when they don\u2019t have ADHD). But as a snippet, I will say that I believe Jared Kushner and Mike Flynn were both caught talking to Russian spies who worked with Sberbank, the parent company of SVB Bank \u2013 the OTHER bank that was a named target of the FISA warrant.\n\nSo, if you like, Alfa Bank \u2013 which owned Cambridge Analytica and passed info to and from Russia on hacked voter databases, for electoral gain, is the SIGINT part of this theory (Signals intelligence) \u2013 and SVB Bank, which funded \u201cstartups\u201d through Russian intel front Sberbank, is the HUMINT part of this theory \u2013 think Kushner, Mike Flynn and Epshteyn.\n\nAgain, Alfa Bank and SVB Bank are the two NAMED TARGETS of the FISA warrant granted on October 15th \u2013 one week after US intelligence put out a statement on voter database hacking, on October 7th.\n\nI believe this is why. There was money laundering from these banks \u2013 but there was data laundering, too.\n\nReports:\n\nFISA warrant granted on these banks (me, HeatStreet, Nov 7th 2016).\n\nFISA warrant granted on these banks October 15th \u2013 Paul Wood, BBC\n\nUS IC is correlating the voter database hack to targeting, with collusion \u2013 Paul Wood, BBC\n\nAlfa Bank and Firtash, who hired Manafort, actually own SCL and Cambridge Analytica \u2013 Ann Marlowe, the Tablet\n\nThere is a secret server belonging to Alfa Bank passing information back to Russia \u2013 Franklin Foer, Slate and David Corn, Mother Jones\n\nAlex Kogan of GSR, later SCL, illegally scraped, without permission, the data of millions of Facebook users \u2013 the Guardian\n\nKogan fled to Singapore and renamed himself Alex Spectre \u2013 Motherboard\n\nGeneral Flynn was in touch with a Russian spy ring at Cambridge University \u2013 the Financial Times\n\nDimitry Firtash donated to Cambridge University \u2013 Ann Marlowe, the Tablet\n\nVoter databases were hacked by Russia \u2013 US Intelligence\n\nWikileaks and Gruccifer2 are Russian fronts \u2013 US intelligence\n\nWikileaks bought Russian servers in advance of the release of the DNC hacks \u2013 Laurelai Bailey, for Patribotics\n\nWikileaks handed its SSL keys to Putin\u2019s Hacker Pytor Chayonov \u2013 me, for Patribotics"

    "text": "The news that Robert Mueller\u2018s office put out a statement disputing BuzzFeed\u2019s big Michael Cohen report shocked pretty much everyone tonight, and on CNN Erin Burnett said it doesn\u2019t look good for BuzzFeed.\n\nMueller\u2019s office rarely puts out statements, but in response to the report that got so much pick-up since last night, spokesman Peter Carr sent out a statement saying, \u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate.\u201d\n\nCNN political correspondent Sara Murray told Burnett it\u2019s remarkable they would have put this statement out in the first place, but said this is a \u201cvery different kind of story.\u201d\n\nFormer US district attorney Harry Sandick said Mueller\u2019s office likely felt an obligation to \u201ccorrect the record\u201d and keep people from being \u201cmisled.\u201d\n\nBurnett then said, \u201cWe need to know more details, but you have a news organization come out citing two law enforcement officials with direct knowledge, saying there was corroborating evidence, saying one of the reporters had seen it, and the special counsel\u2019s office is saying it blatantly isn\u2019t true. I mean, it sounds pretty terrible for BuzzFeed.\u201d\n\nJohn Dean agreed and said, \u201cI looked at the reporters who were behind the story. I only know one of them, Jason Leopold. He\u2019s a careful reporter. And I can\u2019t believe he would put out a bogus story. The other one is a Pulitzer Prize winner, which makes it even more confusing. They\u2019re both investigative reporters, and they must have trusted their sources, so they may have been misled by their sources. It\u2019s hard to tell at this point.\u201d\n\nYou can watch above, via CNN.\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com"

    "text": "DOJ Rings Up Another Leaker, Nailing Financial Investigation Official For Handing Docs To Buzzfeed\n\nfrom the stop-handing-journalists-info-the-public-might-want-to-see! dept\n\nAnother government employee has been charged with leaking sensitive info. This time it's a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) official -- one who apparently handed dozens of suspicious activity reports (SARs) to Buzzfeed.\n\nManhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, who was picked by Trump to replace Preet Bharara\u2019s deputy Joon Kim, denounced BuzzFeed\u2019s accused source. \u201cNatalie Mayflower Sours Edwards, a senior-level FinCEN employee, betrayed her position of trust by repeatedly disclosing highly sensitive information contained in Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to an individual not authorized to receive them,\u201d Berman said in a statement Wednesday announcing the charges.\n\nThe leaked SARs dealt with alleged money laundering by Russian diplomats, as well as transactions possibly related to the purchase of hacked Hillary Clinton emails by a GOP figure. These were supposedly the basis for nine Buzzfeed articles over the last year, with the most recent article cited in the complaint appearing only a few days ago (October 15).\n\nThe complaint [PDF] itself is an interesting read. It makes it clear investigators don't necessarily need to see the content of a person's messages to draw inferences about their behavior.\n\n18. Based upon my training, experience, my conversations with other law enforcement agents with training and experience in cyber technology, and my conversations with law enforcement agents who have reviewed records received in response to a judicially-authorized pen register and trap and trace order for the EDWARDS Cellphone (the \"EDWARDS Pen\"), I have learned, among other things, that: a.The EDWARDS Cellphone utilized a mobile messaging service that utilizes end-to-end encryption (the \"Encrypted Application\"), that is, a method of secure communication that prevents third-parties from accessing data, including the companies that host the end-to-end services, and law enforcement. b. On or about August 1, 2018, within approximately six hours of the EDWARDS Pen becoming operative--and the day after the July 2018 Article was published--the EDWARDS Cellphone exchanged approximately 70 messages via the Encrypted Application with the Reporter-1 Cellphone during an approximately 20-minute time span between 12:33 a.m. and 12:54 a.m. c.Between on or about July 31, 2018 and August 2, 2018, the EDWARDS Cellphone and the personal cellphone of CC-1 exchanged dozens of messages via the Encrypted Application. d. On or about August 2, 2018, approximately one week prior to the publication of the First August 2018 Article, the EDWARDS Cellphone exchanged approximately 541 messages with the Reporter-1 Cellphone via the Encrypted Application. e. On or about August 10, 2018, the day of the publication of the First August 2018 Article, the EDWARDS Cellphone and the Reporter-1 Cellphone exchanged approximately 11 messages via the Encrypted Application.\n\nIt doesn't appear investigators were able to access the content of the messages until they examined Edwards' phone.\n\nThroughout the course of 2018, EDWARDS engaged in hundreds of electronic communications with Reporter-1, many via an encrypted application. A review to date, pursuant to a judicially-authorized search warrant executed today, of EDWARDS's personal cellphone has revealed that that cellphone contains the substance of many of these communications, including, as described in greater detail below, communications in which EDWARDS transmitted or described SARs or other protected information to Reporter-1.\n\nSo much for going dark. Presumably the information obtained with the pen register order was enough to secure a warrant to search a cellphone and flash drive owned by Edwards. \"Reporter-1\" is likely Jason Leopold, who wrote or co-wrote every article named in the DOJ complaint. This also means the DOJ likely has a whole bunch of conversations between a journalist and his source, although obtaining them from the source makes it far less of a First Amendment issue.\n\nThe other interesting part of the complaint is this: Edwards viewed her leaks as whistleblowing and had pursued a whistleblower complaint in the past.\n\nDuring the interview described herein, EDWARDS told the Interviewing Agents, in sum and substance, that she is a \"whistleblower\" who provided the SARs to Reporter-1 for \"record keeping.\" Based on my participation in this investigation and my conversations with other law enforcement agents, I am aware that, prior to the SARs Disclosures, EDWARDS had previously filed a whistleblower complaint unrelated to the SARs Disclosures, and that EDWARDS had also reached out to congressional staffers regarding, among other things, her unrelated whistleblower complaint.\n\nThese leaked SARS may have been one of the \"other things\" she spoke to staffers about. It appears she felt these SARs would just be buried by the administration. Or she felt these were of enough public interest they should be publicly-disclosed. Or it just may be the excuse she gave investigators during the interview.\n\nWhatever the case, one thing remains clear: the Trump Administration is definitely interested in punishing whistleblowers, self-described or otherwise. As Trevor Timm of the Freedom of the Press Foundation points out, this is the fifth time journalists' sources have been charged with felonies since Trump took office. If he keeps it up, Obama's record-setting persecution of whistleblowers will be viewed with fond remembrance usually reserved for misremembering America's halcyon days of segregation and post-war baby making.\n\nFiled Under: financial information, fincen, leaks, natalie edwards, reporters, sars, wiretap\n\nCompanies: buzzfeed"

    "text": "Senior FinCEN official arrested for leaking SAR data to news reporter about Trump advisers, Russia Friday, October 19, 2018 (0 Comments)\n\nPosted by: Brian Monroe\n\nShare | By Brian Monroe\n\nbmonroe@acfcs.org\n\nOctober 19, 2018 Federal authorities have arrested a senior U.S. Treasury department official for allegedly leaking thousands of confidential financial crime compliance program filings, including details about a high-profile investigation into potential ties between arch foe Russia and the president\u2019s election campaign. The official in question, Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards, is a senior adviser for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the country\u2019s financial intelligence unit, which holds untold millions of anti-money laundering (AML) filings sent by financial institutions in the form of suspicious activity reports (SARs) and currency transaction reports (CTRs). The FinCEN database is a treasure trove of information as it contains details on any transaction a bank, money services business, securities firm and other entity subject to formal AML rules felt rose to the level of \u201csuspicious\u201d and involved more than $5,000. Banks file CTRs any time a transaction involves more than $10,000. In an 18-page criminal complaint, authorities detail nearly a dozen stories published by news site, BuzzFeed, over the course of a year where Edwards served as a secret source, handing over specific details on individuals and related financial transactions, which potentially revealed monetary support for Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential campaign. The apparent goal was to uncover concrete financial linkages between these Russian activities and associates of President Donald Trump, including now convicted felon Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager, Paul Gates, the Russian embassy, and others. To read the press release, click here. To read the complaint, click here. Edwards allegedly \u201cbetrayed her position of trust by repeatedly disclosing highly sensitive information contained in\u201d SARs to an \u201cindividual not authorized to receive them,\u201d U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. \u201cSARs, which are filed confidentially by banks and other financial institutions to alert law enforcement to potentially illegal transactions, are not public documents, and it is an independent federal crime to disclose them outside of one\u2019s official duties,\u201d he said. Agents arrested Edwards in Virginia on Friday, charging her with one count of unauthorized disclosures of SARs and one count of conspiracy to make unauthorized disclosures of SAR. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine of $25,000. Federal agents Tuesday carried out court orders to search Edwards\u2019 phone and home. She made court appearances on Wednesday and was later released into the custody of her parents on a $100,000 personal recognizance bond. She didn\u2019t enter a plea but a formal indictment is expected in the coming weeks, according to media reports. Edwards alleged acts are laid out in the complaint crafted by FBI Special Agent Emily Eckstut. When first arrested, Edwards denied involvement with any leaks, but later stated they had to be done as she was a whistleblower. Multiple publications noted she had filed a formal whistleblower complaint and reached out to members of Congress. Several of the articles in recent weeks published in the Buzzfeed series were explosive, noting financial trails involving Russian tycoon Emin Agalarov, who is reportedly at the epicenter of a mid-2016 meet up between Russian minions and Trump campaign chiefs. What was said, who agreed to what and what was later carried out, including financial and other back-scratching, has been at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and been the subject of wide speculation by pundits aplenty. FinCEN leak an AML \u2018worse case scenario\u2019 But it was no surprise someone \u2013 in this case allegedly Edwards \u2013 made the connection that if there were incriminating details to be had in the Russia probe, they could be buried somewhere in the terabytes upon terabytes of data housed in FinCEN\u2019s AML database. FinCEN is the main repository for this information, which allows bureau analysts to engage in proactive investigations to uncover large-scale criminal trends, details then shared with banks and other government agencies with purview over crushing criminal and terror networks and defending the nation against foreign and domestic threats. Beyond FinCEN sharing the results of its own database analyses, all of the major U.S. federal investigative agencies, and many state and local police forces, have remote access to the FinCEN database directly to query for details to form the foundation of a case or attempt to break new ground in current investigations related to companies, individuals, regions and more. Moreover, while several government agents in recent years \u2013 typically those involved in national security \u2013 have been arrested and sentenced for improperly handling classified information, for a FinCEN analyst to be sanctioned for mining the database to allegedly get dirt on political foes, then steal the data itself, possibly targeting even the current U.S. president, is exceedingly rare. But for those in AML compliance and investigative circles, this situation \u2013 along with a few others \u2013 was always a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d waiting to happen. In conferences and conversations, whenever the subject of FinCEN, SARs and CTRs came up, one professional would invariably turn to another and say, \u201cWow, I wonder what would happen if some analyst or investigator had an agenda or ax to grind, and just decided to ping the database for themselves to find skeletons in the closet of a cross-party adversary, ex-boss or ex-wife.\u201d The response was always the same: whoever ever did something like that could, and likely would, find confidential information that could seriously tarnish the reputation of a captain of industry or political powerbroker \u2013 the information in the FinCEN database is that powerful. Beyond that, while a terrible breach of trust, the law and shaking of the confidential foundations the whole of the AML compliance world is built on, illicit use of the data by a jaded employee is actually one of the milder of the nightmare scenarios that could befall FinCEN and its coveted database. What\u2019s worse? Here are two other situations FinCEN is doing its best to guard against: what would happen if a criminal hacker, through stealing the login credentials of a database user or abusing a software vulnerability, gained access to the database and downloaded all or some of the information? They could then sell those details to the highest bidder among a cabal of illicit groups so that criminal groups could know what every bank has on them, and potentially every past or current government investigation \u2013 crippling who knows how many ongoing cases. But even as bad as that could be, there is one involving FinCEN that would likely be considered the most feared of all: what if a hacker gained access to the database itself and rather than trying to steal or download it, introduced a virus or other insidious piece of malware that destroyed some or all of the data altogether. Such move would broadly hamstring many domestic and international, complex financial crime cases, which rely on details in the FinCEN database to initiate and strengthen cases and pull together seemingly disparate sources of information to crack the diffuse, hidden trails of savvy organized criminal groups who are actively trying to mask their touchpoints with the formal financial system. SAR spigot turned on In the case of Edwards, she had very specific individuals and firms she was focusing on, allegedly working with an unnamed a co-conspirator at FinCEN, described as an associated director, in a bid to support the Buzzfeed reporter. While not named in the complaint, the journalist publicly tied to the articles listed in the complaint is widely known as Buzzfeed author Jason Leopold. The unnamed associate director also exchanged more than 300 messages with the reporter, according to the complaint, with investigators eventually securing court approval to tap the person\u2019s phone to monitor the messages and their contents. \u201cThe illegally disclosed SARs pertained to, among other things, Paul Manafort, Richard Gates, the Russian Embassy, Mariia Butina, and Prevezon Alexander,\u201d according to investigators. Edwards \u201chad access to each of the pertinent SARs and saved them \u2013 along with thousands of other files containing sensitive government information \u2013 to a flash drive provided to her by FinCEN,\u201d according to court documents. She transmitted the SARs to the reporter through phone photos and texts over an encrypted app, but that was not all. The complaint also notes Edwards also forwarded \u201cinternal FinCEN emails appearing to relate to SARs or other information protected by the [Bank Secrecy Act], and FinCEN non-public memoranda, including Investigative Memos and Intelligence Assessments published by the FinCEN Intelligence Division, which contained confidential personal, business, and/or security threat assessments.\u201d When she was arrested, authorities stated Edwards \u201cwas in possession of a flash drive appearing to be the flash drive on which she saved the unlawfully disclosed SARs, and a cellphone containing numerous communications over an encrypted application in which she transmitted SARs and other sensitive government information\u201d the reporter. Deputy AG evokes Spider-man to teach on breaches In a twist seemingly presaging the formal announcement of Edwards\u2019 arrest, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein stressed the importance of strong data security and confidentiality of AML documents in a speech in Washington, D.C. before federal watchdog groups. \u201cPreventing inappropriate disclosures of confidential information is one of the important issues I focused on during the past year,\u201d he told attendees Wednesday. \u201cDisclosing non-public, sensitive information you learn as a government employee may jeopardize an investigation or case; prejudice a defendant\u2019s rights; or unfairly damage a person\u2019s reputation.\u201d \u201cIt also can violate federal laws, employee non-disclosure agreements, and individual privacy rights,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some cases, it may put a witness or law enforcement officer in danger.\u201d He noted that whistleblowers are vital and there should be avenues to \u201ccome forward, but it is important to make clear that there are lawful ways to report wrongdoing, either to agency supervisors or to internal watchdogs, without making improper disclosures.\u201d Such leaks \u201cundermine public confidence and harm innocent people,\u201d he wrote, noting that working for the government and having access to such sensitive information incurs a certain duty to protect it with integrity. \u201cIn the courtyard of the Department of Justice headquarters, there is a Latin inscription that reads, \u2018Privilegium Obligatio. It means that when you accept a privilege, you incur an obligation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe point is made more precisely in a remark attributed to French Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire: \u2018With great power comes great responsibility.\u2019\u201d \u201cIf that quotation sounds familiar, it was also said by another well-known philosopher \u2014 Spider-Man\u2019s Uncle, Ben Parker,\u201d he said. \u201cYou hold a position of trust, and public respect for government depends in large part on whether or not you live up to that trust.\u201d"

    "text": "In this wide-ranging conversation with Jason Leopold, Truthout\u2019s lead investigative reporter, he talks about his upcoming trip to Guantanamo, the impact of the new pro-torture film Zero Dark 30, the scheduled sentencing of former CIA agent Kiriakou, and his fifth report on the reported suicide of Gitmo prisoner Adnan Latif. We start with Leopold\u2019s announcement that he\u2019s been approved to cover the trial of Khaled Sheikh Muhammed at Guantanamo Bay, and will travel there at the end of January. We talk about the sharp limitations on coverage and the rules of evidence that appear to preclude a fair trial.\n\nWe talk about the new film Zero Dark 30, and the way it cements the myths that torture is OK, and produces usable intelligence. It also burnishes the image of the CIA, despite the numerous known cases where it tortured innocent people and bungled investigations.\n\nNext, we discuss the recent plea deal taken by John Kiriakou, a CIA agent who helped capture Abu Zubaidah in 2002, who was mistakenly thought to be al Qaeda\u2019s #3 leader. Kiriakou, who was misled to believe that Zubaidah cracked during his first waterboarding, did not participate in torture sessions, but went public in 2007. Leopold interviewed him in a 2010 video report, and asked Kiriakou about Deuce Martinez, whose name surfaced in the later investigation. We talk about NY Times reporter Scott Shane\u2019s remarkable January 6 report, which revealed Shane\u2019s contacts with Kiriakou that drew Shane into the investigation, related to Martinez. Ultimately, Kiriakou pled guilty to revealing a different agent\u2019s name to a reporter, who did not even publish it. So far, Kiriakou is the only person going to jail related to Bush\u2019s torture program.\n\nFinally, we talk about Leopold\u2019s dogged efforts to get to the truth in the case of Yemeni Adnan Latif, who was reported a suicide on September 8, 2012 at Guantanamo. We recap how Latif was not a terrorist, was approved for release by both Bush and Obama officials, and the contradictions in the initial death reports and his autopsy.\n\nCorrection: In our interview, PBC states that the corporate media has barely covered the Latif story. One exception is a recent \u201cOp-Doc\u201d posted on the NY Times website, a 9-minute video that shows the return of Latif\u2019s remains to his family last December. Credit is due to the producer, Laura Poitras. The video is embedded in Leopold\u2019s report."

    "text": "We wonder if the folks over at Truthout.org are rethinking their affiliation with reporter and serial fabulist Jason Leopold. Leopold, you may recall, is the freelance reporter who was caught making stuff up in a 2002 Salon.com article, self-admittedly \u201cgetting it completely wrong\u201d in pieces for Dow Jones, and had his own memoir cancelled because of concerns over the accuracy of quotations.\n\n\n\nLeopold\u2019s latest addition to his application for membership in the Stephen Glass school of journalism came on May 12 of this year, when he got what appeared to be the scoop of a lifetime. Now writing for Truthout.org, Leopold reported that Karl Rove \u201ctold President Bush and Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten, as well as a few other high level administration officials,\u201d that he was about to be indicted in the Valerie Plame CIA leak case, \u201caccording to people knowledgeable about these discussions.\u201d\n\n\n\nLeopold claimed that multiple sources \u201cconfirmed Rove\u2019s indictment is imminent. These individuals requested anonymity saying they were not authorized to speak publicly about Rove\u2019s situation.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, today we learned that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said he would not seek charges against Rove.\n\n\n\nOops.\n\n\n\nTruthout\u2019s executive director Marc Ash originally stood by Leopold\u2019s story \u2014 even as no other news organization could confirm it, and Rove\u2019s attorney vociferously denied it. On May 18, Ash wrote that the site had \u201cadditional, independent sources,\u201d and that \u201cadditional sources have now come forward and offered corroboration to us.\u201d But just a day later, Ash issued an odd \u201cpartial apology\u201d for \u201cgetting too far out in front of the news-cycle,\u201d on the story \u2014 a note which smelled a bit like a preemptive backtrack.\n\n\n\nBut Ash again changed course on May 25, when he wrote for Truthout that he now had \u201cthree independent sources confirming that attorneys for Karl Rove were handed an indictment either late in the night of May 12 or early in the morning of May 13. We know that each source was in a position to know what they were talking about.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter all this certainty comes Ash\u2019s latest version of the story, published yesterday, where he writes that Truthout based its original article \u201con single source information and general background information obtained from experts. The conclusions we arrive at should be considered carefully, but not taken as statements of fact, per se.\u201d Ash makes no mention of those \u201cthree independent sources\u201d who were \u201cin a position to know\u201d that he trumpeted less than three weeks ago.\n\n\n\nNow that we finally have a look at what Leopold and Ash have been working from, it looks pretty thin. Ash says that he knows \u201cfor certain\u201d that there exists a federal indictment called \u201c06 cr 128\u201d which he refers to as \u201c(Sealed vs. Sealed)\u201d since neither party\u2019s name is on the document. He also knows that this indictment \u201cwas returned by the same grand jury that has been hearing matters related to the Fitzgerald/Plame investigation.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo much for what Ash knows. Apparently, Ash is a very religious man, because he \u201cbelieves\u201d quite a bit about the alleged indictment. He believes that it \u201cis directly related to the Fitzgerald/Plame investigation. That\u2019s based on a single credible source.\u201d He goes on to list several other things he \u201cbelieves\u201d to be true, all fed to him by, in his words, the \u201csame single credible source.\u201d (Once again, Ash\u2019s \u201cthree independent sources\u201d are nowhere to be found.)\n\n\n\nAs for what you should believe about Leopold\u2019s story, it\u2019s worth looking at his background in more detail.\n\n\n\nWhen Leopold\u2019s story was first called into question a few weeks ago, Salon\u2019s Tim Grieve reminded readers of Leopold\u2019s checkered history with the publication. Salon removed Leopold\u2019s August 29, 2002 story about Enron from its site after it was discovered that he plagiarized parts from the Financial Times and was unable to provide a copy of an email that was critical to the piece. Leopold\u2019s response? A hysterical rant (linked above) which claimed that Salon\u2019s version of events was \u201cnothing but lies,\u201d and that \u201cAt this point, I wonder why Salon would go to great lengths to further twist the knife into my back. I suppose the New York Times will now release their version of the events. I can see the headline now \u2018Jason Leopold Must Die.\u2019\u201d In other words, people are out to get him, and it\u2019s not his fault.\n\n\n\nFast forward to March 2005, when Leopold\u2019s memoir, Off the Record, was set to be released. In the book, according to Howard Kurtz, Leopold says that he details his own \u201clying, cheating and backstabbing,\u201d and comes clean about how he got fired from the Los Angeles Times and quit Dow Jones just before they fired him because, as he said, it \u201cSeems I got all of the facts wrong\u201d on a story about Enron.\n\n\n\nBut the book was not to be. Rowman & Littlefield, the book\u2019s publisher, cancelled production just before it went to press after one of the book\u2019s sources threatened to sue. That source, Steven Maviglio, who was a spokesman for California Governor Gray Davis, said that Leopold \u201cjust got it completely wrong\u201d when recounting how he allegedly told Leopold that he \u201cmight have broken the law by investing in energy companies using inside information.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrue to form, Leopold blamed his publisher for the controversy, claiming the allegations about Maviglio were not in his book, and, as Kurtz summarized it, \u201cthe company\u2019s publicist took that and other material from his book proposal, not the finished manuscript.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf there is one common theme that emerges from all of Leopold\u2019s journalistic snafus, it\u2019s that none of it seems to be his fault. We probably won\u2019t have to wait long before we hear the same tired refrain from him about the Rove story.\n\n\n\nBut we wonder when editors will finally figure out his game, save themselves the trouble, and just stop publishing him.\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Initially this post mistakenly attributed certain statements made by Mark Ash, Jason Leopold\u2019s editor, to Leopold himself. The attribution has since been corrected.\n\nHas America ever needed a media watchdog more than now? Help us by joining CJR today\n\nPaul McLeary is senior editor of Defense Technology International magazine, and is a former CJR staffer."

    "text": "The money wound up at Russian embassies in almost 60 countries from Afghanistan to Nigeria between Aug. 3 and Sept. 20, 2016. It is not clear how the funds were used. At least one transaction that came into the US originated with VTB Bank, a financial institution that is majority-owned by the Kremlin.\n\nThat wire transfer is one of more than 60 now being scrutinized by the FBI and other federal agencies investigating Russian involvement in the US election. The transactions, which moved through Citibank accounts and totaled more than $380,000, each came from the Russian Foreign Ministry and most contained a memo line referencing the financing of the 2016 election.\n\nOn Aug. 3 of last year, just as the US presidential election was entering its final, heated phase, the Russian Foreign Ministry sent nearly $30,000 to its embassy in Washington. The wire transfer, which came from a Kremlin-backed Russian bank, landed in one of the embassy\u2019s Citibank accounts and contained a remarkable memo line: \u201cto finance election campaign of 2016.\u201d\n\nGot a tip? You can email tips@buzzfeed.com. To learn how to reach us securely, go to tips.buzzfeed.com\n\nBefore publication of this article, BuzzFeed News sought comment from both the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian embassy in Washington. Neither responded. Hours after the story was published, both entities issued statements on social media denouncing the story. The Foreign Ministry noted that it had previously announced that it would have 364 polling stations in 145 countries in order for Russians living overseas to cast ballots in a parliamentary election held Sept. 18.\n\nThe Russian embassy added, \"this attempt to artificially draw Russia and the Embassy to the internal US disagreements has failed in the most shameful manner.\"\n\nThe US Treasury Department placed VTB Bank under sanctions in 2014, following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. The sanctions prohibit VTB Bank from raising capital or accepting loans from American individuals or companies. A wire transfer to the embassy\u2019s US bank account is permitted, however, and Citibank has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nIn a statement, Citibank spokesperson Jennifer Lowney wrote that the financial institution is \"diligent\" in reporting suspicious transfers but that \"given the confidential nature of these reports, we do not comment on or confirm any particular report or transaction.\"\n\nAfter discovering the $30,000 transfer to the embassy in Washington, Citibank launched a review of other transfers by the Russian Foreign Ministry. It unearthed dozens of other transactions with similar memo lines. Compliance officers in Citibank\u2019s Global Intelligence Unit flagged them as suspicious, noting that it was unable to determine the financial, business, or legal purpose of the transactions.\n\n\n\nMuch as checks include a memo line, wire transfers often include a note that states what the money is for. The note on this set of transfers did not indicate what election the money was to be used for, or even the country. Seven nations had federal elections during the span when the funds were sent \u2014 including the Duma, Russia\u2019s lower house of Parliament.\n\nThe FBI was first made aware of the suspicious transactions two months ago. Two FBI sources said that FBI legal attaches in other countries are now investigating whether the money may have been used for the US presidential election and, if so, how.\n\nA VTB spokesperson said in a statement: \"VTB strictly conducts its operations in full compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The U.S. banks also monitor and abide by all the restrictions imposed by the (Office of Foreign Assets Control).\"\n\nThis past January, the United States\u2019 Office of Director of National Intelligence, in a \u201chigh-confidence\u201d assessment, concluded that Vladimir Putin personally signed off on an influence campaign to help Donald Trump win the presidency. Now, the FBI, a special counsel, and three congressional committees are conducting investigations. The committees have formally requested a wide range of banking and financial records on numerous individuals and businesses with ties to Russia from the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN for short.\n\nSpecifically, the Senate Intelligence Committee committee asked FinCEN for \u201cany actions\u201d the agency took to support law enforcement or intelligence inquiries about these individuals and businesses, any documents it sent to the FBI, and any requests for information it sent to banks. A separate letter sent to the Treasury Department by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations sought information on the sanctioned bank.\n\nThese requests led to the discovery of the wire transfers. Two congressional sources said the Senate Intelligence Committee is unaware of the transactions. Spokespeople for the committees would not comment.\n\nAll financial institutions are required to tell FinCEN about any transactions they deem suspicious. Such \u201csuspicious activity reports\u201d do not necessarily prove or even indicate wrongdoing. Federal law also requires financial institutions to file reports on any cash transactions of more than $10,000 in a single day, even if those transactions are legitimate. Banks must also file the reports whenever they suspect money laundering or other financial crimes.\n\nFollowing the congressional requests, Citibank turned over a range of financial documents. The material includes more than 650 suspicious transactions between November 2013 and March 2017 totaling about $2.9 million. That money was sent to four Russian accounts operating in the US: the embassy; the Office of Defense, Military, Air and Naval Attaches; and Russian cultural centers in Washington and New York City.\n\nMost of these wire transfers were not related to the election, sources say, but are the subject of FBI scrutiny for their possible ties to Russian corruption and money laundering.\n\nThe FBI and congressional investigators are now inspecting each of those transactions.\n\nOne FBI special agent said the transfers are critical for the bureau and lawmakers investigating Russia\u2019s interference in last year\u2019s presidential election. He said even if there is a logical explanation for the suspicious wire transactions the FBI has to investigate what the money was used for.\n\n\u201cWe had an election and the intelligence community concluded Russia interfered in it,\u201d said the FBI agent. \u201cHow could we not investigate a suspicious financial transaction that contained a memo that said, \u2018finance election campaign 2016?\u2019 Given the climate and what was in that memo line it would be very irresponsible for us not to investigate. It\u2019s a good lead.\u201d"

    "text": "New York (CNN Business) Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier, two reporters for BuzzFeed News, may have just scored the scoop that, if it is ultimately confirmed, irrevocably changes the course of the Trump presidency. If so, it will represent for Leopold the apex of a comeback from a troubled personal and professional past.\n\nOn Thursday evening, the duo published a bombshell : A report that President Donald Trump personally directed Michael Cohen, his former attorney, to lie to Congress about the Moscow Trump Tower project.\n\nIf the story is accurate, it means Trump asked Cohen to commit perjury, a federal crime and potentially impeachable offense. The story has not yet been corroborated by CNN or any other news outlet. A spokesman for special counsel Robert Mueller's office disputed parts of BuzzFeed News' report.\n\n\"BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate,\" Peter Carr said in a statement on Friday evening.\n\nIn response, BuzzFeed said, \"We are continuing to report and determine what the special counsel is disputing. We remain confident in the accuracy of our report.\"\n\nThere are six distinct areas where reporting from the bombshell lines up with court records, including the charging documents against Cohen, sentencing memos, and hearings.\n\nSince it was published, the story has dominated cable news and caught the eye of Congressional Democrats. In a tweet , House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said his committee would \"get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nLeopold and Cormier have broken a number of major stories on Trump Tower and Russia that have proven true. But the intense attention to their latest scoop has also resurfaced Leopold's checkered past.\n\nBuzzFeed News reporter Jason Leopold in 2016.\n\nLeopold, a former Los Angeles Times, Dow Jones, and Vice News reporter who has been at BuzzFeed since 2017, was involved in several major scandals that called into question the veracity of his reporting during George W. Bush's presidency.\n\nIn 2002, Salon.com removed a story Leopold had written as a freelancer for the site. Salon said that as it investigated a piece he wrote about Enron, including an allegation of plagiarism against him, Leopold \"distributed an account of events\" that was \"riddled with inaccuracies and misrepresentations.\" Ultimately Salon said it \"reluctantly had to conclude\" Leopold's piece carried \"an instance of plagiarism,\" despite his strong denials.\n\nAfter the scandal, Leopold wrote a book in which he said he had engaged in \"lying, cheating, and backstabbing\" in his life; battled mental illness; and struggled with substance abuse.\n\n\"I have a checkered past, and I was hoping that by coming clean about my own past, it would allow me to move forward,\" Leopold wrote, according to a 2005 article in The Washington Post\n\nBut in 2006, Leopold found himself again in controversy . He reported for Truthout.org that then-top White House aide Karl Rove had told then-President Bush and other administration officials that he was going to be indicted in relation to the Valerie Plame affair. Leopold cited \"people knowledgeable about these discussions\" and reported Rove's \"indictment is imminent.\" But Rove never faced any charges.\n\nA 2015 profile of Leopold in The New York Times noted that he has \"been through a series of scandals.\" But the Times also noted Leopold was able to make a comeback by breaking stories uncovered through the submission of Freedom of Information Act requests. He earned the nickname, featured in his Twitter profile, of the \"FOIA terrorist.\"\n\n\"I love the score,\" he told the Times \"So maybe there's this drug-ish thing in me that still exists, maybe that was always part of my personality. I love the score. I love the score! Particularly when it is from the government! I just got you to give me your own documents, you know!\"\n\nLeopold joined Vice News in 2014 and in 2017 was hired by BuzzFeed News where he and Cormier have led reporting on the Trump Tower Moscow project.\n\nIn 2018, Leopold was a finalist for a 2018 Pulitzer Prize in International Reporting for a story the committee described as a \"stunning probe across two continents that proved that operatives with apparent ties to Vladimir Putin have engaged in a targeted killing campaign against his perceived enemies on British and American soil.\"\n\nIn April, Leopold and Cormier reported that a former Russian spy had assisted Trump's business team in working on a potential deal to build a tower in Moscow, citing two sources familiar with the matter, despite Trump saying during the 2016 campaign that he had no business with Russia.\n\nIn May, Leopold and Cormier published what they called the \" definitive story \" on the Trump Tower Moscow project.\n\nAnd then, in November, Leopold and Cormier broke news that the Trump Organization had planned to give Russian President Vladimir Putin a $50 million penthouse in the proposed tower. Asked about the idea of giving Putin the penthouse in the potential tower, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani initially said Trump \"never heard of this\" and that \"the concept never got anywhere beyond an unfunded letter of intent and never even a proposal or draft contract.\" CNN later obtained a document showing Trump had, in fact, signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations, despite Giuliani's claim.\n\nThose stories ultimately led to Thursday's bombshell.\n\nTalking by phone Friday morning on \"New Day,\" Cormier was asked about Leopold's past. Cormier said his story was \"100%\" solid and that his sourcing \"goes beyond\" the two law enforcement sources in BuzzFeed News' story.\n\n\"I am the individual who confirmed and verified that,\" Cormier said, adding that he and Leopold were \"able to gather information from individuals who know this happened.\"\n\nReached for comment on Friday, Leopold referred questions to BuzzFeed News spokesperson Matt Mittenthal.\n\nIn a statement, Mittenthal vigorously stood by BuzzFeed News' story and denounced online criticism that Leopold faced on Friday, much of which came from Trump supporters using his past to discredit Thursday's report.\n\n\"Jason is one of the best journalists in the world, and he has proven it, with reporting that's been months ahead of developments in the Mueller investigation,\" Mittenthal said. \"His and Anthony's work has been proven to be true at every turn -- and it's interesting that these personal attacks are surfacing only now, as the facts become more dangerous for the individuals involved. BuzzFeed News stands by this story 100%.\"\n\nIn a statement released after this story initially published, Giuliani said, \"Any suggestion -- from any source -- that the President counseled Michael Cohen to lie is categorically false. Michael Cohen is a convicted criminal and a liar. To quote the prosecutors, he has traded on 'a pattern of lies and dishonesty over an extended period of time' and for that 'he is going to pay a very, very serious price.'\n\n\"Today's claims are just more made-up lies born of Michael Cohen's malice and desperation, in an effort to reduce his sentence.\""

    "text": "Mensch works at News Corp by day and investigates Trump and Moscow by night. Here\u2019s how she learned the secret that eluded even the best journalists\n\nIn the journalistic race to get to the bottom of one of the most closely guarded secrets in Washington \u2013 the investigation into the Trump team\u2019s contacts with Moscow \u2013 one of the biggest scoops came from an unexpected source: the British former MP and novelist Louise Mensch.\n\n\n\nMensch has lived in New York since resigning as the Conservative MP for Corby in 2012 so that she could spend more time with her children and her American husband, Peter, the manager of the heavy metal band Metallica.\n\nNow 45, the woman born Louise Bagshawe in London who once dominated the chick-lit bestseller lists in the UK has reinvented herself once more: working as an executive for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp by day, and probing Donald Trump\u2019s Moscow connections by night.\n\nDeutsche Bank examined Trump's account for Russia links Read more\n\nOn the eve of the November election, Mensch published a sensational story reporting that a special intelligence court in Washington had granted a warrant to allow the FBI to conduct surveillance of \u201cUS persons\u201d in an investigation of possible contacts between Russian banks and the Trump organisation.\n\n\n\nAt the time, the story did not cause much of a ripple. It was published on Heat Street, a libertarian-leaning website run by News Corp, and an unknown quantity in journalism. So was Mensch, whose recent public profile consisted mainly of a string of angry Twitter spats.\n\nMeanwhile, the combined investigative forces of the US media had spent months seeking to prove a secret connection between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin and had come up with very little.\n\nThe online magazine Slate had published an article at the end of October about mysterious pings that had been detected between a Russian bank, Alfa, and a server connected to the Trump organisation, but the New York Times quoted FBI officials as saying they had looked into it and decided there \u201cthere could be an innocuous explanation\u201d for the computer contacts.\n\nFlynn's resignation likely the beginning of Trump's Russia woes \u2013 not the end | Julian Borger Read more\n\nTwo months later, however, the BBC put out a story echoing Mensch\u2019s original report about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) court warrant issued in October to allow the justice department to look into transfers and communications between the Russian banks and Trump associate \u2013 and that US intelligence agencies were investigating the link.\n\nThe Guardian separately confirmed the original request for a Fisa warrant, which had been turned down earlier in the summer, and former officials said they believed that the Mensch and BBC account of the Fisa warrants was correct.\n\nIn mid-January, the McClatchy news agency said one of its sources had also confirmed the report, and the New York Times\u2019 public editor, Liz Spayd, published an assessment of its coverage of the Trump-Moscow link on 20 January, arguing that it had been \u201ctoo timid\u201d. The Times, Spayd argued, \u201cknew several critical facts: the FBI had a sophisticated investigation under way on Trump\u2019s organization, possibly including Fisa warrants\u201d.\n\nThe full facts about the connections between the Trump camp and the Kremlin are not yet known. Trump now has authority over all the intelligence agencies that were investigating the Russian connection. Investigations have been officially launched in the Senate, but there too, Republicans are in command, and only a handful of senators seem ready to break party ranks to inquire further.\n\nHowever, it seems increasingly clear that Mensch landed an extraordinary scoop that had eluded the best investigative journalists in the US. Her explanation is that her vocal advocacy on behalf of UK and US intelligence agencies since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about mass surveillance led her sources to trust her.\n\n\u201cThey gave me one of the most closely guarded secrets in intelligence,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cPeople are speculating why someone trusted me with that. Nobody met me in a darkened alley in a fedora, but they saw me as someone who has political experience and is their friend. I am a pro-national security partisan. I don\u2019t have divided loyalties.\u201d\n\nMensch said she gained her reputation among intelligence professionals on both sides of the Atlantic as a result of her furious criticism of the Guardian\u2019s handling of the NSA files leaked by Snowden when he walked out of his NSA job in Hawaii and fled to Hong Kong.\n\nThe files included large amounts of information about the UK electronic surveillance agency, GCHQ, and Mensch argued that moving the files around the world constituted trafficking in stolen state secrets that put the lives of British intelligence officials at risk.\n\nThe Guardian has maintained that the revelation of the extent of mass surveillance in the UK and the US was in the public interest, that the data was shared responsibly and securely among journalists, and that nothing was put in the public domain that would be a threat to the lives of GCHQ workers.\n\nMensch presented herself as an advocate for intelligence professionals, who were unable to defend themselves because of the secret nature of their work. She frequently uses the hashtag #TeamBond. \u201cI am a patriot in the service of the intelligence community,\u201d she said.\n\nA few weeks after her Fisa scoop, Mensch was moved from her job running Heat Street, but she said she had asked for the job as she was keen to develop new digital projects for News Corp.\n\nMensch continues to investigate the Trump administration\u2019s links with the Russian government, but now in her own time, publishing her theories in tweets and a blog. She has lately been tracking the flights of private planes linked to Russian oligarchs and Trump associates. She insisted that she had not come under any pressure to stop from Murdoch or senior management of the largely pro-Trump News Corp. She says she prefers the free hand self-publishing provides.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be subject to an editing process,\u201dshe said. \u201cEditors would ask: who are your sources? And I can\u2019t tell them.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn her tweets Mensch is unsparing when it comes to making allegations, and she has repeatedly denounced some figures in the Trump circle as traitors. She insists she has no fear of being sued for libel. \u201cI\u2019ve never been sued because I\u2019ve never been wrong,\u201d she said."

    "text": "Reminiscent of Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeplorable\u201d comments when she referred to supporters of then candidate Donald Trump, MSNBC analyst Malcolm Nance \u2014 and self-appointed counter-terrorism, cryptology, intelligence, interrogation and linguistics expert \u2014 has stated that all military persons that support the President are \u201cnot honorable.\u201d\n\nAs a retired Senior Chief (E-8), Airborne Mission Supervisor, cryptologist (Arabic) and SPECWAR operative I have given (as most of the naval cryptologic community has) retired Senior Chief Malcolm Nance a wide berth. Bottom line: he left the Naval Security Group in disgrace and we (our professional communities and associations) generally have a good laugh at his self-promotion, exaggeration of performance and associations, and his pretense of expertise.\n\nThe proverbial \u201ceye roll\u201d precedes any response we give when asked about his exploits. He has been declared persona non grata (PNG) from his profession, and then presumes to question service members\u2019 honor based on a vote and lawful support for a candidate (now President). Nance, in fact, called for ISIS to bomb Trump Towers in Istanbul following President Trump\u2019s call to Turkish President Erdogan after his reelection; Nance deleted that tweet but did not apologize, according to the Washington Times.\n\nMy first experience with then-Chief (E-7) Nance came soon after Desert Storm. If memory serves, it was late 1992 or 1993 and I was on the mid-watch at the Naval Reconnaissance Support Activity (NRSA) in Rota, Spain. I received a phone call early in the morning \u2014 it was my Commanding Officer (CO). Having recently been meritoriously promoted via the Command Advancement Program (CAP) to Petty Officer Second Class (E-5) from our Det Jeddah EA-3B missions during that original Gulf war, I nearly spilled my coffee thinking that my CO had changed his mind. Then he said distinctly (imagine the caller in his best southern Georgia draw):\n\n\u201cPetty Office Morlock, do you recognize my voice?\u201d\n\nI replied in the affirmative.\n\n\u201cOpen up the log book and write this down verbatim,\u201d he said. \u201cChief Petty Officer Malcolm Nance is persona non grata in our spaces. You may remove him by force\u2026 now read that back to me.\u201d After complying, my CO said good night. I did not know, nor had I heard of Malcolm Nance, but was bitterly disappointed that I did not see a uniform with that name tag on it during my watch.\n\nNRSA was absorbed into the Naval Security Group Activity (NSGA) in Rota as the Air shop. As detachments/deployments would begin to increase in support of the Bosnia and Herzegovina, there was little mention of Chief Nance. The last scuttlebutt I heard was that he was soon fired as Chief of the NSGA sub shop for poor performance. Though I did not try to access his FITREPS for this article, one major issue that his junior sailors had when asked by Nance\u2019s superiors was his propensity to submit himself for personal awards and exaggerate his accomplishments while ignoring his juniors. An interesting consistency. At this point, I had no reason or inclination to concern myself with Nance.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nFollowing my 3-year tour at NSA/CSS Fort Meade as Deputy Branch Chief (as a newly frocked Petty Officer First Class), I was back at the Defense Language Institute Monterey (1997-1998) to study Intermediate Arabic and began to lobby and train for the soon-to-be-realized Tactical Cryptology to Special Warfare billets when deja vu struck. A note on the Leading Petty Officer (LPO) board directed me to the Detachment OIC office. The LCDR asked me if I knew of a Chief Malcolm Nance. Without going into specifics, I replied that I had heard of him by reputation.\n\nI was then advised that Nance was going to San Diego in a Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE) instructor billet; since he was PNG from the Cryptology community, that was practically the only spot the Detailer could get him for his last duty station. Simply put, no one wanted him. The OIC advised me that Nance may drop by the base (DLI was an open base prior to 9/11) to speak with some of the students in the Middle Eastern schools. I was directed not to allow him to contact any of the students and requested to recruit a few SEALs to ensure that he would make no contact with junior ranking personnel. I followed that direction; there was no issue. At this point, I still had not met this person, yet felt badly that someone who had made the rank of Chief had lost the respect of professionals in his rate and rating (rank and job).\n\nMy first direct contact was in Bahrain, post-9/11 and well into my hybrid cryptology/SPECWAR transition. Nance was at the arrival air terminal and the Master Chief I was with saw him, pointed him out and said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to him, he\u2019s got nothing worth listening to.\u201d Nance came over to my MC; neither offered their hands. Then Nance said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone that I\u2019m here.\u201d My MC didn\u2019t reply, just said to me that he would be surprised if anyone cared. I agreed and couldn\u2019t care less at the time; it was my first exercise with DEVGRU and that was my focus.\n\nNow we are at his \u201cnot honorable\u201d comment. Ironically it was noticed that Nance was wearing a Combat Action Ribbon (CAR) on his lapel. In full disclosure, yes, the authorization to wear the ribbon was placed into his service record after he left NSGA Rota, yet as a matter of honor; he had failed to be honest and explain that he was never in combat. The Fleet Navy has its own standard for that award. In Nance\u2019s case he was either on or near a ship that fired missiles, or was close to a SCUD splash down. When this happens, the award goes to all members of the ship(s). As a matter of honor, his personal awards do not show direct action, or even influence in these matters. Certainly, no valor or Combat \u201cV\u201d to be noted.\n\nNance\u2019s biography notes his proximity to actions in Beirut, Ground Zero on 9/11, and others. The word that stands out is \u201cperipherally\u201d \u2014 likely the most accurate word to describe his service. Technically, he was a SERE instructor, yet as a matter of honor, Nance did not train Aviators or Special Operators directly as he did not attend the school simply due to the fact that his \u201cexpertise\u201d of counter-terrorism, intelligence officer and interrogator, did not place him near or behind enemy lines.\n\nAs a matter of honor, I understand that there are times when a resume is slightly exaggerated, yet this attack on our beliefs and lawful conduct displays the psyche of a man who recognizes his failures and must criticize all others in order to bolster his self-worth. I came to that conclusion without pretending to be an intelligence officer.\n\nAs a matter of honor, Nance does not recognize that \u201cexpertise\u201d on his resume/biography does not come from self-acclimation or promotion. It comes from the effort and teaching skills of the Chiefs\u2019 Mess, mission supervisors, civilian specialists, colleagues and shipmates \u2014 we relied on each other daily and in many cases, we still do. Equally, if not more important is passing along experiences, knowledge and recognition to ensure the next group of men and women are better than we imagined ourselves to be.\n\nFeatured image: Malcolm Nance attends Politicon at The Pasadena Convention Center on Sunday, Aug. 30, 2017, in Pasadena, Calif. | Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Invision/AP"

    "text": "Julian Assange\u2019s legal defense team has questioned the testimony of Russiagate conspiracy theorist, Louise Mensch, recalling her confession of taking \u201chard drugs\u201d in the past that could apparently affect her accusations.\n\nMonday\u2019s tweet from the team defending Julian Assange slammed former UK conservative MP turned conspiracy theorist Louise Mensch. The attached article is apparently aimed to remind followers of what exactly the Wikileaks legal team thinks of the woman, who\u2019s been smearing Assange for years.\n\nWhen you see conspiracy theories about Assange this is often who originated them. Yes, really. https://t.co/kLLU4QicJq \u2014 Assange Defence (@AssangeDefence) January 14, 2019\n\nThe article is an Evening Standard story from 2012 which details Mensch\u2019s admission that she had taken \u201cclass A\u201d drugs in her 20s while working in the music industry which \u201cmessed with [her] head.\u201d The defense campaign has previously fact-checked Mensch\u2019s \u201cinsane\u201d claims against Assange, many of which were shown to be patently false.\n\nOn Louise Mensch's latest insanity https://t.co/plUD9toouK\n\n1. It's entirely false\n\n2. WikiLeaks submissions don't even use SSL, but Tor & PGP \u2014 Assange Defence (@AssangeDefence) April 30, 2017\n\nAside from regularly engaging in openly Russophobic stereotypes, Mensch has also been making a steady stream of accusations against figures and movements for having \u201cKremlin connections\u201d for nearly a decade. Aside from Assange and Trump, Mensch has also claimed that movements as diverse as the Bernie Sanders campaign, #MeToo and Black Lives Matter are all Russian assets or plots.\n\n'Donald do nyeot vorry, have nice drink Dyeyet Coke and relax in special designed bath near large open vindow. Taste? That is Russian spyeshal vitamin, very good for hair growth and impress girls of low social responsibility. Da, da, that is it. Ping you later my vriend' https://t.co/JwHyD7BIEt \u2014 Louise Bagshawe (@LouiseBagshawe) January 13, 2019\n\nLast month, Mensch made the accusation that Edward Snowden had released his secret US military documents \u201cunder Putin\u2019s direct orders,\u201d unceremoniously tweeting about the possibility of his being executed\u2026 and this is not the first time she has talked about the death penalty for figures she believes to be involved in collusion with Russia.\n\nOh no, @snowden would be executed, of that I have no doubt, were he to be tried here. He committed espionage of military secrets under Putin\u2019s direct orders. \u2014 Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) December 17, 2018\n\nMy sources say the death penalty, for espionage, being considered for @StevenKBannon. I am pro-life and take no pleasure in reporting this. \u2014 Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) July 19, 2017\n\nWikileaks responded to the accusations against Snowden with threats of potential legal action for her \u201cserial fabrications.\u201d\n\n@snowden do you want us to sue this serial fabricator? \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) December 17, 2018\n\nIn Assange\u2019s case, Mensch\u2019s accusations often move between the conspiratorial and the strangely personal. Responding to Wikileaks message to the media last week reminding them to avoid certain inflammatory and unproven accusations, Mensch published a series of tweets intended to directly defy the request and personally insult Assange.\n\nSo @Wikileaks emailed journalists a list of 140 defamatory things not to say about Julian #Assange. I\u2019ll go first. Thread :)\n\n\n\n1.Assange has poor personal hygiene. He stinks, he doesn\u2019t flush the loo, his breath reeks, he walks about with dirty bare feet. https://t.co/l3Ex3WRPiV \u2014 Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) January 7, 2019\n\n7. Assange doesn\u2019t dye his hair and can\u2019t hack but he is a pathetic narcissist, despite being skinny and weak from his laziness.

    ],
    "text": "F.B.I. officials declined to comment on Monday. Intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation into possible links between the Russian government and the Republican presidential candidate. Still, they have said that Mr. Trump himself has not become a target. And no evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia\u2019s election operations.\n\nAt least one part of the investigation has involved Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for much of the year. Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican political strategist, has had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, where he served as an adviser to that country\u2019s ousted president, Viktor F. Yanukovych.\n\nBut the focus in that case was on Mr. Manafort\u2019s ties with a kleptocratic government in Ukraine \u2014 and whether he had declared the income in the United States \u2014 and not necessarily on any Russian influence over Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, one official said.\n\nIn classified sessions in August and September, intelligence officials also briefed congressional leaders on the possibility of financial ties between Russians and people connected to Mr. Trump. They focused particular attention on what cyberexperts said appeared to be a mysterious computer back channel between the Trump Organization and the Alfa Bank, which is one of Russia\u2019s biggest banks and whose owners have longstanding ties to Mr. Putin.\n\nF.B.I. officials spent weeks examining computer data showing an odd stream of activity to a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank. Computer logs obtained by The New York Times show that two servers at Alfa Bank sent more than 2,700 \u201clook-up\u201d messages \u2014 a first step for one system\u2019s computers to talk to another \u2014 to a Trump-connected server beginning in the spring. But the F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.\n\nThe most serious part of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation has focused on the computer hacks that the Obama administration now formally blames on Russia. That investigation also involves numerous officials from the intelligence agencies. Investigators, the officials said, have become increasingly confident, based on the evidence they have uncovered, that Russia\u2019s direct goal is not to support the election of Mr. Trump, as many Democrats have asserted, but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America\u2019s standing in the world more broadly.\n\nThe hacking, they said, reflected an intensification of spy-versus-spy operations that never entirely abated after the Cold War but that have become more aggressive in recent years as relations with Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia have soured."

    "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 9, 2019, 11:06 PM GMT By Heidi Przybyla\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has agreed to deliver a classified briefing to U.S. House lawmakers on Thursday on his recent decision to lift sanctions on companies linked to a Russian oligarch and Vladimir Putin ally, marking the start of an aggressive new focus on Mnuchin by newly empowered House Democrats, according to two top Democratic aides.\n\nMnuchin, who served as the Trump campaign's national finance chairman in 2016 before being confirmed to President Donald Trump's cabinet, has largely escaped investigative scrutiny.\n\nBut because of his role in the campaign \u2014 and, most recently, the Dec. 19 announcement easing sanctions on companies aligned with Oleg Deripaska, the Putin ally with ties to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort \u2014 House Democrats believe Mnuchin should be a focus of and source of information for several planned investigations both related and unrelated to the Russia probe, according to the aides. These include examinations of Trump's finances and the business practices of the Trump Organization.\n\nThe Thursday briefing comes in response to a letter sent Tuesday to Mnuchin by the new chairpersons of the seven major House investigative committees, asking him to provide answers on the Treasury Department's decision to lift the sanctions, which was announced as lawmakers left town for the holidays.\n\nThe Treasury Department said it would lift sanctions on companies linked to Deripaska \u2014 triggering a statue that gives Congress just 30 days to try to reverse the decision by passing a joint resolution of disapproval. On Friday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., filed such a motion, but it's unlikely to succeed in the Republican-run Senate.\n\nRussian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin speaks with Oleg Deripaska at an investment forum in Sochi in 2008. Ilia Pitalev / AFP-Getty Images file\n\nIn their letter, the investigative committee heads asked Mnuchin to meet with lawmakers \"in an appropriate setting.\" It was one of the first coordinated requests from the committees since the Democrats took control of the House last week.\n\nAmong the questions Democrats are likely to ask Mnuchin at the briefing, according to aides: How much influence did the White House, and Trump personally, exert in Mnuchin's decision to lift sanctions?\n\nDeripaska, one of Russia's wealthiest men, is a close ally of Russian President Putin and was a business associate of former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort. Manafort has been convicted of several felony charges related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and faces sentencing this spring. Deripaska is not implicated in any of those charges.\n\nDeripaska and his companies, including Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum company, were among dozens of Russian entities hit with Treasury Department sanctions in April as punishment for Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The sanctions roiled global aluminum markets, and critics say companies in the U.S. and elsewhere were hurt.\n\nThe Treasury Department has said the decision to lift the sanctions on the companies is in exchange for Deripaska agreeing to significantly reduce his stake in them. While Deripaska will remain sanctioned, \"these companies have committed to significantly diminish Deripaska's ownership and sever his control,\" Mnuchin said in a Dec. 19 statement. \"The companies will be subject to ongoing compliance and will face severe consequences if they fail to comply,\" he said.\n\nSigners of the letter, including House Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., and Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., asked that the sanctions relief be postponed \"until members' questions are resolved.\"\n\nIn fact, Democrats want answers from Mnuchin that go far beyond the sanctions decisions.\n\nSince early 2017, when House Democrats were in the minority, Waters has asked Treasury to provide records detailing Trump's possible financial ties to Russia, as well as those of the president's family members and associates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks as Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin looks on during a tour of the Boeing Company on March 14, 2018 in St. Louis, Missouri. Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty Images\n\nLater that year, Democrats on the committee wrote to Mnuchin requesting his help in determining \"the extent of any undue influence on the president and his administration from Russian government officials, oligarchs and organized crime leaders.\"\n\nAmong other things, Mnuchin oversees the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Unit, which maintains a database for law enforcement officials to combat money laundering and financial crimes. Yet he hasn't responded to inquiries from Financial Services Committee Democrats over the past two years about what they say are potentially suspicious financial dealings of the president, his family and his campaign associates, Democratic aides said.\n\nWaters has been active in scrutinizing Deutsche Bank, which has a history of violating anti-money laundering laws and has also lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump and his family members. Deutsche Bank is the subject of a Department of Justice investigation related to this \"mirror trading\" scandal, in which more than $10 billion was secretly transferred out of Russia by a group of corrupt traders.\n\nIn a May 2017 letter to Mnuchin, Waters also raised questions about comments from Trump's son Eric, during a 2008 conference in New York, that \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\" Democratic committee chairs say they haven't gotten answers from Mnuchin on their many inquiries.\n\nDemocrats have also expressed concern that Mnuchin faces a serious conflict in his current role, given his leadership of the Trump campaign's fundraising operation, and have called for his recusal from law enforcement and regulatory issues involving the president.\n\nAs the gatekeeper for information like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Democrats told Mnuchin they believe his position is untenable.\n\n\"It appears that your own involvement with the Trump campaign has resulted in an unavoidable conflict of interest which you are also attempting to ignore,\" top committee Democrats including Waters wrote in January 2018.\n\nWhile Thursday's meeting with Mnuchin is focused on Russian sanctions relief, some Democrats are expected to press for answers about his knowledge of any financial links Trump or his businesses may have to Russia, according to a Democratic aide close to the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nDemocratic committee chairs, as part of their overall investigative plan are expected to seek Trump's tax returns, in part to determine whether there were any financial ties or money laundering activities involving Trump and Russia during or prior to the campaign. Trump, breaking with tradition of recent past presidents, has refused to disclose his tax returns publicly.\n\nWhile much of the House Democratic agenda to conduct broad oversight of the Trump administration is off to a slow start due to the government shutdown, House Democrats say they must address the lifting of sanctions on the Deripaska-linked companies now, given the 30-day deadline they face.\n\nThe Treasury Department, which would ordinarily be in a position to address NBC News\u2019 questions, is one of the agencies affected by the partial government shutdown. The department did not respond to repeated requests for comment."

    "text": "UPDATE: Sources with links to the intelligence community have now confirmed that this theory is accurate, and I am therefore upgrading this story from my theory to a factual report.\n\nOnce I announced on Twitter and elsewhere that this theory was validated by sources, data scientists who had been examining the server data began to re-examine it in the light of this statement. @TeaPainUSA on Twitter, who knows his data science, collaborated with some other patriot data scientists on Twitter and off to produce this crucial report explaining how Alfa\u2019s server laundered the data.\n\nOriginal:\n\nHere is my theory of how Donald Trump will be impeached, and scores of people around him jailed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just money laundering \u2013 it was \u201cdata laundering\u201d.\n\nMy theory is based on public reporting, to which I will link in the text. Here it is:\n\nAlfa Bank is a front for Russian intelligence. Along with Dimitry Firtash, a Russian agent of influence, it owns Cambridge Analytica, the data targeting company used by Trump\u2019s campaign. It also owns SCL, the propaganda company responsible for what has been termed \u201cfake news\u201d but was actually real propaganda co-ordinated by Russian intelligence.\n\nCambridge Analytica and SCL use Facebook data they had no right to acquire, illegally stolen by a Russian spy working at Cambridge, to build an unbeatable target database of propaganda.\n\nIn the closing days of the election, the Russian state hacked into the voter rolls of the United States. Russian intelligence did this in order that they could provide this information to Alfa Bank in order to use Cambridge Analytica\u2019s targeting, and SCL\u2019s propaganda, in order precisely to target voters and tip them to Trump.\n\nPaul Manafort, who had always worked for and with the Trump campaign and who never left the campaign, relayed messages to Trump based on this stolen voter database information married to Cambridge Analytica and SCL targeting.\n\nBoth Manafort and Trump knew that this targeting information was based on stolen voter databases.\n\nThe Alfa Bank server in Trump Tower provided fresh evidence for the granting of the FISA warrant, I reported. (this is a fact). However, the warrant was broader than merely looking at the server metadata. It explicitly covered US persons caught up in the inquiry and explicitly covered the right for the FBI to read intercepts and hear tapes and other materials on US persons, related to this inquiry, already existing and provided by intelligence from a Baltic state ally, which report was Estonia. [Editor \u2013 this is a correction from my earlier wrong report of Lithuania].\n\nI believe the Alfa Bank server was sending back to Russia information on the hacked voter databases and how they could be micro-targeted.\n\nJust before the election, Manafort, who worked with Firtash and Alfa Bank, told Trump to go and campaign in Michigan. Public polling showed that Trump had no chance in Michigan.\n\nI believe, in summary:\n\nA Russian spy stole the Facebook data of hundreds of millions of Americans\n\nFrom that data, Russia crafted propaganda messages via SCL and targeted them by Cambridge Analytica\n\nBoth of these were owned by Alfa Bank and Firtash, Russian agent and boss of Manafort;\n\nIn order to perfect the social media targeting Russia hacked the electoral voter databases of various key American states:\n\nThis information was fed back to Manafort and Cambridge Analytica / SCL via the means of the bank server in Trump Tower;\n\nManafort and Trump used terrifyingly accurate micro-targeting obtained firstly by Facebook theft but secondly by Russia obtaining the exact demographic profiles of voters through hacks of US state databases and passing it back to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThis theory, if true, would directly connect the Russian state with the Trump campaign and mean that Trump colluded with Russian spies who were hacking America. He will be impeached for it.\n\nThere is much more Trump has done, but the Russian voter database hacks \u2014> to Cambridge Analytica \u2014> to SCL \u201cfake news\u201d to target the election \u2014-> with Trump\u2019s knowledge via Manafort \u2013 is the single most direct proof of Trump\u2019s collusion with America\u2019s enemies.\n\nFurthermore and as a coda,\n\nI believe, although to what Chris Steele might call a \u2018low confidence\u2019 level, that Roger Stone was communicating with Guccifer2 who hacked the DNC and Podesta, and that these releases had not worked. I believe that whoever Stone\u2019s \u201cgo-between\u201d to Wikileaks was, that person worked for or with Cambridge Analytica/SCL / Alfa Bank , and that person passed on the message that precise targeting and propaganda would be needed to win the election, hence the hacking of the voter databases and the messaging that went back into them.\n\nI have a pretty strong idea who this person and his backers are, and I shall be passing it to UK intelligence.\n\nLastly, following our exclusive reporting that Wikileaks is a Russian front who, days before the DNC hack, not only bought Russian servers, but gave their SSL keys to a Russian hacker Peter Chayanov, meaning he could see \u2013 and the FSB could see \u2013 everything on the Wikileaks site, including the IP address of any foolish Americans \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d to Wikileaks (like Chelsea Manning), meaning Putin could blackmail them, I will assume that Chayanov is Guccifer2; that he was collaborating with Stone and Manafort both directly and indirectly; and that he worked with Russian state hackers to attack US voter databases.\n\nAnd, to quote Jim Carrey in \u2018Liar, Liar,\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s the game!\u201d\n\nNow I will list the reporting on which this theory is based. I will address \u201cMoscow Mike Misha Flynn\u201d and the Cambridge University spy ring in another post \u2013 I have learned the hard way that too much information just shuts people down (when they don\u2019t have ADHD). But as a snippet, I will say that I believe Jared Kushner and Mike Flynn were both caught talking to Russian spies who worked with Sberbank, the parent company of SVB Bank \u2013 the OTHER bank that was a named target of the FISA warrant.\n\nSo, if you like, Alfa Bank \u2013 which owned Cambridge Analytica and passed info to and from Russia on hacked voter databases, for electoral gain, is the SIGINT part of this theory (Signals intelligence) \u2013 and SVB Bank, which funded \u201cstartups\u201d through Russian intel front Sberbank, is the HUMINT part of this theory \u2013 think Kushner, Mike Flynn and Epshteyn.\n\nAgain, Alfa Bank and SVB Bank are the two NAMED TARGETS of the FISA warrant granted on October 15th \u2013 one week after US intelligence put out a statement on voter database hacking, on October 7th.\n\nI believe this is why. There was money laundering from these banks \u2013 but there was data laundering, too.\n\nReports:\n\nFISA warrant granted on these banks (me, HeatStreet, Nov 7th 2016).\n\nFISA warrant granted on these banks October 15th \u2013 Paul Wood, BBC\n\nUS IC is correlating the voter database hack to targeting, with collusion \u2013 Paul Wood, BBC\n\nAlfa Bank and Firtash, who hired Manafort, actually own SCL and Cambridge Analytica \u2013 Ann Marlowe, the Tablet\n\nThere is a secret server belonging to Alfa Bank passing information back to Russia \u2013 Franklin Foer, Slate and David Corn, Mother Jones\n\nAlex Kogan of GSR, later SCL, illegally scraped, without permission, the data of millions of Facebook users \u2013 the Guardian\n\nKogan fled to Singapore and renamed himself Alex Spectre \u2013 Motherboard\n\nGeneral Flynn was in touch with a Russian spy ring at Cambridge University \u2013 the Financial Times\n\nDimitry Firtash donated to Cambridge University \u2013 Ann Marlowe, the Tablet\n\nVoter databases were hacked by Russia \u2013 US Intelligence\n\nWikileaks and Gruccifer2 are Russian fronts \u2013 US intelligence\n\nWikileaks bought Russian servers in advance of the release of the DNC hacks \u2013 Laurelai Bailey, for Patribotics\n\nWikileaks handed its SSL keys to Putin\u2019s Hacker Pytor Chayonov \u2013 me, for Patribotics"

    "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. Thomson Reuters A major money-laundering case set to go to trial last week in New York was suddenly settled three days earlier, with both the US government and the defendant, the Russian firm Prevezon Holdings, claiming victory.\n\nThe asset-forfeiture and money-laundering case was scheduled to begin last Monday, but it was unexpectedly settled for close to $6 million, a little under half of the amount sought by the government at the time the case was settled. The US attorney's office characterized the settlement as a win for anti-corruption efforts in a statement issued late Friday.\n\n\"Under the terms of this settlement, the defendants have agreed to pay not just what we alleged flowed to them from the Russian treasury fraud, but three times that amount, and roughly 10 times the money we alleged could be traced directly into US accounts and real estate,\" acting Manhattan US Attorney Joon H. Kim said.\n\nBut Prevezon described the settlement as proof that the company had done nothing wrong. It said it considered the \"surprise\" offer from prosecutors \"too good to refuse.\"\n\n\"It was a surprise,\" said John Dillard, a spokesman for Prevezon's attorneys. \"We were getting ready for opening statements and fully expected to try the case. In fact, we were looking forward to it.\"\n\n\"We reluctantly agreed to accept the government's offer when it became clear that the fine proposed was no more than we would have spent fully litigating the case, and that no admission of guilt, forfeiture or continued seizure of any assets was required,\" Dillard added. \"Essentially, the offer was too good to refuse.\"\n\nThe investigation into whether Prevezon, a real-estate company incorporated in Cyprus, laundered millions of dollars into New York City real estate garnered high-profile attention given its ties to a $230 million Russian tax-fraud scheme and Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, whose suspicious death aroused international media attention.\n\nMagnitsky uncovered the scheme in 2008 on behalf of one of his clients at the time, the investment advisory firm Hermitage Capital. He was later thrown in jail and died in custody, and an independent human-rights commission found he had been illegally arrested and beaten. The Kremlin maintains that Magnitsky died of a heart attack.\n\n(The founder of Hermitage, William Browder, sought justice for Magnitsky in the US and Europe after Magnitsky died. In 2012, Congress passed the Magnitsky Act, which authorizes the president to deny visas to, and freeze the assets of, Russians believed to have been complicit in Magnitsky's death.)\n\nSergei Magnitsky. Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe US government had been investigating the $230 million scheme that Magnitsky uncovered \u2014 and what happened to the proceeds \u2014 for nearly four years. Prosecutors said the funds from the elaborate scheme had been laundered via shell companies and real-estate purchases.\n\nThe trail ultimately led to Manhattan, where Preet Bharara, then the US attorney there, accused Prevezon in September 2013 of receiving \"at least $1,965,444 in proceeds from the $230 million fraud scheme\" in early 2008 via wire transfers from at least two suspected shell companies through the Southern District of New York. The company then invested those funds \"in various New York properties,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe Russian government declined to provide the US government with evidence of Russian money flows that would strengthen the case against Prevezon. Nikolai Gorokhov, a lawyer representing Magnitsky's family, was able to photograph documents contained in a Russian case file targeting two people involved in the $230 million scheme that traced the money to Russia.\n\nGorokhov mysteriously fell from a window in Moscow just over a month before he was due to testify in the Prevezon case. But the documents he photographed were admitted into evidence just days before Prevezon agreed to settle.\n\nThe settlement came as a surprise to some. Louise Shelley, an illicit-finance expert who was set to testify in support of the US government, told CNN the day after the case was settled that she was concerned about the possibility that \"political pressure\" had been applied to the US attorney's office. She added that she thought Prevezon \"won something\" because there was \"no recognition of wrongdoing.\"\n\nReached by Business Insider last week, however, Shelley said only: \"I cannot talk about it.\" She did not respond to further questions.\n\nJamison Firestone, Magnitsky's law-firm partner, flew into New York from London to serve as a government witness against Prevezon. But the case was settled shortly after he arrived.\n\n\"It was definitely my shortest trip across the pond,\" Firestone told Business Insider.\n\n\"There's a part of me that very much wanted to testify and get all this dirty stuff out there and cause maximum damage to these people and everyone who's related to them,\" Firestone said. He relayed how he had been present when the Russian government raided his law office \"and beat up one of my lawyers\" looking for documents related to Magnitsky's work nearly a decade ago.\n\n\"I've filed complaints against some of the people involved in this whole story \u2014 I've seen the money flows,\" Firestone said. \"I have mixed feelings from a personal standpoint, but I respect the government's decision ... and it sent a strong message that if you're going to launder money, don't do it here.\"\n\nA spokesman for the US Attorney's office said the settlement saved taxpayers the expense of a trial, and reiterated that the settlement was for \"many multiples more\" than the amount of proceeds of the Russian tax fraud alleged to have been laundered through real-estate purchases in New York. He characterized it as a \"very good outcome\" for the government.\n\nBill Browder, the founder of Hermitage Capital. Getty Images/ AFP/ Bertrand Guay\n\nBrowder, who founded Hermitage and spearheaded the Magnitsky Act, told Business Insider that \"the government's conduct was absolutely correct and successful.\"\n\n\"The amount of money the US government could trace to this crime was roughly $1.9 million,\" Browder said. \"It would've been a stretch, even in a good trial, for them to get the full $14 million they were aiming for. So for the government to get triple the amount of money that they found [had been laundered] without having to go through a jury trial ... it was a no-brainer.\"\n\n\"Any Russian with illicit money will now be terrified to bring it to America,\" Browder added.\n\nStill, not everyone was convinced that the government's decision to settle was a good one.\n\n\"I would have liked to see the case come to a public trial so that sun could shine on the evidence and details of the alleged wrongdoing,\" said John Cassara, a former intelligence officer who served in the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.\n\n\"Periodically, we need the publicity that big 'impact' cases generate to heighten awareness of money-laundering methodologies, corruption, and suspect modus operandi,\" said Cassara, who now sits on the board of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Center for Sanctions and Illicit Finance.\n\nCassara said he didn't know the strength of the Justice Department's case against Prevezon (Firestone said he thought it would have been an \"easy kill\" for the government) and was \"sure they weighed the pros and cons\" before opting to settle.\n\nBut, Cassara said, \"three times the amount that was allegedly laundered cannot be considered a win.\"\n\n\"According to estimates approximately $5 trillion is laundered globally every year. In comparison, what is $5.9 million?\" Cassara said. \"We probably recover about 1% of the money laundered globally. We have to keep things in perspective. Our efforts to combat international money laundering are failing, and this case did nothing to turn the tide.\""

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Joon H. Kim, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that the United States has settled a money laundering and civil forfeiture action against assets of 11 corporations, including some that own luxury residential and high-end commercial real estate in Manhattan. The Government\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendant corporations laundered some proceeds of a $230 million Russian tax refund fraud scheme involving corrupt Russian officials that was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in pretrial detention in Moscow under suspicious circumstances and was posthumously prosecuted by Russia.\n\nIn the stipulation of settlement filed with U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III today, which is still subject to approval by the Court, one of the defendant corporations, Prevezon Holdings Ltd., agrees to pay $5,896,333.65 to resolve the Government\u2019s claims against all defendants. This payment represents triple the value of the proceeds that the Government alleged could be traced directly from the Russian treasury fraud to the defendants ($1,965,444.55), and more than ten times the amount of proceeds the Government alleged could be traced directly to property in New York (approximately $582,000).\n\nActing Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said: \u201cWe will not allow the U.S. financial system to be used to launder the proceeds of crimes committed anywhere \u2013 here in the U.S., in Russia, or anywhere else. Under the terms of this settlement, the defendants have agreed to pay not just what we alleged flowed to them from the Russian treasury fraud, but three times that amount, and roughly 10 times the money we alleged could be traced directly into U.S. accounts and real estate.\u201d\n\nThe Government\u2019s lawsuit alleged as follows:\n\nIn 2007, a Russian criminal organization engaged in an elaborate tax refund fraud scheme resulting in a fraudulently obtained tax refund of approximately $230 million from the Russian treasury. As part of the fraud scheme, members of the organization stole the corporate identities of portfolio companies of the Hermitage Fund, a foreign investment fund operating in Russia. The organization\u2019s members then used these stolen identities to make fraudulent claims for tax refunds.\n\nIn order to procure the refunds, the criminal organization fraudulently re-registered the Hermitage companies in the names of members of the organization, and then orchestrated sham lawsuits against these companies. These sham lawsuits involved members of the organization as both the plaintiffs (representing sham commercial counterparties suing the Hermitage companies) and the defendants (purporting to represent the Hermitage companies). In each case, the members of the organization purporting to represent the Hermitage companies confessed full liability in court, leading the courts to award large money judgments to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe purpose of the sham lawsuits was to fraudulently generate money judgments against the Hermitage companies. Members of the organization purporting to represent the Hermitage companies then used those money judgments to seek tax refunds. The basis of these refund requests was that the money judgments constituted losses eliminating the profits the Hermitage companies had earned, and thus the Hermitage companies were entitled to a refund of the taxes that had been paid on these profits. The requested refunds totaled 5.4 billion rubles, or approximately $230 million.\n\nMembers of the organization who were officials at two Russian tax offices corruptly approved the requests within one business day, and approximately $230 million was disbursed to members of the organization, purportedly on behalf of the Hermitage companies, two days later.\n\nAfter perpetrating this fraud, members of the organization undertook illegal actions in order to conceal this fraud and retaliate against individuals who attempted to expose it. After learning of the lawsuits against its portfolio companies, Hermitage retained attorneys, including Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, to investigate. Magnitsky and other attorneys for Hermitage uncovered the refund fraud scheme, and the complicity of Russian governmental officials in it, and were subject to retaliatory criminal proceedings against them. Magnitsky was arrested and died approximately a year later in pretrial detention. An independent Russian human rights council concluded that Magnitsky\u2019s arrest and detention were illegal, that Magnitsky was denied necessary medical care in custody, that he was beaten by eight guards with rubber batons on the last day of his life, and that the ambulance crew that was called to treat him as he was dying was deliberately kept outside of his cell for more than an hour until he was dead.\n\nMembers of the criminal organization, and associates of those members, have also engaged in a broad pattern of money laundering in order to conceal the proceeds of the fraud scheme. In a complex series of transfers through shell corporations, the $230 million from the Russian treasury was laundered into numerous accounts in Russia and other countries. A portion of the funds stolen from the Russian treasury passed through several shell companies into Prevezon Holdings, Ltd., a Cyprus-based real estate corporation that is a defendant in the forfeiture action. Prevezon Holdings laundered these fraud proceeds into its real estate holdings, including investment in multiple units of high-end commercial space and luxury apartments in Manhattan, and created multiple other corporations, also subject to the forfeiture action, to hold these properties.\n\n* * *\n\nA chart listing the companies named as defendants in the lawsuit is attached.\n\nMr. Kim praised the outstanding investigative work of ICE HSI New York\u2019s El Dorado Task Force.\n\nThis case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Forfeiture Unit. Assistant United States Attorneys Paul M. Monteleoni, Cristine Irvin Phillips, and Tara M. LaMorte are in charge of the case."

The group is also known as \u201cStone Panda,\u201d \u201cRed Apollo,\u201d \u201cMenuPass\u201d and \u201cPOTASSIUM.\u201d\n\nBoth Zhu and Zhang worked for a company called Huaying Huatai Science and Technology Development company in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin.\n\nBoth were also linked with the ministry of state security in Tianjin. Zhu, known by aliases such as \u201cAfwa,\u201d \u201cCVNX,\u201d \u201cAlayos,\u201d and \u201cGodkiller,\u201d was responsible for registering malware domains and hacking infrastructure, as well as recruiting members for APT10, according to the document.\n\nZhang, whose alternative names include \u201cbaobeiling,\u201d \u201cZhang Jianguo\u201d and \u201cAtreexp\u201d, registered domains and infrastructure as well as tested and developed malware used by the group.\n\nBeginning in or about 2006, the group breached the computers of more than 45 commercial and defence technology companies in aviation, space and satellite technology, pharmaceutical technology, and others in 12 US states, stealing \u201chundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data,\u201d according to US prosecutors.\n\nIn 2014, Zhu and Zhang and other members of the group gained access to the managed service providers, companies that store client data remotely, of businesses and governments in at least 12 countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Brazil, France, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, Germany, and India. They also obtained the personal data of more than 100,000 personnel working for the US Navy.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the alleged hackers sent customised emails with malware hidden in attachments related to the recipient. Once opened, the attachment would install malware, including one known as \u201cPoison Ivy\u201d used to steal usernames and passwords as users type them. The malware was also programmed to communicate with domains assigned to IP addresses of computers controlled by APT10.\n\nZhu and Zhang are not likely to face their charges. In 2014, the US indicted five members of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army for espionage, but they have never been brought to the US. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday that it resolutely opposes the \u201cslanderous\u201d accusations from the US and urges Washington to withdraw its allegations.\n\n\u201cAmerica and many allies know what China is doing. We know why they are doing it. And in some cases, we even know which individual people are doing it in association with the Chinese government,\u201d deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein of the southern district of New York said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe hope the day will come when the defendants face justice under the rule of law in a federal courtroom.\u201d"

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nDec. 30, 2018, 3:04 PM GMT By Allan Smith\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly, who will depart President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday, told The Los Angeles Times in an extensive interview published Sunday that the president never ordered him to do anything illegal and added that the proposed border wall at the center of the government shutdown fight is not as it has been portrayed.\n\nKelly, set to be replaced by Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who will serve as acting chief of staff, said he made sure the president had access to detailed information prior to making decisions, even though the president says publicly that he goes with his gut instinct.\n\n\"It\u2019s never been: The president just wants to make a decision based on no knowledge and ignorance,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cYou may not like his decision, but at least he was fully informed on the impact.\"\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly listens as President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with newly elected governors in the Cabinet Room of the White House on Dec. 13, 2018. Evan Vucci / AP\n\nThe retired Marine general said Trump often pressed him on his legal authority to do certain actions, asking, \"Why can't we do [something] this way?\" Kelly added that he was not ordered to carry out any illegal action \"because we wouldn't have.\"\n\n\"If he had said to me, 'Do it, or you\u2019re fired,'\" Kelly insisted he would have resigned, later adding that he told Trump that \"the last thing in my view that you need in the chief of staff is someone that looks at every issue through a political lens.\"\n\nPointing to Trump's pledge to build a massive wall along the U.S. border with Mexico \u2014 a central campaign promise \u2014 Kelly said, \"To be honest, it's not a wall,\" meaning that Trump no longer is calling for a huge concrete structure spanning thousands of miles.\n\n\"The president still says 'wall' \u2014 oftentimes frankly he\u2019ll say 'barrier' or 'fencing,' now he\u2019s tended toward steel slats,\" Kelly said. \"But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.\"\n\nKelly, who said the country does \"have an immigration problem,\" took aim at former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, blaming him for the administration's policy of family separation at the border. That policy led to hundreds of migrant children being split from their parents by U.S. authorities.\n\nThe policy announcement took the White House by surprise, the former Homeland Security secretary said.\n\n\"What happened was Jeff Sessions, he was the one that instituted the zero-tolerance process on the border that resulted in both people being detained and the family separation,\" Kelly said. \"He surprised us.\"\n\nThe administration had earlier insisted there was no policy of separating families at the border.\n\nOn his way out, Kelly said his tenure as chief of staff could be evaluated not by what Trump did during that time, but rather what the president had not done."

Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2018\n\nThe Senate had previously passed a government funding bill without the border wall funding, but Trump declared the next day he would not sign it without money for his signature campaign promise after facing pressure from conservative commentators and lawmakers.\n\nThe House passed a bill last week with $5.7 billion in border funding, though it was dead on arrival in the Senate as it was clear it would fail to reach a 60-vote hurdle. Democrats in both chambers have declared their opposition to the border wall, with likely next Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro PelosiMoulton: Newborn daughter 'absolutely' a consideration in 2020 White House bid GOP on defensive over Dem votes on policies geared toward women Dems worry Mueller findings could expand executive power MORE (D-Calif.) calling it a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d\n\nThe shutdown has resulted in the furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal employees and the closure of several government departments, including the Department of Homeland Security and numerous other agencies. It will likely extend into the new year and the next Congress, when Democrats take control of the House of Representatives and gain more leverage in negotiations, leaving them little incentive to agree to Trump\u2019s demand."

    "text": "Whistleblowers said the Americans were exchanging messages with unsecure Gmail accounts set up by their Russian counterparts as the US election heated up.\n\nUS Treasury Department officials used a Gmail back channel with the Russian government as the Kremlin sought sensitive financial information on its enemies in America and across the globe, according to documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News. The extraordinary unofficial line of communication arose in the final year of the Obama administration \u2014 in the midst of what multiple US intelligence agencies have said was a secret campaign by the Kremlin to interfere in the US election. Russian agents ostensibly trying to track ISIS instead pressed their American counterparts for private financial documents on at least two dozen dissidents, academics, private investigators, and American citizens. Most startlingly, Russia requested sensitive documents on Dirk, Edward, and Daniel Ziff, billionaire investors who had run afoul of the Kremlin. That request was made weeks before a Russian lawyer showed up at Trump Tower offering top campaign aides \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton \u2014 including her supposed connection to the Ziff brothers. Russia\u2019s financial crimes agency, whose second-in-command is a former KGB officer and schoolmate of President Vladimir Putin, also asked the Americans for documents on executives from two prominent Jewish groups, the Anti-Defamation League and the National Council of Jewish Women, as well as Kremlin opponents living abroad in London and Kiev. In an astonishing departure from protocol, documents show that at the same time the requests were being made, Treasury officials were using their government email accounts to send messages back and forth with a network of private Hotmail and Gmail accounts set up by the Russians, rather than communicating through the secure network usually used to exchange information with other countries.\n\nGot a tip? You can email tips@buzzfeed.com. To learn how to reach us securely, go to tips.buzzfeed.com\n\nAnalysts at an elite agency within Treasury first warned supervisors in 2016 that the Russians were \u201cmanipulating the system\u201d to conduct \u201cfishing expeditions.\u201d And they raised fears that the Treasury\u2019s internal systems could be compromised by viruses contained in emails from the unofficial Russian accounts. But staff continued using the Gmail back channel into 2017, despite repeated internal warnings that Russia could be trawling for sensitive financial records \u2014 including Social Security and bank account numbers \u2014 to spy on, endanger, or recruit targets in the West. The Treasury Department refused to tell BuzzFeed News why its officials were communicating with unofficial Gmail accounts at the same time that Russia was sending the suspicious requests, or to say whether it eventually turned over any documents in response. Nor would officials answer any other specific questions about the matter. In a statement, a spokesperson said: \u201cTreasury does not discuss or comment on confidential communications with foreign governments, including to confirm whether or not they have occurred. We have notified our Office of the Inspector General of these allegations.\u201d\n\nWant to support more reporting like this? Become a BuzzFeed News member today. But documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News reveal that Russia\u2019s attempts to extract information about Western targets triggered alarms inside the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, a powerful unit of the Treasury Department with exclusive access to the most comprehensive and sophisticated financial database in the world. Officials at FinCEN said they reported the use of the back channel to Treasury\u2019s counterterrorism unit and security office, and requested an investigation. They said it was a breach of protocol and that it exposed the Treasury to potential hackers because the Russian messages contained attachments \u2014 a common way for intruders to worm inside an organization\u2019s servers. \u201cIf the attachment had a virus it could infiltrate the server,\u201d a senior FinCEN official told BuzzFeed News. This source said insiders have been concerned that their internal records could have been corrupted. The FinCEN officials reported the incidents in July and August 2016, and claim that there was no substantive investigation of the matter. These sources said that other senior officials continued to use the back channel even after they were told to stop by the Treasury\u2019s office for security. They suspected that the Russian agency making the requests, called Rosfinmonitoring, set up by Putin in 2001 to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, was closely tied to Russia\u2019s espionage apparatus. \u201cThey are passing information that may have interest to the Russians for other reasons,\u201d a FinCEN official wrote to colleagues in March 2017. \u201cOne has to wonder what the heck is going on here.\u201d This official filed for whistleblower protection and quit last year.\n\n\u201cIf you are a Russian government entity and you are communicating with Americans, you have an FSB officer sitting right next to you and that officer is probably sending the email.\u201d\n\nIn emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News, FinCEN insiders expressed shock that staff in another Treasury office had agreed to communicate with the Russians outside of normal, secure channels. FinCEN uses an encrypted portal called the Egmont Secure Web to exchange information with more than 160 other countries, including Russia, and to keep sensitive financial data out of the wrong hands. A former US intelligence official who served in Russia for many years told BuzzFeed News that the use of unsecure accounts is a major red flag for espionage activity. \u201cRosfinmonitoring is under the command and control of the FSB,\u201d the former intelligence officer said, referring to Russia\u2019s spy agency. \u201cIf you are a Russian government entity and you are communicating with Americans, you have an FSB officer sitting right next to you and that officer is probably sending the email.\u201d The first chapter in this extraordinary chain of communications began in late 2015, when a unit of the Treasury Department called the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes entered into an agreement, named the ISIL Project, that called for Russia and the US to share information on financial institutions in the Middle East suspected of supporting ISIS. According to a senior FinCEN intelligence analyst, Russia\u2019s subsequent actions suggest that was just a cover. \u201cWhat we were seeing with Russia was the fruition of a long-term strategy to try and compromise Treasury by cultivating civil servants. That\u2019s why we sounded the alarm and reported it.\u201d It was not the only time that concerns about serious counterintelligence threats were raised at the elite financial intelligence unit during the past two years. Six sources told BuzzFeed News that at least two FinCEN analysts were reported to Treasury\u2019s inspector general over suspicions that they might have been working against the interests of the US. One analyst was a man with close family ties to Ukraine. He was tracking the finances of corrupt foreign officials in a job that requires a security clearance. Four sources said they were told by security officials at the agency that the analyst turned out not to have one. He had applied for clearance during his previous posting at the State Department, they were told, but was denied it because of suspicious contacts with foreigners. The sources said the man also had unusual contacts with his colleagues both before and after he was fired. Shortly after he was escorted out of FinCEN early last year, he showed up outside a coworker\u2019s apartment building late at night and asked questions about investigations and internal Treasury databases. The coworker reported the encounter to supervisors. The man\u2019s uncleared access to sensitive information was considered such a major national security breach that FinCEN was stripped of its authority to grant security clearances for some time, according to these four sources. FinCEN\u2019s security chief was later placed on administrative leave. A second employee was suspended after he was caught traveling to other countries without informing his supervisors \u2014 something that FinCEN analysts are forbidden to do because of the value their data could have to foreign powers. A Treasury spokesperson declined to answer detailed questions about these matters. These revelations are the latest evidence of the disarray inside America\u2019s financial intelligence system, which a two-year BuzzFeed News investigation has laid bare. FinCEN is a critical US law enforcement agency that each day collects and analyzes thousands of bank reports about suspicious financial behavior. Analysts have played a key role in current investigations by the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller, assisting FBI agents with inquiries into the murky finances of President Donald Trump and his associates. Yet hundreds of internal records and interviews with more than a dozen insiders \u2014 from frontline workers to senior leaders \u2014 show an agency in turmoil, torn apart by turf battles, sinking morale, and internal chaos. Officials there say that, as a result, the unit struggles to hold the line against global money launderers, terrorist organizations, and drug cartels, and lies vulnerable to foreign threats. Critical financial records on some Trump associates and Russian figures, collected by FinCEN analysts, have not been turned over to Congress, despite numerous requests. And more than a dozen FinCEN officials say that a rivalry with another unit of the Treasury Department cost them several crucial hours of work to track suspects\u2019 movements in the immediate aftermath of the 2017 London Bridge terror attack. The disarray bled into FinCEN\u2019s daily output. One analyst wrote an investigative memo last year that was shared with the FBI, falsely connecting a member of Trump\u2019s inner circle to a notorious Kremlin bagman. BuzzFeed News reviewed that memo and quickly debunked it; a spelling error led the analyst to mistake an unrelated person for the Putin financier. At least 10 FinCEN employees have filed formal whistleblower complaints about the department. The whistleblowers say they tried multiple times to raise concerns about issues they believed threatened national security, but that they faced retaliation instead of being heeded. Some of FinCEN\u2019s top officials quit in anger. One senior adviser has been arrested and accused of releasing financial records to a journalist. That adviser, a whistleblower named Natalie Mayflower Edwards, first sounded the alarm in the summer of 2016. She went on to speak with six different congressional committee staffers to air her concerns. In July and August 2018, she met again with staffers of one of the Senate committees investigating Russian interference during the presidential campaign. In those meetings, she told the staffers that FinCEN withheld documents revealing suspicious financial transactions of Trump associates that the committee had requested.\n\nAlong with a colleague, Edwards wrote a letter last year to six congressional oversight committees. In it, the analysts included documentary evidence and Edwards wrote, \u201cI have brought forward lawful documented evidential disclosures of violations of law, rule, and regulations, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, and substantial and specific danger to public safety and I have NOT been protected against reprisal.\u201d Edwards added that she reported the \u201cwrongdoing\u201d to her supervisor, the inspector general, Treasury\u2019s general counsel, Treasury security personnel, and the counterterrorism unit, requesting an internal investigation, as well as alerting the Office of Special Counsel, the federal government agency that deals with whistleblower complaints. Despite her disclosures, she wrote, \u201cI continue to be retaliated against.\u201d \u201cMay Edwards took it on herself to try and protect everyone here as well as national security,\u201d a senior FinCEN official told BuzzFeed News. \u201cNobody listened to her or some of the other brave whistleblowers who came forward. They\u2019re all now paying a high price.\u201d Over the past two years, BuzzFeed News reporters have spoken at length to 12 individuals inside FinCEN. These men and women asked for anonymity to draw back the curtain on breakdowns inside the world\u2019s most powerful financial watchdog. They described an agency turned upside down, where failures left them vulnerable to foreign threats, hampered their ability to investigate financial crimes, and ultimately put the public in danger.\n\nAlexei Druzhinin / TASS Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Yuri Chikhanchin, the head of Rosfinmonitoring.\n\nA high-risk agreement The foundations of the Treasury Department\u2019s highly unorthodox relationship with its Russian counterpart were built late 2015, sources and internal documents show. One of FinCEN\u2019s key jobs is to work with other governments to track illicit money networks and shell companies across the globe. Nearly 160 countries, including Russia, have agreements to share bank information through a secure network. But Russia chose to work outside that system \u2014 and it began by building a relationship with a unit of Treasury called the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes. Senior officials from the terror unit had multiple meetings with top officials at Rosfinmonitoring to discuss jointly tracking the financing of ISIS. Among the negotiators was the Russian financial watchdog\u2019s second-in-command, Yuri Korotky. Korotky went to a KGB finishing school the same year that Putin finished his training there, and worked for the KGB\u2019s successor, the FSB, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\nRosfinmonitoring / Via Rosfinmonitoring.ru Yuri Korotky\n\nRosfinomintoring did not return detailed messages seeking comment. Korotky and other Russian officials proposed that Rosfinmonitoring trade information directly with the US as part of their joint effort to defeat ISIS. But almost immediately, the Russians reneged on their end of the bargain. Rosfinmonitoring was slow to share data. It sought ways to work around FinCEN, the Treasury office that had sole access to the data it wanted, and whose analysts were skeptical of sharing information directly with Russia. By the summer, Rosfinmonitoring had made a series of requests about individuals and companies seemingly unconnected to ISIS or jihadi terror. Among them were Alexander Lebedev, a newspaper publisher and Putin critic based in London. The Russians asked for financial tracking documents on a company tied to the Panama Papers, the multinational investigation that embarrassed the Kremlin by revealing Putin\u2019s financial network. Throughout 2016, Rosfinmonitoring asked for documents on nearly two dozen entities that FinCEN insiders believed were enemies of the Kremlin. Even more concerning: Documents show senior officials within the Terrorist Financing unit were communicating with Hotmail and Gmail accounts set up by the Russians, rather than using the standard secure channels.\n\n\u201cThey sent this to a GMAIL account? Is that normal?\u201d\n\nWhen she found out, FinCEN\u2019s chief of staff was stunned. \u201cThey sent this to a GMAIL account? Is that normal?\u201d she asked in an email to a half dozen colleagues on Nov. 28, 2016. The chief of staff was responding to Treasury colleagues who were discussing with Rosfinmonitoring the outlines of their agreement to track terrorism financiers. \u201cUnfortunately, Rosfin does prefer throwaway gmail accounts as their preferred method to communicate,\u201d a FinCEN intelligence official responded. In March 2017, this same official wrote to supervisors to warn that Russia was manipulating the system. She said that the Terrorist Financing unit, which set up the collaboration with Russia, wasn\u2019t forthcoming about the extent of its relationship with that country and wouldn\u2019t let FinCEN attend meetings with its representatives.\n\nGOPFinancialServices / YouTube / Via youtube.com Jamal El-Hindi speaks at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance.\n\nA power vacuum Just as the Kremlin started fishing, a new leader took over FinCEN. Jamal El-Hindi has spent nearly two decades at Treasury. When he was named acting director of FinCEN in June 2016, he assumed control of one of the most important law enforcement bodies in the US. But during his tenure, FinCEN has withered. About 70 full-time jobs have gone unfilled, sources said, and El-Hindi canceled popular programs that insiders felt helped them recruit young, talented analysts. Employees grumbled about a laggardly pace inside the building and complained that basic reports once took days to be approved but were now being held in limbo for weeks. Twelve current and former employees said El-Hindi was notoriously late to meetings. Unlike his predecessors, he did not set yearly priorities, they said. One veteran supervisor said that on El-Hindi\u2019s watch, FinCEN became too cautious and too concerned with the optics of its work rather than the substance.\n\nObtained by BuzzFeed News A slide from the 2017 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey results.\n\n\u201cEl-Hindi\u2019s failure to make decisions is legend at FinCEN,\u201d this official said. \u201cAt one point, the previous director had him put together a decision-making seminar in hopes he might learn how to decision-make.\u201d BuzzFeed News sent El-Hindi detailed messages personally and through Treasury, but received no response. The previous director also did not respond to queries. A new director, Ken Blanco, took over the unit in November 2017. \u201cTreasury does not comment on personnel actions or matters,\u201d a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. By 2017, morale at FinCEN ranked dead last among every unit at the Treasury Department. Frustrated by the dysfunction, seasoned employees started leaving for more lucrative work in the private sector. That\u2019s when officials in a rival department made a lunge for FinCEN\u2019s greatest asset.\n\nBrendan Smialowski / AFP / Getty Images Whistleblowers say the US Treasury Department has been consumed by chaos during the past two years.\n\nTurf war The unit of Treasury that monitors suspicious bank transactions outside the US is called the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, a sister unit of the terror department that had struck the deal with the Russians. Now, by the fall of 2016, the OIA wanted more authority over FinCEN\u2019s vast database of suspicious financial transactions across the globe. The unit proposed a \u201crealignment\u201d that would have peeled off FinCEN\u2019s authority over the database, some of its employees, and a piece of its budget. FinCEN staffers were aghast. They worried that El-Hindi was too weak to fend off the incursion and that it would hamper the office\u2019s ability to fight financial crime. They also said the move by OIA was illegal, because it would cross the bright line that is supposed to separate intelligence agencies that collect information abroad from those that collect information on US citizens and residents. OIA\u2019s maneuver led to an open revolt inside FinCEN. More than a dozen workers reported the matter to their supervisors or to Congress. In September, an attorney from OIA got into a heated exchange with a small group of FinCEN employees, according to eight sources and internal documents. After BuzzFeed News published a report about the allegations last year, Sens. Ron Wyden and Orrin Hatch sent a letter to the Department of Treasury\u2019s inspector general, Eric Thorson, requesting a briefing about the matter. After months of investigation, Thorson\u2019s office concluded there was no merit to the complaints, which included the allegation that OIA analysts illegally snooped on the banking records of American individuals and companies. His office noted, however, that OIA has been working for a decade without proper guidelines on how it handles US citizens\u2019 information. The audit report recommended that OIA \u201cas expeditiously as possible\u201d submit its rules to the Department of Justice for approval, which the agency did earlier this year. El-Hindi wanted his department to \u201cget along\u201d with OIA, these sources said, and did little to stand in that office\u2019s way. In fact, emails show that he instructed his workers not to take their complaints to Congress \u2014 which the whistleblowers viewed as a staggering betrayal. But the FinCEN employees spoke out anyway. At least 10 filed formal whistleblower paperwork, many for the first time in their government careers. In meetings with six different congressional committees, two of the whistleblowers described a litany of misconduct at Treasury, including Russia\u2019s attempt to gather intelligence on its enemies during the 2016 election. To this day, the committees have done little to address those whistleblowers\u2019 concerns. Ultimately, FinCEN won out. The realignment failed and the unit retained control over its records. But its battle with OIA wasn\u2019t over.\n\nDave Thompson, Carl Court / Getty Images FinCEN analysts were involved in the search for suspects after terrorist incidents at the Manchester Arena and the London Bridge."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Image copyright BSTU Image caption Vladimir Putin was 33 when he received this Stasi ID card\n\nA Stasi ID pass used by Vladimir Putin when he was a Soviet spy in former East Germany has been found in the Stasi secret police archive in Dresden.\n\nThe Russian president has expressed pride in his record as a communist KGB officer in Dresden in the 1980s.\n\nHis Stasi pass was found during research into the close co-operation between the KGB and Stasi.\n\nMr Putin, then a KGB major, got it in 1985. It got him into Stasi facilities, but he may not have spied for them.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Stasi Records Agency (BStU) said that Mr Putin \"received the pass so that he could carry out his KGB work in co-operation with the Stasi\".\n\nStasi was actually the nickname for East German Ministry of State Security (MfS) agents. It was notorious for its meticulous surveillance of ordinary citizens, many of whom were pressed into spying on each other.\n\n\"Current research gives no indication that Vladimir Putin worked for the MfS,\" the BStU statement said.\n\nImage copyright BSTU Image caption The stamps are proof of Mr Putin's years co-operating with the Stasi in Dresden\n\nImage copyright BSTU Image caption Mr Putin signed himself \"Wladimir Putin\" using German spelling\n\nMr Putin, born in Leningrad (now St Petersburg), was posted to East Germany in 1985, aged 33. His two daughters were born during that posting. He is now 66.\n\nMr Putin was a KGB officer in Dresden up to and including December 1989, when the communist East German regime collapsed amid mass pro-democracy protests.\n\nHis Stasi pass was renewed every three months, as shown by the stamps on it. It is not clear why he left the pass in the Stasi files in Dresden.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption This building was the KGB's headquarters in Dresden during the Cold War\n\nHe witnessed protesters occupying the Dresden Stasi headquarters, while communist security forces came close to opening fire on them, on 5 December 1989.\n\nJubilant East Berliners had already breached the Berlin Wall in November.\n\nMr Putin was fluent in German at the time and has said he personally calmed the Dresden crowd when they surrounded the KGB building there, warning them that it was Soviet territory.\n\nDuring his KGB service in Dresden Mr Putin was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nIn 1989 he was awarded a bronze medal by communist East Germany - officially the German Democratic Republic (GDR) - \"for faithful service to the National People's Army\", the Kremlin website says.\n\nAfter returning to Russia, Mr Putin rose to become head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) - main successor to the KGB. He became Russian president in 2000.\n\nIn June 2017 Mr Putin revealed that his work in the KGB had involved \"illegal intelligence-gathering\". Speaking on Russian state TV, he said KGB spies were people with \"special qualities, special convictions and a special type of character\".\n\nA once top secret agreement between the KGB and Stasi, seen by the BBC, shows that the KGB had 30 liaison officers in East Germany who worked directly alongside the Stasi.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov shrugged off the emergence of Mr Putin's old Stasi card. \"The KGB and the Stasi were partner intelligence agencies so you probably can't rule out an exchange of such identity cards,\" he said."

    "text": "Two ex-business associates of former national security adviser Michael Flynn have been charged over alleged illegal lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government in the United States and making false statements to the FBI, according to an indictment unsealed Monday.\n\nBijan Rafiekian, also known as Bijan Kian, and Kamil Ekim Alptekin of Istanbul were charged after allegedly being involved in a conspiracy to \u201ccovertly influence U.S. politicians and public opinion\u201d against a Turkish citizen living in the U.S. whose extradition had been requested by the Turkish government, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThat Turkish citizen is Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused of directing a failed coup.\n\nMICHAEL FLYNN'S SENTENCING DELAYED BY JUDGE\n\nThe alleged plot detailed Monday included using a company founded by Rafiekian, referred to in the indictment as \u201cCompany A,\u201d based upon \u201cPerson A\u2019s\u201d national security expertise. Person A reportedly is Flynn.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the purpose of the conspiracy was to use Company A to \u201cdelegitimize the Turkish citizen in the eyes of the American public and United States politicians, with the goal of obtaining his extradition, which was meeting resistance at the U.S. Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nKian and Alptekin allegedly sought to conceal that the Turkish government was directing the work. According to the indictment, Turkish cabinet-level officials approved the budget for the project, and Alptekin allegedly provided Turkish officials with updates on the project.\n\nBoth Kian and Alptekin failed to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), under which Flynn, the former White House national security adviser, also failed to register connected with his work with Turkey. According to the indictment, Rafiekian was vice chairman of Flynn's business group, the Flynn Intel Group. The two worked throughout 2016 to seek ways to have cleric Gulen extradited from the U.S. to Turkey.\n\nKian is charged with conspiracy and acting as an illegal agent of the Turkish government. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of six years in prison for the conspiracy charge, and 10 years for the charge of acting as a foreign agent. Alptekin is also charged with conspiracy and acting as an agent of Turkey, but also faces four counts of making false statements to the FBI. He faces up to 35 years in prison.\n\nMCCABE REVEALS 'ONE THING' THAT STOOD OUT FROM HIS FATEFUL CALL WITH FLYNN\n\nMeanwhile, Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI regarding his contacts with the former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut according to Mueller\u2019s statement of Flynn\u2019s offense, the former national security adviser also made \u201cmaterially false statements and omissions\u201d in Foreign Agent Registration Act filings to the Justice Department regarding his lobbying projects with Turkey. In the FARA filing, Flynn allegedly falsely stated that his company, Flynn Intel Group Inc., \u201cdid not know whether or the extent to which the Republic of Turkey was involved\u201d in a Turkey project, and that the project was focused on improving U.S. business organizations\u2019 confidence regarding doing business in Turkey.\n\nMueller's office has only charged him with one count of false statements regarding his communications with the Russian ambassador. Flynn is expected in federal court on Tuesday for his sentencing hearing in connection with that charge. Earlier this month, Mueller's office recommended a lenient sentence for Flynn, with the possibility of no prison time, stating that Flynn had provided \"substantial\" help to federal investigators about \"several ongoing investigations.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

    "text": "New York (CNN Business) The Senate Intelligence Committee is set to release two reports on Monday detailing the breadth of the Russian social media campaign to sow discord in the United States .\n\nThe reports, both of which were commissioned by the committee, are based on troves of data that Facebook, Twitter, and Google handed over to the committee about the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election and American politics generally. Much of the data has not previously been disclosed publicly.\n\nResearchers analyzed more than 10 million tweets, 116,000 Instagram posts, 61,000 Facebook posts and 1,000 videos posted by the Russian government-linked Internet Research Agency (IRA), the troll group indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller earlier this year.\n\nRecruiting 'assets'\n\nCNN obtained one of the reports in advance of its release. That report was prepared by New Knowledge, a firm that tracks disinformation online. New Knowledge found that the IRA's efforts went beyond the digital, as the group regularly tried to co-opt unsuspecting Americans to complete real-world tasks or hand over their personal information. CNN and other outlets have previously reported on some efforts like this, but others included in the New Knowledge report had not previously been made public.\n\nIn one instance, through its page \"Army of Jesus,\" which was targeting Christians, the group offered \"free counseling to people with sexual addiction,\" New Knowledge found.\n\nThe phony counseling service could have created an opportunity to blackmail or manipulate individuals who availed of it, the report notes.\n\n\"Recruiting an asset by exploiting a personal vulnerability -- usually a secret that would inspire shame or cause personal or financial harm if exposed -- is a timeless espionage practice,\" it says.\n\nNew Knowledge says that it is not known whether anyone took up the offer of counseling.\n\nCNN has previously reported that the IRA co-opted unsuspecting Americans to coordinate protests in the U.S., in one instance even paying a Florida man to build a cage to bring to an event advocating for the imprisonment of Hillary Clinton.\n\nA shift to Instagram\n\nAll of the major social media platforms were used as part of the campaign, the reports said. But New Knowledge found that in 2017, as investigators and reporters began unearthing the Russian social media campaign on the two platforms it used most, Facebook and Twitter, \"the IRA shifted much of its activity to Instagram.\"\n\nThe spread of disinformation on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has received less scrutiny than it has on other platforms.\n\n\"The most prolific IRA efforts on Facebook and Instagram specially targeted Black American communities and appear to have been focused on developing Black audiences and recruiting Black Americans as assets,\" the report notes.\n\nWikileaks and local news\n\nNew Knowledge found that the IRA ran a sustained effort to undermine trust in American mainstream media, while \"extolling the virtues of Wikileaks and Julian Assange.\"\n\nOn October 4th, 2016, the report notes, there were a small number of posts from IRA pages reinforcing Assange's \"reputation as a freedom fighter.\" Those were the group's first posts about Assange in about a month, according to the analysis. A few days later, on October 7th, Wikileaks released the hacked emails of John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman.\n\nThe emails had been hacked by the GRU, Russian military intelligence, according to an indictment from Special Counsel Robert Mueller earlier this year.\n\nNew Knowledge notes that, though it has no definitive proof for this, \"Given the GRU involvement in the DNC hack with Wikileaks, it is possible that the IRA was tasked with socializing Wikileaks to both Right and Left audiences.\"\n\nIn addition, the researchers found, there were 44 Twitter accounts posing as US-related news organizations that had amassed more than 600,000 followers. The report notes that many of the phony news organizations posed as local outlets and that the group could have based this strategy on studies that show Americans trust local media over national outlets.\n\nSupporting Trump, voter suppression\n\nThe report notes that the IRA was largely focused on supporting the candidacy of Donald Trump, and undermining Clinton's, including by amplifying support for Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein late in the election cycle.\n\nIn the days leading up to the general election, New Knowledge notes, the IRA began to \"deploy voter suppression tactics on the black community targeted accounts, while simultaneously fear-mongering on Right-targeted accounts about voter fraud and delivering ominous warnings that the election would be stolen and violence might be necessary.\"\n\nOn the morning of the election, one IRA account, @racist_paul, sent \"dozens of tweets harassing a variety of Jewish reporters and other (real) Twitter users with content about how Trump was 'warming up an oven' for them.\"\n\nSilicon Valley\n\nThe report is critical of social media companies' cooperation with the committee.\n\nAfter reviewing the data provided by the tech giants to the committee, New Knowledge concluded that the companies may have provided the \"bare minimum\" to meet the committee's requests.\n\nThe firm advised lawmakers that there are likely more Russian accounts that the social media companies failed to identify.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said the company did not have a comment on the report but pointed to steps the company has taken to combat disinformation since 2016.\n\nA Twitter spokesperson told CNN the company has made \"significant strides\" toward preventing the manipulation of its service.\n\n\"Our singular focus is to improve the health of the public conversation on our platform, and protecting the integrity of elections is an important aspect of that mission,\" the spokesperson said. \"We've made significant strides since 2016 to counter manipulation of our service, which includes our release of additional data in October related to previously disclosed activities to enable further independent academic research and investigation.\"\n\nIn a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said it is cooperating with officials investigating Russian activity around the 2016 election. \"We've provided thousands of ads and pieces of content to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for review and shared information with the public about what we found. Since then, we've made progress in helping prevent interference on our platforms during elections,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nSecond report"

    "authors": [

    ],
    "text": "New financial disclosures reported by Donald Trump show Ivanka Trump\u2019s name being scrubbed from shell companies related to online gambling. Sources with links to the intelligence community and separate sources with links to the White House say that these companies were designed to disguise Russian payments and money-laundering. They further point, these sources say, to the fact that the Kelhios botnet \u2013 which was used in Russia\u2019s hack on the American election \u2013 was run by a command and control server working from Trump Tower, with the full knowledge of Eric Trump.\n\nIvanka has been linked to eleven companies in the Trump financial disclosures. Her status has been put to \u201cInactive\u201d on several odd holding companies, including:\n\nand others. The most immediately interesting company of Ivanka Trump\u2019s is \u201cPoker Venture Managing Member Corp\u201c. This is owned by Donald and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka\u2019s company with her father itself is an officer of this very dodgy-looking shell, \u201cPoker Venture LLC.\u201d Judging by the corporation wiki, there is panic in Team Ivanka and Team Trump over \u201cPoker Venture\u201c. It shows zero \u201cKey People\u201d, and has two other almost identical companies as its officers \u2013 the live, active PVMMC that Ivanka co-owns with her pops, and this \u201cInactive\u201d attempt to clean Ivanka out of the picture: by: Poker Venture Managing Member Corp by: Donald J. Trump.\n\nThose touring \u201cCorporation Wiki\u201d will be surprised to see that \u201cPoker Venture Managing Member Corp by: Donald J Trump\u201d lists itself as an officer of inactive \u201cPoker Venture\u201d, yet when one clicks on the gray icon, one is taken to the same active company.\n\nAll very strange. Why are Ms. Trump\u2019s shell companies having a panic? What does it matter if she is directly connected to Trump International Hotel Management (which she is) through TIHM? Why is \u201cPoker Ventures\u201d suddenly showing as both active and inactive simultaneously?\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nSources with links to the intelligence community say that the disassociation with the TIHM is because Trump Hotels and Eric Trump are linked to the Kelhios botnet, which was run with a command and control server out of Trump Tower with the full knowledge of Eric and Donald Trump, and also of course, of Ivanka Trump, whose husband Jared was talking to the Russian Ambassador in the Russian Embassy about secret communications with Russia.\n\nPoker Venture Managing Member Corp is a Nevada company. On the Nevada Secretary of State\u2019s website, it shows an odd filing history. The company was formed in 2012, filed an annual listing in 2013 and 2014; no documents are listed for 2015, but two appear two years later, on August 4 2016. However, the official Nevada listing shows PVMMC being cancelled on May 22, 2017.\n\nEqually odd is that the state of New Jersey \u2013 (Ivanka Trump has a New Jersey address listed as one of her business records, associated with Poker Ventures) \u2013 has added to its newly published list of \u201cInternet Gaming Ancillary Companies\u201d both Poker Ventures LLC, which was already listed, but also \u201cNovacorp Net Ltd\u201d, \u201cVidMob Inc\u201d and \u201cReblaze Technologies\u201d. VidMob Inc, a video company, appears to have a Russian developer on its github, Sergey Shpuntov, whose activity appears to be locked on GitHub; Novacorp Net appears to be associated with a credit card company whose records have been scrubbed (but not well enough); while Reblaze Technologies appears to be coded by Russo-Israelis.\n\nMuch worse, Reblaze Technologies does not appear to have much to do with \u201cancillary services for internet gambling\u201d in NJ \u2013 rather, it publishes anti-NSA blogs such as these, lauding the \u2018hacking tools\u2019 leaked by Shadow Brokers. Reblaze also offers lists of \u201cprotect your website\u201d services you can buy from Russian hackers [sic], listing, ostensibly to protect against them, the full range of tools employed on Russia\u2019s hack of America; its founder repeated the anti-NSA blog in an article that reads as a threat to hack America on Medium in December 2016.\n\nDespite this, even the most secretive malware usually gets exposed eventually. A great example of this occurred in August: \u2018Powerful NSA hacking tools have been revealed online\u2019. As the article explained, \u201csome of the most powerful espionage tools created by the National Security Agency\u2019s elite group of hackers\u201d were stolen by illicit hackers and placed up for auction, for any cybercriminal in the world to buy.\n\nPut all of these together \u2013 Novacorp, VidMob and Reblaze, as brand new additions to New Jersey\u2019s \u201cancillary internet gambling companies\u201d and you see three Russian companies involved, sources allege, with the Kelhios botnet, the direct Russian hack on American voter registries and the DNC, and malware delivered via the Kelhios botnet, that are now trying to cover themselves by pretending to have something to do with \u201conline gambling\u201d. Sources suggest that all three directly relate to Ivanka Trump\u2019s \u201cPoker Ventures\u201d company with her father, which is listed on the same sheet. The state document says:\n\nThe following companies have filed completed applications to provide ancillary services for Internet gaming. Preliminary examination of the filings allows for these companies to enter into agreements with casino licensees and Internet gaming permit holders.\n\nIt is not therefore much of a leap to imagine \u2013 though sources were not specific on this point \u2013 that Novacorp, VidMob and Reblaze have been discovered to have been paid by a Trump company, and that their late additions to the New Jersey filing are an attempt to provide a figleaf over other \u201cservices\u201d that they did provide.\n\nOn the wider reason for the cover-up on Ivanka, sources suggested patribotics was being pointed to specific documents because Trump is threatening to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Patience for Trump\u2019s obstruction is wearing thin, sources with links to the intelligence community report. They also suggest that Paul Ryan, who is more realistic towards his own predicament than Mr. Trump, is willing to cooperate with authorities in exchange for mitigation of his own sentence. If Ryan gives up McConnell, and does not impede Mueller or the FBI further, it is possible he may avoid jail, although like Devin Nunes he will be required to resign from Congress. Ryan spoke in defense of Special Counsel Mueller, showing that Trump can no longer rely on Russian kompromat on Ryan to protect him.\n\nIf whistleblowers wish to contact patribotics they are encouraged to get in touch on Twitter or via the contact form elsewhere on this site.\n\nRead More of our ground-breaking Trump Russia journalism here:"

    "text": "Patribotics hopes to expand our reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, make a contribution here.\n\nSeveral separate sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one nation, and with links within the US state and federal justice systems, have outlined evidence that exists against multiple men in the line of succession to the US Presidency, as it relates to Russia\u2019s hack on America. I can also exclusively report a RICO case is being considered against the Republican party for laundering Russian money.\n\nThese sources say that Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who was the \u2018Designated Survivor\u2019 at the inauguration of Donald Trump (yes, really) is likely to become President if charges are pursued, according to the evidence, of illegal collusion with Russia, money laundering, and obstruction of justice.\n\nOn Donald Trump there is voluminous evidence he knowingly colluded with the Russian state in the hacking of the U.S election, and laundered Russian money through shell companies. This evidence is both data-based, for example, based on the way the server he registered laundered stolen voter registration databases with the DNC\u2019s Vertica database in order to target Russian propaganda at voters.\n\nHe has additionally both directly obstructed justice and conspired with others to do so. Rather than repeat previous reporting in this piece I will devote a separate article to the case against Mr. Trump.\n\nOn Mike Pence, there is evidence that he obstructed justice, conspired to obstruct justice, and knew that General Mike Flynn was co-ordinating Russia\u2019s propaganda message on behalf of a foreign power. Pence also violated the Logan Act and obstructed justice when he conspired with Donald Trump to order General Flynn illegally to discuss the removal of sanctions while Barack Obama was still President, and that Pence, Trump and Flynn did so to undermine the action a sitting President was taking against a foreign adversary, as President Obama was expelling Russian spies. I do not mean in this list to exclude evidence of Pence\u2019s espionage, sedition and money-laundering offenses which may have happened during the campaign; it is rather that sources have been more explicit as to Pence\u2019s constitutional and legal violations around President Obama\u2019s actions against Russia, conspiring with Trump to undermine the President of the United States in his action against a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, normally third in the line of succession, I can report as fact that sources say that Ryan has been legally intercepted, and is on tape, admitting that he knew Russian money was being laundered into the Republican party. Without co-operation pending resignation Ryan may find himself swept up into a RICO prosecution involving the apparatus of the Republican party who accepted laundered Russian money.\n\nThis report is a clarification of what I have previously said I had heard on Twitter; namely that Ryan himself was taped at the Republican convention talking to Sergei Kislyak accepting Russian money into the campaign. Following the unconstitutional dismissal of patriot FBI Director Comey by Sessions and Trump, sources have become more forthcoming. It was, they say, Reince Priebus who was taped talking to Sergei Kislyak and other Russians at the convention, agreeing to accept laundered or disgused Russian contributions, and Speaker Ryan is on a later intercept admitting that he knew of this plot, which places him at risk of a large number of criminal charges. A RICO case is being examined against the GOP itself, sources say.\n\nThe fourth person in the line of succession is Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, as President pro-tem of the Senate. Sources with links to the intelligence community say they do not know of any collusion by Hatch in either money-laundering or in accepting Russian intelligence; this does not mean, they warn, that such evidence does not exist.\n\nSome readers have expressed dismay that President Trump may use his powers of pardon to escape justice by pardoning his own confederates in their crimes. Several, separate sources with links to both the intelligence and justice communities note that any person or candidate who accepted laundered donations through banks with branches in Wall Street (even if they are from, say, Wisconsin) is liable to charges from New York\u2019s state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Further, it is understood that the FBI and Federal Prosecutors are working on multiple sets of charges both carefully and individually. Were Mr. Trump to pardon General Flynn for violating the Logan Act, as one example, Flynn would have to accept he committed the crime and Trump would thereby admit his own guilt, leading to impeachment. Prosecutors might then bring separate, subsequent cases against Flynn for RICO, violations of FARA, lying to the FBI, lying on his SF-86, and so forth. At the same time, state courts, where Trump has no powers of pardon, would proceed against Flynn on money laundering crimes, and obstruction of justice charges against Trump might be laid out by Federal prosecutors before the Senate. Violation of the Logan Act is one charge against Flynn which applies to both Trump and Pence, and some lawyers read the power of Presidential pardon as not to apply to cases involving a President\u2019s own impeachment.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Whistleblowing\n\nFollowing the unconstitutional firing of FBI Director James Comey, I am reporting, in the summary above, on at least some of the evidence that, sources say, exists on several men in the line of succession. This brief report is designed to allow whistleblowing staffers on Capitol Hill, and others, to discuss these matter, relying on a previously published report. Normally, perhaps, blogs would not give sufficient cover, but as Press Secretary Sean Spicer has spent several minutes reading my work aloud from the White House press podium, in order falsely to characterize it, the White House can now hardly object if whistleblowers decide to cite patribotics now.\n\nFor these reasons, there will be a separate report summarizing some of the evidence that, sources say, exists on figures within the Trump campaign and the Trump administration who are not part of the Presidential line of succession later, as well as a third detailing some of the offenses sources say Donald Trump has himself committed.\n\nIf whistleblowers wish to contact patribotics they are encouraged to get in touch on Twitter or via the contact form elsewhere on this site."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Twelve days after a young Russian gun-rights activist gained access to some of America\u2019s most prominent conservatives, at an elegant dinner near the Capitol, a Republican operative was eager to keep the momentum going.\n\nIn a February 2017 email, the operative, Paul Erickson, proposed another \u201cU.S./Russia friendship\u201d dinner. He noted that the activist, Maria Butina, who now is accused of being a covert Russian agent, was making an \u201cever-expanding circle of influential friends.\u201d\n\nMs. Butina, he wrote in the email, had just met Susan Eisenhower, the granddaughter of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, during a visit to Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania. The Russian woman had also gotten to know the ex-wife of a supermarket heir, who had endowed an institute dedicated to furthering American-Russian relations, and the \u201csilky smooth\u201d former Russian diplomat who ran it.\n\nThen there was the recipient of the email, George O\u2019Neill Jr., a Rockefeller relative and conservative writer. He was helping pay Ms. Butina\u2019s bills, said a person familiar with their relationship, and hoped to make her the centerpiece of his own project to improve America\u2019s ties to Russia."

    "text": "The Ron Paul \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f (revolution)\n\n\u201cThe current atmosphere in the US is that we\u2019re having a love affair with Russia, that the Cold War is over,\u201d agreed Eugene Poteat, a retired senior CIA operative who served from 1960-1990. \u201cBut there are more Russian spies here now than during the Cold War.\u201d From the New York Post\n\nThe Patriot Deception, my ongoing investigation into Russian Active Measures (Russian: \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u044f) against the U.S. Liberty and Patriot movements, has led me to some interesting characters. From treasonous former U.S. government officials who now openly support Russia\u2019s agenda toward the U.S., to Tea Party and Oath Keepers organizations that are unwittingly being deceived by their choices in news sources, they all have one element in common: They are all classic examples of Russian Active Measures that have been perpetrated against the west since the 1960s.\n\nActive Measures are a combination of Influence Operations and Propaganda designed, not for espionage purposes, but for the purpose of altering public and political opinions in the target nation. In this case, the United States is the targeted nation but, with MI5, the UK\u2019s domestic security service, warning that espionage activity within the UK remains at Cold War levels, we know that the U.S. is not the only target of these operations.\n\nThe Patriot Deception synopsis is as follows. Russia, in an attempt to alter the opinions of U.S. citizens and politicians, creates news items, or alters existing news items to add a pro-Russian slant, and then feeds them to alternative media outlets. Of course, InfoWars is among those outlets, as are numerous other alternative media websites, which then further alter the \u201cnews\u201d to promote it to their audience \u2013 the Liberty and Patriot movements. In the end, the final recipients of this \u201cnews\u201d may be completely unaware that the information originated from a Russian propaganda machine, the major offenders being RT.com (formerly Russia Today), Pravda, Sputniknews, and riafan.com. The item is typically copied and shared on so many websites that its origins cannot be determined with a simple glance. You may find the item on Zero Hedge which lists InfoWars as the source and then find InfoWars lists RT.com as the source, and round and round until you have no idea who created the item. To learn more about this process, read the previous articles in the Patriot Deception series, starting with the Introduction HERE.\n\nRon Paul entered the equation early on in my research. Since he is such a popular figure, in effect, the poster-child for the liberty movement, I wanted to continue my research in order to present a clear picture of his involvement. The research is ongoing but it is sufficient to present the basics of how Russia is using Paul as part of their Active Measures.\n\nWho is Ron Paul?\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1935, this son of Pennsylvania dairy farmers graduated from Duke University with a degree in medicine. He served as a military physician in the U.S. Air Force, and then the Air National Guard, during the 1960s. He entered politics in the 1970s and served in various elected positions, losing the occasional election and returning to his private gynecology practice. He served as a Republican but later ran for President as a Libertarian, knowing he would not be able to win the support of the Republican Party. Also in the 1970s, Paul began writing about the gold market and his personal economic theories. All in all, his story is an excellent example of the American dream. Humble beginnings, hard work, devout study, and eventual success.\n\nAnd he has a love affair with Russian thuggery.\n\nI will assume many of those reading this were children during the Cold War, or perhaps weren\u2019t born until after the fall of our old rivals the Soviet Union. This fact, coupled with the explosion of alternative media outlets in the last ten years, accounts for much of the success attributed to Russian Active Measures. People simply weren\u2019t aware of what the Soviets, and now the Russian federation, have been doing. They grew up in a period after the Cold War and have been told, mostly by Russia, that Russia is now a \u201cfriend\u201d of the United States. For the people of Russia, this may, or may not, be true. For the government of Russia, this has never been true. The United States, according to Russian intelligence documents, remains the \u201cmain target\u201d of Russian intelligence. Russia is not content to simply steal our secrets, which they do fairly easily because of the new public perception. Russia seeks to alter our politics, change the opinions or our citizenry, and reshape the west into an environment that will not hinder Russia\u2019s agenda.\n\nFor an official report on Russian Active Measures, written by the U.S. State Department as the Cold War drew to a close, click HERE. It is a blueprint still followed by the old KGB-hands who now run the Kremlin. To learn about some modern forms of this, I recommend reading Deception, by Edward Lucas.\n\nEnter Daniel McAdams\n\nDuring the last decade of Ron Paul\u2019s political career, he brought on a foreign affairs adviser named Daniel McAdams. McAdams is also the executive director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, an organization that promotes non-interventionist philosophies for U.S. governmental affairs. Daniel McAdams works for the Russians. His self-written bio on the Voices of Liberty website states:\n\nDaniel McAdams is Executive Director at the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, a non-profit policy institute founded in 2013 by Dr. Paul. The Institute focuses on publishing and education to promote Dr. Paul\u2019s philosophy of non-interventionism abroad and defense of civil liberties at home. Previously, McAdams served as US Representative Ron Paul\u2019s adviser for foreign affairs, defense, intelligence, and civil liberties from 2001 until Dr. Paul\u2019s retirement from Congress at the end of 2012. From 1993-1999 he worked as a journalist based in Budapest, Hungary, including as editorial page editor at the Budapest Sun. He also served with the British Helsinki Human Rights Group while based in Europe, monitoring human rights and elections in various contentious states, including Albania, Montenegro, Georgia, Armenia, Belarus, Croatia, and Slovakia. He was a Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellow (1998-2000) and an American Swiss Foundation \u201cYoung Leader\u201d (2006). He holds a BA in English from the University of California at Berkeley and completed studies for a Master\u2019s in international relations at San Francisco State University.\n\nThe British Helsinki Human Rights Group, with which McAdams is so proud to have worked, is barely a blip on the political radar today but, during its prime in the 1990s, was well-known as a pro-Russian, anti-west organization. The organization supported such liberty-minded leaders as Slobodan Milosevic, Robert Mugabe, and Viktor Yanukovich. The BHHRG was well-known to be nothing more than an arm of Russia\u2019s propaganda war as it promoted Russian foreign policy.\n\nStrangely enough, there is no mention of McAdams\u2019 work for Russia Today, now known as RT, RT International, and RT America. A collection of his pieces for RT can be found on the RT website HERE. In them, you will find his full range of pro-Russian, anti-U.S. and NATO opinions. He is also frequently interviewed by Russian media as an \u201cexpert\u201d on civil liberties and the \u201cimperialistic\u201d United States. Ron Paul himself, the de facto leader of the U.S. Liberty movement, appears on RT regularly during interviews as well as writing articles for their websites. In fact, Ron Paul appears so frequently on RT that you would think he was still an elected official.\n\nNow, for those who remember the Cold War, and, in particular, those who were in government service or the military at the time, can you imagine the outrage if a sitting Congressman\u2019s adviser on foreign affairs worked for the Russian government? In 1984, can you imagine what would have happened in the press and in the houses of government if a policy adviser was found to have ties to the Soviet Union? But, in an odd case of amnesia, fast forward just a few years and that is exactly what happened. Daniel McAdams may not have been on the payroll of the FSB or the SVR but he was, without question, an agent for the Kremlin. He is the quintessential \u201cagent of influence\u201d used so often by the Russian intelligence services \u2013 people in positions of sufficient authority to alter or redirect the policies of the target nation. When you sit at the right hand of a congressman and have his ear, and are openly advocating the policies of the enemy, you are the very definition of an agent of influence. For Paul and McAdams, non-interventionist doesn\u2019t simply mean \u201cLet\u2019s stay out of it.\u201d It means \u201cWe support the other side and will openly speak out against the United States.\u201d Ron Paul\u2019s hand-picked group of pro-Russian advisers doesn\u2019t stop with McAdams. Several board members for the Ron Paul Institute have connections to Russia and pro-Russian NGOs. McAdams is simply the most active and most verbal of the group.\n\nWhy does the Kremlin love Ron Paul?\n\nBecause Ron Paul has done more to promote the Russian agenda than he has to improve the political situation in his own country. Russian media parrots Paul in his angry rants against NSA surveillance and the erosion of civil liberties. Fomenting dissent among the population of the target nation is the purpose of Active Measures. It is a major victory for Russia when an admired American politician does the work for them. Paul\u2019s pro-Russia stance and seemingly inexhaustible desire to have his ego stroked by Russian media belies the fact that Russia is the definition of a surveillance state, possessing no truly free media and a history of danger to journalists who attempt to report the truth. Paul will gladly sit with an interviewer on RT and describe the U.S. as a dictatorship, an imperialistic regime, and an insult to our founding fathers. He does so from the pulpit of a nation well-known for killing those who disagree with the Kremlin and attempt to expose its own dirty laundry.\n\nBetween agents of influence in our own government and willing traitors like Edward Snowden, Russia is enjoying greater success today than they ever enjoyed during the Cold War. Our own citizens and representatives, blinded by a false declaration of friendship and enticed by stardom and wealth from Russia\u2019s deep pockets is, in my opinion, the greatest success in the history of Active Measures.\n\nRon Paul, the godfather of the patriot movement, is no prophet. He is a puppet. And thousands of acolytes line up to lick his boots, and fill his coffers, completely unaware that the man behind the curtain is an old, determined, and creative enemy. The Ron Paul revolution is The Patriot Deception defined.\n\nTrue patriotism does not involve siding with the enemies of your nation. Patriotism means putting your energy to work repairing those things you find wrong in your own society. There is much to do if we are to bring the United States back to its previous stature. Our communities are falling apart. Divisions in our country are worse than they have been in decades. Violence is rampant in much of our nation. Russia does not have an answer to our problems. In fact, discord, violence, and division are exactly what the Kremlin wants here. Reject those who claim to be working for the good of the patriots by promoting Russia\u2019s agenda. WE are the beacon of freedom and liberty to the world. Today, Russia understands that better than our own citizens. And they want that beacon extinguished.\n\nRoss Elder"

    "text": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\nMy question for Congressjerk Eric Swalwell is pretty simple: \u201cHow many Americans would you murder to achieve your goal of disarming us?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fair question.\n\nSwalwell is the MSNBC stalwart who recently wrote an op-ed advocating that the government confiscate the guns that make people like him wet themselves and imprison those of us who decline to surrender them. Millions of Americans own these basic tools of freedom, which the ignorant call \u201cassault weapons,\u201d and these loyal citizens keep and bear them to protect themselves, their families, their communities and their Constitution. But Rep. Swalwell would make these citizens felons, though these patriots are only a threat to criminals and aspiring tyrants.\n\nOf course, he wants to make these patriots felons because they are a threat to criminals and aspiring tyrants. After all, that\u2019s what leftist Democrats like him are.\n\nNow, we know that some Americans would resist this kind of tyranny. People all over the world are resisting the elite\u2019s commands. The Brits Brexited. The French are rioting because they don\u2019t want to sacrifice their livelihoods on behalf of the global elites\u2019 weird weather religion. And a decree that the Second Amendment is not a thing anymore would certainly provoke some serious pushback here.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s fair to ask Rep. Bloodlust how much blood he\u2019s prepared to shed to achieve his goal of disarming Normal Americans.\n\nRep. Swalwell, some people are going to fight rather than cave in, so what\u2019s the number of bodies you would be willing to pile up to win? Let\u2019s put aside the right or wrong of resistance; it\u2019ll be a thing. It\u2019ll happen. You\u2019re from near San Francisco, so you don\u2019t know any real Americans, but even though I am from that hellhole too, I\u2019ve met a few Americans in my travels. They are an ornery people who don\u2019t give in to the kind of bullying you advocate. So, you\u2019re going to have to kill some people to do what you want, and I just want to know how many you\u2019re prepared to off to achieve your goal.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s not as if you Democrats don\u2019t already have a history of killing people for having guns you disapprove of.\n\nRemember Waco? The raid on David Koresh\u2019s compound was because his weird band of misfits allegedly had scary, outlawed guns. That\u2019s why Democrat Janet Reno initially decided to send in the troops. The government got four of our ATF agents killed, then slaughtered the resisters, including women and kids.\n\nWas it worth it? Maybe these creepy cultists were violating the law, but was making sure they didn\u2019t have guns that were scary worth shooting or burning alive about 80 people, including four cops?\n\nWas it?\n\nSo, in light of his party\u2019s track record, I want to know how many people Rep. Swalwell \u2013 who fancies himself a potent Democrat presidential contender \u2013 is prepared to see die so he can ensure Americans are disarmed in order to please the liberal Californians he represents. How many?\n\nOne?\n\nOne hundred?\n\nOne thousand?\n\nOne hundred thousand?\n\nMore?\n\nHow many corpses would Eric Swalwell and his blue state buddies accept because they don\u2019t think some law-abiding citizen in Oklahoma should be allowed to choose what kind of weapon he has, because they think they should choose for him, and that that choice should be \u201cNone?\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, which is a wonderful thing because it makes people truly reveal themselves, one gentleman pointed out the not-so-far-fetched notion that mass gun confiscation (let\u2019s leave the problematic logistics for the gun-hating fascists aside) would spark a civil war. But Rep. Swalwell was not worried; he observed that a bunch of citizens with rifles could not stand up to a military armed with nuclear weapons.\n\nWell, that\u2019s a troubling notion.\n\nNow, Congressman Strangelove properly took a lot of grief for suggesting nuking fellow Americans, but even if you accept his backtracking about how this was a joke \u2013 nothing\u2019s funnier than suggesting the mass murder of fellow Americans! \u2013 he only put nukes off limits. What killing systems are still on the table? Infantry? Artillery? Bombers? Because his answer assumed that he would support prosecuting a war against those who failed to obey and submit to arrest.\n\nSo, Congressman, what means of destructions are still on the table to use against fellow Americans who refuse to allow you to strip them of their Second Amendment rights because you Bay Area liberals want to show those hicks in Jesusland who\u2019s boss? Is shooting them okay? Shelling them? Bombing them, just not with nukes?\n\nHaving seen the fruits of oppression overseas, I find this troubling. Actually, that\u2019s putting it lightly. I find it horrifying. I\u2019ve written about it in my novels about how our country could be ripped apart by leftist oppression. My just-released book Wildfire paints a most unpretty picture, but my predictions keep coming true. Try as I might, nothing I write speculating about what they would do if given the chance seems to hold a candle to what people like Congressman Stalin tell us they are actually willing to do to crush us under their Gucci loafers.\n\nUnderstand that the leftists with Swalwell\u2019s mentality are not driven by notions of justice or reason, but by cold hatred for Normal Americans. We\u2019ve been disobedient. We\u2019ve been defiant. We\u2019ve refused to surrender our means of defending our own sovereignty to our elite overlords, and that is intolerable.\n\nAfter all, a man without a rifle is not a citizen. He\u2019s a serf, subject to the whims and will of his overlords who you damn well know are never giving up the guns their minions keep and bear.\n\nLook at England. They gave up their guns. Now, the police watch their Twitter feeds and arrest them if they say unapproved things. That\u2019s not a bug to our liberal elite; that\u2019s a feature. That\u2019s the goal.\n\nWait, this is crazy talk! If we disarm and only a government controlled by the liberal elite has guns, our overlords will be totally cool. They\u2019ll respect our right to say and do what we want. They\u2019ll allow us to practice our religion as we please. You know, just like liberals respect the rights of normal people where they are in control, like on college campuses, or on social media, or in the municipalities that hassle Christian cake shops.\n\nGet woke. They hate you, and your freedom to tell them to pound sand sticks in their collective collectivist craw. Ignore the leftist media and the Fredocon collaborators who demand you not believe your lying eyes or ears when they tell you what they intend to do to you if given the chance.\n\nSo, the question remains. Our liberal elite betters think we should be stripped of those scary bangsticks the Constitution protects, and we disagree. So, Rep. Swalwell, how many Americans are you willing to kill to fulfill your vision of a disarmed, defenseless, servile population of docile subjects?\n\nOne?\n\nOne hundred?\n\nOne thousand?\n\nOne hundred thousand?\n\nMore?\n\nMy third novel about America after it splits into two countries, one red and one blue, just dropped. Check out Wildfire and see what could happen if we fail to defend our freedom in the face of people who want to make us Venezuela del Norte."

But a senior administration official, who spoke privately and was not authorized to discuss the talks, said there was reluctance to move Lighthizer into the role because he is integral to negotiations with China over trade.\n\nSources said Ayers would work with the super PAC set up to assist the president\u2019s reelection campaign. News that Ayers would not take the chief of staff job was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump had previously spoken with Ayers about the top administration job and had settled on him as Kelly\u2019s likely replacement, the president\u2019s advisers said.\n\nBut Ayers, who has young children, had insisted on serving temporarily, which frustrated Trump, who had wanted a replacement to stay on through 2020.\n\nAyers was also skeptical of taking the job based on the challenges that Kelly and his predecessor, Reince Priebus, faced in the position, and talks between the two sides broke down, according to an administration official with direct knowledge of the negotiations.\n\nAyers, 36, also had faced opposition among many senior White House aides, who worried that his elevation could trigger departures of other high-level staff members.\n\nAfter initially agreeing that Kelly would announce his departure on Monday, Trump abruptly shifted course and announced Saturday that Kelly would leave the White House by the end of the year. The position might be filled on an interim basis, he added then.\n\nThat announcement closed out Kelly\u2019s rocky tenure and ushered in a second straight messy chief-of-staff handover for the president, for whom the next pick will be the third to take on the daunting job in less than three years. Last year, Trump took to Twitter to announce Priebus\u2019s departure and Kelly\u2019s arrival while aboard Air Force One, his outgoing top administrator having just left the plane.\n\nWith House Republicans poised to return to the minority in the next Congress following their party\u2019s midterm defeat, Meadows could find the chief of staff position an appealing one. His rise to the job would signal anew that Trump\u2019s response to the November drubbing is to move further to the right, rather than toward negotiations with the ascendant Democrats.\n\nAnother senior administration official said that Mulvaney and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have both expressed internally that they aren\u2019t seeking the job but could change their minds if Trump pleads with them.\n\nKelly, a four-star general who previously served as homeland security secretary, has been lauded by current and former aides who say he brought order to the West Wing. But he has at times clashed with Trump, who openly voiced his frustration with Kelly for months.\n\nKelly struggled to corral the various factions in the White House, including members of Trump\u2019s family, and was criticized by the president as lacking political skills \u2014 an increasing concern heading into the president\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nAyers, a longtime operative who was previously the executive director of the Republican Governors Association, had been viewed as a candidate well positioned to fill that gap, even as he had alienated some members of the staff.\n\nAs news broke Sunday night that Ayers would not take the position, prompting renewed attention on the tumult in the White House, Trump made no mention of his chief-of-staff search and instead sought to shift the focus to his administration\u2019s successes.\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration has accomplished more than any other U.S. Administration in its first two (not even) years of existence, & we are having a great time doing it!\u201d he said in a tweet. He offered no specifics.\n\nHe followed up with a swipe at his favorite target, the \u201cFake News Media,\u201d which he said has \u201cgone totally out of its mind-truly the Enemy of the People!\u201d\n\nPence, meanwhile, wished Ayers well and said in a tweet that he would \u201calways be grateful for his friendship, dedication to the @VP team and his efforts to advance the @POTUS agenda.\u201d\n\nHe also thanked Kelly, who he said had served the administration \u201cwith great distinction.\u201d"

    "text": "Shots fired.\n\nSince Barack Obama moved into the White House, the Democratic Party has lost 870 state and federal offices. They\u2019ve lost control of the Senate, the House, and will soon forfeit the Oval Office.\n\nRepublicans, by contrast, lay claim to 32 state legislatures and 33 governor\u2019s mansions \u2014 including those in the deep blue states of Vermont and Massachusetts. In 25 states, the GOP has full control of state government; for Democrats, that number is six.\n\nSo when Harry Reid said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the Democratic Party is in that big of trouble\u201d earlier this month, some progressives went (justifiability) apoplectic.\n\nBut this week, Reid made it clear that he was speaking primarily about his party\u2019s prospects on the presidential level. And there, his optimism isn\u2019t entirely misplaced. This November, the Democrats became the first party in American history to win the popular vote in six presidential elections out of seven. And they came within 80,000 votes of winning the Electoral College, in a year when both the Kremlin and the FBI took unprecedented actions that damaged the party\u2019s standard-bearer.\n\nWhen assessing the Democratic Party\u2019s condition in the states, however, Reid is appropriately scathing.\n\n\u201cI believe one of the failures of Democratic Party has been the Democratic National Committee, the DNC, has been worthless,\u201d Reid told Nevada Public Radio in an interview published Wednesday. \u201cThey do nothing to help state parties. That should be the main goal they have. I developed everything in Nevada on my own. Their help was relatively meaningless.\u201d\n\nReid continued:\n\nSo, I would hope that they would choose a chair of the Democratic Party who is a full-time person. Not someone like we had with that congresswoman from Florida, who was a full-time congresswoman and a part time chair of the DNC.\n\n\n\nWe need a full time DNC chair and what they should do \u2013 they can take my model if they want \u2013 it\u2019s not rocket science. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of brain power to figure out what needs to be done. They should take a few states every election cycle, maybe three maybe four, and help them develop the infrastructure for good state party organization.\n\nReid has standing to offer criticism this vituperative. The man has tended his own garden. On November 8, the Nevada gave its Electoral College votes to Hillary Clinton, its open Senate seat to Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, and both houses of its legislature to Democratic majorities.\n\nCongressman Keith Ellison and outgoing Labor Secretary Thomas Perez are among the leading candidates to become the next DNC chair. If elected, Ellison has vowed to resign his House seat and devote his full energies to the committee."

    "text": "There\u2019s no strategist pulling the strings, and no collection of burn-it-all-down aides egging him on. At the heart of the rage against Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party, the campaign aides closest to him say, is Bernie Sanders.\n\nIt was the Vermont senator who personally rewrote his campaign manager\u2019s shorter statement after the chaos at the Nevada state party convention and blamed the political establishment for inciting the violence.\n\nHe was the one who made the choice to go after Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after his wife read him a transcript of her blasting him on television.\n\nHe chose the knife fight over calling Clinton unqualified, which aides blame for pulling the bottom out of any hopes they had of winning in New York and their last real chance of turning a losing primary run around.\n\nAnd when Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s producers asked Sanders\u2019 campaign for a question to ask Donald Trump, Sanders himself wrote the one challenging the Republican nominee to a debate.\n\nThere are many divisions within the Sanders campaign \u2014 between the dead-enders and the work-it-out crowds, between the younger aides who think he got off message while the consultants got rich and obsessed with Beltway-style superdelegate math, and between the more experienced staffers who think the kids got way too high on their sense of the difference between a movement and an actual campaign.\n\nBut more than any of them, Sanders is himself filled with resentment, on edge, feeling like he gets no respect \u2014 all while holding on in his head to the enticing but remote chance that Clinton may be indicted before the convention.\n\nCampaign manager Jeff Weaver, who\u2019s been enjoying himself in near constant TV appearances, and the candidate\u2019s wife Jane Sanders, are fully on board. But convinced since his surprise Michigan win that he could actually win the nomination, Sanders has been on email and the phone, directing elements of the campaign right down to his city-by-city schedule in California. He wants it. He thinks it should be his.\n\n\u201cBernie\u2019s been at the helm of this campaign from the beginning,\u201d said Weaver, \u201cand the overall message of this campaign and the direction of the campaign and the strategy, has been driven by Bernie.\u201d\n\nConvinced as Sanders is that he\u2019s realizing his lifelong dream of being the catalyst for remaking American politics \u2014 aides say he takes credit for a Harvard Kennedy School study in April showing young people getting more liberal, and he takes personal offense every time Clinton just dismisses the possibility of picking him as her running mate \u2014 his guiding principle under attack has basically boiled down to a feeling that multiple aides sum up as: \u201cScrew me? No, screw you.\u201d\n\nTake the combative statement after the Nevada showdown.\n\n\"We are now actively destroying what Bernie worked so hard to build over the last year just to pick up two fucking delegates in a state he lost\u201d \u2014 Mike Casca\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who advised him that this was the right route to take, but we are now actively destroying what Bernie worked so hard to build over the last year just to pick up two fucking delegates in a state he lost,\u201d rapid response director Mike Casca complained to Weaver in an internal campaign email obtained by POLITICO.\n\n\u201cThank you for your views. I\u2019ll relay them to the senator, as he is driving this train,\u201d Weaver wrote back.\n\nIn the run-up to the California primary, the big strategic question was how much to modulate the tone of the letter to superdelegates that he's been preparing to send out Wednesday, building on the case that Sen. Jeff Merkley, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Sen. Paul Kirk and former Communication Workers of America president Larry Cohen have been making to fellow superdelegates over the phone for weeks about polls and other factors that would make Sanders the more competitive general election candidate.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about what\u2019s good for the Democratic Party in his mind, but about what he thinks is good for advancing the agenda that he\u2019s been pushing since before he got elected mayor of Burlington.\n\nSanders owns nearly every major decision, right down to the bills. A conversation with former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin about getting left in personal debt from his own 1992 presidential campaign has stayed at the top of Sanders\u2019 mind.\n\nHe demanded that the campaign bank account never go under $10 million, even when that\u2019s meant decisions Weaver and campaign architect Tad Devine have protested \u2014 like making the call in the final days before Kentucky to go with digital director Kenneth Pennington\u2019s plan to focus on data and field, instead of $300,000 to match Clinton on TV.\n\nSanders ultimately lost there by just 1,924 votes.\n\nSanders and aides laugh at the idea that he\u2019s damaging the party and hurting Clinton. They think they don\u2019t get enough gratitude for how much they held back, from not targeting more Democratic members of the House and Senate who opposed him to not making more of an issue out of Clinton\u2019s email server investigation and Bill Clinton\u2019s sex scandals, all of which they discussed as possible lines of attack in the fall. They blame Clinton going after him on gun control for goading him into letting loose on her Goldman Sachs speeches.\n\n\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t started at it by really going hard at him on guns, raising a series of issues against him, that really was what led to him being much, much more aggressive than he otherwise would have been,\u201d said Devine, the consultant who helped engineer Sanders\u2019 plans for a protest candidacy into a real campaign (and convinced him to run as a Democrat).\n\nSince he finished approving the ads for California not long after the Kentucky strategy spat, Devine has been back home in Rhode Island, noticeably missing from cable news as a surrogate but still regularly in touch with Sanders. Devine, who\u2019s been more anxious about what an endgame looks like, says he hasn\u2019t heard anything from the senator that suggests he would alter his plans because of the Clinton campaign\u2019s eagerness to have President Barack Obama endorse her and declare the primaries done.\n\n\u201cThey would be very smart to understand that the best way to approach Bernie is not to try to push him around,\u201d Devine said. \u201cIt\u2019s much better if they try to cooperate with him and find common ground. They should be mindful of the fact that the people he\u2019s brought into this process are new to it and they will be very suspicious of any effort to push him around.\u201d\n\nAides say Sanders thinks that progressives who picked Clinton are cynical, power-chasing chickens \u2014 like Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of his most consistent allies in the Senate before endorsing Clinton and campaigning hard for her ahead of the Ohio primary. Sanders is so bitter about it that he\u2019d be ready to nix Brown as an acceptable VP choice, if Clinton ever asked his advice on who\u2019d be a good progressive champion.\n\n* * *\n\nEvery time Sanders got into a knife fight, aides say, they ended up losing. But they could never stop Sanders when he got his back up.\n\nComing off walloping Clinton in the Wisconsin primary in April, the first internal numbers from campaign pollster Ben Tulchin showed Sanders within range in New York\u2019s pivotal contest two weeks later. Though some senior aides say they realize now the dynamics of the state and the closed primary meant they never really had a shot, they also blame coverage of his New York Daily News interview and the blowup over calling Clinton \u201cnot qualified\u201d for taking New York off the table.\n\nLosing Pennsylvania the following week was another body blow, one of four losses in five states that night.\n\nIn the days following, before Sanders scored his win in Indiana that campaign aides feel no one acknowledged because it came the same night Trump locked up the Republican nomination, the calls started coming in from Democratic power brokers.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s call was part advice, part asking a favor, urging Sanders to use his now massive email list to help Democratic Senate candidates. Russ Feingold in Wisconsin was the most obvious prospect, and Reid wanted to make introductions to Iowa\u2019s Patty Judge and North Carolina\u2019s Deborah Ross \u2014 to help Democrats win the majority, but also to give Sanders allies in making himself the leader of the Senate progressives come next year.\n\nReid, according to people familiar with the conversation, ended the discussion thinking Sanders was on board. He backed Feingold. But that\u2019s the last anyone heard.\n\nWord got back to Reid\u2019s team that Weaver had nixed the idea, ruling out backing anyone who hadn\u2019t endorsed Sanders. Weaver says it\u2019s because the Senate hopefuls had to get in line for Sanders\u2019 support behind top backers like Gabbard and Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.) \u2014 though neither has a competitive race this year.\n\nSanders never followed up himself.\n\nJust before they all figured they\u2019d see each other at the White House Correspondents Dinner, a call from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta came in to Devine, who\u2019s seen by most in the Clinton camp as the only senior aide to Sanders whom Clinton\u2019s staff feels is actually open to a conversation, though Weaver and Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook have checked in with each other occasionally as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to talk,\u201d Podesta said, though, \u201cI don\u2019t have a peace pipe or anything.\u201d\n\nDevine brought the idea to Sanders.\n\n\u201cDo you trust him?\u201d Sanders said, people familiar with the conversation said.\n\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Devine said.\n\n\u201cYou think we should talk to him?\u201d Sanders asked.\n\n\u201cI think we should try to win California, and then we\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d Devine said.\n\nReaching out to the Trump campaign was a different story. Devine knows campaign chairman Paul Manafort from, among other things, their collaboration on the campaign of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. According to campaign aides, the morning after Trump was on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Weaver asked Devine to give Manafort a call to see if they could actually make the debate happen. They were already fielding offers from most of the networks \u2014 including a producer for Stephen Colbert, who wanted to host the debate on his own late night show.\n\nManafort laughed, said it was a joke, but then again, Trump was on his plane, and he had no idea what the candidate would do. The answer turned out to be a statement killing the speculation. Manafort left a voicemail for Devine saying he\u2019d won over Trump. Devine never called him back.\n\n* * *\n\nTop Sanders aides admit that it\u2019s been weeks, if not months, since they themselves realized he wasn\u2019t going to win, and they\u2019ve been operating with a Trump\u2019s-got-no-real-shot safety net. They debate whether Sanders\u2019 role in the fall should be a full vote-for-Clinton campaign, or whether he should just campaign hard against Trump without signing up to do much for her directly.\n\nThey haven\u2019t been able to get Sanders focused on any of that, or on the real questions about what kind of long term organization to build out of his email list. They know they\u2019ll have their own rally in Philadelphia \u2014 outside the the convention hall \u2014 but that\u2019s about as far as they\u2019ve gotten.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be in the race until the end, until the roll call vote,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nAides say they\u2019re going to discourage people from booing Wasserman Schultz, who\u2019s emerged as public enemy number one among Sanders supporters, when she takes the stage at the convention. But they think it\u2019s going to happen anyway.\n\nMeanwhile, they\u2019re looking into trying to replace the Florida congresswoman as the convention chair with Gabbard, and force Wasserman Schultz to resign as DNC chair the day after the convention.\n\nThe meetings in Philadelphia have already started, with the platform drafting committee set to have its opening session on Wednesday. The Sanders team is headed by Mark Longabaugh \u2014 Devine\u2019s business partner, but who\u2019s veered closer to Weaver when it comes to eagerness to headbutt. There are negotiations with the Clinton campaign and the DNC over what they\u2019re going to force them to agree to, from speaking slots at the convention to long-term control over party operations to the order of early state voting (Aides say Sanders believes the race would have been radically different if the order were different, and more states were by themselves on the calendar instead of lumped together on super-ish Tuesdays).\n\n\u201cEverything is on the table,\u201d Longabaugh said.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of payback. Campaign aides say that whatever else happens, Sanders wants former Congressman Barney Frank and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy out of their spots as co-chairs of the convention rules committee. It\u2019s become a priority fight for him.\n\nSanders, the aides say, believes Frank has hated him for years, but the former Massachusetts congressman\u2019s calling him a \u201cMcCarthyite\u201d pushed him over the edge. He never really registered who Malloy was, despite his being from a neighboring home state and his status as one of the most liberal governors in the country, but Sanders was enraged to hear the governor say he had blood on his hands for not supporting the gun manufacturer liability law.\n\nAides think Democrats should be grateful that he\u2019s increased voter turnout and registration. And it\u2019s why they assume Clinton\u2019s campaign will humbly request he be her college campus and millennial ambassador through the fall, to keep up the rallies and the voter registration that\u2019s given him the 45 percent of primary voters.\n\n\u201cWhen they say we\u2019re hurting the Democratic Party,\u201d Devine said, \u201cwe believe we\u2019re helping it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because Sanders is a savvier politician than almost anyone\u2019s given him credit for. He likes that he\u2019s been in front of almost a million people since the campaign started. But he knows that as soon as the campaign\u2019s done, the crowds will start thinning, and he\u2019s not going to get on television anymore. He\u2019s certainly not running for president again.\n\nSanders knows the ride is about to stop \u2014 but he\u2019s going to push it as far as he can before it does."

    "text": "Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When President-elect Donald Trump looks to the Senate for confirmation of his Cabinet nominees next year, he'll have outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to thank for Democrats' powerlessness to block his choices.\n\nThe Nevada Democrat, a fierce Trump opponent who often referred to the president-elect as \"a spoiled brat,\" took dramatic action in 2013 to end Republicans' ability to mount a filibuster to derail President Obama's judicial and Cabinet nominees.\n\nReid, who was majority leader at the time, used a parliamentary move known as the \"nuclear option\" to change a nearly 40-year-old Senate rule. The change meant that the Senate now needs only a simple majority of 51 votes \u2014 rather than a super-majority of 60 \u2014 to proceed to confirmation votes on Cabinet secretaries, agency directors and judges, except for the Supreme Court.\n\nReid, who leaves a legacy as a master parliamentarian, said he's still glad he did it, despite the fact that the rule change will now be used by the Republican majority to help Trump staff his administration.\n\n\"We changed the Senate rules to guarantee a president\u2019s nominees a fair, simple-majority vote,\" he wrote in a recent op-ed in The New York Times. \"I doubt any of us envisioned Donald J. Trump\u2019s becoming the first president to take office under the new rules. But what was fair for President Obama is fair for President Trump.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid admires his leadership portrait as he unveils it on Dec. 8, 2016, on Capitol Hill. (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)\n\nThe change in filibuster rules was just one of the many procedural tactics that Reid employed during his 12 years as Democratic leader to win passage of President Obama's most ambitious goals.\n\nUsing the procedural tricks at his disposal, Reid pushed through approval of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 \u2014 the \"Obamacare\" law that Republicans are seeking to dismantle \u2014 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, an $800 billion stimulus bill that sought to lift the country out of recession by creating jobs repairing roads, bridges and highways while also expanding unemployment benefits.\n\n\"I\u2019ve done the best that I can,\u201d Reid told reporters last week at his final press briefing before heading home to retire in Nevada. \"And I don\u2019t have any regrets whatsoever about my efforts to push forward a Democratic agenda.\"\n\nReid will be succeeded in the new Congress by incoming Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a gregarious, ebullient Brooklynite whose style stands in stark contrast to the tough, taciturn tactician from tiny Searchlight, Nev., who shunned Washington's social life and eschewed small talk.\n\nReid grew up in a shack made of railroad ties with no running water as his father tried unsuccessfully to make a fortune in mining and his mother made ends meet by washing clothes for the brothels that filled the town. Reid hitchhiked 40 miles to Henderson, Nev., every week just to attend high school.\n\nRead more:\n\nEventually, Reid made his way out of the town, working as a U.S. Capitol Police officer while attending law school at George Washington University. He was elected to the Nevada Assembly at age 28 and served in a variety of elected offices before being elected to the U.S. House in 1982 and the Senate in 1986.\n\n\"I really do believe that if a person like me can be successful, and some can say I have been, then I believe that should make people feel pretty good,\" Reid said. \"If I can make it, why shouldn\u2019t anyone be able to make it?\"\n\nSchumer said there is compassion beneath Reid's no-nonsense demeanor.\n\n\"Beneath the quietness is a strength and a caringness,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cHe\u2019s very strategic and very smart.\u201d\n\nBut Reid's unapologetic partisanship has also made him a target of critics.\n\nWyoming Sen. John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, said the glowing tributes to Reid ring false.\n\n\"For me, his time here has been one of failure, obstruction and gridlock,\" Barrasso said.\n\nSen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., said Reid became a lightning rod because he had to be.\n\n\"I don\u2019t agree with all the changes that he brought to the Senate,\" Heller said, referring to McCain's use of the nuclear option. \"But he did that because he thought it was necessary for him to be in the leadership position he was in and what he thought would retain (Democratic) control of the United States Senate.\"\n\nReid said the one thing he regrets is his support for the U.S. invasion of Iraq during the administration of former president George W. Bush.\n\n\"The invasion of Iraq is the worst foreign policy decision in the history of America leading to the death of untold numbers of human beings,\u201d Reid said. \"Four hundred thousand Syrians. We have no idea how many Iraqis; some say half a million. Plus all the migration that\u2019s been forced. We destabilized a whole part of the world. So I am terribly, terribly embarrassed that I fell for ... all that stuff.\"\n\nReid, who has five children and 19 grandchildren, has not yet decided how to spend his retirement.\n\n\"I understand that my influence as a member of government is gone,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be around for advice or counsel ... but I\u2019m not going to be looking to come back here all the time onto the Senate floor or the cloakroom.\"\n\nRichardson reports for the Reno Gazette-Journal.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2hZAtEo"

    "text": "Michael Cohen\u2019s sentencing memos from SDNY and the Special Counsel\u2019s Office leave one hole in the narrative \u2013 did he, in fact, go to Prague, and has he admitted this to investigators?\n\nPatribotics is grateful to our readers, who make this reporting possible. Your support helps us break stories and hold Trump and Russia to account. Please consider a donation here\n\nBased on today\u2019s sentencing memos, the answers would seem to be \u2018maybe\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 respectively. The SDNY memo discusses how Michael Cohen has withheld information. Here are the relevant paragraphs:\n\nTo be clear, neither the SCO nor this Office is making a motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. No such motion is being made because, as detailed herein, Cohen repeatedly declined to provide full information about the scope of any additional criminal conduct in which he may have engaged or had knowledge. \u2026 Indeed, his proffer sessions with the SCO aside, Cohen only met with the Office about the participation of others in the campaign finance crimes to which Cohen had already pleaded guilty. Cohen specifically declined to be debriefed on other uncharged criminal conduct, if any, in his past. Cohen further declined to meet with the Office about other areas of investigative interest. As the Court is undoubtedly aware, in order to successfully cooperate with this Office, witnesses must undergo full debriefings that encompass their entire criminal history, as well as any and all information they possess about crimes committed by both themselves and others\u2026. Cohen affirmatively chose not to pursue this process. https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5453413/SCO-Cohen-Sentencing-Submission.pdf\n\nThe sentencing memo makes clear the SDNY\u2019s belief that Cohen only admits his guilt once he knows his criminal conduct is already established.\n\nCohen has maintained he did not go to Prague, to discuss paying hackers. Yet, Mr. Cohen and those in his immediate orbit seemed scared that Mueller will find this out, too. His adult daughter Samantha, whose Instagram Mr. Cohen told journalists to examine for proof he was in LA, has now deleted her Instagram account.\n\nFeeling like a @RadarOnlineCom celebrity debunking the Russia connection\u2026all thanks to my daughter's Instagram https://t.co/QuVfo6P2tI \u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) January 16, 2017 That Instagram? It\u2019s been deleted.\n\nIn February 2017, Patribotics reported that Michael Cohen\u2019s denial that he could possibly have gone to Prague, as the Steele Dossier asserted, was false. Although we could not absolutely assert from open source evidence that Mr. Cohen went to Prague, with the help of an army of citizen journalists researching on Twitter, we did manage to show that Cohen had lied about when he was in Los Angeles, and that private planes on which he habitually traveled were engaged in deceptive practice, apparently designed to conceal their movements from an observer.\n\nOn April 18 of this year, McClatchy\u2019s well-known and respected national security correspondents Peter Stone and Greg Gordon reported that Special Counsel Bob Mueller had evidence that Cohen went to Prague, to meet and pay hackers working for Russia (who may, per the dossier, have had other nationalities) on behalf of the Trump campaign. That story said:\n\ninvestigators have traced evidence that Cohen entered the Czech Republic through Germany, apparently during August or early September of 2016 as the ex-spy reported, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is confidential. He wouldn\u2019t have needed a passport for such a trip, because both countries are in the so-called Schengen Area in which 26 nations operate with open borders. The disclosure still left a puzzle: The sources did not say whether Cohen took a commercial flight or private jet to Europe, and gave no explanation as to why no record of such a trip has surfaced.\n\n\u2026. However, Democratic investigators for the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which are conducting parallel inquiries into Russia\u2019s election interference, also are skeptical about whether Cohen was truthful about his 2016 travels to Europe when he was interviewed by the panels last October, two people familiar with those probes told McClatchy this week. \u2026..\n\nOne of the sources said congressional investigators have \u201ca high level of interest\u201d in Cohen\u2019s European travel, with their doubts fueled by what they deem to be weak documentation Cohen has provided about his whereabouts around the time the Prague meeting was supposed to have occurred.\n\nRead more here: https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article208870264.html#storylink=cpy\n\nBreaking this down, first, Gordon and Stone list sources familiar with Mueller\u2019s investigation; secondly, they adduce two sources and describe the House and Senate probes in terms that make me think those sources are one staffer on each probe. The line in the story that made me reopen my own reporting was this:\n\ncongressional investigators \u2026.doubts fueled by what they deem to be weak documentation Cohen has provided about his whereabouts around the time the Prague meeting was supposed to have occurred.\n\nNow, \u2018supposed to have occurred\u2019 means what the dossier asserts; the end of August and the beginning of September. That is where the McClatchy report meets our own story. Because it appears to imply that Mr. Cohen lied about the exact nature of his trip to Los Angeles. As we reported, Cohen told Rosie Gray of the Atlantic \u201cthat he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August\u201d. That was demonstrably false. On the 24th August, he was at Newark Airport.\n\nGray\u2019s piece also bore this odd framing: \u201cCohen said that during the time the report places him in Prague, he was actually with his son visiting USC and meeting with the baseball coach. A USC baseball source confirmed Tuesday night that Cohen and his son had visited USC on August 29th. Cohen said that he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August\u201d\n\n\u201cConfirmed\u201d is not the word I would have used. If Mr. Cohen said he was in Los Angeles \u201cmeeting with the baseball coach\u201d, describing a key purpose of the trip, why did he only do so on the last day of that trip?\n\nPer McClatchy, Congressional investigators were not convinced that Mr. Cohen indeed was in Los Angeles for the entire time that he said he was. Perhaps they asked for credit card receipts or photographs. Perhaps some enterprising staffer read Patribotics, noted our reporting and saw the discrepancy between Cohen\u2019s 23-29 August dates and the tweet from 24th August.\n\nConsidered in this way, Cohen\u2019s own word choice seems to indicate a great deal of nervousness about when he could be located in Los Angeles.\n\n.@LouiseMensch in Los Angeles\u2026verified by the press. This picture was taken in January, 2017 \u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) February 7, 2017\n\n.@BarryMacDoubleU already did and half a dozen reporters verified I was in Los Angeles. #FakeNews claims was another Michael Cohen! \u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) February 15, 2017\n\n.I have no idea why, if that\u2019s real or if someone photoshopped it in. Even so, you know where I wasn\u2019t? #Prague #NeverBeen \u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) January 1, 2018 Spoiler: You can\u2019t \u201cphotoshop in\u201d geolocation on a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted in our first story, Cohen was very obviously keen for his passport to \u201cprove\u201d he hadn\u2019t been to Prague. He famously tweeted out the cover, then referred readers to a Buzzfeed story in which he had provided that passport to the reporters. \u201cIf the glove doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit\u201d was now adapted to \u201cNo stamp on the page, no Mike in a cage\u201d. The lack of an entry stamp to Europe must mean an innocent Mr. Cohen. And yet, that was an obvious red herring; Cohen, by the dossier\u2019s account, had gone secretly to Prague, and Russian intelligence planes would be highly unlikely to file manifests, land at major airports, or obtain nice little \u2018Welcome to Moscow\u2019 ink stamps for the FBI to pore over. He also repeatedly pointed to the meeting he had on the 29th. Cohen posted a photograph of himself at dinner on August 25th in Los Angeles, then his next geolocated tweet was August 28th at 1:53 pm from Beverley Hills.\n\nThe Cohens at dinner in LA, August 25th. Samatha Cohen\u2019s Instagram account is now deleted.\n\nMr. Cohen\u2019s tweets also show an odd discrepancy. They are all geolocated for the period of time in question \u2013 apart from one tweet on August 26th. Why did Cohen make a point of turning off location services for that day alone?\n\nThere is, thus, a gap in the public record from this very public man \u2013 from the night of August 25th to lunchtime on the 28th. Did he take a private plane from Los Angeles to Europe, to Germany as McClatchy reported? We are unlikely to find that out from open source intelligence. But it seems that this part of Mr. Cohen\u2019s story is what Congress is doubting \u2013 and from the sentencing memos passed down today by SDNY and the Special Counsel\u2019s office, Mr. Cohen may regret it bitterly if he is found to have held anything back.\n\nAnd yet perhaps \u201cSays Who\u201d has gotten too much attention, and others in Trump\u2019s orbit not enough. The Steele Dossier reported that Mr. Cohen had gone to Prague accompanied by three colleagues. In a special report tomorrow, Patribotics will examine open-source evidence on who might have joined Mr. Cohen in Prague to discuss how to hack the election."

    "text": "Multiple sources with links to the intelligence and law enforcement communities say that Lt. Gen Mike Flynn has turned on Donald Trump, and has already had at least one lengthy interview with the FBI.\n\nGeneral Flynn has not been offered a deal as of yet, these sources say. They indicate that as of this writing Flynn has not been arrested. He would likely be offered a chance to surrender himself, sources report, when that time comes.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate make a contribution here.\n\nSources with links to the Justice Department indicate that General Flynn has already been indicted. On Twitter, Claude Taylor exclusively reported on May 14th that an indictment against Flynn had been returned by a Grand Jury and that this indictment was sealed. I can further report that Flynn\u2019s indictment is thought to be for his failure to register under FARA, the Foreign Agents\u2019 Registration Act, for his lobbying for Turkey. Reporting by NBC of Grand Jury subpoenas in an investigation for which Flynn is the subject, sources say, cover separate offenses of Mike Flynn\u2019s that are linked to Russia. These are being investigated under prosecutors in Northern Virginia*, with an attorney accustomed to handling espionage prosecutions.\n\nSources believe that General Mike \u201cMisha\u201d Flynn, to give him the Russian nickname he awarded himself when picked up by British intelligence committing treason in Cambridge, England, panicked when he heard that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had been appointed to head the investigation into Trump\u2019s collusion with Russia.\n\nMike Flynn may also have interpreted Donald Trump\u2019s text to him, \u2018Stay Strong,\u2019 on the day the subpoenas for evidence in the ongoing case against him were announced, as a threat. Sources believe that Flynn informed the FBI, and multiple other persons, of Trump\u2019s text himself.\n\nSeparate sources with links to the intelligence community confirm our earlier reporting on how Mike Flynn co-ordinated Russia\u2019s propaganda attack on the West on behalf of Trump, giving advice across Europe to far-right parties linked to the Russian state. These include, but are not limited to, UKIP, Marine Le Pen in France and a far-right party in Austria. Flynn regarded himself as a partisan of the Russian state, and his assistance in Russia\u2019s messaging was not limited to hacking the American election, but in trying to boost Nazi ideology and Putin allies right across Europe. These sources state that Gen. Flynn could receive the death penalty for espionage for these activities, if charges are brought on the matter and he is found guilty.\n\nFlynn is being decommissioned, sources say, meaning that he is telling the FBI what he knows. This is clearly very bad news for Donald Trump and all those around him who colluded with Russia. It may be particularly bad news for Vice-President Mike Pence, who is attempting, with little success, to disclaim knowledge of Flynn\u2019s collusion with Russia.\n\n[correction] \u2013 I originally wrote the Northern District of Virginia as opposed to Northern Virginia\n\nprotonmail Whistleblowers are encouraged to get in touch on our secureemail address."

    "text": "Michael Cohen\u2019s sentencing memos from SDNY and the Special Counsel\u2019s Office leave one hole in the narrative \u2013 did he, in fact, go to Prague, and has he admitted this to investigators?\n\nPatribotics is grateful to our readers, who make this reporting possible. Your support helps us break stories and hold Trump and Russia to account. Please consider a donation here\n\nBased on today\u2019s sentencing memos, the answers would seem to be \u2018maybe\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 respectively. The SDNY memo discusses how Michael Cohen has withheld information. Here are the relevant paragraphs:\n\nTo be clear, neither the SCO nor this Office is making a motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. No such motion is being made because, as detailed herein, Cohen repeatedly declined to provide full information about the scope of any additional criminal conduct in which he may have engaged or had knowledge. \u2026 Indeed, his proffer sessions with the SCO aside, Cohen only met with the Office about the participation of others in the campaign finance crimes to which Cohen had already pleaded guilty. Cohen specifically declined to be debriefed on other uncharged criminal conduct, if any, in his past. Cohen further declined to meet with the Office about other areas of investigative interest. As the Court is undoubtedly aware, in order to successfully cooperate with this Office, witnesses must undergo full debriefings that encompass their entire criminal history, as well as any and all information they possess about crimes committed by both themselves and others\u2026. Cohen affirmatively chose not to pursue this process. https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5453413/SCO-Cohen-Sentencing-Submission.pdf\n\nThe sentencing memo makes clear the SDNY\u2019s belief that Cohen only admits his guilt once he knows his criminal conduct is already established.\n\nCohen has maintained he did not go to Prague, to discuss paying hackers. Yet, Mr. Cohen and those in his immediate orbit seemed scared that Mueller will find this out, too. His adult daughter Samantha, whose Instagram Mr. Cohen told journalists to examine for proof he was in LA, has now deleted her Instagram account.\n\nFeeling like a @RadarOnlineCom celebrity debunking the Russia connection\u2026all thanks to my daughter's Instagram https://t.co/QuVfo6P2tI \u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) January 16, 2017 That Instagram? It\u2019s been deleted.\n\nIn February 2017, Patribotics reported that Michael Cohen\u2019s denial that he could possibly have gone to Prague, as the Steele Dossier asserted, was false. Although we could not absolutely assert from open source evidence that Mr. Cohen went to Prague, with the help of an army of citizen journalists researching on Twitter, we did manage to show that Cohen had lied about when he was in Los Angeles, and that private planes on which he habitually traveled were engaged in deceptive practice, apparently designed to conceal their movements from an observer.\n\nOn April 18 of this year, McClatchy\u2019s well-known and respected national security correspondents Peter Stone and Greg Gordon reported that Special Counsel Bob Mueller had evidence that Cohen went to Prague, to meet and pay hackers working for Russia (who may, per the dossier, have had other nationalities) on behalf of the Trump campaign. That story said:\n\ninvestigators have traced evidence that Cohen entered the Czech Republic through Germany, apparently during August or early September of 2016 as the ex-spy reported, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is confidential. He wouldn\u2019t have needed a passport for such a trip, because both countries are in the so-called Schengen Area in which 26 nations operate with open borders. The disclosure still left a puzzle: The sources did not say whether Cohen took a commercial flight or private jet to Europe, and gave no explanation as to why no record of such a trip has surfaced.\n\n\u2026. However, Democratic investigators for the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which are conducting parallel inquiries into Russia\u2019s election interference, also are skeptical about whether Cohen was truthful about his 2016 travels to Europe when he was interviewed by the panels last October, two people familiar with those probes told McClatchy this week. \u2026..\n\nOne of the sources said congressional investigators have \u201ca high level of interest\u201d in Cohen\u2019s European travel, with their doubts fueled by what they deem to be weak documentation Cohen has provided about his whereabouts around the time the Prague meeting was supposed to have occurred.\n\nRead more here: https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article208870264.html#storylink=cpy\n\nBreaking this down, first, Gordon and Stone list sources familiar with Mueller\u2019s investigation; secondly, they adduce two sources and describe the House and Senate probes in terms that make me think those sources are one staffer on each probe. The line in the story that made me reopen my own reporting was this:\n\ncongressional investigators \u2026.doubts fueled by what they deem to be weak documentation Cohen has provided about his whereabouts around the time the Prague meeting was supposed to have occurred.\n\nNow, \u2018supposed to have occurred\u2019 means what the dossier asserts; the end of August and the beginning of September. That is where the McClatchy report meets our own story. Because it appears to imply that Mr. Cohen lied about the exact nature of his trip to Los Angeles. As we reported, Cohen told Rosie Gray of the Atlantic \u201cthat he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August\u201d. That was demonstrably false. On the 24th August, he was at Newark Airport.\n\nGray\u2019s piece also bore this odd framing: \u201cCohen said that during the time the report places him in Prague, he was actually with his son visiting USC and meeting with the baseball coach. A USC baseball source confirmed Tuesday night that Cohen and his son had visited USC on August 29th. Cohen said that he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August\u201d\n\n\u201cConfirmed\u201d is not the word I would have used. If Mr. Cohen said he was in Los Angeles \u201cmeeting with the baseball coach\u201d, describing a key purpose of the trip, why did he only do so on the last day of that trip?\n\nPer McClatchy, Congressional investigators were not convinced that Mr. Cohen indeed was in Los Angeles for the entire time that he said he was. Perhaps they asked for credit card receipts or photographs. Perhaps some enterprising staffer read Patribotics, noted our reporting and saw the discrepancy between Cohen\u2019s 23-29 August dates and the tweet from 24th August.\n\nConsidered in this way, Cohen\u2019s own word choice seems to indicate a great deal of nervousness about when he could be located in Los Angeles.\n\n.@LouiseMensch in Los Angeles\u2026verified by the press. This picture was taken in January, 2017 \u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) February 7, 2017\n\n.@BarryMacDoubleU already did and half a dozen reporters verified I was in Los Angeles. #FakeNews claims was another Michael Cohen! \u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) February 15, 2017\n\n.I have no idea why, if that\u2019s real or if someone photoshopped it in. Even so, you know where I wasn\u2019t? #Prague #NeverBeen \u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) January 1, 2018 Spoiler: You can\u2019t \u201cphotoshop in\u201d geolocation on a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted in our first story, Cohen was very obviously keen for his passport to \u201cprove\u201d he hadn\u2019t been to Prague. He famously tweeted out the cover, then referred readers to a Buzzfeed story in which he had provided that passport to the reporters. \u201cIf the glove doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit\u201d was now adapted to \u201cNo stamp on the page, no Mike in a cage\u201d. The lack of an entry stamp to Europe must mean an innocent Mr. Cohen. And yet, that was an obvious red herring; Cohen, by the dossier\u2019s account, had gone secretly to Prague, and Russian intelligence planes would be highly unlikely to file manifests, land at major airports, or obtain nice little \u2018Welcome to Moscow\u2019 ink stamps for the FBI to pore over. He also repeatedly pointed to the meeting he had on the 29th. Cohen posted a photograph of himself at dinner on August 25th in Los Angeles, then his next geolocated tweet was August 28th at 1:53 pm from Beverley Hills.\n\nThe Cohens at dinner in LA, August 25th. Samatha Cohen\u2019s Instagram account is now deleted.\n\nMr. Cohen\u2019s tweets also show an odd discrepancy. They are all geolocated for the period of time in question \u2013 apart from one tweet on August 26th. Why did Cohen make a point of turning off location services for that day alone?\n\nThere is, thus, a gap in the public record from this very public man \u2013 from the night of August 25th to lunchtime on the 28th. Did he take a private plane from Los Angeles to Europe, to Germany as McClatchy reported? We are unlikely to find that out from open source intelligence. But it seems that this part of Mr. Cohen\u2019s story is what Congress is doubting \u2013 and from the sentencing memos passed down today by SDNY and the Special Counsel\u2019s office, Mr. Cohen may regret it bitterly if he is found to have held anything back.\n\nAnd yet perhaps \u201cSays Who\u201d has gotten too much attention, and others in Trump\u2019s orbit not enough. The Steele Dossier reported that Mr. Cohen had gone to Prague accompanied by three colleagues. In a special report tomorrow, Patribotics will examine open-source evidence on who might have joined Mr. Cohen in Prague to discuss how to hack the election."

    "text": "Sources linked to the intelligence community say that General Mike Flynn\u2019s trips to Cambridge and across Europe will form a key part of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment and the prosecutions of dozens of his associates.\n\nAccording to several sources within the intelligence community, Michael Flynn was co-ordinating, with and for Russian agents, the drafting of messages that Vladimir Putin was using to attack democracy in not only the United States, but across Europe. Furthermore, Flynn was doing this with the full knowledge of the Trump campaign, including Donald Trump himself.\n\nThis news directly relates to the data laundering performed by the Alfa Bank server on behalf of Donald Trump and Russia, where, as I reported, the Trump campaign colluded with the hacking of both the DNC and state voter databases.\n\nThe Alfa Bank server \u2018washed\u2019 that data together to tell Trump where to target it, sources say. But the messages and content with which targets were served was co-ordinated with Russia by General Flynn.\n\nFurthermore, Flynn took the same hacking tools and artificial intelligence coded in Russia and helped far-right and Nazi parties across Europe use it in their own nations. Intelligence sources assert that multiple NATO partners have evidence of this and that it has been provided to the FBI.\n\nIf \u2018data laundering\u2019 is the first part of the Trump Russia incontrovertible evidence, \u2018propaganda targeting\u2019 is the second part. Flynn attacked not only the United States but all her Western allies on Russia\u2019s behalf, with the full knowledge and connivance of Donald Trump.\n\nBoth halves of the social media impeachment will, sources assert, be key to Director Comey\u2019s overall case. This is the \u2018incontrovertible evidence\u2019 to which Sir Richard Dearlove and others have referred.\n\nThe support of our readers makes Patribotics possible. If you would like to support our journalism you can donate. You could make a contribution here, or there are buttons around the site. We thank everybody who has helped so far. You enable us to keep going.\n\nExplaining Data Laundering and Fake News\n\nThe broad case of Russia\u2019s hacking the US election can be divided into two relatively simple spheres. There is another branch of the criminal investigation that focuses on money-laundering and corrupt payments from Russia and Russian satellites to Mr. Trump and to his allies. But the actual hacking of the US election follows a relatively simple narrative line in two halves; hacking and targeting. Mr. Flynn\u2019s activities spanned the two and link them to Russian active measures all across Europe, including the current attack on the French election.\n\nAs I previously reported in an exclusive story on this blog, Alfa Bank in Russia\u2019s server was communicating to the Trump campaign hacked data from state voter databases and the DNC\u2019s own voter targeting engine, Vertica. It was also laundering money to pay these hackers to the Trump campaign. These two functions were performed by the Alfa Bank server communicating with the Trump and Spectrum Health servers.\n\nThe precise combination of these two databases allowed Cambridge Analytica and SCL both to create Russian-directed propaganda and target it at voting groups with extraordinary precision. Intelligence sources clarified that SVB bank, the second bank named in the FISA warrant I exclusively reported on Nov 7th, was also involved in messaging the Trump server, by sending Cambridge Analytica targeting and SCL propaganda to it, to be washed with the databases and money Alfa Bank was sending that server.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note \u2013 the two preceding paragraphs have been corrected. They originally erroneously said that the Alfa server was sending the voter databases to the Trump server, when in fact it was laundering money to pay to hackers and others who would spread the propaganda created by SCL]\n\nThe technology behind Cambridge Analytica\u2019s targeting was stolen from Facebook by Alexander Kogan, who has gone to Singapore and renamed himself Alex Spectre. In many ways, the Trump-Russia story begins and ends at Cambridge University. Dimtry Firtash, the corrupt Russian oligarch who is Paul Manafort\u2019s patron, gave Cambridge \u00a36 million pounds since 2010. With that money evidently came a large ring of Russian spies, probably including Kogan.\n\nFake news in the 2016 election was not, in fact, fake news. It was real propaganda, coordinated and paid for by the Russian state. General Flynn was actively involved on Russia\u2019s behalf, sources say, with discussing how this propaganda could be used and targeted across Europe and elsewhere, as well as in Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nSir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, told the Financial Times that he and other British former spies had left a dining club at Cambridge \u2013 a club to which Flynn belonged \u2013 because of concerns about Russian intelligence penetrating it. General Flynn had been a regular attendee, the story said. It added that British intelligence was extremely concerned about some \u2018startups\u2019 in Cambridge being Russian intelligence, notably Veruscript.\n\nSir Richard and his colleagues suspect that Veruscript \u2014 a newly established digital publishing house that has provided funding to set up a new journal of intelligence and to cover some of the seminar\u2019s costs \u2014 may be acting as a front for the Russian intelligence services\n\nThe story did not get much attention in the America MSM, but I recognise the worthy papers an intelligence veteran in the UK might use to front-face something for reporters. (If Sir Richard is reading this report I do hope he will consider giving it to me next time. I could have told him firewalls = death for dissemination).\n\nThe Guardian followed this up with a story about a probable woman FSB agent or asset at Cambridge, to whom General Flynn, who is as vain as he is stupid, had signed billets-doux marked \u201cGeneral Misha\u201d, the Russian word for Mike.\n\nIn Cambridge, intelligence sources say, Flynn was meeting with not only those who had coded the technology but Russian spies talking about the propaganda it should distribute.\n\nHowever, Flynn did not stop there. With the full knowledge of both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, \u201cGeneral Misha\u201d continued his Nazi \u201ctour of Europe\u201d, with meetings both in Europe and of the EU far right at Trump Tower, discussing how the Russian propaganda of SCL could be targeted directly in their countries in order to swing their elections. Notably, Flynn was caught with the head of the far-right party in Austria. This man was then invited by Donald Trump to the inauguration. Other far-right Russian allies invited to the inauguration, or who came to meet Trump Russia associates at Trump tower, and who were assisted by the Russian botnet and Russian propaganda, include Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage.\n\nSir Richard and US sources have indicated to the Guardian newspaper that Director Comey has direct and incontrovertible evidence that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia. This relates to the FISA warrant that I reported on November 7th and my April 1st report (which I had previously published as a theory) that the AlfaBank server was laundering two hacked databases together for targeting \u2013 the DNC\u2019s own and the voter registration databases. However, the other parts of that evidence, I can report today, involve General Flynn\u2019s discussions with Russian spies and the EU far-right on how they could use similar technology to hack and target Russian active measures in their own country.\n\nIn this scenario, it is easy to see that \u201cHonest Misha\u201d Flynn thought of himself as the leading commander for Russia\u2019s attack on the West.\n\nThe Microchip Russian Botnet Worked in America With Flynn and Flynn Jr \u2013 And Guido Lombardi\n\nHow the Magax3 Pac, \u201cMicrochip\u201d and the Russian botnet worked directly with Donald Trump and Mike Flynn under the aegis of Russian intelligence\n\nIf Peter Chayanov, (one of his many names), is the hacking villain of Trump-Russia, as I have previously reported, the \u2018Microchip\u2019 persona is the targeting villain of the piece.\n\nExclusively on Patribotics by Laurelai Bailey, we broke the story that one week before the DNC emails were published, Wikileaks bought two full servers located in Russia.\n\nNext, we broke the story, based on what I have called COSINT \u2013 crowdsourced, open-source intelligence \u2013 that Wikileaks had actually handed their SSL keys to Chayanov and therefore to Putin. What that means in layman terms is that the Russian dictator can now see the IP addresses of anybody reading Wikileaks, (helpful with targeting propaganda at them, as he sees what stories they are reading), and also the IP addresses used now or in the past by any donors to Wikileaks \u2013 of money or leaks. That means Putin can blackmail whistleblowers from the US military and elsewhere into becoming his spies.\n\nI further reported, based on intelligence sources that it was Chayanov\u2019s company Hostkey that US intelligence determined hacked the state voter databases (named in their October 7th statement as \u2018a Russian company\u2019). Because the USIC named Wikileaks as a Russian government actor in that same statement, and because Chayanov holds Wikileaks SSL keys and servers, USIC now knows, if it did not before, that the Russian government hacked the state voter databases. The motherlode of the DNC leaks was not the DNC emails Wikileaks released; rather, it was the Vertica database that the DNC used and which had files on the voting behavior of all listed voters (hence the BernieBros that disappeared from Twitter \u2013 they were designed to suppress the Clinton vote). The Steele Dossier, which sources say is true in all important respects, states that Russian moles in the DNC leaked the files to Russia \u2013 they were as much hackers as Snowden was at the USA. Because there are too many states to place leakers in, Chayanov was forced actually to hack the state voter registration databases.\n\nThe Trump server was washing these two databases together for targeting by the campaign as I exclusively reported, with further exclusive reporting on the precise method by TeaPainUSA, here.\n\nNext, with the accurate data provided by the data laundering, the Trump campaign needed to target voting groups with accuracy. It did this by creating fake news and ugly memes, and receiving these from Russian sources. Agents of influence of Russia used to propel these fake stories and memes included Sputnik, Jack Posobiec, and the \u201cbotnet\u201d created by Microchip, who is a composite persona. Microchip are Russian agents of influence, and began to create the pro-Trump troll net in 2015, according to Buzzfeed. As well as actual bots based on keywords, the Microchip Russian botnet used human beings and particular hashtags to push the AI themed messaging. Trump\u2019s campaign created fake news to order. Flynn\u2019s twitter account, and that of his son, were lambasted for publishing fake news, but in point of fact it is easy \u2013 and provable \u2013 to see that the Microchip botnet of Russia was tweeting from the account. Flynn\u2019s twitter used the same exact hashtags and linked back to the MagaX3 PAC. He also pushed out the Wikileaks releases of the stolen DNC material (now declared by the CIA to be Russian active measures) with hashtags like #PodestaEmails19 as they arose (remember, anybody clicking on these links had now given their IP address to Putin).\n\nFlynn was working in Trump Tower with \u2018Chief Facebook Officer\u2019 Guido Lombardi, profile in Politico EU, using their mutual hatred of Islam as a wedge issue.\n\nLombardi, who describes himself as a real estate investor with rightward political leanings, said that throughout the presidential campaign he fielded calls from representatives of a veritable Who\u2019s Who of the European Right, including French far-right leader Marine Le Pen \u2014 who was spotted in Trump Tower Thursday \u2014 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, members of Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, as well as the center-right French R\u00e9publicains party who all wanted to meet with Trump. \u2026 Lombardi\u2019s main role, he said, was to run an unofficial, guerilla-style social media operation that aimed to amplify the candidate\u2019s message online. At its height, Lombardi said the operation included sites and Facebook pages for many niche groups of Trump supporters such as \u201cBikers for Trump,\u201d \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d and \u201cVeterans for Trump.\u201d \u201cIn June of 2015, I told Donald, \u2018I\u2019d love to help,\u2019\u201d said Lombardi. \u201c\u2018But I can\u2019t work directly for the campaign because I have all kinds of rules and regulations. I will take care of unofficial media. I will take care of students. I will take care of bikers. I will take care of all the crazies \u2026 There is no official connection so [no] liability.\u2019 He said, \u2018Great.\u2019\u201d By the end of the campaign, Lombardi said he was curating some 500 online groups that were run by a network of volunteers. He said he had started some of them but did not specify how many. It was not possible to verify this claim or Lombardi\u2019s link to the websites. Several of the groups cited by Lombardi had garnered more than 100,000 \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook and featured pro-Trump memes and stories from little-known news sources.\n\nBelow, the screenshot shows Flynn pushing out this Russian co-ordinated propaganda targeted by Lombardi.\n\nLombardi, Flynn and Gaffney, along with Devin Nunes, were in the Transition Team and were willing to slam US intelligence and military leaders.\n\nFueling concerns are reports of Trump\u2019s selection of former Defense Intelligence Agency director Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn as national security adviser. Flynn was purged himself in 2014 by his superiors in the military intelligence community\u2026.Another Trump transition leader who has sharp criticisms of current military and intelligence leaders regarding the war on terrorism is House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif.\u2026 Nunes is now one of the three Trump transition officials in charge of national security appointments, along with former congressman Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., and Reagan-era official Frank Gaffney,\n\nA story that I myself reported for Heat Street in October, 2016 \u2013 before I reported the FISA warrant on Alfa Bank and SVB Bank \u2013 that concerned Trump\u2019s bots and trolls actually pointed to a lot of what is reported here. Because I did note in that story that the Russian botnet AI had spread far beyond America and existed in multiple languages.\n\nCoda: Finding A Common Message Pushed Out by Both Types of Putinbot One easy way to spot a Russian troll, whether curated or automated, is to look for them pushing out the identical message. Do we remember that \u201cPutin: How Obama Created ISIS\u201d video? This happens (see link). Please note the \u201cvarious\u201d \u201cdiverse\u201d profiles Russian men are adopting here. We have an Hispanic woman, a Muslim woman, a white far left Bernie Sanders supporter, and a patriotic redneck. \u2026 but wait! There\u2019s more! By using this method we can see how the Russian troll farm places its fictional accounts around the world and in multiple languages. Australia, Germany, Japan, Africa\u2026 Dutch, from a Holland-based account\u2026.\n\nI further pointed out that all these countries had certain tropes in common. Support for Trump, Brexit, Viktor Orban, and Nigel Farage as well as Marine Le Pen.\n\nThe interesting thing about analyzing Mom For Trump is his use of most of the tropes pushed by Breitbart\u2019s Steven Bannon, now a Trump advisor. These are: Trump Putin Russia Brexit Nigel Farage Many of the \u201cEU located\u201d Putinbots will also hawk the Russian puppet Viktor Orban, the PM of Hungary. Here\u2019s a Spanish-language Putinbot who has chucked in an avatar boosting Assad for good measure (his account reads \u201cthe tiger of damascus\u201d).\n\nIt now turns out that on his trips to Cambridge and through the EU, General Misha Flynn was specifically co-ordinating Russian propaganda for the far right.\n\nThe Alfa Bank server\u2019s washing of the voter registration and Vertica databases is one half of the incontrovertible evidence that will see Donald Trump impeached. But Moscow Mike Flynn\u2019s Treason Tour of Europe is the other half of it. Flynn is the key not only to Vladimir Putin\u2019s attack on America, but also to his attack on the entire Western World.\n\nAn attack in which Donald J Trump was fully and totally complicit."

Flynn broke down and sobbed, sources familiar with the matter said, when faced with the extent of the signals intelligence, or SIGINT, against himself and Mike Flynn Jr. Senior law enforcement officials presented Donald Trump\u2019s former National Security adviser, already indicted at the time for failure to register as a foreign agent of Turkey, with irrefutable evidence of espionage committed on behalf of the Russian state by both himself and his son and business partner, Mike Flynn Jr. Espionage is a capital crime.\n\nSeparate sources with links to the intelligence community and the Justice Department report that a deal for leniency for his son offered to General Flynn, on which we exclusively reported earlier this year, may have been derailed by Mike Flynn Jr\u2019s compulsive tweeting of divisive, pro-Kremlin propaganda.\n\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible.

At that time, Mike Flynn was under indictment for failing to register as a foreign agent for Turkey under FARA, the Foreign Agents\u2019 Registration Act.\n\nGeneral Flynn, sources reported, was arrogant and unconcerned. The charge of failing to register under FARA might only result in a term-limited prison sentence. Flynn had resigned as NSA and believed himself present in the FBI\u2019s offices to discuss the terms of a deal on this charge.\n\nSources said that General Flynn did indeed discuss this offense, which was admitted, with FBI agents. However, they reported that after a brief period, a senior official entered the room and confronted General Flynn with knowledge of his wider conspiracy in Russia\u2019s interference in the election. An outline of a case for espionage, a capital crime, where the default penalty is death, was made to Flynn senior, involving both himself and his son Mike Flynn Jr. While sources were not specific, they reported that the conversation involved both men\u2019s knowing propagation, and co-ordination, with the Kremlin, of Russian propaganda, using an Artificial Intelligence \u2018data weapon\u2019 precisely to target that propaganda on social media. This technology and the way it was employed is also said to feature in an espionage investigation that is ongoing against Bob Mercer, sources say.\n\n@realDonaldTrump will win the election & is more popular than Obama in 2008, AI system finds #MAGA3X @FieldofFight https://t.co/zfIT25Usdc \u2014 General Flynn (@GenFlynn) October 28, 2016\n\nWe exclusively reported these crimes in our story \u2018Mike Flynn\u2019s Treason Tour\u2018, which describes how Flynn and his son assisted Vladimir Putin in targeting Russian propaganda not only in the United States, but also right across Europe.\n\nSources stated that senior officials told General Flynn that they had what they needed to prosecute him and his son, and that they would seek the death penalty. Separate sources reported that General Flynn broke down and wept, asking that the death penalty for espionage not be sought for his son.\n\nSources with links to law enforcement and the justice department stated that at first, senior officials declined to offer a deal of any sort. Later, they became amenable, these sources said. General Flynn was offered a stark choice; co-operate and spare your son execution, but no such promise was made as regards his own trial.\n\nMr. Flynn did then co-operate, sources said.\n\nMike Flynn Jr. angrily denied to this reporter the accounts given her by multiple separate sources, on separate occasions, of what his father had done for him, and in such a way that led her to believe that Flynn Jr. did not know. If correct, this would necessarily mean that the FBI had not allowed General Flynn to discuss his knowledge of the charges against father and son with his co-conspirator.\n\nDespite this, General Flynn was required to put a brake on Mike Flynn Jr.\u2019s divisive propaganda on Twitter, sources said. The younger Flynn was, however, so addicted to tweeting hate-ridden Russian messaging, these sources said, that the Special Counsel\u2019s office decided at one point that the deal had been violated. It was after Flynn Sr. was informed of that decision that he began to fund-raise for his defense, sources said.\n\nAnything General Flynn would have admitted prior to this would still be admissible at trial, sources reported. At time of writing, I do not know whether or not the Special Counsel\u2019s team had a change of heart over honoring their deal for leniency for the younger Flynn following further information received from Mike Flynn Senior.\n\nNote: New charges do not necessarily mean new indictments, but they can do.\n\nA \u2018charge\u2019 is only leveled when an indictment is made public. Therefore, charges may be new for indictments that have been returned by a Grand Jury many months prior. Mr. Mueller may choose to indict General Flynn on some, but not all, of the possible charges against him, as he did with Paul Manafort.\n\nPatribotics is very grateful for the support of our readers, which makes this effort possible.

    "text": "New York (CNN Business) The chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei has been arrested in Canada. She faces extradition to the United States.\n\nMeng Wanzhou, also known as Sabrina Meng and Cathy Meng, was apprehended in Vancouver on December 1, according to Canadian Justice Department spokesman Ian McLeod. In addition to her role as CFO, Meng serves as deputy chairwoman of Huawei's board. She's the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei.\n\nMeng \"is sought for extradition by the United States, and a bail hearing has been set for Friday,\" McLeod said in a statement, which was first reported by The Globe and Mail.\n\nMcLeod said the Canadian Justice Department can't share details of the case. Meng was granted a publication ban after a judge agreed to bar both police and prosecutors from releasing information about the case.\n\nThe US Justice Department sought the arrest as part of ongoing investigation, according to a law enforcement official.\n\nMeng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei\n\nA Huawei spokesperson said Meng was detained by Canadian authorities on behalf of the United States when she was transferring flights in Canada. Huawei said she faces unspecified charges in the Eastern District of New York. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that the US Justice Department was investigating whether Huawei violated US sanctions on Iran.\n\n\"The company has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng,\" the spokesperson said. \"The company believes the Canadian and US legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion. Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU.\"\n\nThe US Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday called for Meng to be released and urged the United States and Canada to explain why she had been detained.\n\n\"The Chinese side has made clear our solemn positions to the United States and Canada, and asked them to clarify the reason of the detention and to release the detainee immediately, and to earnestly safeguard the legal and legitimate rights and interests of the person involved,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told reporters.\n\nThe Chinese company, which sells smartphones and telecommunications equipment around the world, has been facing increased scrutiny in the United States and other countries , where officials have warned of potential national security risks from using Huawei products. The United States is concerned that the Chinese government could be using Huawei's networking technology to spy on Americans.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, said Americans are \"grateful\" to Canadian authorities for arresting Meng.\n\n\"Sometimes Chinese aggression is explicitly state-sponsored and sometimes it's laundered through many of Beijing's so-called 'private' sector entities that are in bed with Xi's communist party,\" he said.\n\nSenator Chris Van Hollen \u2014 a Democrat from Maryland \u2014 said Chinese telecommunications companies \"represent a fundamental risk to American national security.\"\n\n\"We need a comprehensive plan to hold the Chinese and their state-sponsored entities accountable for gross violations of the law and threats to our security,\" he said.\n\nThe Pentagon in May ordered stores on American military bases to stop selling smartphones made by Huawei and Chinese rival ZTE. And in February, top officials from the CIA, NSA, FBI and the Defense Intelligence Agency told a Senate committee that those firms' smartphones posed a security threat to American customers.\n\nUK telecom company BT ( BT ) said Wednesday that it would not buy equipment from the Chinese tech company for the core of its next generation wireless network. The company also said it would remove existing Huawei technology from the heart of its 4G network within two years.\n\nHuawei told CNN Business last month that its equipment is trusted by customers in 170 countries and by 46 of the world's 50 largest telecommunications companies.\n\n\"If a government's behavior extends beyond its jurisdiction, such activity should not be encouraged,\" the company said. \"Huawei firmly believes that our partners and customers will make the right choice based on their own judgment and experience of working with Huawei.\""

If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nSources say the indictment on April 20th of Levashov in the US district court in Connecticut (where an FBI counterintelligence division is based) represents the first concrete move in court that openly leads towards the impeachment of Donald Trump and the prosecution of dozens of members of his team \u2013 because this hacker, the sources suggest, was compensated by Team Trump and the FSB jointly, and Team Trump, sources say, know it.\n\nMr. Epshteyn\u2019s lawyers have denied to me in writing that he was ever an agent of Russia, and have said that neither he nor his parents were ever agents of the Russian state. However, I stand by my prior and current reporting on this public figure, who, until recently, was a member of the US Government as staff at the White House, as well as maintaining a constant public presence as a surrogate of Mr. Trump\u2019s during the campaign, and on television for the White House after it.\n\nMultiple sources with links to the intelligence community report that:\n\nTrump Tower was a \u201ccommand and control\u201d center for the Kehlios botnet, dismantled by the FBI;\n\nThat the \u201cTrump server\u201d with a Trump Tower IP address, that was communicating with servers owned by Alfa Bank in Russia, and with Spectrum Health, had the data packets it sent opened on the hour by human members of Trump\u2019s data team, located near to Trump Tower;\n\nAs I have previously reported here at patribotics, the server was \u2018washing\u2019 the DNC\u2019s stolen, hacked \u2018Vertica\u201d database with voter registration databases \u2013 but new sources report further information that images were also sent from or to Russia, and opened by members of Trump\u2019s own team on an hourly basis\n\nThat \u201cPyotr Levashov'\u201d or \u201cPeter Severa\u201d, indicted by the FBI for running the Kehlios botnet, was recruited for the hacking effort by Mr. Epshteyn, who, sources say, was working for both the FSB and team Trump;\n\nThat in 2015, Trump Hotels was fined a pittance of $50,000 for malware and credit card fraud after it failed to correct an earlier \u201cbreach\u201d, but that this was deliberate, as the credit card malware would later be repurposed to be used in the election;\n\nThat human accounts pushing out fake memes authorized by Russia were paid, via the Kelhios botnet being operated from Trump HQ, using bitcoin and a spam payments system previously used for pornography;\n\nAnd that Pyotr Levashov, aka Peter Severa, is also connected to one Dante Jimenez, another top spammer who himself connects back to Hostkey \u2013 the Russian company controlled by Vladimir Putin, with servers in the Russian academy of sciences, that hosts Wikileaks\n\nSources further attest that the FBI intercepted the traffic between the Alfa Bank server and Mr. Trump\u2019s server, and know exactly what was transmitted\n\nSources further report that there were at least two other \u201cmother servers\u201d, other than the one with the Trump Tower IP address, and the Spectrum Health server that simultaneously pinged Alfa Bank. Sources indicate that one of these two servers was at Spectrum Health, and transferred messages to Russia via a method called \u201ciodine xfer transfer\u201d, but that the US intelligence community intercepted all such messages\n\nSources close to the intelligence community indicate that the indictment of Pyotr Levashov in Connecticut this week represents the FBI \u2018making its move\u2019 to begin proceedings against Trump and his team, as, these sources say, Trump and many of those working for his campaign are well aware that they are tied by data to the criminal activities of Mr. Levashov\n\nMultiple, other sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one country, who were not the original sources on my exclusive story that Carter Page took a recording of Donald Trump to Moscow, confirm that this story is true.\n\nThere will be extensive further reporting on this exclusive story; please check back for updates."

Gen Mike Flynn has turned on Donald Trump, and has already had at least one lengthy interview with the FBI.\n\nGeneral Flynn has not been offered a deal as of yet, these sources say. They indicate that as of this writing Flynn has not been arrested. He would likely be offered a chance to surrender himself, sources report, when that time comes.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate make a contribution here.\n\nSources with links to the Justice Department indicate that General Flynn has already been indicted. On Twitter, Claude Taylor exclusively reported on May 14th that an indictment against Flynn had been returned by a Grand Jury and that this indictment was sealed. I can further report that Flynn\u2019s indictment is thought to be for his failure to register under FARA, the Foreign Agents\u2019 Registration Act, for his lobbying for Turkey. Reporting by NBC of Grand Jury subpoenas in an investigation for which Flynn is the subject, sources say, cover separate offenses of Mike Flynn\u2019s that are linked to Russia. These are being investigated under prosecutors in Northern Virginia*, with an attorney accustomed to handling espionage prosecutions.\n\nSources believe that General Mike \u201cMisha\u201d Flynn, to give him the Russian nickname he awarded himself when picked up by British intelligence committing treason in Cambridge, England, panicked when he heard that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had been appointed to head the investigation into Trump\u2019s collusion with Russia.\n\nMike Flynn may also have interpreted Donald Trump\u2019s text to him, \u2018Stay Strong,\u2019 on the day the subpoenas for evidence in the ongoing case against him were announced, as a threat. Sources believe that Flynn informed the FBI, and multiple other persons, of Trump\u2019s text himself.\n\nSeparate sources with links to the intelligence community confirm our earlier reporting on how Mike Flynn co-ordinated Russia\u2019s propaganda attack on the West on behalf of Trump, giving advice across Europe to far-right parties linked to the Russian state. These include, but are not limited to, UKIP, Marine Le Pen in France and a far-right party in Austria. Flynn regarded himself as a partisan of the Russian state, and his assistance in Russia\u2019s messaging was not limited to hacking the American election, but in trying to boost Nazi ideology and Putin allies right across Europe. These sources state that Gen. Flynn could receive the death penalty for espionage for these activities, if charges are brought on the matter and he is found guilty.\n\nFlynn is being decommissioned, sources say, meaning that he is telling the FBI what he knows. This is clearly very bad news for Donald Trump and all those around him who colluded with Russia. It may be particularly bad news for Vice-President Mike Pence, who is attempting, with little success, to disclaim knowledge of Flynn\u2019s collusion with Russia.\n\n[correction] \u2013 I originally wrote the Northern District of Virginia as opposed to Northern Virginia"

    "text": "Sources linked to the intelligence community say that General Mike Flynn\u2019s trips to Cambridge and across Europe will form a key part of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment and the prosecutions of dozens of his associates.\n\nAccording to several sources within the intelligence community, Michael Flynn was co-ordinating, with and for Russian agents, the drafting of messages that Vladimir Putin was using to attack democracy in not only the United States, but across Europe. Furthermore, Flynn was doing this with the full knowledge of the Trump campaign, including Donald Trump himself.\n\nThis news directly relates to the data laundering performed by the Alfa Bank server on behalf of Donald Trump and Russia, where, as I reported, the Trump campaign colluded with the hacking of both the DNC and state voter databases.\n\nThe Alfa Bank server \u2018washed\u2019 that data together to tell Trump where to target it, sources say. But the messages and content with which targets were served was co-ordinated with Russia by General Flynn.\n\nFurthermore, Flynn took the same hacking tools and artificial intelligence coded in Russia and helped far-right and Nazi parties across Europe use it in their own nations. Intelligence sources assert that multiple NATO partners have evidence of this and that it has been provided to the FBI.\n\nIf \u2018data laundering\u2019 is the first part of the Trump Russia incontrovertible evidence, \u2018propaganda targeting\u2019 is the second part. Flynn attacked not only the United States but all her Western allies on Russia\u2019s behalf, with the full knowledge and connivance of Donald Trump.\n\nBoth halves of the social media impeachment will, sources assert, be key to Director Comey\u2019s overall case. This is the \u2018incontrovertible evidence\u2019 to which Sir Richard Dearlove and others have referred.\n\nThe support of our readers makes Patribotics possible. If you would like to support our journalism you can donate. You could make a contribution here, or there are buttons around the site. We thank everybody who has helped so far. You enable us to keep going.\n\nExplaining Data Laundering and Fake News\n\nThe broad case of Russia\u2019s hacking the US election can be divided into two relatively simple spheres. There is another branch of the criminal investigation that focuses on money-laundering and corrupt payments from Russia and Russian satellites to Mr. Trump and to his allies. But the actual hacking of the US election follows a relatively simple narrative line in two halves; hacking and targeting. Mr. Flynn\u2019s activities spanned the two and link them to Russian active measures all across Europe, including the current attack on the French election.\n\nAs I previously reported in an exclusive story on this blog, Alfa Bank in Russia\u2019s server was communicating to the Trump campaign hacked data from state voter databases and the DNC\u2019s own voter targeting engine, Vertica. It was also laundering money to pay these hackers to the Trump campaign. These two functions were performed by the Alfa Bank server communicating with the Trump and Spectrum Health servers.\n\nThe precise combination of these two databases allowed Cambridge Analytica and SCL both to create Russian-directed propaganda and target it at voting groups with extraordinary precision. Intelligence sources clarified that SVB bank, the second bank named in the FISA warrant I exclusively reported on Nov 7th, was also involved in messaging the Trump server, by sending Cambridge Analytica targeting and SCL propaganda to it, to be washed with the databases and money Alfa Bank was sending that server.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note \u2013 the two preceding paragraphs have been corrected. They originally erroneously said that the Alfa server was sending the voter databases to the Trump server, when in fact it was laundering money to pay to hackers and others who would spread the propaganda created by SCL]\n\nThe technology behind Cambridge Analytica\u2019s targeting was stolen from Facebook by Alexander Kogan, who has gone to Singapore and renamed himself Alex Spectre. In many ways, the Trump-Russia story begins and ends at Cambridge University. Dimtry Firtash, the corrupt Russian oligarch who is Paul Manafort\u2019s patron, gave Cambridge \u00a36 million pounds since 2010. With that money evidently came a large ring of Russian spies, probably including Kogan.\n\nFake news in the 2016 election was not, in fact, fake news. It was real propaganda, coordinated and paid for by the Russian state. General Flynn was actively involved on Russia\u2019s behalf, sources say, with discussing how this propaganda could be used and targeted across Europe and elsewhere, as well as in Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nSir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, told the Financial Times that he and other British former spies had left a dining club at Cambridge \u2013 a club to which Flynn belonged \u2013 because of concerns about Russian intelligence penetrating it. General Flynn had been a regular attendee, the story said. It added that British intelligence was extremely concerned about some \u2018startups\u2019 in Cambridge being Russian intelligence, notably Veruscript.\n\nSir Richard and his colleagues suspect that Veruscript \u2014 a newly established digital publishing house that has provided funding to set up a new journal of intelligence and to cover some of the seminar\u2019s costs \u2014 may be acting as a front for the Russian intelligence services\n\nThe story did not get much attention in the America MSM, but I recognise the worthy papers an intelligence veteran in the UK might use to front-face something for reporters. (If Sir Richard is reading this report I do hope he will consider giving it to me next time. I could have told him firewalls = death for dissemination).\n\nThe Guardian followed this up with a story about a probable woman FSB agent or asset at Cambridge, to whom General Flynn, who is as vain as he is stupid, had signed billets-doux marked \u201cGeneral Misha\u201d, the Russian word for Mike.\n\nIn Cambridge, intelligence sources say, Flynn was meeting with not only those who had coded the technology but Russian spies talking about the propaganda it should distribute.\n\nHowever, Flynn did not stop there. With the full knowledge of both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, \u201cGeneral Misha\u201d continued his Nazi \u201ctour of Europe\u201d, with meetings both in Europe and of the EU far right at Trump Tower, discussing how the Russian propaganda of SCL could be targeted directly in their countries in order to swing their elections. Notably, Flynn was caught with the head of the far-right party in Austria. This man was then invited by Donald Trump to the inauguration. Other far-right Russian allies invited to the inauguration, or who came to meet Trump Russia associates at Trump tower, and who were assisted by the Russian botnet and Russian propaganda, include Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage.\n\nSir Richard and US sources have indicated to the Guardian newspaper that Director Comey has direct and incontrovertible evidence that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia. This relates to the FISA warrant that I reported on November 7th and my April 1st report (which I had previously published as a theory) that the AlfaBank server was laundering two hacked databases together for targeting \u2013 the DNC\u2019s own and the voter registration databases. However, the other parts of that evidence, I can report today, involve General Flynn\u2019s discussions with Russian spies and the EU far-right on how they could use similar technology to hack and target Russian active measures in their own country.\n\nIn this scenario, it is easy to see that \u201cHonest Misha\u201d Flynn thought of himself as the leading commander for Russia\u2019s attack on the West.\n\nThe Microchip Russian Botnet Worked in America With Flynn and Flynn Jr \u2013 And Guido Lombardi\n\nHow the Magax3 Pac, \u201cMicrochip\u201d and the Russian botnet worked directly with Donald Trump and Mike Flynn under the aegis of Russian intelligence\n\nIf Peter Chayanov, (one of his many names), is the hacking villain of Trump-Russia, as I have previously reported, the \u2018Microchip\u2019 persona is the targeting villain of the piece.\n\nExclusively on Patribotics by Laurelai Bailey, we broke the story that one week before the DNC emails were published, Wikileaks bought two full servers located in Russia.\n\nNext, we broke the story, based on what I have called COSINT \u2013 crowdsourced, open-source intelligence \u2013 that Wikileaks had actually handed their SSL keys to Chayanov and therefore to Putin. What that means in layman terms is that the Russian dictator can now see the IP addresses of anybody reading Wikileaks, (helpful with targeting propaganda at them, as he sees what stories they are reading), and also the IP addresses used now or in the past by any donors to Wikileaks \u2013 of money or leaks. That means Putin can blackmail whistleblowers from the US military and elsewhere into becoming his spies.\n\nI further reported, based on intelligence sources that it was Chayanov\u2019s company Hostkey that US intelligence determined hacked the state voter databases (named in their October 7th statement as \u2018a Russian company\u2019). Because the USIC named Wikileaks as a Russian government actor in that same statement, and because Chayanov holds Wikileaks SSL keys and servers, USIC now knows, if it did not before, that the Russian government hacked the state voter databases. The motherlode of the DNC leaks was not the DNC emails Wikileaks released; rather, it was the Vertica database that the DNC used and which had files on the voting behavior of all listed voters (hence the BernieBros that disappeared from Twitter \u2013 they were designed to suppress the Clinton vote). The Steele Dossier, which sources say is true in all important respects, states that Russian moles in the DNC leaked the files to Russia \u2013 they were as much hackers as Snowden was at the USA. Because there are too many states to place leakers in, Chayanov was forced actually to hack the state voter registration databases.\n\nThe Trump server was washing these two databases together for targeting by the campaign as I exclusively reported, with further exclusive reporting on the precise method by TeaPainUSA, here.\n\nNext, with the accurate data provided by the data laundering, the Trump campaign needed to target voting groups with accuracy. It did this by creating fake news and ugly memes, and receiving these from Russian sources. Agents of influence of Russia used to propel these fake stories and memes included Sputnik, Jack Posobiec, and the \u201cbotnet\u201d created by Microchip, who is a composite persona. Microchip are Russian agents of influence, and began to create the pro-Trump troll net in 2015, according to Buzzfeed. As well as actual bots based on keywords, the Microchip Russian botnet used human beings and particular hashtags to push the AI themed messaging. Trump\u2019s campaign created fake news to order. Flynn\u2019s twitter account, and that of his son, were lambasted for publishing fake news, but in point of fact it is easy \u2013 and provable \u2013 to see that the Microchip botnet of Russia was tweeting from the account. Flynn\u2019s twitter used the same exact hashtags and linked back to the MagaX3 PAC. He also pushed out the Wikileaks releases of the stolen DNC material (now declared by the CIA to be Russian active measures) with hashtags like #PodestaEmails19 as they arose (remember, anybody clicking on these links had now given their IP address to Putin).\n\nFlynn was working in Trump Tower with \u2018Chief Facebook Officer\u2019 Guido Lombardi, profile in Politico EU, using their mutual hatred of Islam as a wedge issue.\n\nLombardi, who describes himself as a real estate investor with rightward political leanings, said that throughout the presidential campaign he fielded calls from representatives of a veritable Who\u2019s Who of the European Right, including French far-right leader Marine Le Pen \u2014 who was spotted in Trump Tower Thursday \u2014 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, members of Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, as well as the center-right French R\u00e9publicains party who all wanted to meet with Trump. \u2026 Lombardi\u2019s main role, he said, was to run an unofficial, guerilla-style social media operation that aimed to amplify the candidate\u2019s message online. At its height, Lombardi said the operation included sites and Facebook pages for many niche groups of Trump supporters such as \u201cBikers for Trump,\u201d \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d and \u201cVeterans for Trump.\u201d \u201cIn June of 2015, I told Donald, \u2018I\u2019d love to help,\u2019\u201d said Lombardi. \u201c\u2018But I can\u2019t work directly for the campaign because I have all kinds of rules and regulations. I will take care of unofficial media. I will take care of students. I will take care of bikers. I will take care of all the crazies \u2026 There is no official connection so [no] liability.\u2019 He said, \u2018Great.\u2019\u201d By the end of the campaign, Lombardi said he was curating some 500 online groups that were run by a network of volunteers. He said he had started some of them but did not specify how many. It was not possible to verify this claim or Lombardi\u2019s link to the websites. Several of the groups cited by Lombardi had garnered more than 100,000 \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook and featured pro-Trump memes and stories from little-known news sources.\n\nBelow, the screenshot shows Flynn pushing out this Russian co-ordinated propaganda targeted by Lombardi.\n\nLombardi, Flynn and Gaffney, along with Devin Nunes, were in the Transition Team and were willing to slam US intelligence and military leaders.\n\nFueling concerns are reports of Trump\u2019s selection of former Defense Intelligence Agency director Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn as national security adviser. Flynn was purged himself in 2014 by his superiors in the military intelligence community\u2026.Another Trump transition leader who has sharp criticisms of current military and intelligence leaders regarding the war on terrorism is House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif.\u2026 Nunes is now one of the three Trump transition officials in charge of national security appointments, along with former congressman Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., and Reagan-era official Frank Gaffney,\n\nA story that I myself reported for Heat Street in October, 2016 \u2013 before I reported the FISA warrant on Alfa Bank and SVB Bank \u2013 that concerned Trump\u2019s bots and trolls actually pointed to a lot of what is reported here. Because I did note in that story that the Russian botnet AI had spread far beyond America and existed in multiple languages.\n\nCoda: Finding A Common Message Pushed Out by Both Types of Putinbot One easy way to spot a Russian troll, whether curated or automated, is to look for them pushing out the identical message. Do we remember that \u201cPutin: How Obama Created ISIS\u201d video? This happens (see link). Please note the \u201cvarious\u201d \u201cdiverse\u201d profiles Russian men are adopting here. We have an Hispanic woman, a Muslim woman, a white far left Bernie Sanders supporter, and a patriotic redneck. \u2026 but wait! There\u2019s more! By using this method we can see how the Russian troll farm places its fictional accounts around the world and in multiple languages. Australia, Germany, Japan, Africa\u2026 Dutch, from a Holland-based account\u2026.\n\nI further pointed out that all these countries had certain tropes in common. Support for Trump, Brexit, Viktor Orban, and Nigel Farage as well as Marine Le Pen.\n\nThe interesting thing about analyzing Mom For Trump is his use of most of the tropes pushed by Breitbart\u2019s Steven Bannon, now a Trump advisor. These are: Trump Putin Russia Brexit Nigel Farage Many of the \u201cEU located\u201d Putinbots will also hawk the Russian puppet Viktor Orban, the PM of Hungary. Here\u2019s a Spanish-language Putinbot who has chucked in an avatar boosting Assad for good measure (his account reads \u201cthe tiger of damascus\u201d).\n\nIt now turns out that on his trips to Cambridge and through the EU, General Misha Flynn was specifically co-ordinating Russian propaganda for the far right.\n\nThe Alfa Bank server\u2019s washing of the voter registration and Vertica databases is one half of the incontrovertible evidence that will see Donald Trump impeached. But Moscow Mike Flynn\u2019s Treason Tour of Europe is the other half of it. Flynn is the key not only to Vladimir Putin\u2019s attack on America, but also to his attack on the entire Western World.\n\nAn attack in which Donald J Trump was fully and totally complicit."

    "authors": [

    ],
    "text": "Sources with links to the intelligence community report that Federal Marshals executed two search and seizure warrants at Trump Tower on Friday, May 19.\n\nOne of the warrants covered an electronic storage space in Trump Tower. Several electronic items were seized as a result of this search.\n\nAnother of the warrants, sources report, was served on Paul Manafort\u2019s apartment in Trump Tower.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, make a contribution here.\n\nUnlike the first warrant, this warrant was served, sources say, with \u201cconsent.\u201d That means that Mr. Manafort is almost certainly co-operating with Federal authorities.\n\nThe Trump Data team worked out of Trump Tower. Separate sources, with links to the intelligence and law enforcement communities, report that the FBI is looking at photographs posted publicly on Twitter by members of that team that appear to show a Python server connection loading on the screens of one of the Trump data team workers.\n\nThese same sources have confirmed my April reporting that the Russian Alfa Bank server, with an ip address in Trump Tower, was communicating with Russia and Spectrum Health, and that it was \u2018washing\u2019 hacked U.S. State voter database information with the social media \u2018fake news\u2019 botnet for micro-targeting to voters. There will be a separate piece of analysis on how this might relate to the \u2018electronic devices\u2019 that were seized on Friday afternoon, 19 May. Sources report that this was done \u2018very quietly\u2019, in an attempt to evade detection by the press.\n\nThe servers and data in Trump Tower, and the items taken from Manafort\u2019s apartment, may form part of the \u201csecure communications channel\u201d that Kushner wanted to establish with Russia. I broke on November 7th that a FISA warrant had been secured on any US person\u2019 in relation to two Russian banks, Alfa Bank \u2013 with whom the server was communicating \u2013 and SVB Bank. SVB Bank, which had a deal with Sberbank, is implicated in the meeting Kushner had with Gorkov. Further to that, Avi Berkowitz, who was on the Trump Data team, working with Boris Epshteyn and Brad Parscale, formed a go-between for Kushner and the Russian Ambassador.\n\nMy earlier exclusive report stated that the Kelhios botnet for which the Russian hacker Pyotr Levashov was indicted, was run out of Trump Tower with a \u2018command and control server.\u2019\n\nThe Trump sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., were interviewed by the FBI, sources say, the day before James Comey was fired. This is because, sources linked to the intelligence and law enforcement communities say, they are suspected of being complicit in the Kelhios botnet\u2019s repurposing to service and pay both pro-Russia and pro-Trump Twitter and facebook bots, but also to deliver \u2018fake news\u2019, loaded with malware, and to pay those spreading it through bitcoin transactions.\n\nOne of the reasons James Comey was illegally fired by Trump was that his investigation was at the point of interviewing Trump\u2019s own sons. For the avoidance of doubt, White House sources report that Donald Trump himself is considered by investigators to be directly complicit in Russia\u2019s hack of the American election, and Trump fears that the FBI has data-based evidence that will prove this.\n\nIf whistleblowers wish to contact patribotics they are encouraged to get in touch on Twitter, or via the secure email listed here."

If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nSources say the indictment on April 20th of Levashov in the US district court in Connecticut (where an FBI counterintelligence division is based) represents the first concrete move in court that openly leads towards the impeachment of Donald Trump and the prosecution of dozens of members of his team \u2013 because this hacker, the sources suggest, was compensated by Team Trump and the FSB jointly, and Team Trump, sources say, know it.\n\nMr. Epshteyn\u2019s lawyers have denied to me in writing that he was ever an agent of Russia, and have said that neither he nor his parents were ever agents of the Russian state. However, I stand by my prior and current reporting on this public figure, who, until recently, was a member of the US Government as staff at the White House, as well as maintaining a constant public presence as a surrogate of Mr. Trump\u2019s during the campaign, and on television for the White House after it.\n\nMultiple sources with links to the intelligence community report that:\n\nTrump Tower was a \u201ccommand and control\u201d center for the Kehlios botnet, dismantled by the FBI;\n\nThat the \u201cTrump server\u201d with a Trump Tower IP address, that was communicating with servers owned by Alfa Bank in Russia, and with Spectrum Health, had the data packets it sent opened on the hour by human members of Trump\u2019s data team, located near to Trump Tower;\n\nAs I have previously reported here at patribotics, the server was \u2018washing\u2019 the DNC\u2019s stolen, hacked \u2018Vertica\u201d database with voter registration databases \u2013 but new sources report further information that images were also sent from or to Russia, and opened by members of Trump\u2019s own team on an hourly basis\n\nThat \u201cPyotr Levashov'\u201d or \u201cPeter Severa\u201d, indicted by the FBI for running the Kehlios botnet, was recruited for the hacking effort by Mr. Epshteyn, who, sources say, was working for both the FSB and team Trump;\n\nThat in 2015, Trump Hotels was fined a pittance of $50,000 for malware and credit card fraud after it failed to correct an earlier \u201cbreach\u201d, but that this was deliberate, as the credit card malware would later be repurposed to be used in the election;\n\nThat human accounts pushing out fake memes authorized by Russia were paid, via the Kelhios botnet being operated from Trump HQ, using bitcoin and a spam payments system previously used for pornography;\n\nAnd that Pyotr Levashov, aka Peter Severa, is also connected to one Dante Jimenez, another top spammer who himself connects back to Hostkey \u2013 the Russian company controlled by Vladimir Putin, with servers in the Russian academy of sciences, that hosts Wikileaks\n\nSources further attest that the FBI intercepted the traffic between the Alfa Bank server and Mr. Trump\u2019s server, and know exactly what was transmitted\n\nSources further report that there were at least two other \u201cmother servers\u201d, other than the one with the Trump Tower IP address, and the Spectrum Health server that simultaneously pinged Alfa Bank. Sources indicate that one of these two servers was at Spectrum Health, and transferred messages to Russia via a method called \u201ciodine xfer transfer\u201d, but that the US intelligence community intercepted all such messages\n\nSources close to the intelligence community indicate that the indictment of Pyotr Levashov in Connecticut this week represents the FBI \u2018making its move\u2019 to begin proceedings against Trump and his team, as, these sources say, Trump and many of those working for his campaign are well aware that they are tied by data to the criminal activities of Mr. Levashov\n\nMultiple, other sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one country, who were not the original sources on my exclusive story that Carter Page took a recording of Donald Trump to Moscow, confirm that this story is true.\n\nThere will be extensive further reporting on this exclusive story; please check back for updates."

    "text": "Update: A patriot on Twitter has found another plane, not appearing in the Beauty Central fleet listed online, N789LR, serial number 5100, that made a stop in Belgium in September. She is a GV, with Mode S listed as 52531377\n\nWhen the Steele dossier was published by Buzzfeed, with an entirely appropriate amount of caveats, other journalistic outlets rushed to pour cold water on it, and wrongly so.\n\nChief among these was CNN. Acting as if Buzzfeed had not offered caveats alongside the publication, CNN blasted the news site as though they had irresponsibly published \u2018fake news\u2019.\n\nIn fact, the credibility of Chris Steele was sky-high in the intelligence community, and the heads of all three agencies had included his dossier as an addendum to the Russian hacking report they produced for the President (Obama, at the time; but Trump was also given a version of it).\n\nOne bit of journalistic malfeasance committed by CNN was that they rubbished the dossier\u2019s claims on Michael Cohen without doing independent journalistic research of their own.\n\nInanely, CNN claimed that they had it \u201cconfirmed\u201d that Michael Cohen was not in Prague, Czech Republic, when the dossier said he was.\n\nThey based this on the fact that, as they claimed, \u201ca different Michael Cohen\u201d had been in Prague around that time, according to a passport stamp. This has nothing to do with the matter one way or the other, and a little thought by CNN would have borne that out. The dossier alleged that Cohen went to Prague and another EU country; that was rated as low confidence as to both location and to exact timing. August, at one point; late August or early September at another point. Furthermore, Steele did not, contrary to CNN\u2019s implication, present location or timing as a fact. It was secondhand; he reported as fact that Kremlin insiders said this, and Steele rated the exact location and timing as low confidence.\n\nMore interesting was the substance of Steele\u2019s allegations as to why \u2013 he reported sources said \u2013 Cohen was meeting Russians outside of the US. Firstly, it was to pay off hackers. The dossier made the claim that these were both the hackers who had attacked Clinton, and a company that ran a Twitter botnet (possibly also a Facebook one as I shall later report).\n\nI took as my starting point the idea that the Steele dossier should be believed and would be for the most part correct; and that it was more likely to be right than wrong. The reason I took this attitude is that all three heads of US intelligence agencies had included Steele\u2019s dossier as an adjunct to their report to the President.\n\nThat is utterly extraordinary and represents a massive vote of confidence in Steele\u2019s work. The heads of the FBI, CIA and NSA are not in the habit of including tabloid sensationalism in their official reports, whether as an adjunct or anything else. I do not wish to waste too much time on this, as the report was self-evidently believed to be credible; but contrary to lazy reporting by CNN and others, the dossier was not rubbished by the same agency heads who included it. They said they had not verified the whole of it. That is all. And, again, since parts of the work were not independently verified, its inclusion by the IC represented a colossal vote of confidence in the credibility of Chris Steele (if you are reading this sir please get in touch with me. You are a patriot, may God bless you).\n\nTracking Planes (for No Fun and No Profit)\n\nVery well then. I posted on Twitter that \u2018unverified\u2019 and \u2018unverifiable\u2019 are not synonymous and I started looking for ways to verify the dossier. The first clue was that Cohen did not deny it. Rather, he gave fatuous and whataboutery excuses. To Rosie Gray of the Atlantic, Mr. Cohen stated that he had gone to Los Angeles from the 23rd August onwards. He then tweeted:\n\nFeeling like a @ RadarOnlineCom celebrity debunking the Russia connection\u2026all thanks to my daughter\u2019s Instagram\n\nRadar Online is owned by Pecker, of \u2018Trump loves Pecker\u2019 fame. The piece tweeted by Cohen, who presumably handed Radar their lines, stated that there was \u201cproof\u201d that Cohen never left the USA in August based on metadata from his Twitter account:\n\nMetadata from Cohen\u2019s account confirms that he never posted from outside the United States in the entire month of August.\n\nThe piece also contains video of Cohen on the Sean Hannity show, which is instructional. Cohen says he has never been to Prague and \u2018proved\u2019 it to Mr. Trump by showing Mr. Trump his passport. Cohen also points Hannity to the \u2018other Michael Cohen\u2019 jumped on by CNN as \u2018proof\u2019 that Steele had got it wrong.\n\nBreaking Down Cohen\u2019s Statements and Inferring Why He Made Them\n\nCohen therefore wanted us to believe that:\n\na) his social media accounts could prove his whereabouts\n\nb) the second Michael Cohen being in Prague meant that he himself could not also have been in Prague\n\nc) The lack of a stamp in his passport proves he could not have left the country.\n\nTaking as my starting point that Chris Steele is likely correct, I would treat all of the above as likely true on the face of it, but actually false in implied meaning; so that let us assume yes, a different Michael Cohen was in Prague; let us assume that Michael Cohen\u2019s current passport has no stamp for Prague or out of the country at all in the month of August and September; and that his social media accounts do not have any nice easy \u2018Sent from Prague\u2019 or \u2018sent from Moscow\u2019 geotagging on them.\n\nNone of that would, however, disprove the allegations in the Steele dossier, which is the implication behind making those assertions.\n\nIt is disappointing that American media would treat the one as proving the other. CNN spoke with reverence of a \u2018second Michael Cohen\u2019 as if that somehow meant the first one could not have left the United States. A Twitter account I now believe to be a peddler of disinformation tried to feed out the line that Cohen had an Israeli passport with a single day\u2019s difference, explained by the time difference, and that he used this. Now, it is certainly possible that there is only one Michael Cohen who was in Prague on an Israeli passport rather than an American one. But \u2018Michael Cohen\u2019 is a common enough name. And the dossier alleged that Cohen was meeting Russian intelligence in order to arrange payment for hackers of the election.\n\nIt is a fact, indeed, that a Russian hacker, Yvgeny Nikulin, came to Prague to be paid on October 5th and was picked up there by Cezch intelligence on a red warrant from the FBI.\n\nHow likely is it that a lawyer representing Donald Trump and meeting with Russian intelligence, to pay off hackers that had attacked the US election on behalf of Russia, would have any stamps in his passport of any country? He would be trying for secrecy, and even if Mr. Cohen is a risible fool, as he is, adamantly denying he had ever been to Prague:\n\nI have never been to Prague in my life. #fakenews\n\nand then telling the Wall Street Journal that he had been to Prague in 2001; even if, as I say, Mr. Cohen was a bombastic fool, Russian intelligence were not fools, and they would, presumably, take good care to get Mr. Cohen into and out of the United States without any stamp in any passport he might legitimately own; and with no record of exit or entry into the United States.\n\nMr. Cohen\u2019s Story Is Provably Untrue\n\nCohen\u2019s story unraveled immediately, in so far as he contradicted himself to the Wall Street Journal about \u2018ever\u2019 going to Prague. But perhaps he forgot, even though Prague is a very lovely city. Being generous, Mr. Cohen is a well-traveled man, who might indeed have forgotten a trip some 15 years ago. However, he made other, stupid slip-ups. He told Rosie Gray at the Atlantic:\n\nCohen said that he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August, and that the rest of the month he was in New York.\n\nHowever, Cohen\u2019s own timeline includes a tweet that shows that on the 24th August he was at Newark airport.\n\nI have repeatedly asked Rosie Gray why she has not amended her story to note Cohen\u2019s statement to her is false, but she has not yet responded.\n\nWhy would Cohen lie about this? He also makes strange statements on how it can be \u2018verified\u2019 that he was where he says he was later in the month; calling other people, etc. Frankly all Mr. Cohen would need to do would be to produce some credit card receipts or photographs of himself in the US. He has not done so, according to other journalists also working on substantiating the dossier.\n\nAll Thanks to My Daughter\u2019s Instagram\n\nMr. Cohen told the world that we should examine his adult daughter\u2019s instagram account, so I did just that. With the help of various people on Twitter, I was able to get precise dates on some of Ms. Cohen\u2019s pictures.\n\nOne such picture she posted showed that she boarded a flight back to the United States on January 2nd. (If it was indeed ever deleted, it is now back online). Prior to that, she had been in St. Bart\u2019s. This was mildly interesting to me since Russians, and particularly Chelsea\u2019s Roman Abramovitch, descend on St. Bart\u2019s every Christmas.\n\nThe picture was taken from a window seat and showed a distinctive marking on the wingtip. I asked on Twitter if pilots or other aviation professionals could help me identify the plane. Immediately a number came forward to state that it was a Gulfstream, which they could tell by the positioning of the wing flaps relative to the rest of the wing. They further identified the plane as a G5, specifically. Shortly after that, somebody found the plane and found the tail number. It was N999LR.\n\nI then researched the ownership of this plane. It was registered to \u2018Beauty LLC\u2019. Through ordinary flight trackers I could determine that she had flown from St. Maarten to HPN, a small airport in Westchester. There was quite a bit of diving into \u2018Beauty LLC\u2019. At first they appeared to be something to do with Cohen, as they were registered in the same building as some of his companies. But Beauty LLC owned several planes in its fleet. I started to wonder how Mr. Cohen, doubtless a successful lawyer, could be rich enough to own not one but several private jets.\n\nThe small airport where the jets live, HPN, is next to a ConAir facility and also, I am told, although I have not yet checked this out, one of Donald Trump\u2019s golf courses. It appeared to be more probable that the planes were owned by ConAir and that (although common) the \u2018LR\u2019 at the end of the tail number might stand for \u2018Leandro Rizutto\u2019, the owner of ConAir.\n\nI put this question to Mr. Cohen on Twitter and his reply was most helpful. Showing him a screengrab of his daughter\u2019s Instagram picture, I asked him how often he flew Mr. Rizutto\u2019s planes out of the country. I also asked Cohen where he was between August 19th and August 22nd. He had given wrongful information to Rosie Gray that he was in LA from the 23rd August, when in fact, his TL showed him tweeting from Newark on the 24th. His timeline on Twitter also geotagged one tweet late on the 19th August and another on the 22nd August. I asked him:\n\nYou know when you told us all to look at your daughter\u2019s instagram? We did. Where were you August 19-22? # LeandroRizutto\n\nMr. Cohen replied:\n\n. @ LouiseMensch in Los Angeles\u2026verified by the press. This picture was taken in January, 2017\n\nThat was fascinating. I had tagged my tweet #LeandroRizutto and Cohen did not dispute my identification of this plane. Furthermore, his tweet was utterly perplexing to me. He said that his whereabouts \u201cAugust 19-22\u201d had been verified by the press, but they had not been. His (false) statement to the Atlantic only claimed (wrongly) that he was in LA from the 23rd onwards. He had tweeted from Newark on the 24th. Why would Cohen say that? on August 19th, late, he was tweeting with geolocation from Manhattan, NY (and therefore could not have been in Los Angeles). On the 22nd, again, he is geolocated by a tweet from Manhattan,New York. So he was not \u201cin Los Angeles\u201d nor could \u201cthe press\u201d verify something his own Twitter adamantly contradicted.\n\nBased on my knowledge of men in general, I would venture to argue that they are creatures of habit. If Mr. Cohen, who in some way seemed to be linked to Beauty Central, had flown Rizutto\u2019s G5 (assuming my guess was correct, and Cohen did not contradict it) back from vaycay in St. Bart\u2019s, was it not probable he\u2019d flown with him before?\n\nPlanes, too, loomed large in the overall story of the Trump camp\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia. Dimity Rybolovev\u2019s plane had landed for what quite clearly seemed to be tarmac meetings with the Trump camp in Charlotte, NC, on Nov 3; Las Vegas, Nevada; and . Rybolvev\u2019s plane MKATE had also been parked in the Hamptons when the Cohen family appeared to be in residence there.\n\nAsking Mr. Cohen About A Flight to the Bahamas, August 19-22\n\nI pulled the flight history for two planes that were still active in the same fleet. N999LR \u2013 a G5, the plane that appeared in Mr. Cohen\u2019s daughter\u2019s instagram \u2013 showed a curious gap in its flight history in August, all the way through to late September, of which more later.\n\nN555LR, the G4, had however flown to the Bahamas on August 19 taking the flight path HPN-FOK-Nassau. She returned August 22nd the same route. This broadly fits the gap in Mr. Cohen\u2019s Twitter timeline, although one tweet shows as being geolocated in Manhattan after the outbound flight. I asked Mr. Cohen if he had been on that flight. He had answered me that he was in Los Angeles on 19-22nd, but his Twitter timeline shows he was not. I put this question to him whether he took either flight to or from the Bahamas in that period. He has not responded and later blocked me on Twitter.\n\nI do not assert that Mr. Cohen was on that flight. The allegation against him made in the dossier is, however, a legitimate one for journalists to investigate. I believe that the issue of passports and \u2018another Michael Cohen\u2019 is a red herring. Mr. Cohen is accused of having met with Russian intelligence, and it is highly likely that were this to be true, the Russians could get him in and out of America without a passport being stamped at all.\n\nMy theory of how this might have happened is as follows. Mr. Cohen would have taken the flight out, possibly being picked up in West Hampton at the FOK stop. In the Bahamas, he would have disembarked on the tarmac and boarded another plane \u2013 rather as MKate arranged tarmac meetings. This plane would have flown him to the EU or to Russia, where he would either have not disembarked at all, meeting somebody on board the plane, or disembarked using fake documents provided by Russia, diplomatic cover, a bribe to a guard at a friendly private airport or any number of other ruses by which a state spying actor could disembark an asset. He would have arranged some kind of payment, as the dossier alleges, and then got back on the plane, landed in Nassau, and taken N555LR back to FOK and/or HPN.\n\nIndeed, the limits on this analysis are only bounded by two geolocated tweets from Manhattan on the 19th and 22. Had Mr. Cohen handed his phone to somebody else to place those tweets for him, he could have boarded the plane on the 19th and spent longer in the EU or Russia, returning to Newark airport on the morning of the 24th in order to catch his flight to Los Angeles.\n\nI strongly suspect that Mr. Cohen did really have the use of his own phone by the 24th, if only because he made that obvious error in stating that he had been in Los Angeles on the 23rd.\n\nLater Mr. Cohen backtracked to me blustering that Newark was an airport and that he had flown Virgin to his daughter in LA \u2013 presumably verifiable. But he told Rosie Gray he was in Los Angeles on the 23rd and he asserted to me he was in Los Angeles on 19-22nd. What plane did he take there on the 19th, then? If I were the FBI I would ask that question.\n\nHiding the Planes, Or Planes in Plane Sight?\n\nSeparately to the issue of Mr. Cohen\u2019s whereabouts as asserted vs his Twitter timeline, August 19 \u2013 24th inclusive, I had become interested in the planes of Beauty LLC.\n\nAgain, I make no assertion that Mr. Cohen did indeed fly to the Bahamas on August 19-22nd on N555LR. But as a journalist, I am interested in exploring the theory of how it might have happened, and if so, what that implied.\n\nIn the entirely theoretical situation in which this fleet of planes carried Cohen to the first leg of a clandestine meeting with Russian intelligence they would repay looking at.\n\nSo I looked.\n\nWhat follows owes a great deal to a number of patriotic aviation professionals current and former who assisted me on Twitter and whom I will credit in an update to this article if I receive their permissions.\n\nThe first thing noted by almost everybody was that there was an improbably large gap in the flight history of the GV, N999LR. This gap covered August and September 2016. Those are, of course, the dates that the Steele dossier alleges there were meetings with the Trump camp and Russia.\n\nI make no allegation here of malfeasance on the part of Beauty LLC, its owners, or anybody else. I plan simply to report the unusual facts that I found in public records and to allow intelligence professionals and mainstream media journalists with more resources than I have to investigate whether or not what I report here has a simple and innocuous explanation, which it may well do, or not.\n\nThe flight histories of all planes in the fleet were made private soon after I started asking public questions about them. That could easily be, of course, simply because private jet owners and charter users prefer privacy. Nonetheless I continued to look.\n\nAircraft are identified by a number of markers. The N-number, which can be changed; the serial number of the aircraft; and the S-code number or number of the transponder.\n\nLooking at the current and former fleet of Beauty Central LLC I discovered the three following odd things, which I will the evidence of in a postscript in order to get to the meat of my possibly relevant (and possibly not relevant) discovery:\n\nThe N-Number N450GA, a G1V, was shown as registered to Beauty Central and then to two other registrants. All of those planes had different serial numbers listed in the database. All, however, shared the identical S-Code transponder number. The N-number N33LR was used in Beauty Central for two entirely separate planes; a GV with serial number 5031, and a GIV with serial number 1495. However, these two entirely separate planes were listed in the database as sharing one S-Code transponder number. A GV with the serial number 5031 was listed as registered to Beauty Central LLC on August 3, 2016. Its N-number was N795BA. However, this GV 5031 had a **different transponder S-Code number ** than when GV 5031 was named N33LR, see above. N795BA\u2019s last trackable flight was on August 12, after which, she goes dark. When one of my volunteer patriot researchers, who had first seen N450GA listed in Beauty Central LLC\u2019s fleet as a former plane of their with status \u2018inactive\u2019 looked again, she found that it no longer appeared for her in the list:\n\nN795BA \u2013 the number no longer appears in the FAA\u2019s database for 5031. A pilot described it to me as \u2018weird as hell\u2019 that this deregistered number was not the FAA database. They are meant to stay here.\n\nThis was sufficient to start tracking every plane in the fleet, current or former. To be clear, as I have said, there may well be an innocent explanation. But it is at the least unusual to have two different aircraft sharing the same transponder S-Code \u2013 and for one of those aircraft, the GV, serial number 5031, that became N795BA after being N33LR, to switch transponder numbers between incarnations.\n\nSince I had a gap in August from August 12th on in the G5(s) N999LR, N795BA and N33LR, I chose to look \u2013 and was alerted to \u2013 the flights of N450GA.\n\nReaders who are not already dead from boredom will recall that what was odd about N450GA is that although the N-Number appeared to leave Beauty Central\u2019s fleet, and be assigned to two other companies\u2019 planes with different serial numbers, the S-Code transponder number was always the same. Furthermore, N450GA showed flights in the same period that the GV/s of Beauty Central \u2013 N999LR and N795BA \u2013 showed no flights.\n\nTherefore I will report what trackers showed N450GA did in that period. I make no allegation that Mr. Cohen or Beauty Central had anything to do with these flights, but they are worth investigation based on my reporting about what appears to be unusual data on the registrations of the fleet.\n\nOn August 12, she flew from Detroit to Halifax. On August 13, from Halifax to Lyon, in France. On August 14th, she flew, according to records, from just outside Florence to just outside Moscow. (There does not appear to be any record of the flight from Lyon to Florence). And on August 15th, she flew from Moscow to remote Wyoming, to Bow National Forest.\n\nUPDATE: a pilot tells me the plane did not stop in Wyoming but flew to San Jose:\n\nProbably not significant, but N450GA does not end in Wyoming on 8/15. In my data, the track is lost temporarily (2245Z-2330Z) 45,000 ft above Provo, Utah, picks up again above Nevada and lands in San Jose, CA.\n\nThat is, thus far, what my researches have shown. It certainly does not prove Mr. Cohen went to the Bahamas or met with anybody in Moscow. But as he was not where he said he was, and as he is keen to pretend that Twitter data can alone prove whereabouts, I believe that it is worth asking about.\n\nMr. Cohen\u2019s Apparent Relationship With Pro-Russian Twitter Trolls Fits One Allegation Made in the Dossier\n\nWhen I started talking to Mr. Cohen on Twitter asking about his whereabouts on August 19-22, immediately a bunch of fake Putinbot accounts, some with Ukranian IP addresses, started to @ me. Mr. Cohen would also himself RT these accounts. In particular they started making excuses for Cohen\u2018s whereabouts. One Russian troll RTed things like this. The dossier alleges that Mr. Cohen paid a company that ran a bot net out of Russia, which infected Democrats and others with viruses. He certainly regularly retweets Putinbots who seem to know him well, and to be directly connected to the Trump administration. He said to me he would meet me around the first week of March. Others tweeted and instantly deleted that Cohen was at a Chris Christie fundraiser when he said he was in LA.\n\nThis same Putinbot account tweeted:\n\n@ MichaelCohen212 is an amazing man who has done an amazing job! lots of behind the scenes work getting us President Trump!\n\nUnder this, there was a gif of Vladimir Putin clapping.\n\nIf Mr. Cohen comes back to me with a substantive reply on August 19-22 that is not wrong on its face, I will update this post.\n\nAddendum:\n\nA few images relating to plane registrations discussed above. More will be added later.\n\nN450GA has the transponder 51271263 \u2013 serial 4189\n\nNow N555LR, Serial number 4189, but a different transponder number: 51611410\n\nN999LR, serial number 5481, Mode S Code 53372434\n\nN33LR was used as for a GV, 5031, and a G4, 1495\n\nBut both of these aircraft shared the same transponder number \u2013 50712200 \u2013 when they each bore this N-Number. Sources say this is odd\n\nAs N795BA, the GV with serial number 5031 had a different transponder to this: now it is 52545262\n\nAnd as N899AL, the G4 with serial number 1495 ALSO had a different transponder number \u2013 now it\u2019s Mode S Code 53063316\n\nAll pretty strange, as is the simultaneous delivery date of one plane to (apparently) two companies:\n\nAs I have written, there may be a perfectly simple explanation for all of it, but I believe it is worth journalists examining."

The British, Ukranians and Germans all have recordings of Carter Page in Moscow offering treason for hacking, and recordings of Page playing the tape of Donald Trump for his Moscow paymasters, wherein Trump promises unspecificed (to us) shifts of policy in exchange for hacking help.\n\nAs I reported exclusively at Patribotics, this tape was discussed with Sergei Kislyak by Trump, Manafort, Page and Epshteyn. As I further reported, Sergei Kislyak\u2019s phone was \u2018hot miked\u2019 through an SS7 exploit by a Five Eyes nation for a portion of last year. By request, I am withholding the nation and the amount of time that Kislyak\u2019s phone was recording all those with whom he came in contact*. I will report on exactly how each nation holds this intelligence when I come to Carter Page.\n\nThe United Kingdom in particular has a treasure trove of intelligence on Donald Trump. Before Nigel Farage \u2013 acting as a courier, sources say \u2013 went in to see Julian Assange, Donald Trump called his phone (the previous night). British intelligence taped that conversation, sources say, as Farage was under surveillance, and have provided the resulting fresh evidence of treason to the USIC.\n\nJulian Assange\u2019s conversations about Trump and with his couriers are all on tape. British intelligence and the NSA have been inside the Ecuadorean Embassy for some time. There is disbelief, sources report, in many conversations between the two closest intelligence partners in the world, America and Britain, at how stupid the Russians and Ecuadoreans have been to believe Julian Assange\u2019s pitiable assertions that his communications were ever secure.\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nVladimir Putin, for the avoidance of doubt, was recorded by both British intelligence and private allied intelligence firms of more than one nation, directly ordering an attack on the United States election and on Hillary Clinton. This recording was given to the Washington Post, and they held it back out of respect for US intelligence, for which I applaud them.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, make a contribution here.\n\nDonald Trump Jr\n\nDonald Trump Jr was directly taped by the French before the election, colluding treacherously with the Russians. As with all NATO allies who are not part of the Five Eyes agreement, there is no legal reason why they cannot directly tape Americans abroad. The FBI would need permission with a FISA warrant to listen to any such intelligence on U.S. persons.\n\nEric Trump\n\nThe SIGINT on Eric Trump is mostly held by the United States. Eric, who is not loved by his father nearly as much as his sister Ivanka, has been left holding the baby on the Kelhios botnet. As his father tries to scrub Ivanka from Trump holding companies like TIHM, he has left Eric in place. The Kelhios botnet was delivered from Trump Tower by a command and control center activated by Eric Trump.\n\nHowever, the United Kingdom also holds SIGINT on Eric Trump, because it had ears on the Alfa Bank boardroom, and Eric\u2019s communications with Alfa Bank washed through the server in Trump Tower and the Spectrum Health server were intercepted by the NSA \u2013 as all the packet data was \u2013 but the UK owned the phones, computers and boardrooms on the Russian end, so has \u2018written\u2019 SIGINT on Eric Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump\n\nIvanka Trump is on tape with multiple unnamed allied intelligence services over her fraudulent hotel in Baku, sources report. She is on tape talking to her traitor husband Jared about the hack on America. Most significantly and recently Australia has Ivanka Trump on tape talking treason with the Chinese, who allied with Russia in its attempt to hack America. Australian intelligence and the great nation of Australia herself were grossly insulted by Bannon and Schiller when Nick Warner, the head of Australia\u2019s ASD, their CIA equivalent, underwent a cavity search at the US border on a diplomatic passport. Trump deliberately leaked his insults to the Australian PM on an early diplomatic call. Australia is taking a quiet delight in knowing that they have the most damning evidence against Trump\u2019s disgustingly preferred child Ivanka Trump, whom, sources say, is not \u201ccomplicit\u201d in standing by for treason and criminality but is an active participant in it.\n\nMike Pence\n\nThe SIGINT on Mike Pence, and there is a lot of it, is held mainly by the USIC. I will write an article separately later detailing the case on Pence. Russia holds extensive kompromat on Pence, having hacked his emails to keep him in line. Mike Pence is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Moscow.\n\nPaul Ryan\n\nAgain, SIGINT on Ryan is the near-exclusive preserve of the USIC and RIS (Russian Intelligence Services).\n\nMitch McConnell\n\nAlmost exclusively American intelligence on McConnell, with, among enemy nations, Iran and Russia both having a good deal of their own. A separate article follows.\n\nTrey Gowdy\n\nSIGINT on Gowdy is extensive from the USIC but also Great Britain, in that Britain still gathers intelligence in her overseas territories like the British Virgin Islands. A separate piece follows.\n\nDevin Nunes\n\nPortugal\u2019s intelligence service has had Devin Nunes on tape for quite some time. He is a loathsome traitor and long-time colluder with Russia. When Nunes ran to the White House in the dead of night it is because he saw his own name legally unmasked in those transcripts. Nunes would love to make a deal but the FBI is not interested.\n\nMike Flynn\n\nAs I exclusively reported, Flynn, who is as delusional as he is dishonorable, was taped by almost every European intelligence service. Great Britain has extraordinary amounts of SIGINT on Flynn, as it has been gathering intel on the Russian spy ring at Cambridge for some years now. Flynn\u2019s role in the Russian hack is under-appreciated. He is one of the greatest traitors in American history, and his treason far pre-dates the present lunatic operation of Vladimir Putin.\n\nMike Flynn Jr\n\nOne consideration motivating Flynn\u2019s extensive squealing to the USIC \u2013 he has no more loyalty to his fellow criminals than he had to the United States \u2013 is his desire to spare the life of his son Mike Jr. The younger Flynn, currently under investigation for espionage, traveled with his father to Russia for RT, coordinated with Sputnik operatives like Cassandra Fairbanks in the US, and pushed RIS propaganda and malware. He was taped in Russia by Great Britain as part of MI6\u2019s wholescale ownership of all Kremlin comms \u2013 that is to say that the UK listened to the remote and local mikes on any Russian with whom Flynn jr was conversing \u2013 but most SIGINT on Flynn Jr is held in America.\n\nSteve Bannon\n\nMostly held by the USA and Russia. Bannon has been a Russian asset of medium significance for at least five years.\n\nReince Priebus\n\nSergei Kislyak was under surveillance by the NSA throughout 2016. The NSA has SIGINT on Reince Priebus resulting from this, that is extensive, and now in possession of the FBI.\n\nHowever, in terms of foreign allies, Saudi Arabia has recent SIGINT on Reince Priebus. According to our impeccable sources, Mr. Priebus decided to \u2018run\u2019 when in Saudi Arabia. He panicked when he learned on Air Force One what the SIGINT gained from surveillance of Kislyak at the RNC amounted to. I exclusively reported there was a RICO case against the entire GOP as a body; this is because they accepted, via Reince Priebus, washed Russian money, sources say. The way in which this was to be laundered was recorded at the RNC, sources say. Saudi Arabian intelligence picked up a voice recording of a panicked Mr. Priebus, fresh off the plane, claiming he would seek asylum, sources say. He was under a UFAP warrant, sources with links to the U.S. Marshals report, and was immediately brought back to America under compulsion by Air Marshals who had been placed on Air Force One, these sources say, less than 24 hours later.\n\nMr. Priebus\u2019s quick return was covered by a passive mainstream media who did no investigating into why he was brought home. I knew why Priebus had returned but withheld that report at the request of sources with links to non-US intelligence. I have now been granted permission and even encouraged to report everything relating to allied intelligence on Trump Russian suspects.\n\nThis report will be updated with a Part II tomorrow.\n\nMore of our exclusive reporting:\n\n=*Stop sniggering at the back, 007."

    "text": "Sources with links to the Five Eyes intelligence communities report that the entire meeting that Donald J Trump Jr and Jared Kushner took with Russian intelligence over Hillary Clinton\u2019s hacked emails is on tape. Multiple recordings and transcripts exist. At least one set of these is in the hands of British intelligence at GCHQ.\n\nIt is presumed but not known for certain, therefore, that US intelligence would already have these recordings.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting. If you can, please donate and support our work. There are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nThe Five Eyes agreement prohibits the United Kingdom both from surveilling Americans without judicial permission from the US and from conducting surveillance operations on American soil. However, exploits allowing the phones of every Russian national at the meeting to be used as a \u201chot mike\u201d, in other words, to record what those around them are saying, had already been placed on the phones of the Russian intelligence agents and assets present. This excludes Boris Epshteyn, who although he is an FSB agent and a long-term Russian asset, these sources say, is also a U.S. citizen. Mr. Epshteyn, through lawyers, has adamantly denied that he is an FSB agent and has demanded Patribotics remove reporting on him. Although I have updated my stories to reflect his denials, I stand by my reporting. Mr. Epshteyn\u2019s lawyers declined, in writing, to say whether or not he had been advised by the FBI or law enforcement to register under FARA, the Foreign Agents Registration Act, instead asking me who my sources were and when I received my information from them, questions to which I in turn have refused to respond.\n\nThe resulting recordings form a complete record of the meeting. If, as must be assumed, British intelligence has passed them to their American counterparts, the evidence would be fully legal as any Americans on tape would be \u201cincidental collection\u201d to the targeting of the Russian spies Kushner, Trump Jr and Epshteyn met with in order to commit espionage against the integrity of a US election with a foreign power."

    "text": "Sources with links to the justice department report that Fox News is under an FBI counterintelligence investigation for co-ordinating with the Kremlin in broadcasting propaganda.\n\nWhile the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and journalistic freedom, sources say that signals intelligence gathered from so-called \u2018incidental collection,\u2019 such as NSA collection on Sputnik and Russia Today, which is ongoing.\n\nSpecifically, Sean Hannity is on signals intelligence co-ordinating his pro-Trump message with organs of the Russian state, such as RT, Sputnik, Wikileaks and Julian Assange. However, emails co-ordinating messaging with registered agents of the Russian state are said to exist from more shows than that of Sean Hannity.\n\nFurthermore, sources familiar with the matter say that the FBI is actively considering a referral to the FCC, in addition to any criminal prosecutions that may result for individuals not registering under FARA for coordinating with official agents of the Russian state.\n\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate , there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\n\nA great many of Fox News\u2019 employees, anchors and executives have reported fearlessly on Trump and Russia, including Shep Smith. The problems appear to be executive based and systemic, these sources say, and a referral to the FCC is being considered. The First Amendment protects journalistic freedom, but systemic and repeated coordination with official organs of the Russian state is regarded as knowing collaboration with an enemy attack on America. Referral to the FCC is an option under consideration at a corporate level, sources report, and prosecutions for chief malicious actors, in particular Sean Hannity, are probable, these sources say."
