    "authors": [],
    "text": "\"He spends a lot of time trying to figure out how he can make ... a character different, while still sort of having\u2026 the Sam Jackson persona,\" Steve Kroft says about the actor Samuel L. Jackson, whom he profiles this week on 60 Minutes.\n\nOne place Jackson finds inspiration for his myriad of often intense, raw, commanding movie characters is at his favorite comic book store, where the owners keep a bin of new comic books for Jackson to review. \"He's a big reader of comic books. It's just a constant source of ideas for him,\" Kroft tells 60 Minutes Overtime's Ann Silvio.\n\n\"[Comic books] give me great ideas for interesting character quirks that I want to have in a movie,\" Jackson tells Kroft.\n\nThe one and only Star Wars purple light saber\n\nBelow is a transcript of Overtime's story: \"Who wouldn't want to hang out with Samuel L. Jackson?\"\n\nANN SILVIO: He's the kind of actor\u2026 you know, who wouldn't wanna hang out with Samuel L. Jackson?\n\nSTEVE KROFT: Right.\n\nANN SILVIO: Your interview lets us all do that.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: Oh, that's good.\n\nCAMERA CREW: OK. We're rolling.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: Ok.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: You got like eight pages of stuff.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: I know, man.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: I am not that interesting\u2026\n\nSTEVE KROFT: He's very funny, shrewd, and he's also a great, he's really a great actor, which he doesn't always get credit for.\n\nANN SILVIO: Sometimes he's the best part of sort of a bad movie.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: Quite often he's the best part of a bad movie.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: I've been in movies where I know that I did things that woulda made the movie better, and they didn't make it to the movie. One of the first movies I was in in Hollywood, and I remember, first day I got there, was the first scene I did on that movie and when I finished doing that scene, everybody on set was crying. Everybody's like, \"Oh my God.\" It was like, \"Nailed it.\" And I get there to watch the movie, and it's gone. And it's like\u2026\n\nANN SILVIO: In your interviews we see all of his performer's tools on display. We see the way he uses his body, his voice\u2026\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: For real? Really?\n\nANN SILVIO: \u2026his facial expressions.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: His eyes.\n\nANN SILVIO: His eyes.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: He's really a performer. He's an entertainer. Which makes him\u2026\n\nANN SILVIO: Just innately.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: Yes, innately. And he spends a lot of time trying to figure out how he can make such and such a character different, while still sort of having the\u2026 you know, the Sam Jackson persona.\n\nCAMERA CREW: This is Samuel Jackson at comic book store, take one.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: Comic books have changed a bit since the day.\n\nSTEVE KROFT He's a big reader of comic books. It's just a constant source of ideas for him.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: Mom and Pop store. Really nice people. Hey, man, good to see ya.\n\nANN SILVIO: And you went to a comic book store with him?\n\nSTEVE KROFT: So you never outgrew 'em?\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: No, I did not. And they give me great ideas for interesting character quirks that I want to have in a movie.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: Give me an example.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: There's this one series called 100 Bullets. And it's, you know, there's some interesting criminal guys in there that have interesting traits. And I think one of them had a lisp in one of the things. So I stole that for Kingsman.\n\nFILM: KINGSMAN:\n\nI have trouble understanding you people sometimes. You all talk so funny.\n\nANN SILVIO: He talked about playing a bad guy and making bad guys likeable.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: Bad guys don't wake up thinking they're bad guys. So you try and keep people as human as you possibly can keep them like Jules in Pulp Fiction. Yeah, he's a killer, but when you first meet those two guys, you don't really know they're killers. They're just two guys in a car talkin' about, you know, a trip in Europe\u2026\n\nFILM: PULP FICTION:\n\nJules: What do they call a Big Mac?\n\nVincent: A Big Mac is a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.\n\nJules: Le Big Mac\u2026\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: They're just ordinary humans that do ordinary human things until you incite them.\n\nFILM: PULP FICTION:\n\nGuy: We got into this thing with the best intentions, really. I never\u2026\n\n[gunshot]\n\nJules: Oh, I'm sorry did I break your concentration. I didn't mean to do that. Please continue.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: I always think that my facility for language comes from a lot of different things. You know, 1) I read a lot. And 2) when I was very small, we didn't have television. So my grandfather and I listened to radio drama on the radio. So I learned to hear stories and how to make the words kind of flow and roll over each other, and do stuff. It was always fun. And my grandfather would make me tell him stories. He would, like, tell me stories. And then he'd make me tell him a story.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: I think that, he says that the one thing he tries to do is always figure out what the audience wants, what they want to see. He's interested in continuity and not doing anything that the audience is not gonna buy.\n\nANN SILVIO: Right, because it will take them out of the story.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: Yeah.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: So when sometimes a director asks me to do something stupid, I'll go, \"Well, I'm not gonna do that, because there's somebody in the audience that's gonna sit there and go, that's stupid.\" 'Cause that's what I do, you know? You know, it's like somebody asked me one day \"Don't stop and pick up that guy's gun. Just keep going.\" You know, 'cause I killed him, and I'm like, \"Well, I got a revolver. That's an automatic weapon. So I'm in a gun fight.\"\n\nSTEVE KROFT: You need an upgrade.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: I need an upgrade. So I'm sorry, I'm just not gonna leave a good weapon laying around on the floor so an audience person can go\u2026\n\nSTEVE KROFT: Control it, you want to control it.\n\nSAMUEL L. JACKSON: I want it to make sense.\n\nSTEVE KROFT: We're good.\n\nThe video above was produced by Ann Silvio and Lisa Orlando. It was edited by Lisa Orlando."

    "authors": [
      "March"
    ],
    "text": "Tim Tebow brings his competitive edge to \u201cMillion Dollar Mile,\u201d the obstacle-course competition series he\u2019s hosting on CBS.\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never been an obstacle-course racer I know what it\u2019s like to be able to try to handle the pressure and the lights and push yourself past limits you didn\u2019t think were possible,\u201d says Tebow, 31.\n\nThe former Heisman Trophy winner, NFL quarterback (Jets, Broncos) and current Mets hopeful \u2014 he\u2019ll start the season with the team\u2019s Triple-A affiliate in Syracuse \u2014 taped his 10-episode \u201cMillion Dollar Mile\u201d gig late last fall.\n\nIn the series \u2014 premiering Wednesday, March 27 (9 p.m.) \u2014 contestants (\u201cRunners\u201d) tackle a grueling obstacle course and try to claim the $1 million grand prize while battling a team of elite athletes (\u201cDefenders,\u201d including Emma Chapman, aka \u201cThe Mighty Kiwi\u201d) trying to stop them. LA Chargers play-by-play announcer Matt \u201cMoney\u201d Smith and ESPN host/reporter Maria Taylor provide the commentary.\n\n\u201cMillion Dollar Mile\u201d was not taped under the lights of a TV studio but under the streetlights of downtown LA, on which the obstacle course was constructed. \u201cI gotta be honest, I think that adds to the pressure of it,\u201d Tebow says of the locale. \u201cYou\u2019re in the moment, the bigness of it, the feel of it when it\u2019s lit up at night with the colors and it just looks so cool.\n\n\u201cWe would film late, then I would sleep in, wake up and go train with the USC baseball team and then head back to the set to look over what we were going to do for the next night,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the biggest challenge for me, to be honest with you, is that I was so into it that I was losing my voice. Between every race I had to have tea with lemon and ginger and honey in it.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s me,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had to be not emotional or just [be] a stick up there I probably wouldn\u2019t have been the right guy [to host the show]. If you\u2019ve seen me play you know I\u2019m very emotional and passionate and wear my emotions on my sleeve. It\u2019s the same for me in this role.\u201d\n\nThe Runners win escalating amounts of money for each obstacle they successfully complete \u2014 automatically keeping $50,000 if they make it that far. They also have the option to bow out of the competition. \u201cI was encouraging the contestants and they were encouraging me,\u201d Tebow says. \u201cI would talk to a lot of them before their race about why they were doing this, what their background is, what their training is and what they would do with the money \u2014 and what it would mean to them to look over and see their family in the audience.\n\n\u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve always been that person to cheer for the underdog \u2026 I think America loves [the underdog] and loves seeing people accomplishing a lot. I cheer when greatness can be brought out of someone \u2014 whether it\u2019s for a moment in a race, for a day.\u201d\n\nTebow says the show works because of its human element \u2014 both in the contestants\u2019 back stories and on the show itself.\n\n\u201cThe human element is watching them getting ready \u2026 and not sure if they should try to go for the exit obstacle or keep going on,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then they dig down deep and find a little bit more motivation and then they fall, start over again and they keep fighting \u2014 with their hands bleeding. It\u2019s so cool to find that greatness in so many everyday heroes.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of these races [on \u2018Million Dollar Mile\u2019] will stick with these runners for the rest of their lives as a special moment, whether they won or lost,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe joy on their faces was just epic.\u201d"

Just don't expect a Jerry-like performance from the veteran character actor. In the episode titled \"Welcome to the Camping Trip,\" he'll play a man named Maynard, a general store proprietor.\n\nIn the installment, the Johnsons invite the Butlers to go camping, and of course there will be differences along the way. For Dave (Max Greenfield), he'll have a difficult time understanding Calvin's (Cedric the Entertainer) idea of roughing it. Meanwhile, Gemma (Beth Behrs) and Tina (Tichina Arnold) will cross paths with Maynard (O'Heir) who they'll misjudge as he \"may not be as friendly as he seems.\"\n\nBelow is the exclusive look at O'Heir's appearance, which seems to be received differently from the women as Gemma greets him with a smile and Tina is apprehensive.\n\nAlso, fans should expect some good campfire tunes, as star Max Greenfield will perform an original song during the episode. Below is another exclusive photo of the Johnsons and Butlers bonding around the ... bond fire.\n\nDon't miss \"Welcome to the Camping Trip\" when it airs April 1 on CBS.\n\nThe Neighborhood, Mondays, 8/7c, CBS"

    "text": "Many of us make a special meal of corned beef and cabbage to celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day, and break out the Guinness to go along. But there are lots more ways to celebrate the Irish-American holiday through food and drink. Look to other traditional Irish dishes, and consider St. Paddy\u2019s cocktails, or pick a pale ale and dye it green with all-natural ingredients.\n\nOr stick to the stout, and pair it with these perfect St. Patrick\u2019s Day recipes\u2014sometimes, the Guinness even makes it into the food itself.\n\nThe Irish love to poach their salmon. You\u2019ll find this staple alongside a beer all over the pubs on the Emerald Isle. This version allows you to get the fish cooking while you work on other, more labor-intensive, cooking items. A good mustard sauce, herbed butter sauce, or a basic aioli would make great toppers for this fish native to the waters surrounding the island. Get our Slow Cooker Poached Salmon recipe.\n\nBesides the fact that the topping is kohlrabi instead of potatoes, it\u2019s a pretty traditional shepherd\u2019s pie underneath. The Americanized version uses ground beef, but this recipe keeps it real with ground lamb. Hence the name, right? So Irish. Get our Kohlrabi-Topped Shepherd\u2019s Pie recipe.\n\nSeriously, England doesn\u2019t have the monopoly on fish and chips. Ireland is right there too, with all those lovely chip chops (french fries to Americans) and battered, fried white fish. It\u2019s the perfect thing to soak up the alcohol, Guinness or otherwise. Get our Fish and Chips recipe.\n\nBeer desserts are next-level, and this one lets you have your Guinness and eat it too. The hearty and sweet Bundt cake is given depth by not only the oatmeal-y stout, but by molasses, brown sugar, warming spices, and crystallized ginger as well. The salted-caramel drizzle sends this cake\u2019s deliciousness over the top. Drink while you make it, drink as you share it and eat it. Get our Guinness Gingerbread Bundt Cake recipe.\n\nThis take on traditional Irish colcannon has chunky mashed potatoes and lots of butter. This recipe is unique in that the potatoes are smashed so that the most surface area can get crispy and caramelized; it also includes a half head of cabbage and fresh parsley. Leftover colcannon makes a great breakfast hash served with eggs, so feel free to make a double batch. Get our Colcannon recipe.\n\nMustardshire sauce is the condiment you\u2019ve been missing. Mix one tablespoon mustard powder with one tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and you\u2019ve got a perfect sandwich spread that pairs especially well with corned beef. Make sure to let it sit for at least ten minutes to let the flavors meld before using. Get our Mustardshire Sauce recipe.\n\nThis corned beef recipe means business. Slow-cured isn\u2019t a term we use lightly: This 12-day cure brings out the flavor of the beef and is worth the wait. Coriander, allspice berries, garlic, yellow mustard seed, cloves, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, thyme, carrots, and onion make this one flavorful piece of meat. Refrigerate the brined meat for 12 days and be sure to check that the meat is fully submerged so that it stays tender. Get our Slow-Cured Corned Beef recipe.\n\nChowhound\u2019s recipe for brown soda bread is made with whole-wheat flour and no yeast, so you can assemble it quickly and don\u2019t need to wait for it to rise. With two full cups of buttermilk, this dense, moist bread is best eaten straight out of the oven but does well served for breakfast, toasted with plenty of butter or jam the next morning. Get our Easy Irish Brown Soda Bread recipe.\n\nBoxty is an amazing Irish take on potato pancakes. Part pancake and part hash brown, this hybrid dish is delicious for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Try it as a blini substitute with caviar or served with eggs for breakfast. The Irish answer to latkes, these potato pancakes pair well with any kind of meat and are also excellent with smoked salmon. Make up a big batch and keep them in the freezer so you can reheat them in the toaster oven for a quick snack. Get our Boxty recipe.\n\nCheddar and stout fondue is a perfect winter dish that you can make quickly and easily to serve a crowd. The addition of finely chopped onion, and over a cup of Irish stout (we recommend Guinness or Murphy\u2019s), makes this a smooth and flavorful fondue that pairs well with a number of items that you can dip. Cubed Irish soda bread, chicken apple sausage, steamed potatoes, steamed Brussels sprouts, and apples are all good choices. Get the Irish Cheddar and Stout Fondue recipe.\n\nThis old-fashioned dish is simple to assemble in one pot and is a hands-off recipe that is easy to start on a Sunday afternoon. After grilling the bacon and the sausages, layer them with the onions and potatoes in an ovenproof casserole dish and cover with hot water. Then bake in the oven for between three and five hours and you will have an amazing meal. Serve with bread to sop up the gravy. Get the Dublin Coddle recipe.\n\nHoney mustard is one of everyone\u2019s favorite sauces. This version has mustard powder, apple cider vinegar, honey, and kosher salt mixed together for a smooth sauce that is just as good on a corned beef sandwich as it is on a pretzel. Make up a double batch and store it in the fridge for a week\u2014it\u2019s also great on chicken fingers. Get our Honey Mustard recipe.\n\nThere are many variations on the Bakewell tart, and this recipe is a delightful combination of tart and pudding. The filling is a simple custard made up of eggs, butter, flour, and sugar, poured into a flaky pastry crust. If you\u2019re in a rush you can substitute store-brought puff pastry, and feel free to try any type of jam that suits your fancy. Get the Bakewell Tart recipe.\n\nChamp is a simple comfort food that is a great side dish, and easy to prepare ahead of time. A whole bunch of scallions (including green and white parts) make this a flavorful take on mashed potatoes. For a classic variation, try this recipe from Darina Allen (famed proprietor of Darina Allen\u2019s Ballymaloe Cookery School in Ireland). For something a bit more modern, add some creamy Gorgonzola. Either way, this is a perfect side dish for corned beef and can be repurposed with eggs over easy the next morning. Get the Scallion Champ recipe.\n\nThis is a quick and easy condiment that combines mayonnaise, mustard powder, apple cider vinegar, kosher salt, and minced, pickled jalape\u00f1o. It packs a kick and is a tangy addition to any sandwich. It pairs especially well with ham and corned beef (or even roast beef). Make sure to let the mixture meld for at least ten minutes before using, to maximize flavor. Get our Spicy Mustardaise recipe.\n\nVisit Chowhound\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day recipes for more beer and food pairing ideas.\n\nRelated Video: How to Pour the Perfect Pint of Guinness from a Can\n\n\u2014 Original article by Caitlin M.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Justin Stephens/CBS\n\nHow we operate on social media can tell people a lot about us -- and can be great fodder for drama.\n\nNyambi Nyambi, who plays investigator Jay DiPersia in the legal and political drama The Good Fight, said that technology plays a huge part in his character's work.\n\n\"People put so much information about themselves and the community around them online that the digital imprint left behind can be clues into who they are at different moments in a day,\" he said. \"It seems like we are in a time where people are openly being transparent about their lives, but even if they are not, there's a digital profile that will tell their story.\"\n\nAs a follow-up to the hit show The Good Wife, The Good Fight joined CBS All Access' lineup in 2017. Its third season premieres Thursday. (Editors' note: CBS is CNET's parent company.)\n\nNyambi, who describes DiPersia as a \"moral compass,\" told CNET what to expect from season 3 of The Good Fight -- and also shared a few of his favorite apps.\n\n\"Fans can expect an explosive exploration into race, politics, gender equality, love, betrayal and more,\" Nyambi said. \"What I love about our show are the immense chances our writers take and how they push us actors to explore the deeper issues that plague our humanity and are incredibly relevant today.\"\n\nNyambi said he leaves online investigation to DiPersia, though. While he likes to use Google's search engine, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and IMDb, he doesn't dive too far into another person's online presence unless it's for a script.\n\n\"Generally, I prefer knowing as little as possible so when it comes time for a face-to-face conversation, I'm pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised by what I learn and hopefully come away with a deeper experience,\" Nyambi said. \"Jay is the opposite. He will go in and know everything he can. Information is power. Jay shares what you need to know, not necessarily what you want to know.\"\n\nHere's more of our conversation:\n\nQ: What's the one app that you use the most? Why?\n\nNyambi: The one app I use the most is Headspace. I meditate daily to acknowledge the crazy and let it go.\n\nWhat's the last app you downloaded? Why?\n\nThe last app I downloaded was Filmic Pro. I just took a workshop on how to make documentaries and the class has got me excited to maximize the capabilities of my phone to tell cinematic stories.\n\nWhen you wake up in the morning, what are the first apps you look at? Why?\n\nThe first apps I look at when I wake up in the morning depends on the alerts awaiting me overnight. It ranges from ESPN to The New York Times. When there are no alerts, emails or texts to open, the first app I'm on is Lumosity, playing brain games.\n\nIf you could invent your own app, what would it do?\n\nIf I could invent my own app, it would be something that not only allowed for digital readers to consume their favorite comics, but one that bridges the gap between that and their local community by incentivizing and encouraging these readers to connect with, regularly visit and support their local comic book store(s).\n\nIf there was an app that could save civilization, what would it be?\n\nIf there was an app that could save civilization, it would be Headspace because we simply don't take the time to breathe deep and empathize.\n\nAre you an Android or Apple user? Why?\n\nI actually own both an Android and an Apple phone.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: How does Star Trek: Discovery\u2019s Spock compare to the..."

    "text": "Sure, Super Bowl Sunday may be centered around a big football game -- but it\u2019s also a chance for some of your favorite brands to put their best foot forward. Not only did the big game tease some of Hollywood's biggest upcoming films, companies like Google, Burger King, Coke, Pepsi and Michelob spent millions to highlight just how cherished, forward thinking and (dare we say) important their products are.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of some of the ads that turned our heads when the New England Patriots weren\u2019t squaring off against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\n\n\nChance the Rapper Helps Reinvent a Backstreet Boys Classic for Doritos\n\nLove Nacho Cheese Doritos? Who doesn\u2019t?! Now, the the chip-maker is switching things up with Flamin\u2019 Hot Nacho. To mark the special occasion, the Backstreet Boys remixed their hit \"I Want It That Way\" with some help from Chance the Rapper.\n\n\n\nThe commercial features colorful cars drifting around an airfield with colorful smoke, the single coolest jet in creation, and some fancy footwork from the whole bunch!\n\n\n\nGoogle Delivers a Profound Message of Unity\n\nThis year, the search engine and provider of countless other gadgets and tools offered a message highlighting how Google Translate is helping bring people from all walks of life together.\n\n\n\nThe immersive, globe-trotting ad explains that the most common phrases searched are \u201cHow are you?\u201d \u201cThank you\u201d and \u201cI love you.\u201d It\u2019s tough to beat a message that\u2019s simple yet poignant.\n\n\n\nAmazon Gets Self-Deprecating In the Best Way Possible\n\nFor the 2019 Super Bowl, Amazon truly swung for the fences, hiring the likes of Forest Whitaker, Harrison Ford, Broad City's Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson to showcase some of the times that Alexa didn\u2019t work quite right, to hilarious, mind-blowing effect.\n\n\n\nTurboTax\u2019s Creepy Robot Child\n\nThe giant tax prep software company delivered a head-scratcher this year with RoboChild. Through a series of commercials, viewers are introduced to a small robotic child with the face of little boy.\n\n\n\nAlthough RobotChild is definitely up to date on all the latest Millennial lingo, his look is pretty bone-chilling and difficult to get past.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Celebrates Some Very Special Gamers\n\nThe only company that fittingly manages to rival Google when it comes to tugging at our heartstrings this year is Microsoft, who shined a light on a number of children with disabilities who have found friendship and community thanks to technology.\n\n\n\nAll the kids introduced are passionate gamers who have some difficulty using an average controller. But, thanks to the Microsoft\u2019s Adaptive Controller, they are able to keep up with the best of them.\n\n\n\nStella Artois Makes History\n\nFans of The Big Lebowski and Sex and the City had an extra special Super Bowl Sunday when Jeff Bridges and Sarah Jessica Parker revived their signature characters, The Dude and Carrie Bradshaw, respectively, for the Belgian pilsner maker.\n\n\n\nThe campaign is promoting Stella Artois\u2019 partnership with Water.org; together they are donating enough to provide an individual in the developing world with six months of clean water for every six pack sold.\n\n\n\nBud Light and Game of Thrones Partner Up!\n\nAlthough for months, Budweiser has been promoting a medieval campaign in which they argue that Bud Light is the beer of the people, their Super Bowl offered a grim fate for Bud\u2019s Knight.\n\n\n\nIn the new commercial, the lauded warrior squares off against a mysterious adversary. After the blue knight has been knocked down, viewers discover it is GoT's the Mountain, who finishes him off. Finally, one of Daenerys\u2019 dragons show up and sets the whole gathering aflame! This spot gets extra points for wonderfully subverting expectations.\n\n\n\nCheck out loads more ads in the clip below.\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMaroon 5, Travis Scott & Big Boi Deliver Energy-Filled Super Bowl Halftime Show\n\n2019 Super Bowl Commercials: Check Out the New Star-Studded Ads\n\nGo Behind the Scenes with Adam Levine Before Maroon 5's Super Bowl LII Halftime Performance\n\nRelated Gallery"

    "text": "Adam Levine is prepped and ready to rock out on stage with Maroon 5 for Super Bowl LIII.\n\nThe 39-year-old frontman shared a series of photos to social media over the weekend showcasing rehearsals in Atlanta for the big halftime show.\n\nThe first shot posted on Saturday features a silhouette of the band and their instruments in the darkened Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Levine simply included the #M53 hashtag, which he has been using to promote the band's sure-to-be epic performance alongside Travis Scott and Big Boi.\n\nJust hours before kickoff on Sunday between the Los Angeles Rams and New England Patriots, Levine shared a profile-style selfie where he can be seen holding a cup of coffee beside a microphone.\n\n\"Playing the waiting game...,\" he wrote, just before also sharing a photo of he and his bandmates laughing during a break in rehearsal.\n\nLess than two hours before the start of the game, he shared an image of the group's final dress rehearsal, which showcases Levine facing the audience as flames plummet above the stage. Adam captions the snap, \"Lift off,\" while a sign above the crowd reads, \"This is a closed rehearsal. Essential working personnel only. Absolutely no photography.\"\n\nAhead of the big game, Levine sat down with ET's Kevin Frazier and revealed that his wife Behati Prinsloo will be in attendance for the show, though their two daughters -- Dusty, 2, and Gio, 11 months -- \"are going to stay home.\"\n\n\"It is a little bit of a fiasco out here, it is a little crazy, so we are going to keep them home,\" he told ET. \"But they are going to watch on TV and I am going to wear daddy bracelets so they can see that I am representing them well.\"\n\nThe superstar also opened up about Maroon 5's decision to take on the performance, one that has been highly controversial following the NFL's stance to Colin Kaepernick and other players who took a knee during the national anthem as a form of peaceful protest against police brutality.\n\n\"You know, I think when you look back on every Super Bowl halftime show, it is this insatiable urge to hate a little bit,\" Levine shared. \"I am not in the right profession if I can't handle a bit of controversy. It is what it is. We would like to move on from it and speak through the music.\"\n\nRegarding the controversy, the Voice judge added that \"no one thought about it more than I did,\" saying, \"I spoke to many people, most importantly though, I silenced all the noise and listened to myself, and made my decision about how I felt.\"\n\nLevine stressed that he is \"beyond proud\" of their upcoming performance, adding that he has \"never been more excited\" in his entire life.\n\n\"That is what we did, and I am beyond proud of the finished product, and literally never, never been more excited in my entire life to present this to the people because I believe that it's truly a reflection of all of us.\"\n\nWatch more of ET's exclusive interview with Levine below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nBehati Prinsloo Supports Adam Levine on Super Bowl Sunday\n\nHow Adam Levine Plans to Give His Daughters a Shout-Out During the Super Bowl (Exclusive)\n\nAdam Levine Opens Up About Late Manager Jordan Feldstein Ahead of Super Bowl (Exclusive)"

Team Up To Empower Girls With Special 2019 Super Bowl PSA Check out the clip, which features a team of girls competing against the New York Giants.\n\n\n\nCBS and Girls Inc. have joined together to create a CBS Cares public service announcement set to air during Super Bowl LIII on Sunday, Feb. 3, and after The Big Game on the CBS Sports Network.\n\n\n\nFeaturing the voiceover of CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King and players from the New York Giants, the PSA encourages girls to believe they can succeed at the highest levels, especially when they work together.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Macaroons experience the frustration every NFL player knows: a fumble in the end zone.\n\n\n\nAt the center of the PSA are the Macaroons, a team of girls who score big against the New York Giants, showing that when girls unite, anything is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Macaroon and New York Giant square off.\n\n\n\n\"It is a major priority for our Company to support organizations that are helping to inspire and encourage girls' confidence, development, and achievements,\" said Joe Ianniello, President and Acting CEO, CBS Corporation. \"We are very pleased to work with Girls Inc., the NFL, and the New York Giants to advocate for and affirm the strengths and abilities of girls.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay is suspended for a moment while the Macaroons and Giants get a behind-the-scenes view of how a PSA is made.\n\n\n\nAmong the girls who appear in the PSA are four Girls Inc. girls from New York City: Serenity Peralta, Shadiya McNair, Juliana Villaluz, and Markisha Prince. While filming, the girls also had the opportunity to go behind the camera and learn about what goes into making a PSA.\n\n\n\nIt's Girls Inc.'s mission to ensure that girls value their whole selves, discover their strengths, and lift up and support one another.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Girl Power Girls pose for a photo. Back row from the left: Shadiya, Sarah, Juliana, Serenity and Makisha. Front row from left: Lexi, Elle, Shiloh, Olivia, Cecilia, Tessa, Sophia and Heaven.\n\n\n\n\"Girls Inc. is proud to partner with CBS Corporation to deliver this very important message of empowerment for girls,\" said Judy Vredenburgh, President and CEO of Girls Inc. \"Too often, girls are told they can't. We all have a role to play in challenging stereotypes and limiting messages. That is why we are deeply grateful to CBS Corporation, CBS Cares, and the New York Giants for their commitment to showing girls that they can, in fact, achieve at the highest levels. We couldn't be more thrilled to share that message with the millions of viewers who will be tuning in to watch on Super Bowl Sunday.\"\n\n\n\nTo learn more about Girls Inc.'s important work, visit girlsinc.org."

Same.Fan-favorite Celeb HG Mark is keeping busy playing music with his band Sugar Ray, and even played a show with fellow BB alum/musician Paul Abrahamian in the fall:But music hasn't kept him from staying up to date on Big Brother; he even chimed in when a former notorious Houseguest had something to say about the first eviction of BB20:Mark even joined Marissa to guest co-host Off The Block one week, talking with two-time BB20 evictee Scottie Salton As for Mark's workout pal/bro, James, since leaving the BB house he's been keeping up his rigorous exercise routine when he's not recording new tunes:Not only has the teen heartthrob been recording some new music, he's also spent some quality time with his dad in Las Vegas!Metta's journey through Celebrity Big Brother was unforgettable thanks to his unique gameplay\u2014remember when he thought he was voting for someone to stay in the house?\u2014and his ability to deliver some hilarious soundbites.If you follow the NBA legend on Twitter, you'll know he's still delivering the goods:Even months removed from the BB house, Metta's fondness for Orwell the owl is fresh in everyone's mind:Speaking of Orwell the owl, he's got another former Houseguest looking back on their time together quite fondly\u2014none other than Celeb BB sweetheart and beauty queen Ariadna:As a self-professed BB superfan, Shannon was targeted early on in the game by those she considered her allies, but her short-lived stint in the BB house hasn't hampered her enjoyment of trying new things.Like traveling all over the world, for instance:Since exiting the BB house, Chuck has since climbed back into a different sort of confined space, one with which he's far more familiar: the UFC Octagon!He was also affected by the wildfires in California, but thankfully he and his family evacuated and are safe and sound:Since her dramatic and emotional exit from the game to be closer to her newborn baby, Keshia has been enjoying all the joys of motherhood after her stay inside the Big Brother house.How will the new celebrity HGs adapt to life in the Big Brother house? Will they take any strategic cues from their predecessors?Don't miss the two-night premiere event of Celebrity Big Brother on Monday, Jan. 21 and Tuesday, Jan. 22 at 8/7c on CBS CBS All Access"

You're fabulous.\"\n\n\"What does every star get in her dressing room backstage? Flowers!\" Chen said, drawing attention to a tableau of an antique telephone, glass perfume bottles and a 1920s-era wig that surrounded the ornate vase. Clearly, they spared no expense when it came to designing the room to take anyone who sleeps there back in time.\n\nThe same attention to detail is apparent in the upstairs lounge, which has been \"made to look like the iconic Brooklyn Bridge.\"\n\n\"This is where house guests usually whisper, hang out,\" Chen said, showing off the lounge's many amenities, like comfortable seating and a full-size billiards table.\n\n\"They pretend like they are playing chess, or they pretend like they're playing pool, but they're really conspiring about gameplay, and how to backstab,\" she added with a gleeful smile. \"This is where it all happens.\"\n\nFans will have to tune in to the show for a look at the rest of the carefully considered and intricately designed rooms, which no doubt will play a role in the this season's general theme.\n\nCelebrity Big Brother's big two-night premiere airs Monday, Jan. 21 and Tuesday, Jan. 22 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.\n\nCheck out the video below for a look at the famous houseguests who will be battling it out this season.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nJoey Lawrence Shares His Brothers' Reaction to Him Joining 'Celebrity Big Brother' (Exclusive)\n\nDina Lohan Says Lindsay Lohan Acts Like Her Momager Now for \u2018Celebrity Big Brother\u2019\n\n'Celebrity Big Brother' Season 2 Cast Revealed -- Meet the Famous Houseguests!"

    "title": "8 Of The Most Beloved Shows To Film At CBS Television City",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "File: Bob Barker looks on as a contestant takes part in a game during the taping of the 34th season premiere of The Price is Right at CBS Television City on June 9, 2005 in Los Angeles. (Lumeimages/Getty Images)\n\nThe CBS Television City studios, home to some of TV's most beloved shows for more than 60 years, were sold last month for $750 million. CBS will continue taping there for at least the next five years, but it's a turning point in an epic legacy of classic programming.\n\nLet's unlock the door to that legacy and look at some of the most memorable shows and moments that CBS Television City has given us (along with a real-life love story that happened right there on the studio lot).\n\nTHE CAROL BURNETT SHOW\n\nCarol Burnett just won an honorary Golden Globe with a new category created in her name, and this show is the biggest part of what earned her that prize. She had a massively successful sketch comedy show with a woman lead, running 11 seasons. Burnett inspired generations of viewers, offering a public example of a woman being silly and real in front of millions of Americans.\n\nALL IN THE FAMILY\n\nThis show changed television and is still revered in TV history. It brought social consciousness in sitcoms to another level, centered around bigot Archie Bunker and his conflicts with the world around him. It became the most-watched show of all time, with co-creator Norman Lear and star Carroll O'Connor earning much of the credit for its success. The show also spawned numerous spinoffs, including Maude, The Jeffersons, Gloria, and more.\n\nTHE PRICE IS RIGHT\n\nSince 1972, there's been one go-to show for when you're home during the day, and this is it. It still tapes at Television City to this day. The studio has a rich history of game shows, from Match Game to Win, Lose or Draw, but Bob Barker made this one the most iconic. Drew Carey has since taken up the baton as the other friendliest face on daytime other than Ellen. We're betting (without going over) that this show outlives us all.\n\nELVIS'S 1ST APPEARANCE ON THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW\n\nWhile The Ed Sullivan Show was taped in New York, Elvis Presley brought rock 'n' roll to the masses in 1956 in an appearance taped at Television City. He shook his hips scandalously, and made America sit up and listen to a new sound.\n\nAMERICAN IDOL\n\nThis... is filmed at CBS Television City. It's where we got to watch fresh-faced stars start to take shape in the singing show that turned out the most successes in the modern era (sorry, The Voice). It's where Simon Cowell would let everyone know who he really, really hated, before moving on to the Dolby Theatre finales where he'd finally show some approval with a twinkle in his eye. While not the phenomenon it once was, leading to its brief cancellation before an inevitable resurrection on ABC, it set a standard for storytelling in modern competition shows.\n\nTHE JEFFERSONS\n\nGeorge and \"Weezie\" Jefferson gave America a model for upwardly mobile African-Americans (as memorialized in their classic theme song). It spun out of All In The Family, with Sherman Hemsley and Marla Gibbs giving it life for 11 seasons. It set the groundwork for upper-middle-class black sitcoms that followed, from The Cosby Show [collar pull] to Black-ish.\n\nTHE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS\n\nWhile soap operas aren't as much of a cultural phenom as they once were, The Young and the Restless is still near the top of the list when people think about the format. The show started as an attempt to compete with more youthful soap operas from ABC \u2014 that's why you get \"Young\" right in the title. It birthed one of the longest-running feuds in TV history, with Jill Abbott and Katherine Chancellor carrying their battle on for decades. Over those decades, the show has aired more than 11,000 episodes.\n\nTHE LATE LATE SHOW\n\nThe show launched as a later adjunct to David Letterman's New York-based Late Show, originally hosted by the somewhat chill Tom Snyder. Each host since has upped the energy \u2014 Craig Kilborn and his sarcasm were a notch up, Craig Ferguson increased that energy to frantic, and now James Corden sings and dances his way into insomniacs' hearts each and every night. It's a place where there's room for the host to be even sillier and more off-the-wall than they already can be at 11:30. Ferguson made use of that by dropping the pretense of canned questions and aiming for more real conversations, along with discursive monologues that weren't just a series of jokes. Meanwhile, Corden's used it to make non-singing celebrities sing for you, usually in a car.\n\nBONUS: A TELEVISION CITY LOVE STORY\n\nWe talked with photographer Donavan Freberg about Television City \u2014 he owes his very existence to the location. That's because it's where his mother met his father, comedian Stan Freberg, in the late 1950s.\n\nDonna Andresen started in the typing pool in the studio's early days, moving her way up to being a secretary for one of the studio's executives before being recruited to be a model to help calibrate cameras in the early days of color TV.*\n\nOne day, Frank Sinatra was at the studio, when one of the new color televisions got his attention \u2014 or rather, someone on them, that being Andresen. He demanded to see her. Donavan thinks Sinatra was hoping for a date.\n\n\"So my mother just flat-out says, 'Mr. Sinatra, I'm a huge fan of yours, I'd love to be your secretary, but I want you to know right now that if I'm your secretary, there's no funny business \u2014 and I'm not going to sleep with you.'\"\n\nSinatra agreed, and she ended up serving as both a secretary and executive producer for some of Sinatra's TV shows.\n\nFreberg made multiple appearances \u2014 and on his second one, he asked her out. She turned him down at first, but he won her over, and ended up hiring her as his own producer. Shortly after, they were married.\n\n* Given the biases of the time, there were issues with how those color TV models were chosen \u2014 you can read about that here."

Over 90 percent of the adopted foster children featured on the show have graduated from high school and gone on to follow their dreams of college, advanced degrees and successful careers, including nursing, teaching, social work, legal counsel, business, construction, and the military. Many have started happy families of their own.Three of the stories featured on this year\u2019s show are updates on families who were featured previously. They include:Minuette and younger sister Josette had a brutal childhood. \"Growing up, it was hard because our mother was a drug addict,\" says Josette. \"We didn\u2019t have food, and we were both physically abused.\" Eventually taken into foster care, the sisters were separated and lived in eight different homes before they were adopted by Dan and Angie Farmakis in 2007.Currently, Josette, 25, is following her dream of becoming a nurse. \"Our parents looked past the trauma we\u2019d gone through and saw us for who we really are. It feels like I\u2019ve always been their daughter,\" she says. Minuette, 27, is living her dream of working as a social worker at the same agency that placed her and her sister with their family. \"Working with kids like us in foster care is not only a privilege, it\u2019s an honor,\" she says.Brothers Felipe and Rafael were desperate to stay together and running out of time. By ages 15 and 12, the boys had lived in more than seven foster placements and were considered unadoptable. \"My brother and I were on the verge of being separated, and that was the scariest thing imaginable,\" says Felipe. \"When we met these boys, I knew we could make such a difference in their lives, and we adopted them in March 2002,\" says Erika Albrecht.Today, Felipe and Rafael are both married with children and have successful careers. \"Our parents raised us with so much love. My brother and I wouldn't be where we are today if it wasn\u2019t for adoption,\" says Felipe. \"My brother and I were best man at each other's wedding, and my wife and I have talked about adopting in the future,\" says Rafael.Kenneth and Evette Oden took a leap of faith and saw potential in two foster children who were born exposed to drugs. \"When we first met Kyle, I remember holding him really close to my chest. He looked right in my eyes, and I just knew that he was my son,\" says Evette. \"About a year later, we got a phone call that there was a little girl who needed immediate placement,\" says Kenneth. \"The bond we felt with Kynnedy was just as strong.\"Kyle, now 20, took honors classes in high school and earned an academic scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania. Kynnedy, 19, is a sophomore at San Francisco State University.The following family is being featured on the special for the first time:\"If I wasn\u2019t adopted by my parents at 17, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am now,\" says Ethan Pascucci. \"I lived my early childhood with a parent who was a drug addict. I was 9 when my stepfather was stabbed to death in the home where I slept. My journey into foster care began that night.\" John Pascucci had been in Iraq for 15 months as a combat engineer. \"When I would see a child waving to us at one o\u2019clock in the morning, it made me think every child, no matter how old they are, needs the love and security of a family,\" he says.He and his wife, Karen, decided to adopt from foster care. \"Our original plan was to adopt a 9 to 12-year-old girl, but we fell in love with a 16-year-old boy who was 6'3\",\" says John. \"I was finally looking at parents who would love me for a lifetime, and that changed everything,\" says Ethan. He began taking AP and honors classes and signed up for crew. He became a star rower in high school and was awarded an athletic scholarship to Syracuse University.Currently, there are more than 438,000 children in foster care in the United States. The inspirational \"Children Waiting\" segment gives voice to these forgotten children by creating an intimate portrait of their hopes, their dreams and their wish for a \"forever family.\"The special is presented in association with the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption and the Children's Action Network. Wendy's founder Dave Thomas, who was adopted, established the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption in 1992. It is dedicated to dramatically increasing the adoptions of children in North America's foster care system.The Children's Action Network was founded in 1990 by leaders in the entertainment industry in order to harness the power of the entertainment media on behalf of children. The special is a part of CAN's National Adoption Campaign to raise awareness of the joys of adopting and to find homes for the children who are waiting.Watch A Home For The Holidays\u2014The 20th Anniversary on Friday, Dec. 21 at 8/7c on CBS and CBS All Access"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "This piece originally aired Nov. 19, 2018.\n\nOlympian and U.S. national figure skating champion Adam Rippon tells CBS News he will no longer skate competitively. It means the 29-year-old will effectively retire from professional skating.\n\nRippon competed for the U.S. in the Winter Olympics in South Korea this year. He was one of the first openly gay American athletes to qualify for the Winter Games where he won a bronze medal in the team event.\n\nIn our series Note to Self, Rippon stepped onto the rink at Skylands Ice World in New Jersey to reflect on the path he carved in life, on and off the ice.\n\nHi Adam,\n\nIt's me, Adam, but from the future.\n\nYou are going through a really tough time right now. You've just missed qualifying for the Olympic team for the second time in a row. You feel confused and you feel like a failure. It might not make sense right now, but this is truly one of the most important moments in your life.\n\nTake a moment and be proud of yourself.\n\nDo you remember being 13 and taking the Greyhound Bus from Scranton to Philadelphia every Monday morning so you could get to practice? You stayed with so many different families who made you feel like you were home when you were not. It was scary and you missed your own family very much but your mom always told you it wasn't a sacrifice if you got to do what you love. You lived in your coach's basement for a few months because you couldn't afford to live anywhere else. Not that long ago, you had so little money that sometimes you had to choose whether you paid for groceries or paid for ice time.\n\nYou work so hard, but you are even harder on yourself. Now, listen, this part is important: Stand up, walk to a mirror, look yourself straight in the eye and tell yourself: you are a winner. You won't see one looking back at you yet, but do this every day and you'll really start to learn what being a winner is. Being a winner is a mindset.\n\nYou've come out to your friends and family a few years ago and it made you feel so free, like you've grown wings. Do you remember growing up in Pennsylvania, thinking that being gay was something you would never tell anyone? When you publicly come out in the next year, you will let go of what other people think of you. You will hope to give someone else what you didn't feel growing up: permission to be themselves. You will be saying: \"You are worthy.\"\n\nOh, and when you wax your eyebrows, start talking about how great they look. It'll be a hit.\n\nOver the next few years, you'll get into the best shape of your life, mentally and physically, and you will feel so in control. You're not a teenager anymore and you've embraced that you aren't going to be as thin or light as some of your competitors. You worked on perfecting yourself instead of trying to change yourself.\n\nYou will become a national champion at 26 and your path to the Olympics will seem clearer than ever. But exactly one year before the 2018 Olympic team selection, you will break your foot. You'll fear everything you've worked for was in vain, but don't be discouraged. You are strong, you are brave, you can take on anything.\n\nYou, Adam, will make the Olympic team and skate on Olympic ice, it'll be a moment you've been waiting for your entire life. It'll be crazy, wild, emotional and very exciting. The world will see your character and they will embrace you for just being yourself.\n\nYou are a man now. You've challenged yourself and taken risks. You make people around you laugh, and help them like who they are. You've become the role model that you wished you'd had as a kid. You will look in the mirror and you will see someone you like. You will look in the mirror and finally see a winner looking back at you.\n\nNow go out and conquer the world."

    "text": "The international smash-hit reality TV series, Love Island, is coming to CBS.\n\n\n\nToday, CBS announced that the network has secured the U.S. format rights for the show from ITV Studios and Motion Content Group, with the new series to be produced by ITV Entertainment.\n\n\n\nLove Island sees a group of single \"Islanders\" come together in a stunning villa in a beautiful tropical location. They are on the lookout for romance, but as always, the road to love never runs smoothly, as they must not only choose their partner wisely, but also win the hearts of the public.\n\n\n\nChallenges and dramatic twists abound as the Islanders form alliances, while relationships are made in an effort to win the ultimate prize. Viewers have the opportunity to shape events on screen as they watch the relationships develop, and ultimately crown one lucky couple as the winners who walk away with a cash prize.\n\n\n\nThe Season 4 finale aired this past Monday to a record overnight audience, ranking as the most-watched program ever on the U.K.'s ITV2 network, with almost half of all adult viewers under 34 tuning in throughout the series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Love Island has been a massive success overseas,\" said Sharon Vuong, Senior Vice President, Alternative Programming. \"It's currently seen, or about to premiere in several European countries as well as Australia, and we're thrilled that ITV has partnered with us to bring their most successful show to American television. Having seen the reaction of audiences 'across the pond' and around the world to this most recent season, we expect American viewers will be captivated by this engaging format. Additionally, Love Island is more than a pop sensation; this series has generated compelling 'sociological think pieces' in major publications here and abroad.\"\"As a format, Love Island breaks the mold with high levels of viewer interactivity and participation that influence the content of the show in a way that's extremely addictive,\" said David George, CEO, ITV America. \"It's a cultural phenomenon that builds anticipation with every episode and creates appointment viewing\u2014a pretty hard thing to do in today's TV landscape. We're ecstatic the show has found a home at CBS and look forward to working collaboratively to engage its millions of viewers.\"Love Island is produced by ITV Entertainment, an ITV America company. Executive Producers are David George, Adam Sher, and David Eilenberg. The series is based on a format owned by ITV Studios and Motion Content Group, represented by Richard Foster and Chet Fenster, and distributed by ITV Studios Global Entertainment.Stay tuned to CBS.com in the coming months for more information on Love Island."

    "text": "Comic-Con 2018: Stream Exclusive Video Of Magnum P.I. Panel\n\nThe cast and crew reveal a Magnum/Hawaii Five-0 crossover is already in the works for the new fall show.\n\nCBS's new fall show Magnum P.I. hit the San Diego Comic-Con floor with a special treat for fans: the world premiere of the pilot episode!After the screening, Executive Producers Peter Lenkov and Eric Guggenheim and stars Jay Hernandez (\"Thomas Magnum\"), Perdita Weeks (\"Juliet Higgins\"), Zachary Knighton (\"Orville 'Rick' Wright\"), and Stephen Hill (\"Theodore 'TC' Calvin\") hit the stage for a brief Q&A to talk about the rebooted series.Be sure to check out the full, exclusive Magnum P.I. panel.As CBS viewers well know, Magnum P.I. marks Lenkov and Guggenheim's third TV reboot after Hawaii Five-0 and MacGyver , but Lenkov confessed Magnum was in the works well before those shows.\"This one sort of pre-dated all the others,\" he said, by 10 or 15 years. \"[The original Magnum P.I.] was my favorite show growing up.\"In fact, Lenkov originally wanted to introduce Thomas Magnum as a friend of Steve McGarrett ( Alex O'Loughlin ) in his Five-0 reboot, since they were both in the Navy. However, when that idea was pitched, they didn't yet have the rights to use Magnum.Of course, now, with the updated Magnum P.I. set to hit the airwaves on CBS, a crossover is imminent.\"We'll do a genuine, bonafide crossover at one point,\" Guggenheim confirmed, adding that characters and situations will bump into each other every now and then.Lenkov also explained why now is the perfect time to bring Magnum back to the small screen: to show a positive portrayal of veterans on TV again\u2014and they had the credentials to back it up: \"We have three consultants on this show, and two of them are ex-military.\"As the title character, Jay echoed that sentiment, noting it was especially important and meaningful to him since his brother is also a veteran.Meanwhile, Perdita's character Higgins has been gender-swapped, which could create a different dynamic between the two on screen.\"Opposites attract,\" she said of the Magnum and Higgins' friction. But could that friction to turn to fire? \"You never know,\" she said.\"I think when you have two actors that look like they do, that can be expected,\" Guggenheim joked.Zachary said that he has a real connection to his happy-go-lucky character, Rick.\"Of all the characters, this is the one I was really born to play,\" he said, adding that everything from Rick's persona to his wardrobe is similar to himself in real life. \"The dress, the look\u2014this is me.\"As for Stephen, who plays ace helicopter pilot T.C.?\"Guess who's afraid of heights?\" Jay said, shooting Stephen a cheeky grin.Watch the series premiere of Magnum P.I. on Monday, Sept. 24 at 9/8c on CBS and CBS All Access"

It is my great honor to join my friend Josh Groban in hosting the Tonys this year, and use the opportunity to simply say a heartfelt 'thank you' to this wonderful community... in high heels, with jokes.\"\"I am humbled and ecstatic to be co-hosting the Tony Awards this year with such a brilliant artist and wonderful friend, Sara Bareilles.

    "text": "Look Back At The First-Ever ACM Performances By Country's Biggest Artists\n\nFrom Taylor to Maren to Old Dominion, here's a look back at some of your favorite country singers' first-ever performances on the ACM stage.\n\nThe 53rd Academy of Country Music Awards\u2122 , hosted by Reba McEntire , are coming up on Sunday, Apr. 15 at 8/7c on CBS and CBS All Access , and, as always, it's a chance to watch some of the biggest names in country music take the stage and do what they do best.But don't forget: There's a first time for everything\u2014and everyone!While you wait to watch performers like Florida Georgia Line and more play their latest hits and classic favorites on Sunday, let's take a stroll down memory lane and take a look back at the first-ever performance on the ACM stage for some of country's biggest names.Taylor Swift, who won New Female Vocalist Of The Year in 2007, first performed her single \"Tim McGraw\" at the ACMs.Even better? She got to perform it in front of the man himself.When the Georgia-born country crooner first hit the ACM stage in the early '90s, he performed \"Midnight in Montgomery.\"Last year, Nashville favorites Old Dominion, who won New Vocal Duo or Group of the Year in 2016, performed their hit \"No Such Thing As A Broken Heart,\" which is from their second studio album, Happy Endings.When Keith first performed at the ACMs in the late '90s, he famously paid tribute to elder statesman Glen Campbell with a rendition of 1975 hit \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" alongside Charlie Daniels, Montgomery Gentry, and Bryan White.In 2015, Sam Hunt performed his mid-tempo ballad \"Take Your Time,\" which was nominated for Single Record of the Year.Back in the early '80s, ACMs mainstay and country legend Reba McEntire, who was nominated in the category, took part in a Top New Female Vocalist Nominees medley.Along with Reba, Juice Newton, Barbara Mandrell, Emmylou Harris, Rosanne Cash, Sylvia, and Lacy J. Dalton were also nominated that year.With her chart-topping solo singles, plus her ubiquitous collaborations with Thomas Rhett and EDM king Zedd, it's hard to believe that Maren Morris' first time performing at the ACMs was only last year.But it's true: The singer's first ACMs performance was in 2017, when she sang \"I Could Use A Love Song.\" Not only that, she won New Female Vocalist of the Year.In 1991, country icon Garth Brooks performed a four-part medley: \"Two Of A Kind,\" \"Workin' On A Full House,\" \"Unanswered Prayers,\" \"Friends In Low Places,\" and \"The Dance.\"He also won Entertainer of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year!Last year, newcomer Jon Pardi made his ACMs debut with \"Dirt On My Boots\" and won New Male Vocalist of the Year. This year, he's up for Album of the Year for his latest album, California Sunrise, and is set to perform again!Stream the 53rd Academy of Country Music Awards\u2122 on CBS All Access Look Back At The First-Ever ACM Performances By Country's Biggest Artists \u200bis presented by the First-Ever Ford EcoSport."

Bergen will also be an Executive Producer.During the series' original decade-long run on CBS, Murphy Brown garnered 62 Emmy nominations (with 18 wins), 15 Golden Globe nominations (with three wins), three Screen Actors Guild awards, and much, much more.Bergen personally earned five Emmy Awards for her portrayal of the ambitious investigative journalist and news anchor of FYI, a fictional TV magazine show.Check back with CBS.com for more updates on the upcoming revival of Murphy Brown."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The Ad Council has joined with actor and producer David Schwimmer, writer and director Sigal Avin, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), and the National Women's Law Center (NWLC) to launch \"#ThatsHarassment,\" a national campaign to empower victims and bystanders to speak out and provide tools for employers to create a safe work environment. Beginning Friday, January 26, the full-length short films and PSAs will be supported digitally and on television by major media companies.\n\n\n\nThe PSAs, executive produced by Schwimmer, Avin, and Mazdack Rassi of MILK Studios, are shortened versions of the films that first launched in April 2017. The Ad Council will nationally distribute 30-second cutdowns of three of the six originally launched films to media outlets nationwide this week. The films, written and directed by Avin, depict various cases of sexual harassment in the workplace, all based on real events. Schwimmer, Avin, and Rassi created this project to highlight behaviors that are unacceptable and to end institutional silence and complicity.\n\n\n\n\"My mother, my sister, countless female colleagues, and friends have all experienced some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime,\" says Schwimmer. \"Now I'm a father of a young daughter and I'm angry and concerned about the rise in, and our culture's acceptance of, totally unacceptable behavior by men towards women. Men who demean, deride, discredit, harass, and assault women\u2014no matter what their position of power\u2014need to be held accountable.\"\n\n\n\nThe films, which take place in various professional settings in which sexual harassment can occur, depict different scenarios where men in positions of power cross the line. They include: \"The Boss\" starring Zazie Beetz and David Schwimmer, \"The Coworker\" starring Grace Gummer and Joseph Sikora, \"The Politician\" starring Harry Lennix and Emmy Rossum, \"The Actor\" starring Noah Emmerich and Cristela Alonzo, \"The Doctor\" starring Cynthia Nixon and Michael Kelly, and \"The Photographer\" starring Bobby Cannavale and Anna Van Patten.\n\n\n\n\"The current conversation around sexual harassment is giving us an opportunity to inform, educate and ultimately end harassment and assault. We are proud to join forces with Sigal, David, RAINN, National Women's Law Center, and the media to help all of us\u2014men and women\u2014speak out, stop it, and most importantly, prevent it,\" said Lisa Sherman, President and CEO of the Ad Council.\n\n\n\n\"Knowledge is key for change. For me, the biggest achievement of \"#ThatsHarassment\" is giving harassment a face. Taking what some consider 'a grey area' and making it clear, 'that's harassment.' The fact that there's a visual aid to clarify and demonstrate what sexual harassment is, will minimize the phenomenon,\" Avin added.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, for the duration of 2018, the New York City Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment will air #ThatsHarassment PSAs on Taxi TV, bringing the campaign to video screens in 13,000 NYC taxicabs and generating well over 100,000 impressions per day. The PSAs will also run on NYC Media, the City's official broadcast network with a reach of over 18 million households.\n\n\n\n\"'#ThatsHarassment' is an incredible opportunity to further the conversation around sexual harassment and gender inequality in our society, and we are proud to expand the audience of this vital public awareness campaign in such a unique way on Taxi TV,\" said Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment Commissioner Julie Menin.\n\n\n\nThe campaign also encourages employers to use the films for training to proactively address and prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. Separately, in partnership with National Women's Law Center, Schwimmer and Avin have created a digital toolkit for employers and are inviting them (including C-suite executives, HR directors, supervisors and managers) to use these films to educate, inform, and ensure they are creating safe work environments and conditions for their employees. The Digital Toolkit can be downloaded at NWLC.org/ThatsHarassment and includes \"10 Ways Your Company Can Help Prevent Harassment in the Workplace\" as well as a Discussion Guide for employers to accompany the full-length films.\n\n\n\nEvery day, hundreds of Americans are affected by sexual violence and abuse; in fact, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) estimates that one in four women face harassment in the workplace, and many are hesitant to report it. Sexual harassment is pervasive across industries, but especially in low-wage service jobs. For example, more than 25 percent of sexual harassment charges filed with the EEOC in the last decade came from industries with service-sector workers.\n\n\n\nThe PSAs drive viewers to RAINN, which is the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization, and encourage viewers to call 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or visit RAINN.org/ThatsHarassment. RAINN operates the 24-hour National Sexual Assault Hotline, along with a live chat option.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the campaign, visit RAINN.org/ThatsHarassment, like the page on Facebook, and follow @ThatsHarassment on Twitter and the hashtag #ThatsHarassment. To get immediate, free support 24/7, call 1-800-656-HOPE (4673)."

    "text": "Get To Know The 2017 Kennedy Center Honorees\n\nHere are just some of the highlights of these entertainment superstars' careers.\n\nIn August, The Kennedy Center Honors revealed their honorees for 2017: Carmen de Lavallade, Gloria Estefan, LL COOL J , Norman Lear, and Lionel Richie\u2014whom Kennedy Center Chairman David M. Rubenstein described as \"five artists whose talent and ingenuity have enriched and shaped cultural life in America.\"Before you watch The 40th Annual Kennedy Center Honors on Tuesday, Dec. 26 at 9/8c on CBS and CBS All Access , get to know more about each honoree and why they were chosen for this esteemed distinction.With over 60 years of professional experience under her belt, actress, dancer, and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade is renowned for her performances in both motion pictures and the theatre.She has appeared in four feature films including Carmen Jones (1954) and Odds Against Tomorrow (1959), and made her Broadway debut in 1954's House of Flowers, written by Truman Capote, with music by Harold Arlen. That's not to mention her incredible dance career, which has inspired the creation of numerous ballets.Over the years, Carmen has received numerous award, including the Dance Magazine Award in 1964, an honorary doctorate of fine arts from the Juilliard School in 2007, the Duke Ellington Fellowship Award, and the Dance USA Award in 2010.Currently, de Lavallade is touring a dance/theater work about her life called As I Remember It (2014). Now in her 80s, Carmen de Lavallade continues to inspire generations of artists and audiences alike.Legendary singer-songwriter, actress, philanthropist, author, and overall hyphenate Gloria Estefan is perhaps best known for her GRAMMY\u00ae Award -winning music, which has influenced the music scene for decades and continues to do so today.In recent years, Estefan and her husband Emilio produced On Your Feet! The Musical, a Tony\u00ae Award -nominated Broadway production based on their lives and music.Estefan's many achievements include seven GRAMMYs, an Oscar nomination, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an American Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, an induction into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame, an Ellis Island Medal of Honor, and a National Artistic Achievement Award from U.S. Congress.This world-famous rapper not only helped define a generation of hip-hop, he's since successfully crossed over into other mediums as an actor, author, philanthropist, entrepreneur, and more.LL COOL J is the first rap artist to amass 10 consecutive platinum-plus selling albums, and, in 2016, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his achievements in music.Currently, the performer stars in CBS' own NCIS: Los Angeles and hosts/produces Lip Sync Battle. He also recently announced his new classic hip-hop station coming out on Sirius XM called Rock the Bells Radio.95-year-old Norman Lear boasts an amazing r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a television writer and producer, having pioneered TV classics such as All in the Family, Maude, Good Times, The Jeffersons, Sanford and Son, and Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.In addition to rocking the entertainment industry, Lear flew 52 combat missions during World War II with the Fifteenth Air Force out of Foggia, Italy, and, later, founded American Way, a non-profit organization that opposes the radical religious right.Now, Lear is working on a reimagined Cuban-American version of the popular TV series One Day at a Time, and produces a podcast called All of the Above with Norman Lear, available on Podcast One.Music icon Lionel Richie needs no introduction with over 100 million albums sold; an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and four GRAMMY Awards to his name; and having the distinction of being 2016's MusiCares Person of the Year.Credited with unforgettable songs like \"Endless Love,\" \"Lady,\" \"Truly,\" \"All Night Long,\" \"Penny Lover,\" \"Stuck On You,\" \"Hello,\" \"Say You, Say Me,\" \"Dancing on the Ceiling,\" and \"We Are the World,\" it goes without saying that Richie is a bonafide hitmaker.Recently, Richie headlined Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, and Glastonbury festivals, drawing their largest-ever crowds with over 200,000 attendees.Watch The 40th Annual Kennedy Center Honors on Tuesday, Dec. 26 at 9/8c on CBS and CBS All Access"

    "text": "CBS isn't exactly known for groundbreaking comedy, but the network's streaming option CBS All Access apparently is the perfect place for experimenting with formats, style and degrees of humor, if the new series No Activity is any indication.\n\nNo Activity, from Will Ferrell's Funny or Die operation, is so unlike anything CBS would dare to air. How? Well, in addition to eschewing the laugh track and multi-camera setup so common in CBS sitcoms, it's essentially My Dinner With Andre played out a few times over the window dressing of a police stakeout, and the whole thing plays out more like a televised stage play than a traditional series.\n\nThe comedy's distinguishing feature is also its riskiest; it's almost entirely comprised of scenes featuring two characters talking to each other out of boredom in single settings, while the illusion of something grander is supposedly playing out elsewhere. There's a pair of cops (Tim Meadows, co-creator Patrick Brammall) sitting in a car waiting for something to happen. There's two dispatchers (Amy Sedaris, Sunita Mani) back at the precinct waiting for something to happen. There's a couple of crooks (Jesse Plemons and a rotating cast) chilling in criminal spaces \u2014 say it with me \u2014 waiting for something to happen. And for the most part, nothing happens.\n\nSo, What's Will Ferrell's CBS All Access Cop Comedy No Activity About?\n\nIt shouldn't work, but it does for the most part thanks to a talented cast that can take absurd banter and make it lively, at least in the two episodes screened to critics. Sedaris goes T.M.I. about her masturbating son, Jason Mantzoukas \u2014 who hopefully has a regular role in the show because he's deservedly having a moment \u2014 goes on about his mom's cat that got out, and Meadows details an odd encounter he had with someone who was using his favorite workplace bathroom stall. However, the piece de resistance comes from guest star J.K. Simmons, playing an internal affairs officer, who ends the second episode with an epic monologue about how he ruined his life by submitting to love.\n\nIt's No Activity boiled down to its essentials; someone is talking, and it happens to be very funny. And with guest stars that include Ferrell, Bob Odenkirk, Michaela Watkins and Mackenzie Davis, it should continue to be funny. Just don't expect any major plot-driven humor, because nothing really happens.\n\nBut it could, which would make it one of television's greatest experiments in comedy. The threat of something happening is everywhere \u2014 at the end of Episode 1, something does happen and the show's tagline is \"Sh*t happens. Eventually\" \u2014 and it would be interesting to see if the show suddenly veers into plot-heavy action in winking and rewarding fashion at the end of its eight-episode first season and brings all of its characters together, because all the pieces are in place for some serious activity.\n\nNo Activity premieres Sunday, Nov. 12 on CBS All Access with new episodes released each week.\n\n(Full Disclosure: TV Guide is owned by CBS.)"

    "text": "The Dick Van Dyke Show - Now in Living Color!, a new one-hour special with two newly colorized back-to-back classic episodes of the beloved 1960s series, will be broadcast on Friday, Dec. 22 at 9/8c, following the I Love Lucy Christmas Special, on the CBS Television Network and CBS All Access.\n\n\n\nSeries creator and co-star Carl Reiner personally selected the two episodes to showcase the tremendous comedic talents of the late Mary Tyler Moore.\n\n\n\n\"I picked two of the funniest episodes we did, and I remember them fondly because they both showcased our wonderful Mary. I treasure her memory,\" said Reiner.\n\n\n\nThe special features the Season 1 episode \"My Blonde-Haired Brunette,\" written by Reiner, and the Season 3 episode \"October Eve,\" written by Bill Persky and Sam Denoff. The main titles and end credits of the two episodes are seamlessly combined into one set\u2014at the beginning and end of the hour\u2014with no interruption between the episodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning series starred Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore as television comedy writer Rob and his wife Laura Petrie; Larry Matthews as their son Ritchie; Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie as Buddy Sorrell and Sally Rogers, co-writers on the fictional The Alan Brady Show; Carl Reiner as Alan Brady; Richard Deacon as Mel Cooley; Jerry Paris as Dr. Jerry Helper; and Ann Morgan Guilbert as Millie Krumbermacher Helper.\n\n\n\nIn \"My Blonde-Haired Brunette,\" Laura dyes her hair blonde when she fears the romance in their marriage is fading. The episode was first presented on Oct. 10, 1961, during the series' first season.\n\n\n\nIn \"October Eve,\" a painting of Laura returns to haunt her when, despite her having posed fully clothed, the artist (played by Reiner) takes the liberty of \"undraping\" her. The episode was first presented on April 8, 1964, during Season 3.\n\n\n\n\"In 'October Eve,' I got a chance to perform on the show as someone other than Alan Brady, and I loved the character of Carpetna the artist as soon as I read it,\" said Reiner. \"When I saw it in color, it was better than I ever dreamed it could be.\"\n\n\n\nThe Dick Van Dyke Show originally aired on CBS from Oct. 3, 1961, through June 1, 1966, finishing in the Nielsen Top 10 in three of its five seasons, peaking at No. 3 during the 1963-1964 season. The show received 15 Primetime Emmy Awards, including three Emmys for Dick Van Dyke, five for Carl Reiner, and two for Mary Tyler Moore.\n\n\n\nWatch The Dick Van Dyke Show - Now in Living Color! on Friday, Dec. 22 at 9/8c, following the I Love Lucy Christmas Special on the CBS Television Network and CBS All Access."

Watch it now!\n\nThe new police drama S.W.A.T. has arrived on CBS and CBS All Access , and now you can get immersed in the show in a unique way! The second episode, \"Cuchillo,\" involved a huge action scene featuring Daniel \"Hondo\" Harrelson ( Shemar Moore ) dangling precariously from a helicopter.

You may need to watch a few times to notice everything.Note: The 360-degree experience may not work in all apps and browsers and some versions may only be available in the United States.

    "title": "Star Trek: Discovery Writers Pick Their Favorite Classic Trek Episodes",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Star Trek: Discovery Writers Pick Their Favorite Classic Trek Episodes\n\nStream these legendary episodes as Star Trek: Discovery continues on CBS All Access.\n\nFor more than 50 years, Star Trek has inspired multiple generations of fans, including the creators of the CBS All Access original series Star Trek: Discovery With the new show now underway, Star Trek: Discovery Executive Producers Alex Kurtzman, Akiva Goldsman, Gretchen J. Berg, and Aaron Harberts, as well as writers Ted Sullivan, Lisa Randolph, Jordon Nardino, Erika Lippoldt, Bo Yeon Kim, Kirsten Beyer, and Sean Cochran have revealed some of their absolute favorite classic Trek episodes\u2014or \"Trekisodes\"\u2014and what they mean to them as both fans and creators.Scroll down to see the team's top picks!A villain with a legitimately compelling reason \"why\" is rare currency and just about the hardest thing to accomplish. And so it began with Khan, whose motives are drawn by what's essentially a Spartacus story: Bred a slave, he rose against his less \"superior\" masters to declare his freedom\u2014a freedom he conflates with totalitarianism, firmly landing him a prime place in the pantheon of all-time greatest badasses. Decades later, with [Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan], the brilliant Nick Meyer built on Khan in what for me and many others became the best Trek movie of all time, which could never have existed if it weren't for this episode of TOS.Sacrilegious as it sounds, I prefer this two-parter to \"The Cage.\" It has almost all the benefits of the original\u2014Jeffrey Hunter as Pike, a literally cool Majel Barrett as Number One, emotional Spock, excellent sci-fi, and awesome scope and scale\u2014but all this is actually made better by its re-contextualization into the series proper. Spock's devotion to Pike years later, its juxtaposition to his relationship with Kirk, and its clever reintegration of the original material make for a deeper and more utopian Trek story. Bonus Elements: The only death penalty left on the books and a phaser cannon.The first time I watched it I burst into tears. I was so affected by the Horta and the twist. The way that Spock is able to see the Horta and then communicate with it and find out that this monster might not be a monster after all is such a profound piece of storytelling.The whole \"the monster was actually a mother protecting her babies\" thing made quite an impact on me as a kid watching Trek for the first time.Patrick Stewart gives a stunning performance and it breaks the mold for traditional storytelling within Star Trek. It's bold and emotionally complex. It also had a lasting impact on Picard, which is an element of serialized storytelling that we're looking to build upon on our show.I was blown away by this beautiful (and gut-wrenching) first contact story that intricately weaves science fiction, mystery, and drama together into... well, a Ressikan flute solo. A masterclass in how to execute a high sci-fi concept via a grounded, emotional tale about family, life, and death.It's written by our own Joe Menosky. It's everything great about Star Trek. It's one of the best Prime Directive stories ever told. And it's about understanding \"the other\"\u2014which is a lesson we can all re-learn these days. And something we have baked into the DNA of our show as well.Even before I had the honor of writing Star Trek: Discovery with Joe Menosky, I was in awe of his writing. This episode is one of the smartest episodes of science fiction ever created. It's a beautiful exploration of two cultures seeking to find common ground. To communicate. To grow. And that journey comes with great sacrifice. Patrick Stewart and Paul Winfield give jaw-dropping performances as they slowly move their two cultures toward mutual understanding.This episode is compelling from start to finish, but does not rely on phaser shootouts or space battles. Instead, it does what Star Trek does best: it's about sharing ideas and expanding our understanding of each other.The concept of basing a language on metaphor remains stunning to this day, and the simple story of these two beings trying to communicate is the essence of Trek.Beyond the involvement of the brilliant Joe Menosky, who wrote it, and the legendary Paul Winfield, who turned in one of the all-time Trek performances, I love how this episode highlights the lengths to which we must sometimes go to find common understanding with those dissimilar to us. That tragedy and loss are often central to cultural breakthroughs is something often found throughout history but rarely emphasized.I watched this two-parter a lot for inspiration when we were writing the 2009 [Star Trek movie]. It helped me understand how to return Spock to the fold with the meaning and coronation one would expect from the great Vulcan's homecoming, but also pointed us toward the potential for a scene between elder and younger Spock.The inspiration came from the scene between Spock and Data, a Trekker's dream come true, and I can only imagine the challenge [Michael Piller and Rick Berman] felt in tackling it. They executed [their relationship] perfectly by echoing them as opposite sides of the same coin: an android who yearns to become more human, and a Vulcan who's spent his elder years suppressing his human side. (Maybe it's just how I read into it, but it always felt like the absence of Kirk's friendship in Spock's life played into that.)A deeply emotional scene held in restraint, it's a portrait of two beings both fascinated and confused by their similarities and differences, and reaching for understanding. That sums up what Trek is all about and gives poignant double meaning to the title \"Unification.\"A cool metaphysical mystery that explores what life is and what consciousness means\u2014classic Trek. But like \"The Naked Time\" and \"Shore Leave,\" this episode also gives the supporting cast a chance to step into the spotlight. I love seeing more of Uhura's love for singing and hearing her speak Swahili (a terrific reminder that Trek could be something other than American-centric). I also really like seeing Uhura and Nurse Chapel bond as friends.So many people's favorite Trek episode, including mine. Brilliant Harlan Ellison screenplay, made better by Roddenberry and company. Thought provoking sci-fi, and strong period work. Some of my favorite Trek elements: a return to earth, Starfleet revealed to civilians, naturalistic acting\u2014all wrapped up inside a profound emotional punch. If streaming were available then, Kirk's loss of Edith Keeler would have taken him seasons to get over. Crazed Dr. McCoy and self-critical Spock, awesome bonus elements.Probably the safest choice a fan could ever make, but for good reason. Harlan Ellison created a morality tale that was complex, emotionally rich, and profoundly enlightening. He used all the pieces on the Trek chessboard like a grandmaster.It was the first episode I ever saw (way back in the Dark Ages of 1979). As a young boy, I was confused by what I was watching. It was a science-fiction show set in the future, but the action took place in the past. The handsome hero did not save the beautiful woman (like Mighty Mouse or Superman always did). And the ending made me very sad, even though I also understood it was the right thing to do. It instantly opened my young eyes to not only a different kind of storytelling, but a different way of thinking about life and the choices we make. I credit this episode with shaping my morality more than any single other story.Joan Collins co-stars in the closest thing we'll ever get to Douglas Sirk directing Star Trek. Illustrating the tragedy of personal sacrifice for the greater good is Trek at its best and most poignant.The Led Zeppelin of Trek episodes, some people might hear this as a favorite, moan, and then ask for a more interesting answer. But despite this, Led Zeppelin is still one of my favorite bands, and this is still one of my favorite episodes. Quintessential Trek in every possible way, it underscores how difficult a moral choice can be and complicates it even more by asking Kirk to consider the future\u2014that which he has not yet seen\u2014over the happiness and experiences of his present.In hindsight, I'm completely blown away with how brilliantly \"The Game\" captured where we are with screens in a modern society. It's so predictive about where we are and how we interface with our phones and entertainment. Plus, who doesn't love seeing Ashley Judd in one of her first TV performances!This episode, in which Data creates his daughter Lal, stood out when I first watched it as a kid. Now as an adult and a parent, the story has taken on a deeper meaning and leaves me absolutely heartbroken.Michelle Forbes steals the show as the titular Ensign Ro Laren. I am a huge fan of both the actress and the character, and the female camaraderie between Ro and Guinan in the episode was particularly layered and memorable.A powerful episode to watch unfold, even if you already know what's going to happen. \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" doesn't just delight with a counterfactual, but enriches us with the story of good people hurtling towards a noble purpose. It is, to me, the most touching hour of television Trek has given us.\"Message in a Bottle\" has something to say: Trek is fun. We get the curiosity of our Doctor thrown into a life-and-death situation, the delight of his friction, and then, cooperation, with his equivalent (Andy Dick) back home, and a touching payoff when Starfleet learns Voyager is not lost. Like the Doctor himself, this episode is fully functional.Did you know this episode was screened for cadets at the United States Air Force Academy as an illustration of the honor code they were expected to serve? I did, because I read it on IMDB trivia. Wesley Crusher, you may have been at one time the kid we all wanted to eject into space, but you came back and showed us what being Starfleet was really all about.There are definitely better episodes of Trek to include on this list. But none that have give me so much pleasure as the moment Troi, in full Romulan drag, threatens to eject someone into space! Truly iconic. Your fave could never.A game-changing episode that revealed a whole new facet to a series five seasons in, and created a launching point for the brilliant Season 6 of DS9. Not only did this episode manage to heighten the stakes in an unexpected manner, it gave way to some of the juiciest character moments to date. When Sisko says \"This has become my home, and you have become my family,\" the emotion behind those words is completely earned\u2014and reminds us that even though the show was taking chances, it was still about family, as all Trek is.The reintroduction of a core TNG cast-member as a regular on another series could have felt cheap or forced\u2014but fortunately for us, it turned out to be a wonderfully executed season premiere. The continued exploration of Worf's identity struggle between Klingon and Starfleet, his integration into the ensemble of this show\u2014while doing them justice as well\u2014and the cool action made for an extremely satisfying episode.Only on Star Trek can a semi-bottle show, structured as the formal hearing of an android, turn out to be one of the most thought-provoking episodes (in the franchise, if not in science fiction television) that asks what it means to be human.I love seeing how Kira and Dax get stranded and have to work together. They're not talking about boys, they're two strong women who are trying to fix a problem. They rely on their brains and skills. And it's one of the things I love most about Trek. And it's exciting to see that play out in our show with [ Sonequa Martin-Green ], [ Michelle Yeoh ], and [ Mary Wiseman ].There's always that one episode where everything just \"clicks\" for you, the one that makes you realize when you're helplessly in love with a show. This was that episode for me with DS9. It had a wonderful balance of action and comedy, vaguely disguised as a bottle show (for which I have a great affinity), through which somehow every character was given an opportunity to shine. It also brilliantly utilized the space station and its notorious history as a Cardassian station, creating (quite literally) a ticking time bomb.An absolutely riveting episode with spectacularly written twists that you don't see coming. The climax is simple: six people walking down a hallway... and it\u2019s totally thrilling (helped by an amazing score by Jay Chattaway\u2014one of my favorites in all of Trek). I have also always loved the O'Brien/Keiko dynamic, and it's front and center here in this \"Die Hard in space\" episode of TNG.This episode had a huge impact on me when I first watched it. It deals with science, morality, and the definition of life itself. Is a shark evil if it eats a person? Or is it merely existing? I particularly loved the fact that this story has a tragic ending. (I find tragedy makes stronger points than happy endings.) Picard's adherence to the principles of Starfleet are beautifully illustrated here, which is what makes his elation at making first contact so powerful... and his devastation at the subsequent death so gut-wrenching.Time travel! Tribbles! Kirk! Spock! Tribbles! Jadzia Dax in a TOS red miniskirt! Tribbles! What more could you possibly want? Just a superbly, seamlessly executed homage to The Original Series, yet equally a quintessential DS9 story. And this episode includes one of my favorite writing \"cheats\" with Worf's line, in reference to the Klingons' lack of cranial ridges in TOS: \"We do not discuss it with outsiders.\" F***ing brilliant.Can't get enough of Benny Russell. \"For all we know he's out there right now dreaming of us.\" It feels classic while being entirely meta. I love how it doesn't shy away from the implications of race in the period and the tragedy of Russell's ultimate fate.My personal favorite. Tim Russ's direction was fantastic. Picardo turned in a heart-breaking performance as the EMH left behind. For him, it was yesterday; for everyone else, hundreds of years had passed. Great premise\u2014how does history remember us? And lots of campy fun for the rest of the cast.I've always loved the character of Sarek, and this episode was probably one of the better Trek episodes dealing with emotion. Also touching on the experiences of growing old, to see Sarek shed a tear in the concert scene gets me every damn time.It's fun, and plays with secondary characters like Sulu and McCoy. And it also has a giant rabbit in a vest. Only in Star Trek.A great Spock/McCoy episode that hinged on what is now a staple of classic Star Trek\u2014the half-human, half-Vulcan's struggle between logic and emotion.The fun of a long-running series is often found in giving new insight into characters the audience has come to feel they know, and showing how the characters have grown since they were introduced. This episode does just that\u2014Riker finds himself reunited with his former captain (giving depth to his backstory) and is confronted with a mission that tests his loyalties and poses a moral dilemma\u2014complete with a science mystery. All the makings of a great episode of Trek.Stream the entire first season of Star Trek: Discovery , exclusively on CBS All Access"

    "text": "Star Trek: Discovery Stars Weigh In On THAT Pivotal Moment From Episode 1\n\nThe brand-new series gets off to a rousing start!\n\nViewers tuning in to the series premiere of Star Trek: Discovery got quite a shock at the end of the first episode, entitled \" The Vulcan Hello ,\" when the series' main character, Michael Burnham ( Sonequa Martin-Green ), committed mutiny against her captain and mentor, Philippa Georgiou ( Michelle Yeoh ).\"Oh my God\u2014horror, the sense of betrayal!\" Michelle laments in a video examining the earth-shattering moment. \"Michael Burnham is my baby, right? \u2026 When that happened, it was like a stab through the heart, because I think that was the last thing she expected from her Number One.\"Watch the video above for more from stars Michelle, Sonequa, Doug Jones , and Executive Producer Aaron Harberts.Of course, Burnham didn't take this treacherous act lightly; the fate of her entire crew\u2014including Georgiou\u2014was at stake, with the Klingon sarcophagus ship poised to attack the U.S.S. Shenzhou.From Burnham's point of view, the only due course of action was to go against Georgiou's order to stand down, and incapacitate her superior officer with a Vulcan nerve pinch\u2014a move that, ultimately, in her mind, would benefit the Federation.\"I truly believed it was one of those times where you have to override protocol,\" Sonequa says of her character's tough call. \"And I felt that, if there was ever a moment where you deny these sorts of principles that we live by, it would be to save lives.\"Such a serious violation of Starfleet regulations will undoubtedly come at a cost for Burnham, but the question remains: Will it have been worth it?Stream the entire first season of Star Trek: Discovery , exclusively on CBS All Access"

And another. And another.Watch all of the big moments below!The Emmys\u00ae kicked off with a song and dance routine for the opening number, which was packed with nods to hit shows, lots of Easter Eggs for TV fans, and a performance by Chance the Rapper.Stephen segued into the type of monologue that his fans love\u2014fearlessly tackling current events, teasing attendees (including himself), and incorporating some notable figures. Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer even dropped by to estimate the Emmy crowd size, and drew big reactions from Melissa McCarthy and Anna Chlumsky.Later in the show, Stephen delivered on a much-anticipated moment \u2014getting naked as part of a Westworld spoof. Tituss Burgess approved.As part of the Emmys' big night, Stephen sat down for an exclusive interview with \"Emmy\" herself, played by the one and only RuPaul.Always of service to his audience, Stephen took a moment during the show to lead the traditional Hollywood Prayer, a, uhhh ... humble moment of reflection and soon-to-be hallowed tradition, we're sure.Of course, Stephen was also a nominee this year. Unfortunately for both him and Jimmy Kimmel, so was John Oliver . Stephen and Jimmy spent a little quality time commiserating and sharing some thoughts about their late-night colleague.Stream the 69th Emmy\u00ae Awards on CBS and CBS All Access"

Well, as you might expect, being bestowed with a coveted gold statuette is a pretty complex process.We've already told you how an Emmy Award gets made , but here's a question: How do you actually win one?In honor of the 69th Emmy\u00ae Awards , which air live on Sunday, Sept. 17 at 8 PM ET / 5 PM PT on CBS and CBS All Access , we thought we'd shine a light onto how to win an Emmy!In order to be considered for an Emmy, you'll need to submit a program, performer, or individual achievement for consideration. (This year, the submission deadline was between June 1, 2016 and May 31, 2017.)Once submissions are in, voters choose the entries they feel exemplify excellence in their categories.Fun fact: The Television Academy includes more than 22,000 voting members within 29 peer groups, each representing specific professions within the TV industry.After you submit your work, the good people at Ernst & Young will hand-check all the ballots. The top contenders will earn nominations. This year, those lucky contenders were announced on July 13 by Shemar Moore and Anna Chlumsky Here are the 2017 Emmy nominees , in case you need a refresher!Since 2015, eligible voting members have been able to watch content through a secure online platform, which roughly translates to an epic episode-binging session.Small caveat: Voters must cast online votes for their favorite nominees by August 28!Remember those handy-dandy accountants we told you about before? Here, they swoop in with their calculators yet again to hand-check ballots and crunch the numbers.Finally, the winners\u2019 names are printed, sealed, and loaded into secure briefcases.On Sunday, Sept. 17, a briefcase containing these winners' names will travel to the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, where they will be used to announce who will walk away with a gorgeous gold statuette during the 69th Emmy Awards.Who will be a part of the new crop of winners?Watch the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards , hosted by Stephen Colbert , live on Sunday, Sept. 17 at 8 PM ET / 5 PM PT on CBS and CBS All Access Infographic courtesy of the Television Academy."

    "text": "Who Is Maren Morris? 5 Things You Need To Know\n\nLearn more about the country singer, who will perform at 11th Annual ACM Honors on Friday, Sept. 15.\n\nAt just 27, Maren Morris has managed to shake up the country world with her crafty lyricism, hook-heavy jams, and unapologetically brazen attitude. Propelled by songs like \"80s Mercedes\" and \"My Church,\" Morris' debut album, Hero, earned her a host of accolades and award nominations, not to mention a bevy of enthusiastic fans.It's no wonder the Texas singer has been selected to perform and present at the 11th Annual ACM Honors , airing on Friday, Sept. 15 at 9/8c on CBS and CBS All Access . She has all the potential of an icon-in-the-making, so get familiar with her with these five need-to-know facts.Like a lot of hopeful singers, Morris originally took her talents to the reality competition circuit, auditioning for two wildly popular singing competition shows; but, sadly, she was turned down by both.However, it turns out those particular rejections didn't slow her down and didn't stop Morris from breaking into the country-music scene.In a sweet bit of irony, in 2016, things came full circle when contestants from both shows sang her hit \"My Church\" for the judges.Though she had a decade of performance experience behind her, Morris didn't originally intend to be a country singer.She moved to Nashville to pursue songwriting, but was repeatedly told her songs sounded so personal, they were meant for her to sing herself.She told NPR that \"My Church\" was the push she needed to embrace her destiny as a headlining act, saying, \"The second that song was done and we were listening back to it, the first thought in my mind was, 'Wow, they were right. I'm not sending this to anybody.'\"Morris' fiance is Ryan Hurd, a singer/songwriter who penned Blake Shelton's \"Lonely Tonight,\" among other hits.He and Morris met during a songwriting session in 2013, where they ended up collaborating on what would eventually become Tim McGraw 's hit \"Last Turn Home.\"Then, in 2016, they started dating. Fans who saw Morris on her Hero headlining tour probably even saw the singer's beau, who opened for her in venues across the country.Along with country greats like Dixie Chicks and Sheryl Crow, Morris constantly name-checks Britney Spears, Spice Girls, and other iconic pop acts as inspiration, which is hardly a surprise once you listen to Hero, because the debut is packed with radio-ready jams boasting instantly catchy hooks.She's admitted to taking songwriting cues from Backstreet Boys, and cites Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran as performers whose onstage energy and charisma she aims to emulate.In 2016, her native Arlington proclaimed December 27th \"Maren Morris Day.\"The singer accepted the official proclamation from Mayor Jeff Williams at her parents' salon in downtown Arlington, and later wrote on Instagram that receiving the honor was \"so cool.\"As one of the most exciting new voices in country music, Morris is unquestionably an artist worth watching.Stay tuned for more ACM Honors updates , and watch the 11th Annual ACM Honors on Friday, Sept. 15 at 9/8c on CBS and CBS All Access"

    "text": "Star Trek: Discovery Will Feature Shift Toward Long-Form, Serialized Storytelling\n\nCast and crew offer more juicy details on the upcoming CBS All Access original series.\n\nOn Tuesday, during the CBS TCA Press Day, the cast and crew of Star Trek: Discovery left their marquee panel with a resounding mission statement\u2014that this iteration of the beloved franchise will boast unprecedented conflict, long-form storytelling, and serialization.\"It's the most serialized Star Trek ,\" Executive Producer Akiva Goldsman said of Discovery. \"You will find this to be far more serialized than Deep Space Nine , even in its [last few] seasons ... It's long-form character storytelling.\"\"It's one thing to speak of a utopia,\" said Sonequa Martin-Green (First Officer Michael Burnham) while explaining how those ideals have influenced the franchise and the new series. \"To be able to see it in action, to see us aspiring to it, we haven't reached this perfection yet, but we're trying\u2014and I think it's going to be really compelling because you\u2019re seeing us try and fail and try again.\" Jason Isaacs (Captain Gabriel Lorca) expanded on the notion: \"With [our show], you can start the discussion,\" drawing a contrast to other versions of Star Trek, which would often encompass the entire discussion in a single episode. \"That's the richness that you get from a long-form story.\"As for the on-screen presentation, EP Alex Kurtzman emphasized, \"This show is massive. It's massive, massive, massive.\"With almost all practical sets as well as incredibly elaborate costumes and character designs, it was imperative that everything remain up to the production's standards.\"We just wanted to do it right,\" Kurtzman continued. \"We took our time, and hopefully now you're seeing the results of the work everyone has done here.\"Sonequa echoed the EPs' sentiments about the sheer size and scope of the new series\u2014and the responsibility.\"Our cups are running over with gratitude and excitement, and we're bursting at the seams from the weight of it and the breadth of it,\" she said. \"We couldn't be more thrilled to share this journey with you, because we understand its significance. We know that we're telling a story we believe in.\"Everybody is so passionate, the craftsmanship here [in front of and behind the camera] is nothing short of stellar. This is an epically grand yet microscopically tuned, deeply emotional story. We don't take it for granted. We don't take it lightly; I certainly don't.\"Later, the EPs addressed the decision behind giving Sonequa's character a traditionally male name, \"Michael.\"\"That was [Bryan Fuller's] idea,\" Kurtzman said. \"I think he just felt that name.\"\"We talked about it in the entire room,\" said Executive Producer Aaron Harberts. \"And, of course, an archangel is named Michael as well, and it just had a lot of potency for us.\"While not necessarily canon, Sonequa added that she worked the name into her own personal backstory.\"[I] decided for my creation, and for my background, that I was named after my [biological] father,\" she said. \"We get a little bit of exploration of the father-daughter dynamic. I think it's a lovely symbol.\"Above all, Star Trek: Discovery will aspire to Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's original vision for the franchise.\"I think the defining characteristic of Mr. Roddenberry's universe is optimism,\" Kurtzman explained. \"We talk about that all the time. We are working with [Roddenberry's] son to make sure that legacy\u2014it's not a small thing we've inherited; it's a huge thing.\"Like many of the cast and producers on the panel, Jason was a fan growing up. He recalled that when he was a boy in England, his siblings would argue over which of three television channels they would watch on any given night. But when Star Trek was on? \"There was no argument!\"\"The idea of being in Star Trek was impossible for me to imagine,\" said James Frain, who plays Sarek. \"I loved it ... I can\u2019t find the right words!\"Looking ahead, the cast and crew offered a special treat to the audience gathered inside the room: a behind-the-scenes look at the recording session for Discovery's main title theme, which runs about a minute and a half. It was composed by Jeff Russo and brought to life by a staggering 60-piece orchestra.Keep your ears perked up to find out more about the new theme and all things Star Trek: Discovery in the weeks ahead.Stream the entire first season of Star Trek: Discovery , exclusively on CBS All Access"

    "text": "Back From The Dead: An Interview With Zoo Star Billy Burke\n\nThe Zoo star gives us a glimpse of what to expect\u2014including Mitch Morgan's return\u2014in Season 3 of Zoo.\n\nIn the Season 2 finale of Zoo , we watched through tears as Mitch Morgan sacrificed himself to prevent the hybrid animals from escaping Pangea. In a twist no one saw coming: Mitch is back! This season, we fast-forward 10 years\u2014and it isn't a pretty picture. While the cure was effective, it caused sterility amongst the humans. With the population dwindling, the team is forced to face an even deadlier challenge: the army of lab-made monsters Mitch gave his life to contain. Billy Burke , who stars as the notoriously snippy scientist, shared some on-set insight and teased what's to come this season on Zoo Oh yeah, I knew. As I recall there were rumblings about it on set even before the producers had a chance to come to me and lay out what their plan was. It was the idea of a 10-year jump ahead that was more of an eyebrow raiser for all of us. Mitch getting eaten alive by hybrid razorbacks but somehow surviving seemed like an easy thing to pull off in comparison.: Like a return to the womb. Nope. Kidding. It was pretty much how you'd expect it to be like shooting that scene in an unheated warehouse... in January... in Canada. They kept the water at a pretty manageable temperature so being IN the tank was the relief. Being out of it was the sucky part.: It's actually a lot less awkward and constricting than it used to be. The days of making stupid faces at a tennis ball in front of a green screen are pretty much gone, at least they are with the tech we use now. Our CGI guys can put an image pretty much anywhere the actors are looking, and from the little I've seen so far they've really upped the game this year. That said, we do have to react to stuff that isn't there. There's no secret to making it work other than just doing your best to \"believe\" there IS something there.: When Mitch last saw Clementine she was 10 years old, and to that point they'd had a pretty estranged relationship due to divorce. She's been saddled with a terminal disease her entire life for which he'd been tirelessly searching to find a cure. I think if he's tried to teach her anything it's just to hang on, no matter what. That said, as the story unfolds I think we'll find that as with all parent-child relationships, sometimes the elder learns more from the younger.: Do we have flying cars yet?Watch Zoo on Thursdays at 10/9c on CBS and CBS All Access."

    "text": "All The Reasons Why We Love Katey Sagal On Superior Donuts\n\nWhen it comes to being smart, caring, and sarcastic, Katey proves she has it all as Randy DeLuca.\n\nIf you've been watching Superior Donuts since the beginning, then there's a good chance you've grown to love Officer Randy DeLuca (played by Katey Sagal ), whose sweet and salty personality shines through with every new episode.But there's much more behind this no-nonsense cop than meets the eye, which only fuels our adoration for the character\u2014and the talented actress who plays her!Here are a few of the reasons why Randy (and Katey) make Superior Donuts more delicious.Randy isa highly respected Chicago police officer who has been keeping the community safe for years.Locals trust her, so when this cop demands something\u2014whether it's backup, or a half-dozen glazed\u2014it's not uncommon for everyone around her to listen up.Randy's always at the ready with witty comebacks and has mastered the art of leaving an impression with very few words.Some of our favorite one-liners include: \"Can he take me to the future when this conversation is over?\" ( \"Crime Time\") and \"You're wearing a Rasta hat and you smell like day three of Coachella\" ( \"Takin' It To The Streets\" ).As a little girl, Randy would frequently accompany her dad to Superior Donuts to visit his best friend, Arthur, which explains her effortless ability to connect with the confection-making curmudgeon and encourage him to embrace the changing times.In one of Superior Donuts' most controversial episodes, \"The Amazing Racists,\" Randy stuck by Franco's side after Officer Lee randomly stopped-and-frisked him for no reason.Though, Lee was the one who handled the dispute, Randy later came to Franco's defense and provided him with the compassion he deserved for an unfortunate situation gone wrong.As much as we've learned about Randy on the show, there's also a mysterious quality to the feisty character, which makes her even more intriguing.That said, we can't wait to learn more about Office DeLuca as her backstory unfolds on Superior Donuts.Watch all-new episodes of Superior Donuts on Mondays at 9/8c, following Man With A Plan , on CBS and CBS All Access"

    "text": "Who Is Jon Pardi? 5 Things You Need To Know\n\nCheck out these fun tidbits about the New Male Vocalist Of The Year presented by T-Mobile.\n\nWith a name like Jon Pardi , you know you're in for a good time. The 31-year-old makes music with a rollicking, old-school vibe\u2014classic country with a modern beat\u2014that wins over old and new country fans alike.With two studio albums and a string of boot-stompin' hits under his belt, the party's just getting started for Pardi. Plus, after winning New Male Vocalist Of The Year presented by T-Mobile , he's clearly one worth watching\u2014and knowing more about!Not everyone in the Golden State is a surf-loving beach boy. Take Pardi, who grew up in the Northern California farming community of Dixon and hails from a long line of cattle ranchers and butchers.He was also raised on a steady diet of Dwight Yoakam, Merle Haggard, and Buck Owens, and almost as soon as he started playing music, he started performed at the Dixon May Fair and, eventually, on the local bar circuit.His 2016 sophomore album, California Sunrise, plays homage to his home state, and clearly struck a chord with country fans; it debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Country Albums chart.In 2014, before he even released his debut album, Write You A Song, Pardi gained a reputation as a charismatic and rowdy road warrior, playing live whenever he could.In the years since, he's toured constantly and relentlessly, opening for Dierks Bentley Luke Bryan , Eric Church, and even country legend Alan Jackson, who handpicked Pardi for his 25th-anniversary tour in 2015.In December 2013, Pardi went under the knife to repair a knee injury from his days as a high-school football player. The operation took place just a month before the release of his debut album, so the pressure was on to heal quickly and get back on the promotional grind.It all went smoothly, and Pardi later said the surgery actually made him a better performer.\"It really started bugging me when it started affecting my onstage dancing,\" he said about the injury. \"I'd get all into the music and start dancing around and try to do some karate chops up onstage; [then], before I knew it, I would get stuck in some crazy George Strait position. It wasn't pretty.\"Two of Pardi's biggest hits to date are the lovey-dovey \"Head Over Boots\" and the bouncy \"Dirt On My Boots.\"The semblance isn't lost on him: he admits he was skeptical about releasing two boot-referencing singles back to back, but ultimately trusted his record label's judgment.After all, what the worst that could happen? A boot sponsorship? Doesn't seem like a bad deal to us.Pardi is the real deal, a true artist who puts his signature stamp on every song. Along with songwriter/producer Bart Butler, Pardi co-wrote and co-produced his entire debut album, packing it with steel guitars and lots of twang.He and Butler teamed up again for California Sunrise, which was recorded live with a studio band. Pardi co-produced that album as well, and co-wrote seven of its 12 tracks.Impressed yet? Because we sure are!Pardi may be considered a new kid in the country scene, but he brings a wealth of experience and energy to his craft. As his star power continues to grow, his old-school flair gets more and more irresistible.This is a party definitely worth joining!Learn more about the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards on CBS.com."

    "text": "Who Are Brothers Osborne? 5 Things You Need To Know\n\nCheck out these fun tidbits about the New Vocal Duo Or Group Of The Year presented by T-Mobile.\n\nFirst things first: Yes, Brothers Osborne are indeed real-life brothers. The Maryland-born, Nashville-based duo of T.J. and John Osborne (T.J.'s the clean-shaven lead singer, John's the scruffy guitarist) perform passionate country-rock with a hint of soul.They bring an outsider's POV to Nashville, often talking about wanting to bring authenticity back to country music.Clearly, it's working; their 2016 debut album, Pawn Shop, spawned a string of hits, including \"Rum,\" \"Ain't My Fault,\" and the GRAMMY-nominated \"Stay A Little Longer.\"Now, the brothers are fresh off of a 52nd ACM Award win for New Vocal Duo Or Group Of The Year presented by T-Mobile , so it's time to get familiar with the bluesy bros. Here are five things you need to know.Only two years apart and the middle of five kids, John and T.J. were close growing up. They even shared a room and slept in bunk beds until John left for college.They learned to sing and play guitar together, as well, during all-night jam sessions that their parents hosted on weekends.It wasn't long before they began writing on their own, and, after John moved to Nashville in 2000, T.J. unsurprisingly followed suit two years later to join forces with his big bro.The brothers grew up in Deale, Maryland, a small fishing town on the Atlantic seaboard. Most people don't think of Maryland when they think of country music, so the brothers decided to show off their blue-collar stomping grounds in the video for \"Rum.\"A majority of the clip was filmed at a dockside bar called Happy Harbor, where John and T.J. had their first paying gigs as teens.They recruited locals to appear in the video, having them lip-sync the breezy, boozy song and showing off a normal day in Deale, gray skies and all.As teenagers, John and T.J. played in a band called Jax 'n' Jive and, together, won their high school's Battle Of The Bands competition in 1999.They also played in a cover band with their dad\u2014who was a plumber by day, and a music lover 24/7\u2014called Deuce And A Quarter, which performed tunes by the likes of Merle Haggard and Lynyrd Skynyrd in local bars around Deale.Plus, during this era in their pre-career, their dad prepped T.J. and John for the grueling tour grind by insisting they learn enough songs to play four-hour sets.Much like an actual pawn shop, the duo's 2016 album is an eclectic collection. The title track is about living on the cheap while managing to find diamonds in the rough, and tackles the heart-wrenching decision between selling an instrument and affording rent.John explained to Billboard that visiting pawn shops is one of their favorite hobbies while traveling, saying, \"We go to pawn shops in almost every city we visit. It's a race to see who can find that one cool steal.\"Some of the most iconic duos in music history follow the \"singer and guitarist\" format, including The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, and Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, to name a couple.John and T.J. fit that mold, and they look to those kinds of pairings to inspire their own guitar-and-vocals arrangements.The country world is stacked with electrifying groups climbing their way up the charts, but Brothers Osborne stand out from the pack with their brazen music and brotherly bond.Get used to seeing them 'round here because their reign as country's hottest duo is only just beginning.Learn more about the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards on CBS.com."

In this track, Moore boasts about having \"got a rough side, a wild side, at least a country-mile wide,\" which makes us think this Arkansas native is the kind of guy who's built Ford tough.This one might be a somber ballad, but the song goes to prove that a truck is so much more than just a mode of transportation.Young sings the ode to a brother at war and, though, the jarhead bequeaths his truck should he not return home, Young never loses hope and decides to fix every dent and ding, all except for the truck's heart and soul: \"The Dashboard.\"There's personal memories and a deep history in Rice's 4x4, so much so, that if you \"wanna know what [he's] made of, just look at [his] truck.\"According to Toby Keith, there's nothing more attractive than a girl in a \"Big Ol' Truck,\" and we happen to agree.This ballad is the perfect example of how trucks can have profound significance, so sing-along with Brice as he honors his trusty truck for hauling around a lifetime of memories.From picking up his first date at 16 to cruising around with an eight-foot bed, Diffie outlines his truck's rich history.Take his word for it: \"Once around the block and you'll know what he means!\"Grab someone special to ride in the front seat, roll down the windows, and crank these truckin' awesome tunes on the road to the 52nd ACM Awards Learn more about the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards on CBS.com."

    "text": "5 Songs You Need To Know From 52nd ACM Award Winner Jon Pardi\n\nTap your toes to these hit songs from the winner of New Male Vocalist Of The Year presented by T-Mobile.\n\nWhile the 52nd ACM Awards don't take place until Sunday, April 2, up-and-coming country crooner Jon Pardi can certainly start celebrating early after winning New Male Vocalist Of The Year presented by T-Mobile Pardi, who grew up in sunny California, started writing at the tender age of 12 and, from there, hit the ground running by almost immediately moving to Nashville after his high-school graduation.Since opening for Dierks Bentley in 2010, Pardi has come a long from being the first act on the bill. In fact, after he released his first song in 2012, it only took a few years and two highly acclaimed albums for Pardi to morph into the headliner that country-music fans are coming to see.Before Pardi takes the stage to perform at the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards , which is hosted by Luke Bryan and Dierks Bentley and airs live on Sunday, April 2 at 8/7c on CBS and CBS All Access , make sure to give these five songs a listen.Released in March 2012, \"Missin' You Crazy,\" shows off the singer's natural talent crafting intricate lyrics as the song presents a wistful narrative that's totally relatable for anyone who's ever been in a long-distance relationship.The crooner's second single, which features classic country's signature twang, is about what it's like to be young and in love, and quickly became the California native's first Top 10 hit.While this tune's rock-'n'-roll-inspired melody might be different from the rest of Pardi's songs, it further proves the fresh-faced crooner is nothing less than versatile.True to form, the first single off Pardi's sophomore album, California Sunrise, finds the singer speaking straight from his heart, allowing himself to be honest and vulnerable\u2014two things that are often imitated but never duplicated.Pardi's most recent single, which peppers fiddle riffs into a steady, uptempo beat, gets your toes tapping from the very start and, from there, you might just find yourself scootin' around the floor.Learn more about the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards on CBS.com."

John and TJ have come a long way since then, but they haven't lost a shred of their passion for making music.If you aren't already familiar with Brothers Osborne, these five songs are an incredible place to start.Released in 2013 as the duo's debut single, \"Let's Go There\" shows country-music fans that these brothers have a pure sound of their own, which is filled with a healthy dose of blues and honest storytelling.This tune has a garage-rock feel that often side-steps into some majorly funky grooves. We'll cheers to that!A relationship is on the rocks and the guitar is off the leash on \"Stay A Little Longer,\" which was written by the brothers and Shane McAnally, who's nominated for Songwriter Of The Year at the 52nd ACM Awards.Hoping to achieve a Jackson Browne-type vibe on this one, the brothers brought in family members to add their own interesting harmonies, which adds even layers to an already deep and beautiful track.On this song, which is off the pair's highly anticipated sophomore album, Pawn Shop, it's all spunk\u2014and a small amount of punk\u2014as TJ and John proudly skirt responsibility for all the old-fashioned jamming going on here.Watch Brothers Osborne perform at the 52nd ACM Awards , hosted by Luke Bryan and Dierks Bentley Learn more about the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards on CBS.com."

    "text": "5 Awesome Yet Totally Unexpected Country Collaborations\n\nWhen country artists veer outside the genre's lines, incredible things can happen.\n\nWhen Florida Georgia Line announced they'd be taking the 52nd ACM Awards stage on Sunday, April 2 at 8/7c on CBS with Backstreet Boys , we were reminded of the musical magic that can occur when artists from different genres stop to collaborate.Whether it involves pop stars, rappers, or boy bands, the collaboration possibilities for country's finest are endless\u2014and, when done right, they can give music lovers of all kinds something special to sink their teeth into.Read on for few more examples of other country artists who shocked us with their cross-genre ventures.In 2016, Backstreet came back, but not in the way people expected. Instead, the veteran man band joined forces with hit country duo Florida Georgia Line for a tribute to the type of love that's truly larger than life and can only be matched by a higher power\u2014and, of course, the mother of your children.The only thing sweeter than the harmony-rich song itself is the accompanying music video, which shows each singer surprising his significant other with roses, champagne\u2014the works.P!nk's mastery of massive pop choruses came in handy for this wistful ballad from Chesney's 2016 album, Cosmic Hallelujah, which is nominated for Vocal Event Of The Year at the 52nd ACM Awards.\"Setting The World On Fire\" recounts a fiery fling in the City of Angels, and P!nk and Chesney's voices blend gorgeously as they remember their younger, wilder days.At the end of the track, the romantic urgency finally boils over with P!nk's explosive hook, which is tailor-made for shouting from open car windows.This one might be outta left field, but don't mistake its unexpectedness for insignificance.Nelly pairs his surprisingly vulnerable verses with McGraw's moving, yet regretful hook about losing his lover to another man, and now we understand why \"Over And Over\" was a massive crossover hit in 2014.In 1996, the unlikely duo of Toby Keith and Sting teamed up for a divorce-themed ditty about a man whose wife left him and took their two children.Heavy stuff.The duet first appeared on Sting's 1996 album Mercury Falling but didn't become a hit until Keith included it on his 1997 album, Dream Walkin', which sparked \"I'm So Happy, I Can't Stop Crying\" to subsequently soar up the charts and gave Sting his first country hit. Clarkson 's emotionally raw 2005 single \"Because Of You\" was written about her parents' divorce and her tough relationship with her father.Two years later, she re-recorded it as a duet with her mother-in-law, Reba McEntire, for the country legend's Duets album.Learn more about the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards on CBS.com."

    "text": "You don\u2019t need to know much about The Good Wife to join and enjoy its spin-off, The Good Fight, but you will need plastic. Produced by Michelle and Robert King (who created the original series) and Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams), the new legal drama is the inaugural offering of CBS All Access. It\u2019s a $5.99-a-month streaming service programmed with back catalog oldies and cable TV adultness that finally answers the question: \u201cWhat would The Good Wife have been like with f-bombs and naked butts and no Julianna Margulies?\u201d The summary judgment: Pretty good! (You can decide for yourself \u2013 for free \u2014 on Sunday night, when CBS gives the show a primetime preview at 8 p.m. ET)\n\nWith Alicia Florrick out of the picture, Diane Lockhart takes center stage here, played once again by Emmy-winner Christine Baranski in her typically splendid fashion. We find the proud lawyer prepping for retirement \u2014 a grand home in Provence \u2014 when she loses everything in an investment scam allegedly hatched by friends and clients Henry and Lenore Rindell (Paul Guilfoyle, Bernadette Peters). Muscled out by her fellow sharks at (deep breath) Lockhart, Decker, Gussman, Lee, Lyman, Gilbert-Lurie, Kagan, Tannenbaum & Associates, Diane finds new employment \u2014 and new moral focus \u2014 working as a junior partner at another Chicago firm, mostly black, run by the charismatic, progressive, pragmatic Adrian Boseman (a nimble, energized Delroy Lindo, relishing a juicy part). An area of specialty: representing victims of police brutality \u2014 provided that the firm\u2019s litigation financiers, a pair of white guy data crunchers, can calculate big paydays with their complex spreadsheet algorithms.\n\nLockhart\u2019s struggle could resonate in a society where mid-life or even late-life career reboots and delayed retirements have become common. But she isn\u2019t the only one in The Good Fight suddenly needing or chasing a new start. Diane brings her godchild and the Rindell\u2019s attorney daughter, Maia (Rose Leslie), an eager newbie whose family name goes from asset to albatross overnight, costing her a job at Lockhart, Decker, Blah Blah Blah. Boseman also employs Alicia\u2019s former partner, Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo). What broke them up? Mystery. Both characters are their own person, but they also fill the Alicia-shaped space in the Kings\u2019 template: Maia gives Diane someone to mentor; Lucca gives Diane a refining foil, calling her out of denials and self-deceptions and goosing her conscience. \u201cDiane, when did you get so cynical?\u201d she asks early in the premiere, before Diane\u2019s fall. \u201cYou should come to this side of the table.\u201d\n\nPatrick Harbron/CBS\n\nThere\u2019s something knowing about the line, at least to fans of The Good Wife. The \u201ceducation of Alicia Florrick\u201d proved to be a seven-season curdle into something similar to her slippery, philandering politico husband, Peter (Chris Noth, also absent), a self-serving nihilist cheating on her best self and best friends. Diane, no stranger to murkiness, ended The Good Wife by slapping Alicia across the face for shattering her (illusory) happiness by exposing the adulteries of her husband (Gary Cole). It doubled as a stinging, somewhat hypocritical punishment for Alicia\u2019s spiritual fail. In a way, The Good Fight picks up the story, but with Diane playing the role of the fallen, humbled hero. The first two episodes suggest a show that explores and interrogates the idea of redemption.\n\nThe storytelling in The Good Fight lacks some of the scope and jaunty walk-and-talk drive of The Good Wife, a consequence, perhaps, of a smaller budget. But everything else \u2014 writing, acting, vision \u2014 is smart and strong, and each episode moves briskly and offers ample entertainment. It\u2019s immediately the best legal drama in the TV-verse, much better than CBS\u2019 would-be Good Wife-replacement, Doubt. What captures your imagination is the resonant premise of women trying to pick themselves \u2014 and each other \u2014 up again after gutting falls. The premiere opens with a shot of Diane looking demoralized as she watches President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration; it closes with her bucking up a crestfallen Maia with the line, \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201d I\u2019m with her. You\u2019ll want to be, too. Make the investment: The Good Fight is premium pop for our \u201cShe Persists\u201d moment. B+"

(You can decide for yourself \u2013 for free \u2014 on Sunday night, when CBS gives the show a primetime preview at 8 p.m. ET)\n\nWith Alicia Florrick out of the picture, Diane Lockhart takes center stage here, played once again by Emmy-winner Christine Baranski in her typically splendid fashion. We find the proud lawyer prepping for retirement \u2014 a grand home in Provence \u2014 when she loses everything in an investment scam allegedly hatched by friends and clients Henry and Lenore Rindell (Paul Guilfoyle, Bernadette Peters). Muscled out by her fellow sharks at (deep breath) Lockhart, Decker, Gussman, Lee, Lyman, Gilbert-Lurie, Kagan, Tannenbaum & Associates, Diane finds new employment \u2014 and new moral focus \u2014 working as a junior partner at another Chicago firm, mostly black, run by the charismatic, progressive, pragmatic Adrian Boseman (a nimble, energized Delroy Lindo, relishing a juicy part). An area of specialty: representing victims of police brutality \u2014 provided that the firm\u2019s litigation financiers, a pair of white guy data crunchers, can calculate big paydays with their complex spreadsheet algorithms.\n\nLockhart\u2019s struggle could resonate in a society where mid-life or even late-life career reboots and delayed retirements have become common. But she isn\u2019t the only one in The Good Fight suddenly needing or chasing a new start. Diane brings her godchild and the Rindell\u2019s attorney daughter, Maia (Rose Leslie), an eager newbie whose family name goes from asset to albatross overnight, costing her a job at Lockhart, Decker, Blah Blah Blah. Boseman also employs Alicia\u2019s former partner, Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo). What broke them up? Mystery. Both characters are their own person, but they also fill the Alicia-shaped space in the Kings\u2019 template: Maia gives Diane someone to mentor; Lucca gives Diane a refining foil, calling her out of denials and self-deceptions and goosing her conscience. \u201cDiane, when did you get so cynical?\u201d she asks early in the premiere, before Diane\u2019s fall. \u201cYou should come to this side of the table.\u201d\n\nPatrick Harbron/CBS\n\nThere\u2019s something knowing about the line, at least to fans of The Good Wife. The \u201ceducation of Alicia Florrick\u201d proved to be a seven-season curdle into something similar to her slippery, philandering politico husband, Peter (Chris Noth, also absent), a self-serving nihilist cheating on her best self and best friends. Diane, no stranger to murkiness, ended The Good Wife by slapping Alicia across the face for shattering her (illusory) happiness by exposing the adulteries of her husband (Gary Cole). It doubled as a stinging, somewhat hypocritical punishment for Alicia\u2019s spiritual fail. In a way, The Good Fight picks up the story, but with Diane playing the role of the fallen, humbled hero. The first two episodes suggest a show that explores and interrogates the idea of redemption.\n\nThe storytelling in The Good Fight lacks some of the scope and jaunty walk-and-talk drive of The Good Wife, a consequence, perhaps, of a smaller budget. But everything else \u2014 writing, acting, vision \u2014 is smart and strong, and each episode moves briskly and offers ample entertainment. It\u2019s immediately the best legal drama in the TV-verse, much better than CBS\u2019 would-be Good Wife-replacement, Doubt. What captures your imagination is the resonant premise of women trying to pick themselves \u2014 and each other \u2014 up again after gutting falls. The premiere opens with a shot of Diane looking demoralized as she watches President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration; it closes with her bucking up a crestfallen Maia with the line, \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201d I\u2019m with her. You\u2019ll want to be, too. Make the investment: The Good Fight is premium pop for our \u201cShe Persists\u201d moment. B+"
