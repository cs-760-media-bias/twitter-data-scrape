    "text": "Now that Donald Trump\u2019s newly handpicked Attorney General William Barr has falsely spun the still-secret Robert Mueller report in pro-Trump fashion, and a number of major news outlets have played along by falsely reporting Barr\u2019s words as if they were Mueller\u2019s words, Donald Trump has decided that he\u2019s been fully exonerated. More to the point, he clearly feels emboldened \u2013 and he\u2019s moving in a dangerously ugly direction at rapid speed.\n\nIn the day and a half since Donald Trump falsely announced that he\u2019s been exonerated, his Department of Justice has suddenly announced that it\u2019ll go into court to try to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Trump\u2019s Pentagon has suddenly announced that it\u2019s found $1 billion for Trump to begin building his border wall. Trump\u2019s campaign has given TV news networks a list of people who are supposed to be banned from the air. His flunky Lindsey Graham just announced that he\u2019ll seek a new Special Counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton. And Trump tweeted last night about his desire to have President Obama investigated for some gibberish or other.\n\nMany or even most of these moves will either fall flat of their own accord, be defeated in court, or end up backfiring. But this is where Donald Trump\u2019s head is at now. He\u2019s been falsely, temporarily given a reprieve. Instead of using this window of opportunity to try to make something of his failed presidency, he\u2019s decided to use it to pander to his base and seek petty revenge on those who have dared to expose his corruption. It\u2019s as if Trump has decided to try to prove to mainstream Americans that he\u2019s every bit as awful as they\u2019ve always believed.\n\nWhat\u2019s not clear is if Donald Trump truly thinks that William Barr\u2019s cartoonish stunt has actually gotten him off the hook for his endless list of criminal scandals, or if Trump understands that Mueller\u2019s report will surface and destroy him eventually. If it\u2019s the latter, Trump may be trying to finish off America with the finite window of time he has left. House Democrats will have their hands on the Mueller report before much longer, because they\u2019ve never had a larger priority. These next weeks may be among the most important \u2013 and perilous \u2013 in American history."

This is being widely spun by pundits as some kind of defeat, because Mueller isn\u2019t (directly) indicting anyone else. But in actuality, Mueller just pulled off a victory in plain sight and no one noticed.\n\nFor the past year we\u2019ve been hearing from these same pundits about how Donald Trump was going to find a way to fire Robert Mueller before he could complete his work and file his report. Guess what? That didn\u2019t happen. Instead, Mueller managed to make it all the way to the finish line. He got to finish the job and file his report, after so much hype about how he would never get to this point.\n\nNow these same pundits are spinning a doomsday tale about how the Attorney General is going to run it through a shredder and then everyone is just going to give up and move on. But that\u2019s not remotely realistic at this point. The public has an overwhelming appetite to see the report, and House Democrats have a number of ways to force it to become public if the AG does try to play any games.\n\nRobert Mueller completed his work, and now we\u2019re all about to at least get to see the bullet points of it. Then we\u2019ll find out what the various U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices that have been working with Mueller have up their sleeves as far as corresponding indictments. But the big story tonight is that Mueller made it to the finish line \u2013 which so many of the pundits said would never happen."

As Mueller has picked off more of Trump\u2019s underlings and come closer to completing his report, Trump has ramped up his attacks on Mueller. Today, Mueller finally filed his report, bringing his probe to completion. So what does Trump have to say about it?\n\nAs of right now, roughly six hours after the news broke that Robert Mueller had submitted his report, Donald Trump has said nothing at all. This is more than a bit odd, considering that Trump usually starts rage-tweeting whenever he thinks things are going poorly for him, and he usually starts gloat-tweeting whenever he thinks things are going well for him. So how could he possibly be silent on tonight of all nights?\n\nIf anything, Trump has become more loose lipped in the days leading up to this report. He\u2019s attacked John McCain in offensive fashion nearly every time he\u2019s appeared in public this week. He posted fifty tweets and retweets last weekend, most of them frantic or deranged. Trump was clearly going bonkers about the prospect of this report landing. Now it\u2019s happened, and he\u2019s going silent.\n\nDoes this mean Donald Trump has completely snapped now that the report has been filed? If so, why isn\u2019t he exploding with rage on Twitter? Does this mean Trump mistakenly thinks he\u2019s off the hook, simply because no one showed up at Mar-a-Lago with handcuffs tonight? If so, why isn\u2019t he gloating? We\u2019re inclined to interpret his silence as a sign that he simply has no idea what to make of the filing of this report. Maybe he\u2019ll react in the morning. We\u2019ll see. But his silence tonight is\u2026 unusual."

To that end, SDNY just made a major new prosecutorial hire.\n\nGeoffrey Berman is the current U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, but he recused himself from all Trump-related investigations from day one, due to his past ties to Trump. That left the number two person at SDNY, Robert Khuzami, in charge of the criminal case against Michael Cohen. We would have expected Khuzami to also lead the way on any Trump-related SDNY indictments that could soon be unsealed \u2013 except that Khuzami is retiring, and he\u2019s been replaced by a big name.\n\nThe new #2 at SDNY is Audrey Strauss, who has a storied career. Back in the day she defeated Donald Trump\u2019s mentor Roy Cohn in taking down a mafia leader. Since that time her career has been focused on aggressive white collar criminal enforcement.\n\nKeep in mind that Audrey Strauss is going to have authority over any Trump related criminal prosecutions by the SDNY going forward \u2013 and her specialty consists of taking down crime families and white collar criminals. Read into that whatever you like. We\u2019ll all find out SDNY\u2019s next moves soon enough."

      "Bill Palmer"
    ],
    "text": "Special Counsel Robert Mueller has filed his Trump-Russia report this evening, and it\u2019s led to a whole lot of questions and very few answers. One of the most curious questions is why Mueller chose to file his report on a Friday evening. There may be a highly logical reason for this, and it has to do with what\u2019s about to happen over the next few days.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what we know for sure. Robert Mueller spent the better part of two years working on this report, and he didn\u2019t appear to be up against any arbitrary deadline. To that end, \u201cMarch 22nd\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like anyone\u2019s idea of a deadline. So Mueller chose this particular Friday evening for a reason. Attorney General William Barr then announced that he didn\u2019t block any of Mueller\u2019s requests, and that he\u2019ll try to get the report to Congress as soon as this weekend.\n\nSo Mueller chose to submit his report on a Friday, and Barr is planning to let the public see it over the weekend (he knows that when he gives it to Congress, it\u2019ll immediately get publicly leaked whether it\u2019s officially made public or not). And Barr doesn\u2019t appear to be trying to play any games, because if he were lying about having granted all of Mueller\u2019s requests, he\u2019d be committing a crime by telling that lie, and he\u2019d get caught.\n\nThis leaves us with the question of why Mueller and Barr are setting things up so that the public finds out what\u2019s in Mueller\u2019s report over the weekend. We keep hearing that Mueller isn\u2019t indicting anyone else, but everyone from Congressman Adam Schiff to Senator Richard Blumenthal has pointed out this evening that more indictments are likely coming from the likes of SDNY. Schiff took things further during his MSNBC appearance, stating that he expects the report to spell out who \u201cshould be indicted.\u201d Keep in mind that as Chairman of the House Intel Committee, Schiff knows things about this probe that we don\u2019t.\n\nIf the Mueller report is indeed going to explain to the public why additional people should be indicted, it would certainly need to come out before those indictments can happen. In such case submitting the report on Friday, and making it public over the weekend, would ostensibly be in order to lay the groundwork for indictments that are being unsealed next week.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been watching cable news this evening, you\u2019re probably scratching your head at this, because you\u2019ve heard over and over again that no one else is going to be indicted. But what\u2019s actually been reported is that Robert Mueller isn\u2019t going to indict any more people. That tells us nothing about any criminal cases that Mueller has handed off to U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices, which he\u2019s done with the cases against Michael Cohen and others."

Even as we wait for the other shoe to drop, Barr\u2019s announcement about the receipt of the report has given away something big about how Mueller\u2019s investigation has played out in the weeks since Barr took office.\n\nBy rule, William Barr has to publicly reveal any instances in which Robert Mueller and/or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein asked him to approve something but he refused. In his announcement letter, Barr says that there were no such instances. If Barr were lying about this, he\u2019d quickly get exposed, and he\u2019d get in legal trouble for it. So it\u2019s safe to assume that he\u2019s telling the truth. This is a big deal.\n\nThis means that Mueller got his way every single time he asked Barr to approve something. If Mueller asked for approval to refer criminal cases against Trump and/or his kids to places like SDNY for indictment and prosecution, then he got it. We don\u2019t know what Mueller asked for, but we do know that he has a long and consistent history of being a particularly aggressive prosecutor. Now we know that he got his way with Barr.\n\nWe can\u2019t stress enough that tonight\u2019s prevailing media narrative about no one else getting indicted is misleading at best, and borders on intentional false reporting. People ranging from Chairman Adam Schiff to Senator Richard Blumenthal have called in to MSNBC to spell out that more indictments are likely coming from places like SDNY, but MSNBC just keeps sticking with its false narrative about no one else in Trump world getting indicted. We\u2019re almost at a loss for words at how recklessly MSNBC is botching the story tonight."

    "text": "Already under investigation for numerous alleged crimes, \u201cPresident\u201d Donald Trump either doesn\u2019t fully grasp the gravity of these investigations or he figures he has nothing to lose. As reported by Forbes, Trump is once again making questionable use of campaign donations.\n\nForbes analyzed Trump\u2019s campaign filings and found that $1.3 million of these funds have been spent on rent, food, lodging and \u201cother expenses\u201d at Trump properties. If these expenses are not legitimate, it means Trump has managed to convert $1.3 million into his own pocket. On its face, this conversion could be lawful. The Federal Election Commission allows campaigns to pay rent for facilities utilized for campaign activities, as well as travel and meals, but Forbes was apparently suspicious \u2014 especially because all funds have been expended at Trump properties \u2014 and started their own research project.\n\nOne expenditure of $54,000 was paid to Trump Plaza, LLC, which controls two brownstone buildings in New York. Forbes staked out the property to try to determine whether Trump\u2019s campaign in fact occupied space in one or both of the buildings, to no avail. They went inside and spoke to the person working the front desk, who told them: \u201cIf there was any kind of office rented out for campaigning or whatever, I would know about it.\u201d Let\u2019s take this to mean there is not a campaign office in either brownstone.\n\nIn addition to the $54,000 paid for \u201crent\u201d on the brownstones, $60,000 has gone to Trump Restaurants LLC. How much food have these people eaten? This organization runs several Trump-branded restaurants, all of which are contained in buildings it manages. Forbes reporters gained access to the building and found what they believe to be the recipient of these funds: A kiosk selling t-shirts, hats, and miscellaneous campaign memorabilia. Failing to get responses to a list of questions they sent to the Trump Organization regarding the square footage of the kiosk, Forbes had a reporter \u201cwalk\u201d the kiosk to estimate its size: approximately 60 square feet. Forbes determined that Trump\u2019s campaign is paying $600 per square foot (annually) or $3,000 per month for a kiosk. Comparing the cost of this kiosk to Gucci\u2019s space on Fifth Avenue, Forbes believes something is amiss.\n\nThere are limits to what campaigns can pay for rent. That rent must be \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cmarket rate.\u201d Obviously, this is not fair and is certainly not the \u201cmarket rate\u201d if Gucci is paying $160 less per square foot. Let\u2019s be real here: We learned from Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony that Donald Trump exaggerates his net worth to secure loans to which he is not entitled. Multiple news outlets have reported Trump billed the Secret Service for golf cart rentals at his properties. Trump has engaged in so many questionable activities that have earned money for him, it would take several pages to list them all, but you get the idea: sure, these funds are being legitimately used."

So what happens when even large chunks of Fox News decide to begin distancing themselves from Trump\u2019s worsening scandals and increasingly offensive rhetoric?\n\nDonald Trump sat down for an interview on Friday with Maria Bartiromo from Fox Business Network, a spinoff of Fox News. Bartiromo has been generally pro-Trump in her coverage, so Trump was probably expecting a softball interview. But Bartiromo apparently felt she needed to cover her bases when it came to Trump\u2019s recent escalating personal attacks on the late Republican Senator John McCain. Things quickly went off the rails.\n\nMaria Bartiromo asked Donald Trump, \u201cJohn McCain is dead, why are you doing this?\u201d This sent Trump into yet another tirade about McCain. Then he blamed the media for his own attacks on McCain, insisting that he\u2019s merely been answering the media\u2019s questions about McCain (in most instances this isn\u2019t true). Then Trump unleashed this tirade at Bartiromo: \u201cI could say I have no comment but that\u2019s not me. But you shouldn\u2019t have brought it up. Actually, I thought you weren\u2019t supposed to bring it up but that\u2019s OK. Fake news, every once and a while.\u201d Wait, what?\n\nFor starters, Donald Trump is now accusing one of his own Fox allies of being \u201cfake news,\u201d and he\u2019s doing it to her face, no less. As his scandals grow worse for him, Trump is increasingly taking out his frustrations on his personal allies, and on members of his own party. Also, Trump seemed to be under the impression that Bartiromo had agreed not to ask him about McCain, but she says that\u2019s not the case. Did Trump\u2019s own handlers mislead him in order to get him to do this interview, or is he merely hallucinating?"

What\u2019s this based on? Literally nothing, of course. Meanwhile, the people in position to know better are expecting Mueller\u2019s report to set off additional indictments.\n\nFirst, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff appeared on MSNBC and stated that he thinks it\u2019s \u201clikely\u201d there are more indictments coming; they\u2019ll just come from the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices that Mueller handed off the cases to. But this didn\u2019t seem to fit with the doomsday narrative, so MSNBC kept pushing the notion that it\u2019s all over, and everyone who hasn\u2019t yet been arrested is somehow magically off the hook. That\u2019s when Richard Blumenthal stepped to the plate.\n\nRichard Blumenthal, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, appeared on MSNBC and stated that there is a \u201chigh likelihood that there are indictments in this president\u2019s future.\u201d He explained that these indictments are likely to come from SDNY and/or other federal prosecutors. But again, this didn\u2019t fit the prevailing MSNBC narrative, so the host cut off Blumenthal, and began asking leading questions which were aimed at painting the picture that no more indictments are coming.\n\nWe don\u2019t know why the TV pundits are so eager tonight to push the notion that they somehow know that no one else will be indicted, beyond the obvious fact that scaring viewers is a good way to paralyze them into staying tuned in. But back in the real world, people who have been involved with the overall Trump-Russia investigation, such as Adam Schiff and Richard Blumenthal, are very loudly saying that they\u2019re expecting more indictments. Blumenthal even thinks Trump is going to be indicted."

Now it turns out Adam Schiff agrees with us.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff appeared on MSNBC during the 6pm hour today, and he said this: \u201cWhat Mueller is reporting, as best we can tell, are his conclusions on the criminal side of the house, who should be indicted and who shouldn\u2019t be indicted, and why he reached those conclusions.\u201d Then Schiff added that he thinks it\u2019s \u201centirely possible if not likely that there will be other indictments\u201d forthcoming.\n\nIt\u2019s not all that difficult to figure out how and why this would be the case. For example, Robert Mueller investigated Michael Cohen and determined that while Cohen didn\u2019t commit crimes central to the Trump-Russia election scandal, he did commit other Trump-related crimes, so he referred the case to the SDNY, which had jurisdiction over those crimes. Sure enough, SDNY brought a case against Cohen, and he\u2019s going to prison. Does anyone really believe that Cohen is the only person in Trump\u2019s orbit who fit this particular pattern?\n\nSo yeah, Adam Schiff is right to expect that there are additional indictments likely coming. The question is how many Trump-related sealed indictments are in play that we don\u2019t know about. It\u2019s also notable that Schiff expects the report to spell out who \u201cshould be indicted.\u201d This would mean that Mueller\u2019s report has spelled out why these other indictments are about to be carried out."

    "text": "In case you were curiously perusing the list of people and entities who recently received document requests from the House Judiciary Committee, you may have come across the name of Rinat Akhmetshin, and you may have wondered how he fits into the picture of Donald Trump\u2019s far-flung scandals that are currently under investigation.\n\nRinat Akhmetshin is a Russian-American lobbyist and former Soviet counterintelligence officer. He\u2019s been accused of having ongoing ties to Russian intelligence, though he denies it. Akhmetshin is also a known associate of Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who had baited Don Junior into accepting the mysterious Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, with an offer of providing dirt on Hillary Clinton. According to Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s initial public statement about the meeting, it was about Russian adoptions.\n\nDon Junior\u2019s statement was not factually untrue, it was just far from complete. The meeting indeed turned out to be about Russian adoptions. It was also about lifting or weakening the sanctions high-level Russians had been under since the passing of the Magnitsky Act in 2012, which is in fact one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s top priority foreign policy goals. The issues of U.S. sanctions and Russian adoptions are inextricably linked.\n\nHere is how: The Magnitsky Act froze the assets of Russians implicated in human rights abuses and denied them visas to enter the United States. It was named after Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died under suspicious circumstances in a Russian prison after uncovering a tax fraud scheme that involved high-ranking Russian officials. In a retaliatory move, Vladimir Putin stopped allowing American citizens to adopt Russian children.\n\nJust as an aside: This was an exceptionally cruel and callous move on Putin\u2019s part, both with regard to American couples hoping to adopt and \u2013 perhaps even more so \u2013 with regard to the children who qualified for foreign adoption. A considerable number of the children who were adopted by Americans prior to the Magnitsky Act were orphans who had medical conditions and needed care that they were not really receiving in the orphanages, but that their new American parents were happy to provide. When Putin decided to use them as pawns to exert political pressure on the United States, these children were doomed to remain in Russian orphanages.\n\nIt is not clear whether at the time of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting, Don Junior was aware of the fact that \u201cRussian adoptions\u201d was essentially code for sanction relief. But the fact is that he \u2013 the son of presidential hopeful Donald Trump \u2013 was being lobbied by surrogates of the Russian government with a view to the sanctions against Russian oligarchs being weakened or lifted in the event that the New York real estate mogul should become the next American president.\n\nAccording to Trump Jr., \u201cthere was no follow up\u201d but this statement doesn\u2019t seem to be true. The question of Russian adoptions apparently did come up again, this time in an unofficial conversation that was directly between President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany in July 2017 with only a Russian translator present. \u201cActually, it was very interesting,\u201d Trump himself said when asked about the conversation. \u201cWe talked about adoption.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of any reliable documentation, it will be difficult to determine what exactly was said during this unofficial conversation. But it is very likely that we will hear more about adoptions and the question of sanction relief as the investigation of Donald Trump\u2019s Russian ties continues to take its course."

    "text": "Special Counsel Robert Mueller has filed his Trump-Russia report this evening, and it\u2019s led to a whole lot of questions and very few answers. One of the most curious questions is why Mueller chose to file his report on a Friday evening. There may be a highly logical reason for this, and it has to do with what\u2019s about to happen over the next few days.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what we know for sure. Robert Mueller spent the better part of two years working on this report, and he didn\u2019t appear to be up against any arbitrary deadline. To that end, \u201cMarch 22nd\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like anyone\u2019s idea of a deadline. So Mueller chose this particular Friday evening for a reason. Attorney General William Barr then announced that he didn\u2019t block any of Mueller\u2019s requests, and that he\u2019ll try to get the report to Congress as soon as this weekend.\n\nSo Mueller chose to submit his report on a Friday, and Barr is planning to let the public see it over the weekend (he knows that when he gives it to Congress, it\u2019ll immediately get publicly leaked whether it\u2019s officially made public or not). And Barr doesn\u2019t appear to be trying to play any games, because if he were lying about having granted all of Mueller\u2019s requests, he\u2019d be committing a crime by telling that lie, and he\u2019d get caught.\n\nThis leaves us with the question of why Mueller and Barr are setting things up so that the public finds out what\u2019s in Mueller\u2019s report over the weekend. We keep hearing that Mueller isn\u2019t indicting anyone else, but everyone from Congressman Adam Schiff to Senator Richard Blumenthal has pointed out this evening that more indictments are likely coming from the likes of SDNY. Schiff took things further during his MSNBC appearance, stating that he expects the report to spell out who \u201cshould be indicted.\u201d Keep in mind that as Chairman of the House Intel Committee, Schiff knows things about this probe that we don\u2019t.\n\nIf the Mueller report is indeed going to explain to the public why additional people should be indicted, it would certainly need to come out before those indictments can happen. In such case submitting the report on Friday, and making it public over the weekend, would ostensibly be in order to lay the groundwork for indictments that are being unsealed next week.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been watching cable news this evening, you\u2019re probably scratching your head at this, because you\u2019ve heard over and over again that no one else is going to be indicted. But what\u2019s actually been reported is that Robert Mueller isn\u2019t going to indict any more people. That tells us nothing about any criminal cases that Mueller has handed off to U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices, which he\u2019s done with the cases against Michael Cohen and others."

    "text": "Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report is now in the hands of Attorney General William Barr. Even as we wait for the other shoe to drop, Barr\u2019s announcement about the receipt of the report has given away something big about how Mueller\u2019s investigation has played out in the weeks since Barr took office.\n\nBy rule, William Barr has to publicly reveal any instances in which Robert Mueller and/or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein asked him to approve something but he refused. In his announcement letter, Barr says that there were no such instances. If Barr were lying about this, he\u2019d quickly get exposed, and he\u2019d get in legal trouble for it. So it\u2019s safe to assume that he\u2019s telling the truth. This is a big deal.\n\nThis means that Mueller got his way every single time he asked Barr to approve something. If Mueller asked for approval to refer criminal cases against Trump and/or his kids to places like SDNY for indictment and prosecution, then he got it. We don\u2019t know what Mueller asked for, but we do know that he has a long and consistent history of being a particularly aggressive prosecutor. Now we know that he got his way with Barr.\n\nWe can\u2019t stress enough that tonight\u2019s prevailing media narrative about no one else getting indicted is misleading at best, and borders on intentional false reporting. People ranging from Chairman Adam Schiff to Senator Richard Blumenthal have called in to MSNBC to spell out that more indictments are likely coming from places like SDNY, but MSNBC just keeps sticking with its false narrative about no one else in Trump world getting indicted. We\u2019re almost at a loss for words at how recklessly MSNBC is botching the story tonight."

What\u2019s this based on? Literally nothing, of course. Meanwhile, the people in position to know better are expecting Mueller\u2019s report to set off additional indictments.\n\nFirst, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff appeared on MSNBC and stated that he thinks it\u2019s \u201clikely\u201d there are more indictments coming; they\u2019ll just come from the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices that Mueller handed off the cases to. But this didn\u2019t seem to fit with the doomsday narrative, so MSNBC kept pushing the notion that it\u2019s all over, and everyone who hasn\u2019t yet been arrested is somehow magically off the hook. That\u2019s when Richard Blumenthal stepped to the plate.\n\nRichard Blumenthal, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, appeared on MSNBC and stated that there is a \u201chigh likelihood that there are indictments in this president\u2019s future.\u201d He explained that these indictments are likely to come from SDNY and/or other federal prosecutors. But again, this didn\u2019t fit the prevailing MSNBC narrative, so the host cut off Blumenthal, and began asking leading questions which were aimed at painting the picture that no more indictments are coming.\n\nWe don\u2019t know why the TV pundits are so eager tonight to push the notion that they somehow know that no one else will be indicted, beyond the obvious fact that scaring viewers is a good way to paralyze them into staying tuned in. But back in the real world, people who have been involved with the overall Trump-Russia investigation, such as Adam Schiff and Richard Blumenthal, are very loudly saying that they\u2019re expecting more indictments. Blumenthal even thinks Trump is going to be indicted."

Although no details of any kind have been revealed about the nature of the report, numerous pundits are painting this as the \u201cend\u201d of Mueller\u2019s work. We\u2019re here to tell you that Mueller didn\u2019t come out of retirement and spend two years working on this case just so he could file a book report and go home.\n\nFor that matter, Robert Mueller didn\u2019t come out of retirement just to take down the likes of Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. Mueller watched Donald Trump commit felony obstruction of justice by firing FBI Director James Comey to try to shut down this investigation. When Mueller took over the probe, it became about more than just the Trump-Russia scandal; it became about Donald Trump\u2019s crimes.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Robert Mueller\u2019s gameplan is for bringing Donald Trump to justice, but we know there is one, or Mueller wouldn\u2019t have taken the job. Mueller could be planning anything from having the SDNY indict Trump any minute now, to spelling out in his report that Trump should be indicted.\n\nAs this plays out in the coming hours and days, keep this in mind: no matter how many times the TV pundits insist that no new indictments have accompanied Robert Mueller\u2019s report, they don\u2019t know this. They don\u2019t know what indictments may or may not be under seal, or what might be unsealed and when. Until actual news breaks, the pundits are largely just going to spin the current lack of information into a worst case scenario, because that\u2019s what they think will scare you into staying tuned in.\n\nOne even bigger thing to keep in mind: although Robert Mueller\u2019s mandate was to investigate the Trump-Russia election scandal, whenever he\u2019s uncovered alleged crimes that fall outside that mandate, he\u2019s handed them off to U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices for prosecution. For instance, Michael Cohen is headed to prison for crimes that have basically nothing to do with Trump-Russia. So you can fully expect that Mueller has referred for prosecution all the alleged crimes he\u2019s uncovered on the part of everyone in Donald Trump\u2019s orbit.

This of course raises more questions than answers, but suffice it to say that things are about to get very real.\n\nAs of this moment, there are no real details available about what Robert Mueller\u2019s report says, or what it even covers. Some major news outlets are characterizing the submission of this report as the \u201cend\u201d of Mueller\u2019s investigation, but we\u2019re not sure we buy that notion, considering that just a few hours ago evidence surfaced that Mueller\u2019s grand jury is still ongoing in at least one criminal case. Regardless, all heck is about to break loose in rapid fashion. Here\u2019s what you can expect.\n\nWilliam Barr now has to decide how much of Robert Mueller\u2019s report to give to Congress. Keep in mind that whatever Barr gives to Congress, it\u2019ll almost surely get promptly leaked to the public. Barr knows this, so he could decide to make a simultaneous public release. In any case, if the Democrats in Congress believe that Barr\u2019s version of the Mueller report is incomplete or inaccurate, they\u2019ll quickly take steps to get their hands on the whole thing.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what happens on the indictment front.

    "text": "Special Counsel Robert Mueller has filed a report about his investigation with the Attorney General. Although no details of any kind have been revealed about the nature of the report, numerous pundits are painting this as the \u201cend\u201d of Mueller\u2019s work. We\u2019re here to tell you that Mueller didn\u2019t come out of retirement and spend two years working on this case just so he could file a book report and go home.\n\nFor that matter, Robert Mueller didn\u2019t come out of retirement just to take down the likes of Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. Mueller watched Donald Trump commit felony obstruction of justice by firing FBI Director James Comey to try to shut down this investigation. When Mueller took over the probe, it became about more than just the Trump-Russia scandal; it became about Donald Trump\u2019s crimes.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Robert Mueller\u2019s gameplan is for bringing Donald Trump to justice, but we know there is one, or Mueller wouldn\u2019t have taken the job. Mueller could be planning anything from having the SDNY indict Trump any minute now, to spelling out in his report that Trump should be indicted.\n\nAs this plays out in the coming hours and days, keep this in mind: no matter how many times the TV pundits insist that no new indictments have accompanied Robert Mueller\u2019s report, they don\u2019t know this. They don\u2019t know what indictments may or may not be under seal, or what might be unsealed and when. Until actual news breaks, the pundits are largely just going to spin the current lack of information into a worst case scenario, because that\u2019s what they think will scare you into staying tuned in.\n\nOne even bigger thing to keep in mind: although Robert Mueller\u2019s mandate was to investigate the Trump-Russia election scandal, whenever he\u2019s uncovered alleged crimes that fall outside that mandate, he\u2019s handed them off to U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices for prosecution. For instance, Michael Cohen is headed to prison for crimes that have basically nothing to do with Trump-Russia. So you can fully expect that Mueller has referred for prosecution all the alleged crimes he\u2019s uncovered on the part of everyone in Donald Trump\u2019s orbit. This isn\u2019t over; today is the starting point."

    "text": "Update 5:15pm eastern time: Robert Mueller has now submitted a report to the Attorney General. This does not mean that his investigation is over. Even if he is finished, his ongoing criminal cases will be handed over to permanent federal prosecutors such as the SDNY. As we explain below, Mueller appears to still have a grand jury going. Original article follows below\u2026\n\nSince yesterday we\u2019ve been seeing major media reports that Special Counsel Robert Mueller won\u2019t be bringing any new indictments, and that he could be \u201cwrapping up\u201d his investigation as soon as today. Earlier today the media acknowledged that its source for the \u201cno new indictments\u201d story is the uber-unreliable Rudy Giuliani, which means there is no source, and therefore there is no story. Now evidence has surfaced this afternoon that Mueller\u2019s grand jury is still ongoing.\n\nRobert Mueller hauled a large number of Stone associates in front of the grand jury, who then turned around and identified themselves to the media. Their various connections to Stone revealed that Mueller was investigating a wide swath of Stone\u2019s life which went far beyond the Trump-Russia scandal and the 2016 election. But when Stone was arrested, it was on a very limited seven-count indictment. So what happened to the rest of the case that Mueller was building against Stone?\n\nStone associate Andrew Miller famously refused to testify, and tried a number of legal challenges against Mueller. Days after Stone\u2019s arrest, CNN reported that Mueller still wanted Miller to testify to the grand jury about Stone. This suggested that Mueller was planning to try to bring superseding indictments against Stone. This afternoon, Miller told the Atlantic that Mueller is still trying to get him to testify before the grand jury.\n\nThe key distinction here is grand jury as opposed to trial jury. Robert Mueller isn\u2019t trying to get Miller to testify at Roger Stone\u2019s eventual trial on the existing charges. Instead, he\u2019s pushing Miller to testify before a grand jury \u2013 and keep in mind that a grand jury\u2019s only purpose is to bring indictments. So this means that Mueller\u2019s grand jury is still a thing, and that Mueller intends to put more witnesses in front of it, and that Mueller intends to bring additional indictments.\n\nThis brings us back to Rudy Giuliani\u2019s new claim that Robert Mueller doesn\u2019t intend to bring any more indictments. This is obviously incorrect. Rudy could theoretically come back and try to argue that he\u2019s only referring to indictments against new people, not new indictments against people who have already been indicted. But Rudy lies so often, there\u2019s no reason to believe him on this anyway. And if Mueller isn\u2019t indicting any new people, it would be because he\u2019s handing off any remaining criminal cases to SDNY or other federal prosecutors, as he\u2019s already done with Michael Cohen and others. In any case, we now we know that as of right now, Mueller isn\u2019t done."

As reported by Forbes, Trump is once again making questionable use of campaign donations.\n\nForbes analyzed Trump\u2019s campaign filings and found that $1.3 million of these funds have been spent on rent, food, lodging and \u201cother expenses\u201d at Trump properties. If these expenses are not legitimate, it means Trump has managed to convert $1.3 million into his own pocket. On its face, this conversion could be lawful. The Federal Election Commission allows campaigns to pay rent for facilities utilized for campaign activities, as well as travel and meals, but Forbes was apparently suspicious \u2014 especially because all funds have been expended at Trump properties \u2014 and started their own research project.\n\nOne expenditure of $54,000 was paid to Trump Plaza, LLC, which controls two brownstone buildings in New York. Forbes staked out the property to try to determine whether Trump\u2019s campaign in fact occupied space in one or both of the buildings, to no avail. They went inside and spoke to the person working the front desk, who told them: \u201cIf there was any kind of office rented out for campaigning or whatever, I would know about it.\u201d Let\u2019s take this to mean there is not a campaign office in either brownstone.\n\nIn addition to the $54,000 paid for \u201crent\u201d on the brownstones, $60,000 has gone to Trump Restaurants LLC. How much food have these people eaten? This organization runs several Trump-branded restaurants, all of which are contained in buildings it manages. Forbes reporters gained access to the building and found what they believe to be the recipient of these funds: A kiosk selling t-shirts, hats, and miscellaneous campaign memorabilia. Failing to get responses to a list of questions they sent to the Trump Organization regarding the square footage of the kiosk, Forbes had a reporter \u201cwalk\u201d the kiosk to estimate its size: approximately 60 square feet. Forbes determined that Trump\u2019s campaign is paying $600 per square foot (annually) or $3,000 per month for a kiosk. Comparing the cost of this kiosk to Gucci\u2019s space on Fifth Avenue, Forbes believes something is amiss.\n\nThere are limits to what campaigns can pay for rent. That rent must be \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cmarket rate.\u201d Obviously, this is not fair and is certainly not the \u201cmarket rate\u201d if Gucci is paying $160 less per square foot. Let\u2019s be real here: We learned from Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony that Donald Trump exaggerates his net worth to secure loans to which he is not entitled. Multiple news outlets have reported Trump billed the Secret Service for golf cart rentals at his properties. Trump has engaged in so many questionable activities that have earned money for him, it would take several pages to list them all, but you get the idea: sure, these funds are being legitimately used."

He\u2019s been accused of having ongoing ties to Russian intelligence, though he denies it. Akhmetshin is also a known associate of Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who had baited Don Junior into accepting the mysterious Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, with an offer of providing dirt on Hillary Clinton. According to Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s initial public statement about the meeting, it was about Russian adoptions.\n\nDon Junior\u2019s statement was not factually untrue, it was just far from complete. The meeting indeed turned out to be about Russian adoptions. It was also about lifting or weakening the sanctions high-level Russians had been under since the passing of the Magnitsky Act in 2012, which is in fact one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s top priority foreign policy goals. The issues of U.S. sanctions and Russian adoptions are inextricably linked.\n\nHere is how: The Magnitsky Act froze the assets of Russians implicated in human rights abuses and denied them visas to enter the United States. It was named after Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died under suspicious circumstances in a Russian prison after uncovering a tax fraud scheme that involved high-ranking Russian officials. In a retaliatory move, Vladimir Putin stopped allowing American citizens to adopt Russian children.\n\nJust as an aside: This was an exceptionally cruel and callous move on Putin\u2019s part, both with regard to American couples hoping to adopt and \u2013 perhaps even more so \u2013 with regard to the children who qualified for foreign adoption. A considerable number of the children who were adopted by Americans prior to the Magnitsky Act were orphans who had medical conditions and needed care that they were not really receiving in the orphanages, but that their new American parents were happy to provide. When Putin decided to use them as pawns to exert political pressure on the United States, these children were doomed to remain in Russian orphanages.\n\nIt is not clear whether at the time of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting, Don Junior was aware of the fact that \u201cRussian adoptions\u201d was essentially code for sanction relief. But the fact is that he \u2013 the son of presidential hopeful Donald Trump \u2013 was being lobbied by surrogates of the Russian government with a view to the sanctions against Russian oligarchs being weakened or lifted in the event that the New York real estate mogul should become the next American president.\n\nAccording to Trump Jr., \u201cthere was no follow up\u201d but this statement doesn\u2019t seem to be true. The question of Russian adoptions apparently did come up again, this time in an unofficial conversation that was directly between President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany in July 2017 with only a Russian translator present. \u201cActually, it was very interesting,\u201d Trump himself said when asked about the conversation. \u201cWe talked about adoption.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of any reliable documentation, it will be difficult to determine what exactly was said during this unofficial conversation. But it is very likely that we will hear more about adoptions and the question of sanction relief as the investigation of Donald Trump\u2019s Russian ties continues to take its course."

Why did the DOJ just fly a plane to London from its U.S. base where fugitive retrieval agents are stationed? Does anyone know what\u2019s about to happen next?\n\nThe short answer is no \u2013 at least when it comes to unscrambling the precise details of what\u2019s happening right now, or predicting what\u2019s about to happen by this time tomorrow. At this point you might have a better statistical chance of accurately guessing the winner of every remaining March Madness game than accurately guessing what all will be in the Mueller report. Of course there are some anecdotal clues that point to what\u2019s about to happen in a less detailed sense.\n\nBased on his recent escalating antics and unraveling behavior, Donald Trump clearly thinks the Mueller report is going to be ugly for him, and that it\u2019s coming soon, and that he won\u2019t be able to defend himself well against it. But this could be based on anything from inside knowledge to general dread. More and more Republicans in Congress are voting against Trump on key issues, seemingly trying to insulate themselves from his downfall \u2013 but again, that doesn\u2019t mean they know anything more than we do about when and how the Mueller hammer might drop on him.\n\nRobert Mueller knows what\u2019s in his own report, but he\u2019s not going to tell us about it before he\u2019s ready to tell us about it. Mueller has had nearly two years to plan his endgame, and Donald Trump has had nearly two years to dread it.

One of the most popular yet baseless assertions has been that Mueller\u2019s report will somehow never become public. Now there\u2019s a new scary media narrative in play: Mueller\u2019s report won\u2019t even be about Donald Trump.\n\nAs absurd as this sounds, it\u2019s coming from a major news outlet, ABC News. It\u2019s claiming that \u201csources familiar with the investigation believe there are no more indictments coming from the special counsel.\u201d It\u2019s also referring back to Rod Rosenstein\u2019s earlier remark that the Mueller report won\u2019t contain disparaging information about anyone who\u2019s not being criminally charged. Put these two things together, and ABC has concluded that the report will only be about the people who have already been charged. Uh, wait a minute here.\n\nThere are two key flaws in this logic. First, we have no way of knowing whether ABC\u2019s \u201csources familiar with the investigation\u201d are actually on Robert Mueller\u2019s team. For all we know, these sources could be Trump-loyal personnel at the DOJ who are trying to help Donald Trump\u2019s case by spinning misinformation. In hindsight, these same kinds of \u201csources\u201d appear to have been behind the false narrative that Mueller\u2019s report would be done last month, and with the false narrative that Rosenstein was going to have resigned by now. Also, Mueller and his team don\u2019t leak these kinds of things. Even if they did, it\u2019s unclear why they would only \u201cbelieve\u201d there are no more indictments coming, when they\u2019re the ones who have made those decisions one way or the other.\n\nThe second flaw in ABC\u2019s logic might be the more egregious one. Even if Robert Mueller and his office aren\u2019t going to indict anyone else, this could simply mean that they\u2019re planning to have various permanent federal prosecutors handle any upcoming indictments around the same time Mueller issues his report. This isn\u2019t merely theoretical; we\u2019ve already seen Mueller hand the Michael Cohen cases and other cases off to SDNY and other U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices.\n\nThe bottom line: this seems like a whole lot of nonsense. That said, this flawed logic may unwittingly reveal something crucial. If Mueller sticks to Rosenstein\u2019s edict that the report about Donald Trump\u2019s crimes can only disparage people who are being criminally charged, wouldn\u2019t that mean that Mueller is planning to have someone criminally charge Trump around the time of this report?"

As Trump becomes more frantic, can he top all this in the weirdness department? He may have just done precisely that.\n\nThis evening Donald Trump sent out an email to his supporters with the subject line \u201cWitch Hunt Report Attached.\u201d The subject line also includes an image of a paperclip, aimed at tricking recipients into believing that a document of some kind has been attached to the email. Then the first line of the email says \u201c[SORRY THIS DOCUMENT IS BLANK].\u201d Wait, what?\n\nAfter the weird fake-out that even Trump\u2019s own base probably isn\u2019t gullible enough to fall for, the email then claims that \u201closer Democrats and their friends in the Fake News Media\u201d have been claiming that \u201cthey plan to release the report \u2018soon\u2019 but they\u2019ve been saying that for OVER 2 YEARS.\u201d This is weird, considering the report will be released by Robert Mueller and the Department of Justice, not the \u201closer Democrats\u201d or the \u201cFake News Media.\u201d\n\nOf course this entire bizarre email turns out to be an attempt at luring recipients into taking a poll about whether the \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d should end. It\u2019s all part of a Trump 2020 campaign fundraiser. The timing is interesting when you consider that Donald Trump is trying to fundraise off the premise that he\u2019s done nothing wrong, even as Forbes reported yesterday that Trump has funneled more than a million dollars of these donations into his own businesses."

Now there\u2019s a new scary media narrative in play: Mueller\u2019s report won\u2019t even be about Donald Trump.\n\nAs absurd as this sounds, it\u2019s coming from a major news outlet, ABC News. It\u2019s claiming that \u201csources familiar with the investigation believe there are no more indictments coming from the special counsel.\u201d It\u2019s also referring back to Rod Rosenstein\u2019s earlier remark that the Mueller report won\u2019t contain disparaging information about anyone who\u2019s not being criminally charged. Put these two things together, and ABC has concluded that the report will only be about the people who have already been charged. Uh, wait a minute here.\n\nThere are two key flaws in this logic. First, we have no way of knowing whether ABC\u2019s \u201csources familiar with the investigation\u201d are actually on Robert Mueller\u2019s team. For all we know, these sources could be Trump-loyal personnel at the DOJ who are trying to help Donald Trump\u2019s case by spinning misinformation. In hindsight, these same kinds of \u201csources\u201d appear to have been behind the false narrative that Mueller\u2019s report would be done last month, and with the false narrative that Rosenstein was going to have resigned by now. Also, Mueller and his team don\u2019t leak these kinds of things. Even if they did, it\u2019s unclear why they would only \u201cbelieve\u201d there are no more indictments coming, when they\u2019re the ones who have made those decisions one way or the other.\n\nThe second flaw in ABC\u2019s logic might be the more egregious one. Even if Robert Mueller and his office aren\u2019t going to indict anyone else, this could simply mean that they\u2019re planning to have various permanent federal prosecutors handle any upcoming indictments around the same time Mueller issues his report. This isn\u2019t merely theoretical; we\u2019ve already seen Mueller hand the Michael Cohen cases and other cases off to SDNY and other U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices.\n\nThe bottom line: this seems like a whole lot of nonsense. That said, this flawed logic may unwittingly reveal something crucial. If Mueller sticks to Rosenstein\u2019s edict that the report about Donald Trump\u2019s crimes can only disparage people who are being criminally charged, wouldn\u2019t that mean that Mueller is planning to have someone criminally charge Trump around the time of this report?"

But apart from Rudy\u2019s own admission last summer that the DOJ Inspector General was investigating how he knew the FBI\u2019s actions in advance during the election, we haven\u2019t had any proof that Rudy is under investigation \u2013 until now.\n\nNow that the House Judiciary Committee has finished sending its initial round of document requests, which it said were merely an effort to catch up with similar requests that have already been made by other investigators, the committee is launching into its next round. That\u2019ll include subpoenas for those who failed to comply with the first round. It\u2019ll also include some new names, including Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThis is according to the Wall Street Journal, which says that the committee is about to request documents from Rudy Giuliani and others who are alleged to have been involved in Donald Trump\u2019s plot to dangle a pardon at Michael Cohen, in an effort to keep Cohen from cooperating. We think this is significant for two reasons. First, the committee clearly isn\u2019t worried about the fact that Rudy is Trump\u2019s attorney. Nor should they be, as dangling a pardon to keep someone from testifying is an act of felony obstruction of justice. When an attorney and client conspire together to commit a crime, it isn\u2019t covered by attorney-client privilege.\n\nSecond, this means the House Judiciary Committee plans to publicly make a big deal out of the fact that Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani conspired together to commit crimes. We won\u2019t be shocked if the committee ends up forcing Rudy to testify in front of the TV cameras. Rudy doesn\u2019t appear to be taking the news well, as he tweeted last night that the investigation was a \u201cWitchunt.\u201d Wait, what?"

His worship of our flag doesn\u2019t cut it. He wanted a parade that was supposed to support the military and veterans, but in reality it was there to boost his ego, which shows no respect to veterans. And most of all, dodging the draft five times brings no honor to Trump and his fake love for the military.\n\nThe list goes on, but this is about Senator John McCain. It\u2019s okay to respectfully state your opinion on how he did as a Senator, but these personal attacks go on and on. This incitement of hate from Trump encourages his supporters to bring that hate towards McCain\u2019s family, particularly his daughter Meghan, and his wife Cindy.

    "text": "\u201cPresident\u201d Donald Trump had signaled that he intended to sign an executive order that was designed to guarantee free speech on college campuses. On Thursday, Trump followed through on his promise, executing his latest Executive Order, \u201cImproving Free Inquiry, Transparency, and Accountability At Colleges and Universities.\u201d Like much that comes from Trump, his \u201cwinning,\u201d it is an empty bag of gas.\n\nThe Executive Order directs twelve federal grant-making agencies to ensure that the higher education schools that receive federal research funds are complying with the laws and regulations that already exist at the federal level. As Vox noted, Trump\u2019s EO \u201cis more symbolism than substance.\u201d Trump had promised such action at the annual Cult 45 convention, aka the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nViolence is never the answer, and physical assaults on individuals such as Hayden Williams, who was allegedly attacked at the University of California Berkley, must be condemned. The same goes for physical damage and violence against property or individuals. But Trump\u2019s EO is especially addressed to the perceived suppression against conservative speakers and students. Trump\u2019s EO provides:\n\n\u201cFree inquiry is an essential feature of our Nation\u2019s democracy, and it promotes learning, scientific discovery, and economic prosperity. We must encourage institutions to appropriately account for this bedrock principle in their administration of student life and to avoid creating environments that stifle competing perspectives, thereby potentially impeding beneficial research and undermining learning.\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the conservative institutions (yes, there are many such places of higher learning) implement this order not to \u201cstifle competing perspectives.\u201d This new executive order does not address federal financial aid programs. However, the EO does require a report by January 2020 addressing the risk-sharing proposals for colleges, something that Trump has indicated would be coming.\n\nThe report could address caps on student loans available and put more emphasis on the institutions sharing in the financial burdens. The outcome likely will have little impact, as the cost of a college education is not likely to decrease in any meaningful way. As per the normal, Trump and his Education Secretary Betsy DeVos don\u2019t know much about education, or anything. Trump does know executive orders, though."

Today, Cummings is targeting Jared Kushner over allegations that Kushner has been using personal email and an encrypted messaging service to communicate with foreign leaders.\n\nElijah Cummings is citing a meeting that he had with Kushner attorney Abbe Lowell back in December, which up to now wasn\u2019t public knowledge. According to Cummings, Lowell admitted during the meeting that Jared Kushner uses the encrypted social media platform WhatsApp to communicate with world leaders, as reported by USA Today. This raises concerns on three levels. First, there is the question of whether this practice violates federal record keeping laws. Kushner claims he screen-shots all of his WhatsApp messages and submits them for collection. If this proves true, it would probably be compliant with the law.\n\nSecond, there is the question of whether this practice is safe. According to Cummings, Kushner\u2019s attorney said in December that he didn\u2019t know whether or not Kushner was transmitting classified information via WhatsApp. This would raise various security issues. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that Donald Trump routinely vilified his opponent Hillary Clinton for allegedly transmitting classified information via a private email server.\n\nThird, according to a new report from Politico, Jared Kushner \u201creportedly has communicated with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman via WhatsApp.\u201d Considering that the Crown Price is widely believed to have been behind the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, we expect Elijah Cummings to ask a whole lot of questions going forward about those WhatsApp conversations. Stay tuned."

Writing to the head of the orphanage, whom she affectionately calls \u201cDaddy,\u201d Selena sees her wealthy benefactors clearly, through the eyes of a wisdom that belies her years. \u201cWhat gets me most about these people, Daddy,\u201d Selena writes, \u201cisn\u2019t how ignorant they are, or how much they drink. It\u2019s the way they have of thinking that everything nice in the world is a gift to the poor people from them or their ancestors.\u201d\n\nThe matron of the house compels Selena to come to the rear porch and look at the sunset and, once witnessed, waits. At length, Selena thanks her. \u201cI have since thanked her,\u201d Selena continues, \u201cfor the ocean, the moon, the stars in the sky, and the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn a tedious digression Wednesday before workers at an Ohio tank factory, Donald Trump said of the late John McCain that he, Trump, \u201cgave him the kind of funeral he wanted,\u201d but, \u201cdidn\u2019t get a thank you.\u201d What conceivable flight of supercilious fantasy could possibly make a man, who was barred from even attending a funeral, conclude that the funeral itself owed its existence to him, never mind that he should be thanked for it?\n\nAs we see from Vonnegut, the conceit to take credit for everything and the presumption to be thanked for everything is nothing new. It\u2019s really a feature of the powerful that is older than the Pharaohs. It is out of place in a Democracy, but never mind that. What is it doing in the addled brain of Donald Trump? Does Trump suffer from a God delusion?\n\nWe\u2019ve seen nothing to suggest that he doesn\u2019t. Trump has a near pathological aversion for admitting when he\u2019s wrong, but even more than this, Trump has an overweening need to take credit. Credit for the economy, credit for the Kavanaugh appointment, credit for the tax bill (as long as it continues, largely, to be seen as good by its Trump-supporting victims living in poverty), credit for aviation safety (except when planes crash), hell, credit for coining the term \u201cpriming the pump.\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind any of this quite so much were it not for one thing, the thing that it all relentlessly tracks back to. Donald Trump is in charge of the most fearsome nuclear arsenal ever assembled by the human race. And he thinks he\u2019s God. And so, too, do many of his followers."

It started with the very first speech he ever gave as a candidate for president, the \u2018golden elevator\u2019 speech at Trump Tower in New York, when he stated that Mexican immigrants were rapists and drug dealers (although he did generously admit to assuming that some were good people). Among his most cringe-worthy statements were after Charlottesville, when he proclaimed there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d\n\nTo paraphrase something that former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum said about his opponent during Florida\u2019s Gubernatorial race last year: I\u2019m not saying Donald Trump is a white supremacist and a white nationalist, but the white supremacists and white nationalists believe he is.\n\nIn the worst mass shooting in New Zealand\u2019s history on Friday, a gunman opened fire in two different mosques, killing at least fifty people and wounding many more. The perpetrator\u2019s manifesto referred to Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, as a \u201csymbol of renewed white identity\u201d and stated that Trump \u201cshares a common purpose with me.\u201d When Trump was later asked about the rise of white nationalism, he reportedly stated that it was limited to \u201ca small group of people\u201d and therefore he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a problem.\n\nMick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s Acting White House Chief of Staff, recently sat for a televised interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News. Mulvaney most likely chose Fox because he believed he would find a sympathetic interviewer. While Wallace certainly didn\u2019t play hardball with Mulvaney, he did ask some pointed questions: \u201cTo the degree that there is an issue with white supremacists, white nationalists, anti-Muslim bigotry in this country, and there is an issue with that, why [does Trump] not deliver a speech condemning it?\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s response, delivered while nervously chuckling, was \u201cthe president is not a white supremacist. I\u2019m not sure how many times we have to say that!\u201d A word of advice for Mick: generally when you say the same thing over and over and people still don\u2019t believe you, it\u2019s because you\u2019re frequently giving them reasons not to believe you.\n\nDonald Trump will likely never give a speech condemning white supremacy and white nationalism. If he ever did, it would be only days, if not hours, before he started sending heated tweets that directly contradicted whatever he\u2019d said in that speech. The reason is simple: a good portion of Trump\u2019s base is made up of white supremacists and white nationalists.\n\nWhether Trump holds these views himself or not, we\u2019ll never know \u2013 we can\u2019t see into his head \u2013 but we do know that he encourages these people every chance he gets, and he bends over backwards to ensure he doesn\u2019t alienate them (even after one of them uses a car to run down and kill an innocent woman). What Trump himself believes is irrelevant. What truly matters is what Trump promotes, and what Trump promotes is white nationalism, white supremacy and racism."

There are also the tragic deaths of children in U.S. custody, as reports reveal the conditions are even worse than we had feared.\n\nPart of the reason the federal government has tried the excuse that there\u2019s too many separated children and parents, is because they are now using secret shelters to detain migrant children. One of them, located in Ada, Oklahoma, has a reputation for sexual harassment and physical abuse among its staff \u2013 and is known to be holding at least one migrant child. A report from two years ago singled out this particular facility for having a staff with no medical training.\n\nEven more alarming is that the attorneys of these children don\u2019t even know how to find them \u2013 or how many even exist. There are at least five in Arkansas, Florida, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia, according to Reveal News. Beyond asking how this can be fixed, we must also ask if the number of separated families is so large because the Trump administration sought to profit off of this as much as possible?\n\nPeople often compare this age to the beginning of the Holocaust. But it could be something else \u2013 echoes of our own dark past \u2013 our treatment of Native Americans that is all too often glossed over in schools, or the internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War II, which is also rarely embellished, and was routinely upheld by courts in its day. Media companies owe it to their country to put their resources into investigating this matter thoroughly from the ground up.

I believe no matter what, veterans should stick together, even with our disagreements in politics. Now I am calling for all veterans to come together and demand that President Trump show the recently departed Senator John McCain some respect and dignity, especially for his honorable service to our country.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise to me now that Trump has no respect for veterans. His worship of our flag doesn\u2019t cut it. He wanted a parade that was supposed to support the military and veterans, but in reality it was there to boost his ego, which shows no respect to veterans. And most of all, dodging the draft five times brings no honor to Trump and his fake love for the military.\n\nThe list goes on, but this is about Senator John McCain. It\u2019s okay to respectfully state your opinion on how he did as a Senator, but these personal attacks go on and on. This incitement of hate from Trump encourages his supporters to bring that hate towards McCain\u2019s family, particularly his daughter Meghan, and his wife Cindy. As stressful as losing family members can be, they don\u2019t need to be trolled with hateful messages, tweets or articles.\n\nI have learned in Chaplain Assistant School that one of our primary roles in the Chaplain Corps is to honor the dead. I am calling on all veterans to come together and demand that Trump stop these hateful attacks on John McCain. These attacks are a disgrace to the Oval Office, to our military and veterans and to our country."

What Florida Republicans are now trying to do: The Republican-controlled Florida Legislature is moving to pass a bill that would limit the voting rights of these former felons.\n\nFlorida and Ohio are consistent members of a small contingent of states that are considered by many to be the deciders of the presidency. There\u2019s also a chance that Florida is a consistent member in your Bush-Gore-themed nightmares. We\u2019re talking about a state with a population of over 21 million that is often decided by tens of thousands of people, and suddenly Republicans want to roll back the voting rights of around a million and a half re-enfranchised voters, almost 45% of whom are black. As they say; you do the math.\n\nSay it with me: the Republicans are good-for-nothing, racist cheaters. They gerrymander to take a disproportionate number of seats in the House of Representatives, they enact laws with excessively punitive punishments targeted at poor people and people of color so that they can\u2019t vote, and sometimes they steal ballots. They know how unappealing they are, so they cheat, demagogue, and manipulate against the best interests of this beautiful country and her people.\n\nWe cannot let this pending constitutional travesty go on in Florida. The more people talk about it and call the Republicans out for it, the more pressure gets put on them to do the right thing. Almost two-thirds of the people of Florida voted for Amendment 4, and doing anything but restoring the voting rights for these people is patently against the will of the people at large. Yes, the Amendment needs to be clearly defined because it hasn\u2019t been yet, but defining it to limit the rights it intended to restore is ethically unsound and undemocratic.\n\nFlorida can decide who gets the presidency. When people vote in big numbers, the Democrats win. Adding 1.5 million more eligible voters to the state would be huge. Putting these things together, the Republicans know they\u2019re in trouble. They\u2019re trying to make sure that democracy is stifled so that they can win. Share this or any article you can to make sure this gets as much attention as possible, because the outcome of this issue could mean the difference between a Democratic victory in 2020 and an unthinkable loss."

Now the Enquirer gang has decided to sell Trump out in the hope of keeping itself out of even more legal trouble.\n\nWe already saw Pecker and the National Enquirer sell Donald Trump and Michael Cohen out to the SDNY in return for immunity. But then Pecker blew his immunity when he got caught trying to blackmail Trump\u2019s longtime nemesis Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and now Pecker is in real danger of facing serious criminal charges. So he\u2019s selling Trump out yet again.\n\nPecker and AMI have agreed to turn over Trump-related documents to the House Judiciary Committee, according to CBS News. Based on the nature of the document request, these are ostensibly the same documents that they\u2019ve already turned over to the SDNY. So this won\u2019t necessarily further incriminate Trump, but it will serve to publicly incriminate Trump, as the committee will turn around and use these documents as part of its public hearings on Trump\u2019s crimes.\n\nThe National Enquirer gang keeps playing games, of course, so it\u2019s possible they could be disingenuous in their announcement that they\u2019re going to cooperate. But in this instance, they have nothing further to lose by turning over documents to the House Democrats that they\u2019ve already turned over to prosecutors.

As Trump becomes more frantic, can he top all this in the weirdness department? He may have just done precisely that.\n\nThis evening Donald Trump sent out an email to his supporters with the subject line \u201cWitch Hunt Report Attached.\u201d The subject line also includes an image of a paperclip, aimed at tricking recipients into believing that a document of some kind has been attached to the email. Then the first line of the email says \u201c[SORRY THIS DOCUMENT IS BLANK].\u201d Wait, what?\n\nAfter the weird fake-out that even Trump\u2019s own base probably isn\u2019t gullible enough to fall for, the email then claims that \u201closer Democrats and their friends in the Fake News Media\u201d have been claiming that \u201cthey plan to release the report \u2018soon\u2019 but they\u2019ve been saying that for OVER 2 YEARS.\u201d This is weird, considering the report will be released by Robert Mueller and the Department of Justice, not the \u201closer Democrats\u201d or the \u201cFake News Media.\u201d\n\nOf course this entire bizarre email turns out to be an attempt at luring recipients into taking a poll about whether the \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d should end. It\u2019s all part of a Trump 2020 campaign fundraiser. The timing is interesting when you consider that Donald Trump is trying to fundraise off the premise that he\u2019s done nothing wrong, even as Forbes reported yesterday that Trump has funneled more than a million dollars of these donations into his own businesses."

On Thursday, Trump followed through on his promise, executing his latest Executive Order, \u201cImproving Free Inquiry, Transparency, and Accountability At Colleges and Universities.\u201d Like much that comes from Trump, his \u201cwinning,\u201d it is an empty bag of gas.\n\nThe Executive Order directs twelve federal grant-making agencies to ensure that the higher education schools that receive federal research funds are complying with the laws and regulations that already exist at the federal level. As Vox noted, Trump\u2019s EO \u201cis more symbolism than substance.\u201d Trump had promised such action at the annual Cult 45 convention, aka the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nViolence is never the answer, and physical assaults on individuals such as Hayden Williams, who was allegedly attacked at the University of California Berkley, must be condemned. The same goes for physical damage and violence against property or individuals. But Trump\u2019s EO is especially addressed to the perceived suppression against conservative speakers and students. Trump\u2019s EO provides:\n\n\u201cFree inquiry is an essential feature of our Nation\u2019s democracy, and it promotes learning, scientific discovery, and economic prosperity. We must encourage institutions to appropriately account for this bedrock principle in their administration of student life and to avoid creating environments that stifle competing perspectives, thereby potentially impeding beneficial research and undermining learning.\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the conservative institutions (yes, there are many such places of higher learning) implement this order not to \u201cstifle competing perspectives.\u201d This new executive order does not address federal financial aid programs. However, the EO does require a report by January 2020 addressing the risk-sharing proposals for colleges, something that Trump has indicated would be coming.\n\nThe report could address caps on student loans available and put more emphasis on the institutions sharing in the financial burdens. The outcome likely will have little impact, as the cost of a college education is not likely to decrease in any meaningful way. As per the normal, Trump and his Education Secretary Betsy DeVos don\u2019t know much about education, or anything. Trump does know executive orders, though."

After all, Gates continued to work for the campaign, and then for the transition team, long after Manafort was fired.\n\nRick Gates was one of the many Trump-related people who received document requests from the House Judiciary Committee. Some big names, including Steve Bannon and Hope Hicks, are cooperating. Other people are saying they won\u2019t cooperate, and are willing to roll the subpoena dice instead. But we were all expecting Rick Gates to cooperate, right? After all, Gates is still hoping for a lenient prison sentence, and he needs to be as helpful as possible.\n\nBut this evening we all learned that Rick Gates has informed the House Judiciary Committee that he can\u2019t give them his documents at this time, because prosecutors have advised him not to. The only possible reason for this is that prosecutors are still using Gates\u2019 documents in an ongoing criminal case.\n\nConsidering that just about everyone else involved has either been convicted or pleaded out, it\u2019s clear that the evidence Gates is withholding is against Donald Trump. Gates is saying that he might be able to give Congress his documents in the \u201ccoming months.\u201d This would seem to fall in line with the expectation that Robert Mueller will drop the hammer on Trump before much longer.

Not a good way to get people to work with you. In the case of the GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, Trump has been bullying UAW leader David Green while simultaneously begging CEO Mary Barra to keep the plant open. He attacks the one he sees as the weaker of the two.\n\nNever mind that David Green wrote two letters to Trump last year, seeking his help on the impending closing, to which Trump never responded. One can only wonder where he\u2019s been since GM made the announcement in November 2018. The reason Trump is livid about the Lordstown plant is his (fake) campaign promise to increase manufacturing jobs. He then took office and imposed the very thing that hurts manufacturing: tariffs.\n\nIn all fairness, the Lordstown plant primarily manufactured the Chevrolet Cruze, which was no longer of interest to car buyers, and GM decided to stop production and streamline its facilities to assist with overall profitability. As reported by Vox, part of this plan included closing four U.S. Plants (two in Ohio, one in Michigan, and one in Maryland) and one Canadian plant and cutting its workforce by 15%.\n\nNot only was Trump made aware of this by David Green, GM announced last fall that it was offering voluntary buyouts to 18,000 salaried workers to cut costs and that the \u201ctariffs under the Trump administration could lead to a \u2018smaller\u2019 GM,\u201d Vox reports. Has Trump not been paying attention? Of course he hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s too busy waging war against his perceived enemies. Now, it\u2019s a crisis for him. As a wise man once said, \u201cBe careful where you point your finger; you\u2019re pointing two back at yourself.\u201d Too bad Trump doesn\u2019t know that.\n\nAs Vox points out, Trump\u2019s trade policies didn\u2019t help. His tariffs are getting the better of the very jobs he claimed to protect. Now it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault. To try to save his shrinking base in that area (which has decreased by 19% according to USA Today), he traveled there, as if his presence is going to make a difference. GM isn\u2019t the problem; Trump is.\n\nAs Politico points out, Trump doesn\u2019t understand the global economy any more than he understands the U.S. economy, and the auto industry is very much a global industry. With auto makers building cars in the U.S. using foreign parts, and foreign manufacturers using U.S. parts, they all depend on each other. President Obama understood that nuance, and his policies increased investment, which Trump is single-handedly destroying.\n\nDonald Trump has seemingly never understood that tariffs are in essence an additional tax on U.S. citizens. Read a detailed analysis of tariffs by the Tax Foundation here. One can only assume that in addition to closing plants, he hasn\u2019t noticed all of the retail businesses that are closing and leaving untold numbers of people unemployed. Yep. Trump is \u201cmaking America great again\u201d one bankruptcy or closing at a time. And the auto manufacturers are still moving operations to Mexico. Thanks, \u201cPresident\u201d Trump."

But apart from Rudy\u2019s own admission last summer that the DOJ Inspector General was investigating how he knew the FBI\u2019s actions in advance during the election, we haven\u2019t had any proof that Rudy is under investigation \u2013 until now.\n\nNow that the House Judiciary Committee has finished sending its initial round of document requests, which it said were merely an effort to catch up with similar requests that have already been made by other investigators, the committee is launching into its next round. That\u2019ll include subpoenas for those who failed to comply with the first round. It\u2019ll also include some new names, including Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThis is according to the Wall Street Journal, which says that the committee is about to request documents from Rudy Giuliani and others who are alleged to have been involved in Donald Trump\u2019s plot to dangle a pardon at Michael Cohen, in an effort to keep Cohen from cooperating. We think this is significant for two reasons. First, the committee clearly isn\u2019t worried about the fact that Rudy is Trump\u2019s attorney. Nor should they be, as dangling a pardon to keep someone from testifying is an act of felony obstruction of justice. When an attorney and client conspire together to commit a crime, it isn\u2019t covered by attorney-client privilege.\n\nSecond, this means the House Judiciary Committee plans to publicly make a big deal out of the fact that Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani conspired together to commit crimes. We won\u2019t be shocked if the committee ends up forcing Rudy to testify in front of the TV cameras. Rudy doesn\u2019t appear to be taking the news well, as he tweeted last night that the investigation was a \u201cWitchunt.\u201d Wait, what?"

Writing to the head of the orphanage, whom she affectionately calls \u201cDaddy,\u201d Selena sees her wealthy benefactors clearly, through the eyes of a wisdom that belies her years. \u201cWhat gets me most about these people, Daddy,\u201d Selena writes, \u201cisn\u2019t how ignorant they are, or how much they drink. It\u2019s the way they have of thinking that everything nice in the world is a gift to the poor people from them or their ancestors.\u201d\n\nThe matron of the house compels Selena to come to the rear porch and look at the sunset and, once witnessed, waits. At length, Selena thanks her. \u201cI have since thanked her,\u201d Selena continues, \u201cfor the ocean, the moon, the stars in the sky, and the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn a tedious digression Wednesday before workers at an Ohio tank factory, Donald Trump said of the late John McCain that he, Trump, \u201cgave him the kind of funeral he wanted,\u201d but, \u201cdidn\u2019t get a thank you.\u201d What conceivable flight of supercilious fantasy could possibly make a man, who was barred from even attending a funeral, conclude that the funeral itself owed its existence to him, never mind that he should be thanked for it?\n\nAs we see from Vonnegut, the conceit to take credit for everything and the presumption to be thanked for everything is nothing new. It\u2019s really a feature of the powerful that is older than the Pharaohs. It is out of place in a Democracy, but never mind that. What is it doing in the addled brain of Donald Trump? Does Trump suffer from a God delusion?\n\nWe\u2019ve seen nothing to suggest that he doesn\u2019t. Trump has a near pathological aversion for admitting when he\u2019s wrong, but even more than this, Trump has an overweening need to take credit. Credit for the economy, credit for the Kavanaugh appointment, credit for the tax bill (as long as it continues, largely, to be seen as good by its Trump-supporting victims living in poverty), credit for aviation safety (except when planes crash), hell, credit for coining the term \u201cpriming the pump.\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind any of this quite so much were it not for one thing, the thing that it all relentlessly tracks back to.

Now that deal is reportedly toast.\n\nIt\u2019s long been reported that George Nader helped set up (and attended) the infamous transition period Seychelles meeting between Erik Prince and Kremlin higher-up Kirill Dmitriev. That meeting was allegedly an attempt at establishing a backchannel between the Donald Trump regime and the Vladimir Putin regime. Nader\u2019s cooperation was extensive enough that he even testified before a Trump-Russia grand jury last year. It seemed like Nader was going to be Mueller\u2019s guy all the way.\n\nBut now George Nader is reportedly no longer cooperating with Robert Mueller, according to Laura Rozen of Middle Eastern news publication Al-Monitor. No one involved is willing to comment on why this has happened, or even confirm or deny that it\u2019s happened. But it\u2019s intriguing, because it points to just how much things have changed in the investigation over the past year. In fact it ties into something new we just learned yesterday.\n\nThanks to a court filing by Michael Flynn\u2019s former business partner Bijan Kian yesterday, we learned that during the transition period, Flynn also met with Kirill Dmitriev. This means Mueller got the lowdown on Dmitriev when Flynn cut his deal in November of 2017, before he gave immunity to Nader with regard to the Prince meeting with Dmitriev. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know here, but if Nader\u2019s original cooperation deal was a big story, then the demise of that deal is an even bigger story."

One particular revelation, first reported by CNN, has received very little media coverage. But it is a story that is too important to miss because of what it reveals about the president and the prosecutors investigating him. It shows that one side is intelligent, shrewd, and determined, while the other side is an egotistical oaf who just got trampled on by his own two feet. Before you read any further, you can try to guess which side is which.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, SDNY prosecutors obtained a search warrant to access the contents of Michael Cohen\u2019s Gmail account. Google refused to comply fully with the warrant, pointing out that the law did not require the company to hand over data that was stored on overseas servers. That would have been the end of the story. Instead, a few weeks later, Trump inadvertently gave prosecutors an incredibly thoughtful gift.\n\nOn March 23, 2018, Trump signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill to prevent a government shutdown. The bill included a controversial law known as the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act, which gives law enforcement the authority to secure digital information even if it is stored outside the United States. Trump got what he wanted despite pushback from privacy advocates concerned that the law could lead to unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution.\n\nThe SDNY then returned to court in April with new legal ammunition, citing the law that Donald Trump had just signed. A judge granted a new warrant, which meant that SDNY prosecutors got what they wanted: full access to Trump\u2019s fixer\u2019s email account, including attachments, address book entries and more. Some of that seized Cohen evidence surely incriminates Trump \u2013 and they have Trump to thank."

It started with the very first speech he ever gave as a candidate for president, the \u2018golden elevator\u2019 speech at Trump Tower in New York, when he stated that Mexican immigrants were rapists and drug dealers (although he did generously admit to assuming that some were good people). Among his most cringe-worthy statements were after Charlottesville, when he proclaimed there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d\n\nTo paraphrase something that former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum said about his opponent during Florida\u2019s Gubernatorial race last year: I\u2019m not saying Donald Trump is a white supremacist and a white nationalist, but the white supremacists and white nationalists believe he is.\n\nIn the worst mass shooting in New Zealand\u2019s history on Friday, a gunman opened fire in two different mosques, killing at least fifty people and wounding many more. The perpetrator\u2019s manifesto referred to Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, as a \u201csymbol of renewed white identity\u201d and stated that Trump \u201cshares a common purpose with me.\u201d When Trump was later asked about the rise of white nationalism, he reportedly stated that it was limited to \u201ca small group of people\u201d and therefore he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a problem.\n\nMick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s Acting White House Chief of Staff, recently sat for a televised interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News. Mulvaney most likely chose Fox because he believed he would find a sympathetic interviewer. While Wallace certainly didn\u2019t play hardball with Mulvaney, he did ask some pointed questions: \u201cTo the degree that there is an issue with white supremacists, white nationalists, anti-Muslim bigotry in this country, and there is an issue with that, why [does Trump] not deliver a speech condemning it?\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s response, delivered while nervously chuckling, was \u201cthe president is not a white supremacist. I\u2019m not sure how many times we have to say that!\u201d A word of advice for Mick: generally when you say the same thing over and over and people still don\u2019t believe you, it\u2019s because you\u2019re frequently giving them reasons not to believe you.\n\nDonald Trump will likely never give a speech condemning white supremacy and white nationalism. If he ever did, it would be only days, if not hours, before he started sending heated tweets that directly contradicted whatever he\u2019d said in that speech. The reason is simple: a good portion of Trump\u2019s base is made up of white supremacists and white nationalists.\n\nWhether Trump holds these views himself or not, we\u2019ll never know \u2013 we can\u2019t see into his head \u2013 but we do know that he encourages these people every chance he gets, and he bends over backwards to ensure he doesn\u2019t alienate them (even after one of them uses a car to run down and kill an innocent woman). What Trump himself believes is irrelevant. What truly matters is what Trump promotes, and what Trump promotes is white nationalism, white supremacy and racism."

But last night it was revealed that this was false, and that plenty of people were in fact cooperating. Now we\u2019re getting names, including a big one.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks is turning over Trump-related documents to the House Judiciary Committee, according to a new report this evening from CNN. Why does this matter? First, Hicks is selling Trump out by complying with the document request, as opposed to trying to stand her ground and fight what would have been an inevitable subpoena. But there\u2019s more to it than that.\n\nSecond, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler has already publicly made clear that this initial round of document requests is only seeking the same documents that Robert Mueller other investigators have already requested. Hope Hicks decision to turn over documents to the committee tells us that Mueller has already asked her for the same documents, and that she\u2019s already complied with that request. She wouldn\u2019t give these documents to Congress if she refused to give them to Mueller, because Congress would just give them to Mueller anyway.\n\nSo now we know that Hope Hicks has sold out Donald Trump to the House Democrats and to Robert Mueller. She\u2019s not the only one. Nadler confirmed earlier this week that Steve Bannon gave thousands of documents to the committee, which means he must have previously given thousands of documents to Mueller as well. It\u2019s starting to become clear who wants to survive this legally, and who wants to go to prison with Trump."

The Trump administration initially lied about separating families, with the excuse that they were simply following orders from a previous administration \u2013 though it\u2019s been unclear if they\u2019re referring to the policies of Presidents Obama, Bush 43 or Clinton \u2013 in other words, deflecting with lies and not caring where they point. As time drags on, we\u2019ve found that the number of children separated is much higher than originally thought \u2013 some even forced into adoption. There are also the tragic deaths of children in U.S. custody, as reports reveal the conditions are even worse than we had feared.\n\nPart of the reason the federal government has tried the excuse that there\u2019s too many separated children and parents, is because they are now using secret shelters to detain migrant children. One of them, located in Ada, Oklahoma, has a reputation for sexual harassment and physical abuse among its staff \u2013 and is known to be holding at least one migrant child. A report from two years ago singled out this particular facility for having a staff with no medical training.\n\nEven more alarming is that the attorneys of these children don\u2019t even know how to find them \u2013 or how many even exist. There are at least five in Arkansas, Florida, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia, according to Reveal News. Beyond asking how this can be fixed, we must also ask if the number of separated families is so large because the Trump administration sought to profit off of this as much as possible?\n\nPeople often compare this age to the beginning of the Holocaust. But it could be something else \u2013 echoes of our own dark past \u2013 our treatment of Native Americans that is all too often glossed over in schools, or the internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War II, which is also rarely embellished, and was routinely upheld by courts in its day. Media companies owe it to their country to put their resources into investigating this matter thoroughly from the ground up. This is hardly the beginning of another shameful chapter in American history. We\u2019re several steps along the way."

But if you spend any time thinking the final endgame scenario through, you quickly realize it\u2019s not so simple.\n\nLet\u2019s assume for a moment that Robert Mueller and the Attorney General (or the SDNY) decide to indict Donald Trump while he is in office. How do they issue that indictment? Is Trump a flight risk? Most likely he is not. Therefore, his lawyer would be served and he would be given some number of hours to turn himself in for processing.\n\nWhat will he do? What if he announces a pardon for himself? That would place a burden back onto the DOJ to fight the pardon in court, and he would most likely avoid immediate arrest. Would he start firing nearly everyone inside the DOJ? He could.\n\nWould the Republicans in Congress decide they don\u2019t want to go down with him, and move to quickly impeach him before he can wreak further havoc on our institutions and/or rally his supporters to armed protests? Do you really think Trump will accept an indictment quietly, or is he more likely to fire as many people as he can in the DOJ, issue pardons to himself and his family, and rally his supporters into a frenzy?\n\nEven if Donald Trump is indicted, he would still most likely be the President of the United States until there are enough votes to oust him. I bet these conversations have happened and are happening right now inside the DOJ. Given how messy this \u201cend-game\u201d is likely to get, it makes some sense that the final act against the President of the United States must be robust and well planned.

During his 2016 campaign, he derided Obama\u2019s GDP growth as being anemic and terrible, promising that the growth would exceed 3% a year when he became president. Well, turns out, the \u201cGreatest Negotiator of All Time\u201d (\u201cGNAT\u201d) and the \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d man is not so great after all.\n\nIn late February, the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the 2018 growth was 2.9%, matching Obama\u2019s peak year of 2015. Some economists have predicted that 2.9% will be the peak for Trump in his first term. On Wednesday, the news of a stagnating economy continued. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had promised several rate hikes in 2019, causing him to be in the cross hairs of Trump\u2019s proverbial venom when he did so. On Wednesday, Powell promised there would be no more rate hikes and noted the economic growth rate will be 2.1%. They have reduced the economic growth forecasts through 2021 to less than 2%.\n\nThese grim economic forecasts throw Trump and the GOP\u2019s assertions about how the trillion-dollar tax cut would stimulate the economy onto the trash heap. In addition to the revised forecasts and less than stellar growth predicted, Trump has been feverishly trying to get GM to reverse its decision announced last year to close its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, blaming that on a local union leader.\n\nWhat Donald Trump and his administration fail to understand, apparently, is that his tariff positions have done harm to not only farmers, but to the automobile industry. This comes at the same time that reports from Politico and elsewhere describe an undisclosed report that Trump has that would justify significant tariffs on automobile imports, which would again hit the auto industry hard. Trump once again shows that he and the GOP stomp like elephants but their business approach stings like a GNAT. Winning, Trump style."

Perhaps in retaliation, Trump has decided that his number one goal in life is to attack John McCain as often and as offensively as possible. This is finally resulting in GOP Senators pushing back, or at least one of them in particular.\n\nRepublican Senator Johnny Isakson said last year that if anyone attacked John McCain, they deserved a \u201cwhipping\u201d for it. Sure enough, after Donald Trump spent the past few days attacking McCain, Isakson said today that \u201cI want to do what I said that day on the floor of the Senate.\u201d In other words, he wants to deliver a \u201cwhipping\u201d against Trump. We\u2019re assuming he means the metaphorical kind, and that he\u2019s not actually talking about physically beating Trump up, but this is nonetheless quickly dissolving into a food fight.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what happens next. Donald Trump will surely hear about Isakson\u2019s remarks and fire back on Twitter, which will only serve to give more exposure to what Isakson said about Trump. Interestingly, it appears that Isakson made his remarks today before he was aware that Trump had just unleashed on McCain yet again, this time criticizing McCain for not having come back from the dead to thank Trump for throwing him a big funeral. This will only get uglier for Trump an the GOP."

What Florida Republicans are now trying to do: The Republican-controlled Florida Legislature is moving to pass a bill that would limit the voting rights of these former felons.\n\nFlorida and Ohio are consistent members of a small contingent of states that are considered by many to be the deciders of the presidency.

We\u2019re talking about a state with a population of over 21 million that is often decided by tens of thousands of people, and suddenly Republicans want to roll back the voting rights of around a million and a half re-enfranchised voters, almost 45% of whom are black. As they say; you do the math.\n\nSay it with me: the Republicans are good-for-nothing, racist cheaters. They gerrymander to take a disproportionate number of seats in the House of Representatives, they enact laws with excessively punitive punishments targeted at poor people and people of color so that they can\u2019t vote, and sometimes they steal ballots.

Almost two-thirds of the people of Florida voted for Amendment 4, and doing anything but restoring the voting rights for these people is patently against the will of the people at large. Yes, the Amendment needs to be clearly defined because it hasn\u2019t been yet, but defining it to limit the rights it intended to restore is ethically unsound and undemocratic.\n\nFlorida can decide who gets the presidency. When people vote in big numbers, the Democrats win. Adding 1.5 million more eligible voters to the state would be huge. Putting these things together, the Republicans know they\u2019re in trouble. They\u2019re trying to make sure that democracy is stifled so that they can win. Share this or any article you can to make sure this gets as much attention as possible, because the outcome of this issue could mean the difference between a Democratic victory in 2020 and an unthinkable loss."

Trump is hoping to find a way to prevent Congress from seeing the ugliest parts of the report, or at least get the opportunity to lie about these things before Congress can reveal it all to the public.\n\nBut nothing works that way, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler just reminded everyone of as much. He tweeted \u201cThe law here is very clear. When he finishes his work, Special Counsel Mueller is required to report to the Attorney General, who is required to report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Attorney General William Barr would be committing a crime by letting Donald Trump see the Mueller report before he gives it to Congress.

However, if the poll is biased or the questions unclear, results don\u2019t always speak the truth.\n\nThis week, USA Today published an article entitled \u201cPoll: Half of Americans say Trump is victim of a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 as trust in Mueller erodes.\u201d As you might expect, \u201cPresident\u201d Donald Trump immediately tweeted in support of this headline, without reading the full article. If you take this headline at face value without reading the article and conducting further research, you might think that confidence in Mueller has dropped significantly since the December NPR/PBS NewHouse/Marist poll that found only 33% of Americans viewed Mueller\u2019s investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nAs reported by Vox, the Suffolk/USA Today poll question which generated the headline is \u201cseriously flawed.\u201d What does that mean? The question was a two-part question, which can result in skewed numbers from lack of clarity. The question asked: \u201cPresident Trump has called the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 and said he\u2019s been subjected to more investigations than previous presidents because of politics. Do you agree?\u201d\n\nSome may agree with the first part of the question but not the second or vice versa. The two parts are not necessarily related to or dependent upon each other, and different answers could be given for each. In today\u2019s fast-paced world, most of us \u201cskim\u201d materials to save time and could have easily missed one part of this question. As Vox points out, this is poor polling strategy.\n\nThough neither Vox nor I have proof of any of this, the compound question invariably sets itself up for failure, especially viewed in light of similar but well-constructed poll questions. Vox points to a Washington Post / Schar School poll conducted last month, which indicated that 56% of those polled find Mueller more credible than Trump, and the Hill.TV / American Barometer poll found 58% who believe Mueller\u2019s investigation is \u201cunbiased.\u201d Vox has this right. When presented with one clear question, people participating in polls gave very different responses.\n\nVox does mention other results of the Suffolk/USA poll that are based on more clearly written questions and tend to support the belief that the earlier-mentioned results were skewed, giving Trump some bad news in the process: 62% of respondents are against introducing impeachment proceedings at the present time while also supporting the aggressive investigation techniques being used by Democrats. Nancy Pelosi is right to play down impeachment\u2014for now. Her decision is in line with the American public\u2019s view. Of course, Trump chose to ignore the worst news for him from this poll: 52% have \u201c\u2019little or no trust\u2019\u201d in his denial of collusion. We can\u2019t always take poll results at face value and certainly not by a headline, which could also be erroneously constructed.\n\nWisely take poll data with the proverbial grain of salt. Many contingencies come into play that can easily skew a poll in the direction intended by the polltaker or framer. Of course, Donald Trump sees anything that appears to support him as good, without bothering to look further. The headline plays to his base, and that\u2019s what he wants."

    "text": "Michael Flynn has been so valuable as a cooperating witness, Special Counsel Robert Mueller ended up recommending essentially no prison time for Flynn, despite his serious crimes against the United States. This has long made clear that Flynn gave up the biggest of fish in the Trump-Russia scandal. We just don\u2019t know any of the details of that, because Mueller is still blacking all of it out in Flynn\u2019s court filings. But one key detail just slipped through.\n\nMichael Flynn\u2019s former business partner Bijan Kian is set to go on trial, and Flynn is a key witness against him. Kian\u2019s defense strategy will naturally consist of trying to discredit Flynn, and to that end, he\u2019s asking prosecutors for the details of Flynn\u2019s various crimes. Prosecutors are fighting against this for the same reason they\u2019ve been redacting everything in their publicly available filings; they don\u2019t want to risk tainting the cases that Flynn has helped them build against the biggest fish.\n\nBut as an eagle eyed Rachel Maddow spotted last night, Bijan Kian\u2019s legal filings in this back-and-forth have revealed a transition period meeting that took place between Michael Flynn and the same Russian who also met with Erik Prince during the transition. Why is this a big deal? For starters, assuming this meeting really happened and Kian isn\u2019t simply making it up for some reason, this is new information that the media never did manage to dredge up.\n\nMore importantly, Michael Flynn has already long ago told Robert Mueller everything about everything. Flynn would have given up this meeting to Mueller in December of 2017. That means Mueller has had a year and a half to take Flynn\u2019s testimony, dig into it all, and investigate everyone else who was connected to this Kremlin representative.\n\nMost importantly of all, this is the Russian who met with Erik Prince about allegedly setting up a backchannel between the White House and the Kremlin. So this guy was more important than Sergey Lavrov, Natalia Veselnitskaya, or any of the other Russians who surreptitiously met with Team Trump. This guy is the ballgame \u2013 and now we know that thanks to Flynn, Mueller has apparently had the inside track on him all along."

Now that Trump has finally thrown his full weight into the escalating debacle between Kellyanne Conway and George Conway, a lot of people think he\u2019s doing it again. I\u2019m here to tell you, that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here.\n\nHere\u2019s what Donald Trump tweeted today: \u201cGeorge Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife\u2019s success & angry that I, with her help, didn\u2019t give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!\u201d\n\nWait, are we supposed to believe this is somehow helping Donald Trump? What exactly is this distracting us from? It\u2019s not as if we\u2019ve forgotten that the Mueller report is about to land on his head. And if we do lose track, Felix Sater will be happy to remind us of the real story when he publicly testifies against Trump a week from today.\n\nDonald Trump is lashing out at George Conway for the same reason he\u2019s lashing out at John McCain. Trump is taking on water from all sides, and it\u2019s gotten so bad for him, that even his delusionally broken mind can see that he\u2019s sinking. This is a guy who\u2019s taking out his frustrations in any direction he can, because he\u2019s just that exasperated about his own impending downfall. There\u2019s no strategy here. Not anymore. Trump just knows he\u2019s losing and he doesn\u2019t like it."

He\u2019s also spent the day attacking George Conway, the husband of his senior adviser Kellyanne Conway. So could Trump possibly find a way to humiliate himself even further before the day ended? You already know the answer.\n\nIt started at around 10pm eastern time, when Donald Trump tweeted this quote: \u201cThe reason we have the Special Counsel investigation is that James Comey (a dirty cop) leaked his memos to a friend, who leaked them to the press, on purpose.\u201d There are a couple of problems here. First, none of this is factually correct. Second, the quote came from a woman named Kennedy, who occasionally hosts a show on Fox Business Channel, and previously hosted a show on MTV. That\u2019s right, Trump is now reduced to quoting someone from MTV to try to make his case.\n\nThen Trump tweeted this crediting it to Sean Hannity: \u201cJohn Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.\u201d The trouble here is that no one has any idea what this is even supposed to mean. With each passing day, more evidence emerges that Donald Trump and his campaign criminally conspired with the Russian government to alter the outcome of the 2016 election. And what\u2019s this nonsense about Hillary and Ukraine?\n\nIt\u2019s becoming more clear by the hour that Donald Trump is falling to pieces under the increasing pressure of his worsening criminal scandals. Trump picked a fight with a dead man today, and the dead man won. Then Trump tried to top it by quoting someone from MTV and making things up about Hillary Clinton. This just keeps getting more disturbing."

During his 2016 campaign, he derided Obama\u2019s GDP growth as being anemic and terrible, promising that the growth would exceed 3% a year when he became president. Well, turns out, the \u201cGreatest Negotiator of All Time\u201d (\u201cGNAT\u201d) and the \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d man is not so great after all.\n\nIn late February, the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the 2018 growth was 2.9%, matching Obama\u2019s peak year of 2015. Some economists have predicted that 2.9% will be the peak for Trump in his first term. On Wednesday, the news of a stagnating economy continued. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had promised several rate hikes in 2019, causing him to be in the cross hairs of Trump\u2019s proverbial venom when he did so. On Wednesday, Powell promised there would be no more rate hikes and noted the economic growth rate will be 2.1%. They have reduced the economic growth forecasts through 2021 to less than 2%.\n\nThese grim economic forecasts throw Trump and the GOP\u2019s assertions about how the trillion-dollar tax cut would stimulate the economy onto the trash heap. In addition to the revised forecasts and less than stellar growth predicted, Trump has been feverishly trying to get GM to reverse its decision announced last year to close its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, blaming that on a local union leader.\n\nWhat Donald Trump and his administration fail to understand, apparently, is that his tariff positions have done harm to not only farmers, but to the automobile industry. This comes at the same time that reports from Politico and elsewhere describe an undisclosed report that Trump has that would justify significant tariffs on automobile imports, which would again hit the auto industry hard. Trump once again shows that he and the GOP stomp like elephants but their business approach stings like a GNAT. Winning, Trump style."

The question at the time was how much Gates would be able to give up on Donald Trump. After all, Gates continued to work for the campaign, and then for the transition team, long after Manafort was fired.\n\nRick Gates was one of the many Trump-related people who received document requests from the House Judiciary Committee. Some big names, including Steve Bannon and Hope Hicks, are cooperating. Other people are saying they won\u2019t cooperate, and are willing to roll the subpoena dice instead. But we were all expecting Rick Gates to cooperate, right? After all, Gates is still hoping for a lenient prison sentence, and he needs to be as helpful as possible.\n\nBut this evening we all learned that Rick Gates has informed the House Judiciary Committee that he can\u2019t give them his documents at this time, because prosecutors have advised him not to. The only possible reason for this is that prosecutors are still using Gates\u2019 documents in an ongoing criminal case.\n\nConsidering that just about everyone else involved has either been convicted or pleaded out, it\u2019s clear that the evidence Gates is withholding is against Donald Trump. Gates is saying that he might be able to give Congress his documents in the \u201ccoming months.\u201d This would seem to fall in line with the expectation that Robert Mueller will drop the hammer on Trump before much longer.

Trump was giving a speech in Ohio today when he falsely tried to take credit for McCain\u2019s funeral, and then attacked McCain for what happened after the funeral. No, really, it was that deranged.\n\nDonald Trump said this today of John McCain: \u201cI gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve.\u201d Then he added, \u201cI didn\u2019t get a thank you.\u201d Wait, what in the name of all that is holy? For starters, Trump had nothing to do with McCain\u2019s funeral, which he was in fact banned from attending. Second of all, Trump appears to be attacking McCain for not having come back from the dead to thank him.\n\nIf there\u2019s an upside to this disgusting debacle, it\u2019s that even the Republican cowards in the Senate are finally feeling compelled to begin criticizing Donald Trump for his attacks on John McCain. GOP Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia said today that Trump\u2019s words were \u201cdeplorable.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if Isakson realized the irony in using Hillary Clinton\u2019s word to describe Trump, after the GOP ripped Clinton so thoroughly for having referred to Trump\u2019s base as \u201cdeplorables.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see where this is headed. But if Donald Trump thinks that repeatedly and grotesquely attacking John McCain is somehow going to save his dying presidency, suffice it to say that he\u2019s miscalculating here. Republican Senators have spent the past three years failing to properly defend McCain against Trump\u2019s attacks. But now that Trump is nearing his downfall anyway, if the GOP Senators are looking for an excuse to finish him off, his attacks on McCain are nothing short of the perfect excuse."

Not a good way to get people to work with you. In the case of the GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, Trump has been bullying UAW leader David Green while simultaneously begging CEO Mary Barra to keep the plant open. He attacks the one he sees as the weaker of the two.\n\nNever mind that David Green wrote two letters to Trump last year, seeking his help on the impending closing, to which Trump never responded. One can only wonder where he\u2019s been since GM made the announcement in November 2018. The reason Trump is livid about the Lordstown plant is his (fake) campaign promise to increase manufacturing jobs. He then took office and imposed the very thing that hurts manufacturing: tariffs.\n\nIn all fairness, the Lordstown plant primarily manufactured the Chevrolet Cruze, which was no longer of interest to car buyers, and GM decided to stop production and streamline its facilities to assist with overall profitability. As reported by Vox, part of this plan included closing four U.S. Plants (two in Ohio, one in Michigan, and one in Maryland) and one Canadian plant and cutting its workforce by 15%.\n\nNot only was Trump made aware of this by David Green, GM announced last fall that it was offering voluntary buyouts to 18,000 salaried workers to cut costs and that the \u201ctariffs under the Trump administration could lead to a \u2018smaller\u2019 GM,\u201d Vox reports. Has Trump not been paying attention? Of course he hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s too busy waging war against his perceived enemies. Now, it\u2019s a crisis for him. As a wise man once said, \u201cBe careful where you point your finger; you\u2019re pointing two back at yourself.\u201d Too bad Trump doesn\u2019t know that.\n\nAs Vox points out, Trump\u2019s trade policies didn\u2019t help. His tariffs are getting the better of the very jobs he claimed to protect. Now it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault. To try to save his shrinking base in that area (which has decreased by 19% according to USA Today), he traveled there, as if his presence is going to make a difference. GM isn\u2019t the problem; Trump is.\n\nAs Politico points out, Trump doesn\u2019t understand the global economy any more than he understands the U.S. economy, and the auto industry is very much a global industry. With auto makers building cars in the U.S. using foreign parts, and foreign manufacturers using U.S. parts, they all depend on each other. President Obama understood that nuance, and his policies increased investment, which Trump is single-handedly destroying.\n\nDonald Trump has seemingly never understood that tariffs are in essence an additional tax on U.S. citizens. Read a detailed analysis of tariffs by the Tax Foundation here. One can only assume that in addition to closing plants, he hasn\u2019t noticed all of the retail businesses that are closing and leaving untold numbers of people unemployed. Yep. Trump is \u201cmaking America great again\u201d one bankruptcy or closing at a time. And the auto manufacturers are still moving operations to Mexico. Thanks, \u201cPresident\u201d Trump."

This was a big deal, both because it was the only known immunity deal that Mueller had handed out to anyone, and because Nader appeared to be in prime position to steer Mueller toward bigger Trump-Russia fish. Now that deal is reportedly toast.\n\nIt\u2019s long been reported that George Nader helped set up (and attended) the infamous transition period Seychelles meeting between Erik Prince and Kremlin higher-up Kirill Dmitriev. That meeting was allegedly an attempt at establishing a backchannel between the Donald Trump regime and the Vladimir Putin regime. Nader\u2019s cooperation was extensive enough that he even testified before a Trump-Russia grand jury last year. It seemed like Nader was going to be Mueller\u2019s guy all the way.\n\nBut now George Nader is reportedly no longer cooperating with Robert Mueller, according to Laura Rozen of Middle Eastern news publication Al-Monitor. No one involved is willing to comment on why this has happened, or even confirm or deny that it\u2019s happened. But it\u2019s intriguing, because it points to just how much things have changed in the investigation over the past year. In fact it ties into something new we just learned yesterday.\n\nThanks to a court filing by Michael Flynn\u2019s former business partner Bijan Kian yesterday, we learned that during the transition period, Flynn also met with Kirill Dmitriev. This means Mueller got the lowdown on Dmitriev when Flynn cut his deal in November of 2017, before he gave immunity to Nader with regard to the Prince meeting with Dmitriev. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know here, but if Nader\u2019s original cooperation deal was a big story, then the demise of that deal is an even bigger story."

But what Donald Trump just said about John McCain makes me want to vomit.\n\nDonald Trump said today that he was the one who threw John McCain a big funeral, and he\u2019s upset that McCain didn\u2019t bother to thank him for it. If Trump is referring to McCain\u2019s body having honored in the Capitol, that was a decision made by Congress, not by Trump. And for the record, McCain earned it, after he spent six years rotting in a Vietnamese prison while serving his country. This was the same war which saw Trump faking a foot problem in order to dodge the draft on five separate occasions.\n\nTrump keeps saying that he doesn\u2019t respect John McCain because McCain cast the deciding vote against repealing Obamacare. But the reality is that McCain said all along that he would only vote for \u201crepeal and replace\u201d if it included a replacement that was better than Obamacare. When Trump and the GOP ended up proposing a \u201creplacement\u201d that didn\u2019t exist, McCain stuck to his promise, and he voted it down. John McCain is the reason that tens of millions of Americans, including me, still have access to legitimate health insurance that covers preexisting conditions.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s explanation is a bunch of crap, as he was attacking John McCain\u2019s war hero status as far back as 2015, long before the fateful Obamacare vote. Not only are Trump\u2019s attacks on McCain disingenuous and offensive, Trump is lying about the reason he\u2019s attacking McCain.

Everyone describes Mueller as careful and methodical, and today\u2019s release gives us a glimpse into what that means when it is put into action.\n\nWe learned that Mueller and his SDNY allies were investigating Michael Cohen in earnest for a year before the raid of his offices, and they built a justification for one warrant, then he sifted through the information gathered, then built a justification for the next warrant. This is a fine example of the careful, patient and thorough investigative work that Mueller is known to produce. The first warrant was issued in July of 2017 for one gmail account. Then a second was issued in August for an iCloud account. Then later, a warrant was issued for a second Gmail account.\n\nThis gives a glimpse into just how much information Mueller and his allies have on each and every subject and target in the investigation. They had full access to two years of Cohen\u2019s emails, and a list of all the people Cohen called, or who called him, and when, and the length of the calls. They clearly know so much more than has been made public about each and every subject and target.\n\nThis brings us to the next and most interesting thing we learned: there is still a lot of information that Mueller and his allies are keeping redacted. Information regarding payments to Stormy Daniels and campaign finance payments is almost completely redacted. That is surprising because so much information about this subject is already public. What is left to redact?\n\nRedactions are made to protect people who are named, but will not be indicted, from unfair or misleading public scrutiny. They\u2019re also made to protect an ongoing investigation, in order to keep potential subjects and targets from learning about investigative information and techniques. In this case, the judge said the redactions were justified for the latter reason.\n\nThat means there is more to the story than has already been made public, and there are additional subjects and targets involved. Also telling was the unredacted title of the section that is redacted: \u201cThe illegal campaign contribution scheme.\u201d This title confirms that the prosecutors could seek charges for illegal campaign contributions, as well as conspiracy to commit campaign finance violations, against multiple people. More than anything else, the warrant information tells us there is much more to come."

Now we\u2019re getting names, including a big one.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks is turning over Trump-related documents to the House Judiciary Committee, according to a new report this evening from CNN. Why does this matter? First, Hicks is selling Trump out by complying with the document request, as opposed to trying to stand her ground and fight what would have been an inevitable subpoena. But there\u2019s more to it than that.\n\nSecond, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler has already publicly made clear that this initial round of document requests is only seeking the same documents that Robert Mueller other investigators have already requested. Hope Hicks decision to turn over documents to the committee tells us that Mueller has already asked her for the same documents, and that she\u2019s already complied with that request. She wouldn\u2019t give these documents to Congress if she refused to give them to Mueller, because Congress would just give them to Mueller anyway.\n\nSo now we know that Hope Hicks has sold out Donald Trump to the House Democrats and to Robert Mueller.

Nadler confirmed earlier this week that Steve Bannon gave thousands of documents to the committee, which means he must have previously given thousands of documents to Mueller as well.

Back in the real world, Trump\u2019s latest pipe dream just got shattered.\n\nTrump told reporters today that he thinks the public should get to see Robert Mueller\u2019s full report. But along the way, Trump slipped in one rather absurd detail: he should get to see the report before Congress does. We all know why. Trump is hoping to find a way to prevent Congress from seeing the ugliest parts of the report, or at least get the opportunity to lie about these things before Congress can reveal it all to the public.\n\nBut nothing works that way, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler just reminded everyone of as much. He tweeted \u201cThe law here is very clear. When he finishes his work, Special Counsel Mueller is required to report to the Attorney General, who is required to report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Attorney General William Barr would be committing a crime by letting Donald Trump see the Mueller report before he gives it to Congress. Trump would run his big mouth about it, Barr would get caught in the act, and he\u2019d end up in prison. We don\u2019t think Barr is that reckless or stupid \u2013 and Nadler just reminded Barr that he would face consequences if he were tempted to do something that stupid."

    "text": "Have you ever daydreamed about Donald Trump being hauled out of the White House in handcuffs as a stoic Robert Mueller looks on? If you have, you\u2019re not alone. But if you spend any time thinking the final endgame scenario through, you quickly realize it\u2019s not so simple.\n\nLet\u2019s assume for a moment that Robert Mueller and the Attorney General (or the SDNY) decide to indict Donald Trump while he is in office. How do they issue that indictment? Is Trump a flight risk? Most likely he is not. Therefore, his lawyer would be served and he would be given some number of hours to turn himself in for processing.\n\nWhat will he do? What if he announces a pardon for himself? That would place a burden back onto the DOJ to fight the pardon in court, and he would most likely avoid immediate arrest. Would he start firing nearly everyone inside the DOJ? He could.\n\nWould the Republicans in Congress decide they don\u2019t want to go down with him, and move to quickly impeach him before he can wreak further havoc on our institutions and/or rally his supporters to armed protests? Do you really think Trump will accept an indictment quietly, or is he more likely to fire as many people as he can in the DOJ, issue pardons to himself and his family, and rally his supporters into a frenzy?\n\nEven if Donald Trump is indicted, he would still most likely be the President of the United States until there are enough votes to oust him. I bet these conversations have happened and are happening right now inside the DOJ. Given how messy this \u201cend-game\u201d is likely to get, it makes some sense that the final act against the President of the United States must be robust and well planned. This is not going to be clean and simple."

At some point twenty Republican Senators will selfishly decide that their own odds of reelection are better if they kick Trump out, and that\u2019ll be the end of him.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Senate Republicans have been increasingly voting against Donald Trump on legislation he cares about, in the clearest sign yet that they think he\u2019s going down, and that they\u2019re trying to avoid going down with him. Perhaps in retaliation, Trump has decided that his number one goal in life is to attack John McCain as often and as offensively as possible. This is finally resulting in GOP Senators pushing back, or at least one of them in particular.\n\nRepublican Senator Johnny Isakson said last year that if anyone attacked John McCain, they deserved a \u201cwhipping\u201d for it. Sure enough, after Donald Trump spent the past few days attacking McCain, Isakson said today that \u201cI want to do what I said that day on the floor of the Senate.\u201d In other words, he wants to deliver a \u201cwhipping\u201d against Trump. We\u2019re assuming he means the metaphorical kind, and that he\u2019s not actually talking about physically beating Trump up, but this is nonetheless quickly dissolving into a food fight.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what happens next. Donald Trump will surely hear about Isakson\u2019s remarks and fire back on Twitter, which will only serve to give more exposure to what Isakson said about Trump. Interestingly, it appears that Isakson made his remarks today before he was aware that Trump had just unleashed on McCain yet again, this time criticizing McCain for not having come back from the dead to thank Trump for throwing him a big funeral. This will only get uglier for Trump an the GOP."

Thumbs up. Elevating Sarah Palin and her whack job followers? Thumbs down. No one in politics should be immune from criticism, simply because they did something great in another walk of life. But what Donald Trump just said about John McCain makes me want to vomit.\n\nDonald Trump said today that he was the one who threw John McCain a big funeral, and he\u2019s upset that McCain didn\u2019t bother to thank him for it. If Trump is referring to McCain\u2019s body having honored in the Capitol, that was a decision made by Congress, not by Trump. And for the record, McCain earned it, after he spent six years rotting in a Vietnamese prison while serving his country. This was the same war which saw Trump faking a foot problem in order to dodge the draft on five separate occasions.\n\nTrump keeps saying that he doesn\u2019t respect John McCain because McCain cast the deciding vote against repealing Obamacare. But the reality is that McCain said all along that he would only vote for \u201crepeal and replace\u201d if it included a replacement that was better than Obamacare. When Trump and the GOP ended up proposing a \u201creplacement\u201d that didn\u2019t exist, McCain stuck to his promise, and he voted it down. John McCain is the reason that tens of millions of Americans, including me, still have access to legitimate health insurance that covers preexisting conditions.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s explanation is a bunch of crap, as he was attacking John McCain\u2019s war hero status as far back as 2015, long before the fateful Obamacare vote. Not only are Trump\u2019s attacks on McCain disingenuous and offensive, Trump is lying about the reason he\u2019s attacking McCain. You just can\u2019t get any lower than this \u2013 though Trump will surely find a way to do just that."

Nevertheless, a thin majority (51%) responded he will run again and lose in 2020 \u2013 and a further 8% thinks he will lose and have to be deposed, with 23% believing he will win reelection. The remaining replies ranged from \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d all the way to impeachment to \u201che will become dictator for life.\u201d\n\nWhat struck me about all this is, based on the opinions of people in a distinctly anti-Trump city, how easy it is to believe that Donald Trump has a Vegas chance to survive this current crisis. Most particularly, in a post-Fairness Doctrine, Post-Truth era, the \u201cman on the street\u201d thinks that a proven arch criminal, traitor, sexual predator and liar has a decent shot at a second term.\n\nWelcome to a world where it is possible to believe that the Apollo mission to the moon was a hoax, where global warming is a business dirty trick of Chinese export, where the 911 attacks were engineered by the Bush administration and UFOs travel trillions of kilometers for the sole purpose of making lovely designs in our crops.

To support this extraordinary claim I turn to no less a person than Sir Isaac Newton, who said in his Third Law of Motion: \u201cFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\u201d\n\nIf anything has been a constant in American national politics, it has been the routine left to right and back again swing of the pendulum of the political spectrum.

Now it turns out they were indeed fibbing the numbers \u2013 and we suspect we know why.\n\nThis evening Rachel Maddow revealed during her MSNBC show that the number of people who met the deadline is actually much higher. While eight people submitted their documents electronically, an unstated number of additional people sent paper documents to the House, which take longer to process. The Republicans on the committee know full well how this kind of thing works. So why would they pretend the number is so much lower than it is?\n\nThe thing about a massive document request operation is that while some people will definitely cooperate and others will never voluntarily cooperate, there are those on the fence who will be looking around to see what everyone else does. Let\u2019s say that you and another person on the document request list had a crucial email exchange. If the other person is cooperating, that means the committee already has those emails, so there\u2019s no reason for you to risk being held in contempt of Congress just to avoid having to turn those emails in.\n\nIf you\u2019re tempted to fight the document request, and you find out that only a small handful of the other people on the list have cooperated, you\u2019re going to feel more confident about standing your ground. This is surely why Donald Trump\u2019s Republican allies tried to create the false appearance today that almost no one was cooperating. Now we wait for the real number. Once that surfaces, we expect to see more people give in and cooperate."

I\u2019m here to tell you, that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here.\n\nHere\u2019s what Donald Trump tweeted today: \u201cGeorge Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife\u2019s success & angry that I, with her help, didn\u2019t give him the job he so desperately wanted.

    "text": "Donald Trump is continuing to get hammered in court. Last week ended with a trio of legal setbacks for Trump in New York that would take over the news cycle in any normal presidency. With Trump, these developments are just raindrops in a growing thunderstorm of bad news.\n\nOn Thursday, a New York appeals court gave Summer Zervos the green light to proceed with her defamation lawsuit against Trump. A former contestant on The Apprentice, Zervos claimed that Trump groped and kissed her without her consent. Trump denied the allegations, calling them \u201c100% false\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d Zervos then sued Trump under New York law for defamation, claiming that he damaged her reputation by falsely painting her as a liar.\n\nTrump loves to trample on the Constitution except when he thinks it might protect him. In this instance, Trump tried to hide behind the Constitution\u2019s supremacy clause, which prevents states from interfering with the federal government\u2019s powers. His lawyers argued that the Constitution bars Zervos from bringing the claim because he is the President of the United States. But the court agreed with Zervos, ruling 3-2 that even presidents are not immune from state level defamation lawsuits.\n\nAlso on Thursday, New York Attorney General Letitia James made a new filing in the state\u2019s lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Her office already succeeded in getting a court-supervised takedown of the Foundation in December. But now she is asking a judge to order Trump to pay a $5.6 million penalty and $2.8 million in restitution, and to ban Trump, Don Jr., Ivanka, and Eric from running any New York charity for the next decade. The filing reveals that James is armed with a wealth of \u201cuncontroverted evidence\u201d establishing that Trump \u201cused Foundation funds to, among other things, pay for portraits of himself; make political donations, pay for advertising for Trump hotels, settle lawsuits involving the Trump Organization, and to improperly intervene in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nFinally, on Friday, a federal judge in New York ruled against the Trump administration in a class-action lawsuit on immigration. Under federal law, migrants who prove they were \u201cabused, abandoned, or neglected\u201d by their parents are entitled to a pathway to lawful permanent residence. But in a blow to Trump\u2019s hardline immigration aspirations, a judge ruled that the Trump administration wildly misconstrued the law and illegally denied this special status to thousands of qualified people.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s new legal setbacks were no doubt one ingredient in the stew that led to his Twitter hysteria over the weekend. Trump attacked the late Senator John McCain, threatened Saturday Night Live with a federal investigation after it aired a rerun, and barked orders at Fox News. This all reflects Trump\u2019s growing desperation, as the \u201cpresident\u201d who is obsessed with winning continues losing bigly."

Trump was giving a speech in Ohio today when he falsely tried to take credit for McCain\u2019s funeral, and then attacked McCain for what happened after the funeral. No, really, it was that deranged.\n\nDonald Trump said this today of John McCain: \u201cI gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve.\u201d Then he added, \u201cI didn\u2019t get a thank you.\u201d Wait, what in the name of all that is holy? For starters, Trump had nothing to do with McCain\u2019s funeral, which he was in fact banned from attending. Second of all, Trump appears to be attacking McCain for not having come back from the dead to thank him.\n\nIf there\u2019s an upside to this disgusting debacle, it\u2019s that even the Republican cowards in the Senate are finally feeling compelled to begin criticizing Donald Trump for his attacks on John McCain. GOP Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia said today that Trump\u2019s words were \u201cdeplorable.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if Isakson realized the irony in using Hillary Clinton\u2019s word to describe Trump, after the GOP ripped Clinton so thoroughly for having referred to Trump\u2019s base as \u201cdeplorables.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see where this is headed. But if Donald Trump thinks that repeatedly and grotesquely attacking John McCain is somehow going to save his dying presidency, suffice it to say that he\u2019s miscalculating here. Republican Senators have spent the past three years failing to properly defend McCain against Trump\u2019s attacks. But now that Trump is nearing his downfall anyway, if the GOP Senators are looking for an excuse to finish him off, his attacks on McCain are nothing short of the perfect excuse."

This included $2.8 million in restitution and another $5.6 million in penalties. At the time, Palmer Report pointed out that because Trump runs a debt-based cash-poor business model, he might have to sell off assets just to pay the fines \u2013 particularly if they kept piling up. It turns out we may or may not have been onto something.\n\nToday it\u2019s being reported that Donald Trump sold one of his New York City condos back on March 8th. Forbes is hitting on two key suspicious points. First, the buyer appears to have used a series of shell corporations to try to hide his or her real identity. Second, the buyer appears to have paid Trump far more than market value. These are both matters of concern. But what caught our eye is the specific dollar amount: $2.9 million. Sound familiar?\n\nThat\u2019s right. Just one week before it was announced that Donald Trump was getting hit with a $2.8 million fine, he sold off a property for $2.9 million, which was conveniently just enough to cover the cost of the fine. Is this merely an interesting coincidence, or is Trump indeed selling off assets in order to get enough cash to pay his fines?\n\nTrump was also hit with the separate $5.6 million fine, in addition to the $2.8 million fine. But he sold the property before the fines were publicly announced. It\u2019s possible he knew the $2.8 million restitution charge was coming, and he wanted to generate enough cash to cover it, but he didn\u2019t know the extra $5.6 million charge was coming.\n\nOf course Donald Trump will likely try to fight these fines in court. But if the courts rule against him, and he doesn\u2019t have the cash on hand to pay the fines, New York State could decide to seize some of his assets in order to make up for it. So yeah, Trump could be trying to get out ahead of this. Or it could simply be a coincidence that he found some shady buyer to pay him an overinflated $2.9 million, just as he was finding himself on the hook for $2.8 million."

Various parts of the document seem to spell out bad news for Donald Trump. But one part in particular should truly scare him.\n\nIt\u2019s not the revelation that Robert Mueller appears to have been investigating everyone in Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle a year before the Michael Cohen raid, though that\u2019s pretty ugly. It\u2019s not even that during the election, foreign money was paid into the hush money account that Trump and Cohen were using to pay off Trump\u2019s mistresses, though that\u2019s really ugly. Instead, it\u2019s a different stretch of the documentation entirely.\n\nCNBC pointed out that when it comes to the documents that were used to obtain the search warrant, it\u2019s a big deal that nineteen pages are blacked out. We agree that it\u2019s a big deal, and not simply due to the generic fear of the unknown. These pages are blacked out because they relate to an ongoing SDNY criminal investigation, a year after the Cohen raid, and several months after the case against Cohen was fully put to bed.\n\nMulti-tier criminal investigations like this tend to only progress sideways and/or upward. So those nineteen blacked out pages are almost certainly evidence against a fish who is equal to, or bigger than, Michael Cohen. Some of it could theoretically be about the likes of Elliott Broidy, as we just learned this week that his office was raided a couple months after the Cohen raid. But really, the blacked out parts are most likely about Donald Trump \u2013 and that would mean that the SDNY is building a massive criminal case against him."

One particular revelation, first reported by CNN, has received very little media coverage. But it is a story that is too important to miss because of what it reveals about the president and the prosecutors investigating him. It shows that one side is intelligent, shrewd, and determined, while the other side is an egotistical oaf who just got trampled on by his own two feet. Before you read any further, you can try to guess which side is which.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, SDNY prosecutors obtained a search warrant to access the contents of Michael Cohen\u2019s Gmail account. Google refused to comply fully with the warrant, pointing out that the law did not require the company to hand over data that was stored on overseas servers. That would have been the end of the story. Instead, a few weeks later, Trump inadvertently gave prosecutors an incredibly thoughtful gift.\n\nOn March 23, 2018, Trump signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill to prevent a government shutdown. The bill included a controversial law known as the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act, which gives law enforcement the authority to secure digital information even if it is stored outside the United States. Trump got what he wanted despite pushback from privacy advocates concerned that the law could lead to unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution.\n\nThe SDNY then returned to court in April with new legal ammunition, citing the law that Donald Trump had just signed. A judge granted a new warrant, which meant that SDNY prosecutors got what they wanted: full access to Trump\u2019s fixer\u2019s email account, including attachments, address book entries and more. Some of that seized Cohen evidence surely incriminates Trump \u2013 and they have Trump to thank."

Everyone describes Mueller as careful and methodical, and today\u2019s release gives us a glimpse into what that means when it is put into action.\n\nWe learned that Mueller and his SDNY allies were investigating Michael Cohen in earnest for a year before the raid of his offices, and they built a justification for one warrant, then he sifted through the information gathered, then built a justification for the next warrant. This is a fine example of the careful, patient and thorough investigative work that Mueller is known to produce. The first warrant was issued in July of 2017 for one gmail account. Then a second was issued in August for an iCloud account. Then later, a warrant was issued for a second Gmail account.\n\nThis gives a glimpse into just how much information Mueller and his allies have on each and every subject and target in the investigation. They had full access to two years of Cohen\u2019s emails, and a list of all the people Cohen called, or who called him, and when, and the length of the calls. They clearly know so much more than has been made public about each and every subject and target.\n\nThis brings us to the next and most interesting thing we learned: there is still a lot of information that Mueller and his allies are keeping redacted. Information regarding payments to Stormy Daniels and campaign finance payments is almost completely redacted. That is surprising because so much information about this subject is already public. What is left to redact?\n\nRedactions are made to protect people who are named, but will not be indicted, from unfair or misleading public scrutiny. They\u2019re also made to protect an ongoing investigation, in order to keep potential subjects and targets from learning about investigative information and techniques. In this case, the judge said the redactions were justified for the latter reason.\n\nThat means there is more to the story than has already been made public, and there are additional subjects and targets involved. Also telling was the unredacted title of the section that is redacted: \u201cThe illegal campaign contribution scheme.\u201d This title confirms that the prosecutors could seek charges for illegal campaign contributions, as well as conspiracy to commit campaign finance violations, against multiple people. More than anything else, the warrant information tells us there is much more to come."

    "text": "When it comes to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s upcoming report about Donald Trump\u2019s crimes, the big questions are when it will arrive and what it will reveal. The bigger question is whether it\u2019ll be enough to finish Trump off. Now we have a hint about that, from one of the few people who knows just how ugly the report will be, because he\u2019s the one who committed the crimes that the report will expose.\n\nThat\u2019s right, Donald Trump took some time away from his increasingly deranged rants about John McCain and George Conway so he could address the upcoming Mueller report. Here\u2019s what he said to reporters today: \u201cIt\u2019s sort of interesting that a man, out of the blue, just writes a report \u2026 I got 63 million more, 63 million votes. And now somebody just writes a report? I think it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Okay, wait a minute, because there are two things going on here.\n\nFirst there is Trump\u2019s obvious and ongoing desperation to convince himself that he won the 2016 election in dominant fashion. Was he really about to falsely claim that he got 63 million more votes than Hillary Clinton, before thinking better of it? In any case, each time Trump references his vote totals, he reminds everyone that Hillary got three million more votes than he did. But that\u2019s not the important part here.\n\nDonald Trump is pretty clearly saying he thinks it\u2019s unfair that, after he was voted into office, \u201csomebody just writes a report\u201d and cancels that out. He\u2019s basically admitting that he knows the Mueller report is going to take down his presidency. For all his constant lying, sometimes Trump\u2019s rare moments of accidental truth can tell us a lot."

    "text": "Preet Bharara is the former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. He was abruptly fired by Donald Trump, after he refused to take a personal call from the President he felt was inappropriate, considering his office was investigating Trump. Bharara appeared on Morning Joe this morning, and he discussed Geoffrey Berman, his replacement as the US Attorney for the SDNY. Berman was hand-picked by Donald Trump to lead the SDNY. Berman was a law partner of Rudy Giuliani, who is famously part of Donald Trump\u2019s legal defense team.\n\nBharara discussed how aggressively the SDNY has pursued investigations against Donald Trump, despite Trump having fired Bharara and hand-picked his replacement. Bharara described the pressure his replacement is under to do the right thing, and he later likened Berman\u2019s situation to that of Attorney General William Barr.\n\nBharara stated that the SDNY, like the Department of Justice, is filled with dedicated, professional prosecutors, totally committed to the rule of law. If Berman interfered with any rightful attempt to investigate and prosecute crimes, the law enforcement community and the public would know about it within days, and Berman\u2019s professional reputation would suffer irreparable harm. While a lawyer such as Berman might initially come into the SDNY with the intent of interfering in an ongoing investigation, once inside the organization, Berman would be hit with the realization that dozens of lawyers and reporters are actively watching him, and looking for any sign of interference. Berman, quickly and wisely, recused himself on all matters related to Donald Trump.\n\nThe pressure that Berman faces in the SDNY is less than the pressure on Donald Trump\u2019s hand-picked Attorney General, William Barr. His decisions and actions will be recorded in history books and he surely knows it. While he declined to recuse himself, which probably would have gotten him fired on the spot, there are clearly signs that Barr, like Berman, is not willing to be seen as a puppet for Donald Trump.\n\nThe latest sign is today\u2019s announcement of the continued employment of Rod Rosenstein as the Deputy Attorney General. Barr declared under oath during his confirmation hearings, that he spoke with Rosenstein and expected him to depart DOJ after a transition period, which was expected to be mid-March. Today, it was announced that Rosenstein would stay on \u201clonger.\u201d This will not make Donald Trump happy at all.\n\nRosenstein retained control of the day-to-day management of the Mueller investigation throughout Jeff Sessions\u2019 tenure as Attorney General, throughout Matt Whittaker\u2019s tenure as Acting AG, and now through William Barr\u2019s tenure as Attorney General. It would be highly unusual, and would attract attention, for the Attorney General to interfere and be involved in the day-to-day management of the Mueller investigation. Instead, the normal way for Barr to impact the day-to-day management of the Mueller investigation would be for him to replace Rod Rosenstein with his own hand-picked Deputy Attorney General.\n\nAllowing Rod Rosenstein to continue in his position, and continue to oversee the management of the Mueller investigation for an undetermined amount of time, is a big deal. It is another indication that William Barr is unwilling to directly interfere with the Mueller investigation."

For a team that cries \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201clying media,\u201d it should check its own work product. In what can only be described as perhaps an early April Fools joke, or perhaps someone seeing if they could slide one past Donald Trump, the Economic Report of the President from March 2019 lists alongside some real-life interns some fictional characters. The list in the Report is:\n\nInterns Student interns provide invaluable help with research projects, day-to-day operations, and fact-checking. Interns during the previous year were Brittany Amano, Jackson Bailey, Rana Bansal, Christian Brown, Lydia Byrom, John Cleese, Alexis Cirrotti, Jesse Dennis, Mackenzie Dickhudt, Adam Donoho, Troy Durie, Michael Everett, Isabelle Holland, Wesley Huang, J. T.

Same for Bruce Wayne (Batman), Peter Parker (Spiderman), John (sic) Snow (Game of Thrones), and J.T. Hutt (Jabba the Hut from Star Wars). Martha Gimbel took a screenshot and posted it on Twitter so when it is corrected, it will remain for posterity.\n\nBut this is not the only area where the Trump administration is not doing a great job of accuracy or quality control. For example, according to a Washington Post report, Trump is winning only 6 percent of federal lawsuits trying to implement his policies, well below the normal win percentage in these kinds of suits, which is around 70 percent.\n\nDonald Trump likes to talk about how unprecedented his first two years have been. Once again, like a clock right twice a day, he is right \u2013 the work product is sloppy on a level not seen before. Maybe he needs superheroes Spell Checker Super Lawyer to help him out."

    "text": "Polls. Sometimes we love them, and sometimes we don\u2019t. How do we know when they are accurate? Sometimes we don\u2019t. A valid poll can display feelings on issues. However, if the poll is biased or the questions unclear, results don\u2019t always speak the truth.\n\nThis week, USA Today published an article entitled \u201cPoll: Half of Americans say Trump is victim of a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 as trust in Mueller erodes.\u201d As you might expect, \u201cPresident\u201d Donald Trump immediately tweeted in support of this headline, without reading the full article. If you take this headline at face value without reading the article and conducting further research, you might think that confidence in Mueller has dropped significantly since the December NPR/PBS NewHouse/Marist poll that found only 33% of Americans viewed Mueller\u2019s investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nAs reported by Vox, the Suffolk/USA Today poll question which generated the headline is \u201cseriously flawed.\u201d What does that mean? The question was a two-part question, which can result in skewed numbers from lack of clarity. The question asked: \u201cPresident Trump has called the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 and said he\u2019s been subjected to more investigations than previous presidents because of politics. Do you agree?\u201d\n\nSome may agree with the first part of the question but not the second or vice versa. The two parts are not necessarily related to or dependent upon each other, and different answers could be given for each. In today\u2019s fast-paced world, most of us \u201cskim\u201d materials to save time and could have easily missed one part of this question. As Vox points out, this is poor polling strategy.\n\nThough neither Vox nor I have proof of any of this, the compound question invariably sets itself up for failure, especially viewed in light of similar but well-constructed poll questions. Vox points to a Washington Post / Schar School poll conducted last month, which indicated that 56% of those polled find Mueller more credible than Trump, and the Hill.TV / American Barometer poll found 58% who believe Mueller\u2019s investigation is \u201cunbiased.\u201d Vox has this right. When presented with one clear question, people participating in polls gave very different responses.\n\nVox does mention other results of the Suffolk/USA poll that are based on more clearly written questions and tend to support the belief that the earlier-mentioned results were skewed, giving Trump some bad news in the process: 62% of respondents are against introducing impeachment proceedings at the present time while also supporting the aggressive investigation techniques being used by Democrats. Nancy Pelosi is right to play down impeachment\u2014for now. Her decision is in line with the American public\u2019s view. Of course, Trump chose to ignore the worst news for him from this poll: 52% have \u201c\u2019little or no trust\u2019\u201d in his denial of collusion. We can\u2019t always take poll results at face value and certainly not by a headline, which could also be erroneously constructed.\n\nWisely take poll data with the proverbial grain of salt. Many contingencies come into play that can easily skew a poll in the direction intended by the polltaker or framer. Of course, Donald Trump sees anything that appears to support him as good, without bothering to look further. The headline plays to his base, and that\u2019s what he wants."

    "text": "Michael Flynn has been so valuable as a cooperating witness, Special Counsel Robert Mueller ended up recommending essentially no prison time for Flynn, despite his serious crimes against the United States. This has long made clear that Flynn gave up the biggest of fish in the Trump-Russia scandal. We just don\u2019t know any of the details of that, because Mueller is still blacking all of it out in Flynn\u2019s court filings. But one key detail just slipped through.\n\nMichael Flynn\u2019s former business partner Bijan Kian is set to go on trial, and Flynn is a key witness against him. Kian\u2019s defense strategy will naturally consist of trying to discredit Flynn, and to that end, he\u2019s asking prosecutors for the details of Flynn\u2019s various crimes. Prosecutors are fighting against this for the same reason they\u2019ve been redacting everything in their publicly available filings; they don\u2019t want to risk tainting the cases that Flynn has helped them build against the biggest fish.\n\nBut as an eagle eyed Rachel Maddow spotted last night, Bijan Kian\u2019s legal filings in this back-and-forth have revealed a transition period meeting that took place between Michael Flynn and the same Russian who also met with Erik Prince during the transition. Why is this a big deal? For starters, assuming this meeting really happened and Kian isn\u2019t simply making it up for some reason, this is new information that the media never did manage to dredge up.\n\nMore importantly, Michael Flynn has already long ago told Robert Mueller everything about everything. Flynn would have given up this meeting to Mueller in December of 2017. That means Mueller has had a year and a half to take Flynn\u2019s testimony, dig into it all, and investigate everyone else who was connected to this Kremlin representative.\n\nMost importantly of all, this is the Russian who met with Erik Prince about allegedly setting up a backchannel between the White House and the Kremlin. So this guy was more important than Sergey Lavrov, Natalia Veselnitskaya, or any of the other Russians who surreptitiously met with Team Trump. This guy is the ballgame \u2013 and now we know that thanks to Flynn, Mueller has apparently had the inside track on him all along."

Other times he\u2019ll seemingly leave a few words strategically un-redacted, as if he were dropping a clue. This time around, Mueller is raising eyebrows with a certain number he just invoked: eleven.\n\nRobert Mueller just asked a judge for an oddly specific eleven day extension on a filing deadline. The filing in question involves a newspaper\u2019s request to unseal certain documents. It\u2019s the kind of thing that Mueller probably doesn\u2019t consider a priority, even if the media does. But we\u2019re not aware of him having previously tried to blow off these kinds of matters. More importantly, who asks for eleven days? And why is his new target April Fools Day?\n\nSome observers are asking if this is a sign that Robert Mueller\u2019s team is shorthanded, which is possible. Andrew Weissmann is reportedly leaving the team. But it could just as easily be a sign that Mueller has something big coming up between now and April 1st, and it\u2019s either getting in the way of being able to deal with something like this filing, or the filing itself would reveal something that shouldn\u2019t be out there before April 1st.\n\nFeel free to make whatever you want of this. But the reality is that Special Counsel Robert Mueller just asked for an eleven day extension so he could make a filing on April Fools Day, and if that doesn\u2019t sum up just how surreal this has all become, nothing does."

    "text": "Earlier this week, Palmer Report explained that it\u2019s far too early to size up the 2020 Democratic presidential primary field simply by looking at any one factor. Polls are still more about leftover name recognition from past elections than about current preferences. Fundraising numbers are also only one factor. Now we\u2019re seeing startling new numbers from Kamala Harris and Beto O\u2019Rourke, each of a different kind, and it\u2019s important to put them in context.\n\nTwo new major polls have been released this week. The new Morning Consult poll shows little to no movement for any candidate, in comparison to the last time it was conducted a week ago. But the new CNN poll tells a different story. It has Joe Biden in first place at 28% and Bernie Sanders in second place at 20%, which as we\u2019ve explained, is mostly a function of the time they\u2019ve spent on the national political stage prior to this race. The real story here is that Kamala Harris has spiked to third place with 12%, while Beto O\u2019Rourke is in fourth place with 11%.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s recent Texas Senate race garnered consistent nationwide coverage, so he has more built-in national name recognition than Harris does. So the fact that she\u2019s climbed ahead of him in the CNN poll is a big deal. In fact, when you consider that Biden and Bernie both have fairly low polling numbers for already being such household names, Kamala\u2019s numbers make a strong argument that she\u2019s the de facto frontrunner. That said, because Beto just now entered the race, we\u2019ll want to see if he gets a bump in the polls next week from his launch.\n\nThe other startling news is that Beto O\u2019Rourke managed to raise slightly more money in the first 24 hours of his campaign than Bernie Sanders raised in his first 24 hours. Again, Bernie is the more established name, so it\u2019s a really big deal that Beto managed to out-fundraise him.\n\nThe poll numbers are telling us that Kamala Harris has the momentum, while the fundraising numbers tell us that Beto O\u2019Rourke has the momentum. This early in the race, particularly in a field this large, positive news about a candidate tends to snowball in terms of positive coverage and attention. So we consider momentum to be the biggest overall factor in ranking the field. Kamala and Beto had a good week. We\u2019ll see what happens next week in this crowded race."

After all, would you be eager to turn over evidence that could incriminate yourself or your allies? Now we\u2019re getting numbers, and it\u2019s eye popping.\n\nLast night House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced on MSNBC that Steve Bannon had helpfully turned over several thousand Trump-related documents. Now the Republicans on the committee are claiming that just eight document request targets, out of eighty-one in total, have complied. Based on their track record we\u2019re not inclined to take the Republicans on this committee at their word. But Politico has pieced together what it believes are the identities of the eight people; the ones you\u2019ve heard of are Bannon, Tom Barrack, the NRA, George Papadopoulos, and Sam Nunberg. Of course the real story here is what happens to the people who didn\u2019t comply.\n\nSeventy-three Trump related people and entities are about to get forcibly subpoenaed to turn over the documents in question. Some of them will try to fight it by employing various legal tactics. But the bottom line is that the House Judiciary Committee is going to win most or all of these fights. The committee can also take its fight to the court of public opinion by publicly revealing precisely why it\u2019s asking these specific people for these specific documents.\n\nAt least some of these seventy-three people have another problem on their hands. For example, let\u2019s say that you worked for the Trump campaign while it was being run by Steve Bannon. Even if you refuse to turn over the documents you have, for all you know, Bannon may have already turned over his own copies of those same documents. So you may be holding out and fighting a losing legal battle for nothing. We expect to see some additional folks cave and cooperate in the coming days, for just this reason."

It should raise alarms in all of us, that the current occupant of the White House will get grand ideas from his puppet master, Vladimir Putin. Cohen tweeted: \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin has signed two new laws that impose strict prohibitions on Internet activities and speech. They allow Russian authorities to jail or fine people who spread \u2018fake news\u2019 or if they \u2018disrespect\u2019 government officials online.\u201d\n\nAnyone who reads Palmer Report knows that Trump has repeatedly attacked the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and disrespectful and, in a tweet binge perhaps influenced by other kinds of binging, Trump tweeted an astounding twenty-eight times on Sunday. This included stating that Saturday Night Live should be investigated by both the Federal Election Commission and the Federal Trade Commission for collusion with Russia and Democrats and for disrespecting Trump.\n\nRepresentative Eric Swalwell rang the cautionary bell, warning that he expects Trump to emulate his dictatorial hero and try this at home, tweeting: \u201cI will do everything physically possible \u2014 march with my feet, shout from my lungs, and out-maneuver with my mind \u2014 to stop this from happening in America. But you better believe Donald Trump will try. And I know you\u2019re with me. Not on our watch.\u201d\n\nOn a day that many have openly and with concern raised issues about the mental wellbeing of the \u201cpresident,\u201d this news from Russia is troubling. That\u2019s not because it raises concerns about Russian citizens (it does not appear to be much different than other actions Putin has taken without needing laws), but because it raises concerns about Trump seeing this and either being informed that this is his next item to implement in the United States or thinking that this is a brilliant way for Trump to silence the critics in all forms of media and in the general population.\n\nOne of the twenty-eight tweets on Sunday was an attack against Fox News, so it appears nobody might be off limits. If we get a whiff of this, as Swalwell notes, we must march, advocate and ensure that our rights to speak and criticize remain intact."

For starters, all three of them seem too cartoonish in nature to even be real people. And no one even wants to know why Kellyanne and George are married. But now Trump has gone and made it worse.\n\nGeorge Conway\u2019s ongoing attacks on Donald Trump have gotten a smidgeon of media coverage here and there, but they\u2019ve often gotten lost in the wash of even more absurd Trump headlines. Up to now, Trump has largely kept quiet about it, perhaps because he didn\u2019t want to give George a platform, or perhaps because he didn\u2019t want Kellyanne to be stuck in the middle, if such rational thoughts on Trump\u2019s part are even possible. But now that\u2019s changed.\n\nAfter George Conway flatly stated yesterday that Donald Trump is too mentally deranged to continue serving as president, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign chairman Brad Parscale fired back at him. Parscale wouldn\u2019t have dared to do something like this unless Trump told him to do it, and here\u2019s what Parscale said: \u201cWe all know that Donald Trump turned down Mr. Kellyanne Conway for a job he desperately wanted. He barely worked the Justice Department and was either fired/quit, didn\u2019t want the scrutiny? Now he hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success. POTUS doesn\u2019t even know him!\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know, or care, how much or little of this is true. What does matter is that Donald Trump has given a whole lot more attention and heft to George Conway\u2019s words by having such a top surrogate fire back in such direct and vicious fashion, and then retweeting this morning and adding that George was a \u201cA total loser!\u201d To whatever extent the Kellyanne-George debacle is humiliating and/or problematic for Trump, he just made it even worse for himself."

To support this extraordinary claim I turn to no less a person than Sir Isaac Newton, who said in his Third Law of Motion: \u201cFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\u201d\n\nIf anything has been a constant in American national politics, it has been the routine left to right and back again swing of the pendulum of the political spectrum. Never before in history has that pendulum swung so severely to the right, and never before has there been so powerful a groundswell risen up of equal and opposite reaction, fueled by an outrage seldom seen before, and one about to be augmented by a Generation Z explosion \u2013 coming of age and desperate to vote Donald Trump into oblivion. And you may quote me."

    "text": "About a month ago, the media reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would be resigning shortly after new Attorney General William Barr was confirmed. Rosenstein then let it be known to NBC News through his associates that he would remain on the job until whenever Special Counsel Robert Mueller was finished. But the media largely ignored this, and kept reporting that he would be leaving any day. Now the DOJ is confirming to NBC that he\u2019s staying longer. So what\u2019s really going on?\n\nRod Rosenstein originally said that he planned to stay at the DOJ until Mueller\u2019s work was done, and based on everything we know about Rosenstein, there is every reason to believe this is how he would handle things. The narrative about Rosenstein prematurely resigning has never rung true, and we\u2019ve long suspected that it\u2019s come from the same \u201csources\u201d that keep saying Mueller is going to \u201cwind down\u201d his investigation at any moment.\n\nThe media can\u2019t help but run with these kinds of narratives, because when audiences start hearing reports about Mueller and Rosenstein being on their way out, it frankly scares them, and causes them to stay tuned in. It\u2019s the same reason we hear so much media talk about pardons, when thanks to inevitable state charges, pardons were never going to play a major role in the Trump-Russia scandal. That said, there does appear to be one interesting tidbit to be gleaned from this about Rosenstein and Mueller.\n\nBased on the leaks that keep surfacing about Rod Rosenstein supposedly leaving any day now, it\u2019s fairly clear that there is a concerted effort by Team Trump to nudge him toward the door. Donald Trump\u2019s periodic negative tweets about Rosenstein underscore this. But now the DOJ is acknowledging to the media that Rosenstein is sticking around \u201ca little longer.\u201d That\u2019s probably all the time Rosenstein can buy himself \u2013 and it suggests that Mueller will carry out his big endgame moves before much longer."

This number sounded low to us, and we pointed out that based on their track record, we had no reason whatsoever to take the Republicans on this committee at their word. Now it turns out they were indeed fibbing the numbers \u2013 and we suspect we know why.\n\nThis evening Rachel Maddow revealed during her MSNBC show that the number of people who met the deadline is actually much higher. While eight people submitted their documents electronically, an unstated number of additional people sent paper documents to the House, which take longer to process. The Republicans on the committee know full well how this kind of thing works. So why would they pretend the number is so much lower than it is?\n\nThe thing about a massive document request operation is that while some people will definitely cooperate and others will never voluntarily cooperate, there are those on the fence who will be looking around to see what everyone else does. Let\u2019s say that you and another person on the document request list had a crucial email exchange. If the other person is cooperating, that means the committee already has those emails, so there\u2019s no reason for you to risk being held in contempt of Congress just to avoid having to turn those emails in.\n\nIf you\u2019re tempted to fight the document request, and you find out that only a small handful of the other people on the list have cooperated, you\u2019re going to feel more confident about standing your ground. This is surely why Donald Trump\u2019s Republican allies tried to create the false appearance today that almost no one was cooperating. Now we wait for the real number. Once that surfaces, we expect to see more people give in and cooperate."

    "text": "Donald Trump is continuing to get hammered in court. Last week ended with a trio of legal setbacks for Trump in New York that would take over the news cycle in any normal presidency. With Trump, these developments are just raindrops in a growing thunderstorm of bad news.\n\nOn Thursday, a New York appeals court gave Summer Zervos the green light to proceed with her defamation lawsuit against Trump. A former contestant on The Apprentice, Zervos claimed that Trump groped and kissed her without her consent. Trump denied the allegations, calling them \u201c100% false\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d Zervos then sued Trump under New York law for defamation, claiming that he damaged her reputation by falsely painting her as a liar.\n\nTrump loves to trample on the Constitution except when he thinks it might protect him. In this instance, Trump tried to hide behind the Constitution\u2019s supremacy clause, which prevents states from interfering with the federal government\u2019s powers. His lawyers argued that the Constitution bars Zervos from bringing the claim because he is the President of the United States. But the court agreed with Zervos, ruling 3-2 that even presidents are not immune from state level defamation lawsuits.\n\nAlso on Thursday, New York Attorney General Letitia James made a new filing in the state\u2019s lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Her office already succeeded in getting a court-supervised takedown of the Foundation in December. But now she is asking a judge to order Trump to pay a $5.6 million penalty and $2.8 million in restitution, and to ban Trump, Don Jr., Ivanka, and Eric from running any New York charity for the next decade. The filing reveals that James is armed with a wealth of \u201cuncontroverted evidence\u201d establishing that Trump \u201cused Foundation funds to, among other things, pay for portraits of himself; make political donations, pay for advertising for Trump hotels, settle lawsuits involving the Trump Organization, and to improperly intervene in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nFinally, on Friday, a federal judge in New York ruled against the Trump administration in a class-action lawsuit on immigration. Under federal law, migrants who prove they were \u201cabused, abandoned, or neglected\u201d by their parents are entitled to a pathway to lawful permanent residence. But in a blow to Trump\u2019s hardline immigration aspirations, a judge ruled that the Trump administration wildly misconstrued the law and illegally denied this special status to thousands of qualified people.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s new legal setbacks were no doubt one ingredient in the stew that led to his Twitter hysteria over the weekend. Trump attacked the late Senator John McCain, threatened Saturday Night Live with a federal investigation after it aired a rerun, and barked orders at Fox News. This all reflects Trump\u2019s growing desperation, as the \u201cpresident\u201d who is obsessed with winning continues losing bigly."

    "text": "Partially redacted documents were released today in relation to the search warrant that was carried out against Michael Cohen\u2019s residence and office nearly a year ago. This wasn\u2019t because prosecutors wanted to announce anything, and was instead the result of a legal victory by a number of major news outlets who sought the documents. So what do these documents tell us?\n\nThe documents are hundreds of pages long and are extraordinarily detailed, but a few things jump right off the page. For instance, Special Counsel Robert Mueller was aggressively investigating Michael Cohen nearly a year before the raid ultimately took place. At a certain point Cohen was being investigated for crimes like money laundering and acting as an unregistered foreign agent, but Cohen was never charged with these kinds of crimes.\n\nThis tells us that Mueller initially saw Cohen as a major potential player in the Trump-Russia scandal, but he eventually concluded that this wasn\u2019t the case. Mueller did however uncover evidence that Cohen committed other crimes that weren\u2019t central to the Trump-Russia probe, so he handed off the Cohen case to federal prosecutors at the SDNY, who later carried out the search warrant.\n\nIn other words, it looks like Robert Mueller started off by thoroughly investigating every key player in Donald Trump\u2019s orbit right out of the gate. He then prosecuted some cases himself while handing off others. The key here is that we clearly don\u2019t know how many cases have been referred to other prosecutors. For instance we just learned yesterday that the Feds raided the office of former Trump campaign fundraiser Elliott Broidy last summer. The bottom line: no one in Trump\u2019s orbit is off the hook for anything, unless they\u2019re innocent."

This included $2.8 million in restitution and another $5.6 million in penalties. At the time, Palmer Report pointed out that because Trump runs a debt-based cash-poor business model, he might have to sell off assets just to pay the fines \u2013 particularly if they kept piling up. It turns out we may or may not have been onto something.\n\nToday it\u2019s being reported that Donald Trump sold one of his New York City condos back on March 8th. Forbes is hitting on two key suspicious points. First, the buyer appears to have used a series of shell corporations to try to hide his or her real identity. Second, the buyer appears to have paid Trump far more than market value. These are both matters of concern. But what caught our eye is the specific dollar amount: $2.9 million. Sound familiar?\n\nThat\u2019s right. Just one week before it was announced that Donald Trump was getting hit with a $2.8 million fine, he sold off a property for $2.9 million, which was conveniently just enough to cover the cost of the fine. Is this merely an interesting coincidence, or is Trump indeed selling off assets in order to get enough cash to pay his fines?\n\nTrump was also hit with the separate $5.6 million fine, in addition to the $2.8 million fine. But he sold the property before the fines were publicly announced. It\u2019s possible he knew the $2.8 million restitution charge was coming, and he wanted to generate enough cash to cover it, but he didn\u2019t know the extra $5.6 million charge was coming.\n\nOf course Donald Trump will likely try to fight these fines in court. But if the courts rule against him, and he doesn\u2019t have the cash on hand to pay the fines, New York State could decide to seize some of his assets in order to make up for it. So yeah, Trump could be trying to get out ahead of this. Or it could simply be a coincidence that he found some shady buyer to pay him an overinflated $2.9 million, just as he was finding himself on the hook for $2.8 million."

Under different circumstances, you\u2019d think Cohen might be upset about this. But last night he released a statement through his attorney, saying that he\u2019s entirely in favor of it, because he\u2019s just that eager to see Trump brought to justice.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more and more of this by the hour. Each time a new piece of legislation goes through Congress, more Republicans vote against Donald Trump on it, as even Trump\u2019s own political party begins to try to insulate itself from his expected downfall. Fox News just suspended one of Trump\u2019s favorite hosts, Jeanine Pirro, and may be on the verge of dumping Tucker Carlson as well, because Fox cares more about its own bottom line than it does about trying to keep Trump from drowning.\n\nIn the coming days we\u2019ll hear about the additional current and former Donald Trump associates who have sold him out by turning over incriminating documents to the House Judiciary Committee. The hits just keep coming. More and more people in Trump\u2019s orbit have concluded that Trump is going down, and they\u2019re afraid of going down with him."

    "text": "Several media outlets got their way today when they successfully forced the SDNY to publicly release a partially redacted copy of the search warrant that was used for the year-ago raid of Michael Cohen\u2019s residence and office. Various parts of the document seem to spell out bad news for Donald Trump. But one part in particular should truly scare him.\n\nIt\u2019s not the revelation that Robert Mueller appears to have been investigating everyone in Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle a year before the Michael Cohen raid, though that\u2019s pretty ugly. It\u2019s not even that during the election, foreign money was paid into the hush money account that Trump and Cohen were using to pay off Trump\u2019s mistresses, though that\u2019s really ugly. Instead, it\u2019s a different stretch of the documentation entirely.\n\nCNBC pointed out that when it comes to the documents that were used to obtain the search warrant, it\u2019s a big deal that nineteen pages are blacked out. We agree that it\u2019s a big deal, and not simply due to the generic fear of the unknown. These pages are blacked out because they relate to an ongoing SDNY criminal investigation, a year after the Cohen raid, and several months after the case against Cohen was fully put to bed.\n\nMulti-tier criminal investigations like this tend to only progress sideways and/or upward. So those nineteen blacked out pages are almost certainly evidence against a fish who is equal to, or bigger than, Michael Cohen. Some of it could theoretically be about the likes of Elliott Broidy, as we just learned this week that his office was raided a couple months after the Cohen raid. But really, the blacked out parts are most likely about Donald Trump \u2013 and that would mean that the SDNY is building a massive criminal case against him."

    "text": "Bernie Sanders promised he\u2019d try to use his 2020 presidential campaign to help heal some of the bitter wounds that his 2016 campaign caused within the Democratic Party and the American political left. We\u2019d been hoping he really meant it. But Bernie just made two key campaign hires that are each scandalous to the point that we feel compelled to say something about it.\n\nBernie just hired Briahna Joy Gray to be the national press secretary for the 2020 campaign. The trouble: she voted for Jill Stein in 2016. Four days before the election she announced on Twitter that she would be voting for Stein, and long after the election she confirmed in a separate tweet that she did in fact end up voting for Stein. That\u2019s far from her only troubling moment. On September 26th of 2016, she tweeted this: \u201cDonald Trump is right. The dems pushed the \u2018Russia did the hacking\u2019 angle b/c it was politically advantageous for them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right, during the 2016 general election, Bernie Sanders\u2019 new press secretary was actively trying to downplay Donald Trump\u2019s Russia scandal, and then she went against Bernie\u2019s wishes and voted for the Kremlin-friendly Stein instead of Hillary Clinton. Oh, and Gray once attacked the character of civil rights legend John Lewis as well. We have screen captures of all these tweets, in case she deletes them. But she\u2019s arguably the less scandalous of Bernie\u2019s two new hires.\n\nBernie Sanders also revealed today that he\u2019s hired David Sirota to help run his 2020 campaign. The trouble: the Atlantic figured out that Sirota has been secretly working informally for the Bernie 2020 campaign since long before today. This is particularly troubling because Sirota has spent the past few months using his role as a journalist for the Guardian to attack Bernie\u2019s most prominent 2020 Democratic opponents.\n\nWhenever a political analyst calls out Bernie Sanders for these kinds of disingenuously divisive moves, many of Bernie\u2019s supporters reflexively fire back by accusing the analyst of being the one divisive for pointing it out. But considering that Bernie just hired a Stein-voting Russia denier, and that Sanders has had an anti-Democrat attack dog secretly working for his campaign for an unknown amount of time, something is very off here. If this is the kind of campaign Bernie truly wants to run, he should drop the \u201cunity\u201d facade."

    "text": "Preet Bharara is the former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. He was abruptly fired by Donald Trump, after he refused to take a personal call from the President he felt was inappropriate, considering his office was investigating Trump. Bharara appeared on Morning Joe this morning, and he discussed Geoffrey Berman, his replacement as the US Attorney for the SDNY. Berman was hand-picked by Donald Trump to lead the SDNY. Berman was a law partner of Rudy Giuliani, who is famously part of Donald Trump\u2019s legal defense team.\n\nBharara discussed how aggressively the SDNY has pursued investigations against Donald Trump, despite Trump having fired Bharara and hand-picked his replacement. Bharara described the pressure his replacement is under to do the right thing, and he later likened Berman\u2019s situation to that of Attorney General William Barr.\n\nBharara stated that the SDNY, like the Department of Justice, is filled with dedicated, professional prosecutors, totally committed to the rule of law. If Berman interfered with any rightful attempt to investigate and prosecute crimes, the law enforcement community and the public would know about it within days, and Berman\u2019s professional reputation would suffer irreparable harm. While a lawyer such as Berman might initially come into the SDNY with the intent of interfering in an ongoing investigation, once inside the organization, Berman would be hit with the realization that dozens of lawyers and reporters are actively watching him, and looking for any sign of interference. Berman, quickly and wisely, recused himself on all matters related to Donald Trump.\n\nThe pressure that Berman faces in the SDNY is less than the pressure on Donald Trump\u2019s hand-picked Attorney General, William Barr. His decisions and actions will be recorded in history books and he surely knows it. While he declined to recuse himself, which probably would have gotten him fired on the spot, there are clearly signs that Barr, like Berman, is not willing to be seen as a puppet for Donald Trump.\n\nThe latest sign is today\u2019s announcement of the continued employment of Rod Rosenstein as the Deputy Attorney General. Barr declared under oath during his confirmation hearings, that he spoke with Rosenstein and expected him to depart DOJ after a transition period, which was expected to be mid-March. Today, it was announced that Rosenstein would stay on \u201clonger.\u201d This will not make Donald Trump happy at all.\n\nRosenstein retained control of the day-to-day management of the Mueller investigation throughout Jeff Sessions\u2019 tenure as Attorney General, throughout Matt Whittaker\u2019s tenure as Acting AG, and now through William Barr\u2019s tenure as Attorney General. It would be highly unusual, and would attract attention, for the Attorney General to interfere and be involved in the day-to-day management of the Mueller investigation. Instead, the normal way for Barr to impact the day-to-day management of the Mueller investigation would be for him to replace Rod Rosenstein with his own hand-picked Deputy Attorney General.\n\nAllowing Rod Rosenstein to continue in his position, and continue to oversee the management of the Mueller investigation for an undetermined amount of time, is a big deal. It is another indication that William Barr is unwilling to directly interfere with the Mueller investigation."

Other times he\u2019ll seemingly leave a few words strategically un-redacted, as if he were dropping a clue. This time around, Mueller is raising eyebrows with a certain number he just invoked: eleven.\n\nRobert Mueller just asked a judge for an oddly specific eleven day extension on a filing deadline. The filing in question involves a newspaper\u2019s request to unseal certain documents. It\u2019s the kind of thing that Mueller probably doesn\u2019t consider a priority, even if the media does. But we\u2019re not aware of him having previously tried to blow off these kinds of matters. More importantly, who asks for eleven days? And why is his new target April Fools Day?\n\nSome observers are asking if this is a sign that Robert Mueller\u2019s team is shorthanded, which is possible. Andrew Weissmann is reportedly leaving the team. But it could just as easily be a sign that Mueller has something big coming up between now and April 1st, and it\u2019s either getting in the way of being able to deal with something like this filing, or the filing itself would reveal something that shouldn\u2019t be out there before April 1st.\n\nFeel free to make whatever you want of this. But the reality is that Special Counsel Robert Mueller just asked for an eleven day extension so he could make a filing on April Fools Day, and if that doesn\u2019t sum up just how surreal this has all become, nothing does."

Polls are still more about leftover name recognition from past elections than about current preferences. Fundraising numbers are also only one factor. Now we\u2019re seeing startling new numbers from Kamala Harris and Beto O\u2019Rourke, each of a different kind, and it\u2019s important to put them in context.\n\nTwo new major polls have been released this week. The new Morning Consult poll shows little to no movement for any candidate, in comparison to the last time it was conducted a week ago. But the new CNN poll tells a different story. It has Joe Biden in first place at 28% and Bernie Sanders in second place at 20%, which as we\u2019ve explained, is mostly a function of the time they\u2019ve spent on the national political stage prior to this race. The real story here is that Kamala Harris has spiked to third place with 12%, while Beto O\u2019Rourke is in fourth place with 11%.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s recent Texas Senate race garnered consistent nationwide coverage, so he has more built-in national name recognition than Harris does. So the fact that she\u2019s climbed ahead of him in the CNN poll is a big deal. In fact, when you consider that Biden and Bernie both have fairly low polling numbers for already being such household names, Kamala\u2019s numbers make a strong argument that she\u2019s the de facto frontrunner. That said, because Beto just now entered the race, we\u2019ll want to see if he gets a bump in the polls next week from his launch.\n\nThe other startling news is that Beto O\u2019Rourke managed to raise slightly more money in the first 24 hours of his campaign than Bernie Sanders raised in his first 24 hours. Again, Bernie is the more established name, so it\u2019s a really big deal that Beto managed to out-fundraise him.\n\nThe poll numbers are telling us that Kamala Harris has the momentum, while the fundraising numbers tell us that Beto O\u2019Rourke has the momentum. This early in the race, particularly in a field this large, positive news about a candidate tends to snowball in terms of positive coverage and attention. So we consider momentum to be the biggest overall factor in ranking the field. Kamala and Beto had a good week. We\u2019ll see what happens next week in this crowded race."

The list in the Report is:\n\nInterns Student interns provide invaluable help with research projects, day-to-day operations, and fact-checking. Interns during the previous year were Brittany Amano, Jackson Bailey, Rana Bansal, Christian Brown, Lydia Byrom, John Cleese, Alexis Cirrotti, Jesse Dennis, Mackenzie Dickhudt, Adam Donoho, Troy Durie, Michael Everett, Isabelle Holland, Wesley Huang, J. T. Hutt, Kathryn Janeway, Mostafa Kamel, Ayesha Karnik, David Laszcz, John Leo, Eugene Liu, Kacey Manlove, Aunt May, Kevin Nguyen, Katherine Olsson, Sarah Park, Peter Parker, Pragya Parthasarathy, Arjun Ramani, Kriyana Reddy, Steve Rogers, Jake Rosen, Joshua Siegel, John Snow, Nirali Trivedi, Bruce Wayne, Amanda Wilcox, and Jacob Ziemba.\n\nPerhaps the Janeway listed is real and not really the Star Trek character. Same for Bruce Wayne (Batman), Peter Parker (Spiderman), John (sic) Snow (Game of Thrones), and J.T. Hutt (Jabba the Hut from Star Wars). Martha Gimbel took a screenshot and posted it on Twitter so when it is corrected, it will remain for posterity.\n\nBut this is not the only area where the Trump administration is not doing a great job of accuracy or quality control. For example, according to a Washington Post report, Trump is winning only 6 percent of federal lawsuits trying to implement his policies, well below the normal win percentage in these kinds of suits, which is around 70 percent.\n\nDonald Trump likes to talk about how unprecedented his first two years have been. Once again, like a clock right twice a day, he is right \u2013 the work product is sloppy on a level not seen before. Maybe he needs superheroes Spell Checker Super Lawyer to help him out."

After all, would you be eager to turn over evidence that could incriminate yourself or your allies? Now we\u2019re getting numbers, and it\u2019s eye popping.\n\nLast night House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced on MSNBC that Steve Bannon had helpfully turned over several thousand Trump-related documents. Now the Republicans on the committee are claiming that just eight document request targets, out of eighty-one in total, have complied. Based on their track record we\u2019re not inclined to take the Republicans on this committee at their word. But Politico has pieced together what it believes are the identities of the eight people; the ones you\u2019ve heard of are Bannon, Tom Barrack, the NRA, George Papadopoulos, and Sam Nunberg. Of course the real story here is what happens to the people who didn\u2019t comply.\n\nSeventy-three Trump related people and entities are about to get forcibly subpoenaed to turn over the documents in question. Some of them will try to fight it by employing various legal tactics. But the bottom line is that the House Judiciary Committee is going to win most or all of these fights. The committee can also take its fight to the court of public opinion by publicly revealing precisely why it\u2019s asking these specific people for these specific documents.\n\nAt least some of these seventy-three people have another problem on their hands. For example, let\u2019s say that you worked for the Trump campaign while it was being run by Steve Bannon. Even if you refuse to turn over the documents you have, for all you know, Bannon may have already turned over his own copies of those same documents. So you may be holding out and fighting a losing legal battle for nothing. We expect to see some additional folks cave and cooperate in the coming days, for just this reason."

    "text": "Last year, even as Donald Trump\u2019s presidency seemed to be on its last legs, and the Republican Party seemed to be inching away from him, something happened that caused the GOP to rush back into his arms and buy him significant time. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy abruptly announced he was retiring, thus allowing Trump to nominate his replacement. This was suspicious beyond words, because Kennedy\u2019s son was an executive at Deutsche Bank, which was at the financial center of Donald Trump\u2019s Russia scandal.\n\nThis set off a million theories about how Donald Trump might have used Trump-Russia dirt on Justin Kennedy as leverage to force Anthony Kennedy into retirement. The trouble was that, while it all made sense, it was all vague and circumstantial. But that\u2019s no longer the case. Tonight the New York Times published a verty lengthy expose about the mutually corrupt relationship between Trump and Deutsche Bank over the years \u2013 and both the older and younger Kennedy play a role in the story.\n\nThe NY Times article confirms, once and for all, what had long been suspected: Justin Kennedy was indeed the Deutsche Bank senior executive who kept making the decision to loan large amounts of money to Donald Trump for bad real estate deals, even after every other bank in the world had sworn off lending money to Trump. Oh, and there\u2019s this sentence: \u201cOccasionally, Justice Kennedy stopped by Deutsche Bank\u2019s offices to say hello to the team.\u201d\n\nSo now we only have two possibilities. The first is that a Supreme Court Justice abruptly retired at the perfect time to save Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, after the Justice\u2019s son had coincidentally spent years signing off on absurd loans to Trump, from a bank that\u2019s best known for laundering Russian money. The second is that Justin Kennedy is a Kremlin asset who spent years funneling money from Vladimir Putin to Donald Trump, and Anthony Kennedy retired in order to keep Trump afloat, because it was the only way to protect his son. Pick one."

    "text": "Bernie Sanders promised he\u2019d try to use his 2020 presidential campaign to help heal some of the bitter wounds that his 2016 campaign caused within the Democratic Party and the American political left. We\u2019d been hoping he really meant it. But Bernie just made two key campaign hires that are each scandalous to the point that we feel compelled to say something about it.\n\nBernie just hired Briahna Joy Gray to be the national press secretary for the 2020 campaign. The trouble: she voted for Jill Stein in 2016. Four days before the election she announced on Twitter that she would be voting for Stein, and long after the election she confirmed in a separate tweet that she did in fact end up voting for Stein. That\u2019s far from her only troubling moment. On September 26th of 2016, she tweeted this: \u201cDonald Trump is right. The dems pushed the \u2018Russia did the hacking\u2019 angle b/c it was politically advantageous for them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right, during the 2016 general election, Bernie Sanders\u2019 new press secretary was actively trying to downplay Donald Trump\u2019s Russia scandal, and then she went against Bernie\u2019s wishes and voted for the Kremlin-friendly Stein instead of Hillary Clinton. Oh, and Gray once attacked the character of civil rights legend John Lewis as well. We have screen captures of all these tweets, in case she deletes them. But she\u2019s arguably the less scandalous of Bernie\u2019s two new hires.\n\nBernie Sanders also revealed today that he\u2019s hired David Sirota to help run his 2020 campaign. The trouble: the Atlantic figured out that Sirota has been secretly working informally for the Bernie 2020 campaign since long before today. This is particularly troubling because Sirota has spent the past few months using his role as a journalist for the Guardian to attack Bernie\u2019s most prominent 2020 Democratic opponents.\n\nWhenever a political analyst calls out Bernie Sanders for these kinds of disingenuously divisive moves, many of Bernie\u2019s supporters reflexively fire back by accusing the analyst of being the one divisive for pointing it out. But considering that Bernie just hired a Stein-voting Russia denier, and that Sanders has had an anti-Democrat attack dog secretly working for his campaign for an unknown amount of time, something is very off here. If this is the kind of campaign Bernie truly wants to run, he should drop the \u201cunity\u201d facade."

    "authors": [
      "Bill Palmer"
    ],
    "text": "About a month ago, the media reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would be resigning shortly after new Attorney General William Barr was confirmed. Rosenstein then let it be known to NBC News through his associates that he would remain on the job until whenever Special Counsel Robert Mueller was finished. But the media largely ignored this, and kept reporting that he would be leaving any day. Now the DOJ is confirming to NBC that he\u2019s staying longer. So what\u2019s really going on?\n\nRod Rosenstein originally said that he planned to stay at the DOJ until Mueller\u2019s work was done, and based on everything we know about Rosenstein, there is every reason to believe this is how he would handle things. The narrative about Rosenstein prematurely resigning has never rung true, and we\u2019ve long suspected that it\u2019s come from the same \u201csources\u201d that keep saying Mueller is going to \u201cwind down\u201d his investigation at any moment.\n\nThe media can\u2019t help but run with these kinds of narratives, because when audiences start hearing reports about Mueller and Rosenstein being on their way out, it frankly scares them, and causes them to stay tuned in. It\u2019s the same reason we hear so much media talk about pardons, when thanks to inevitable state charges, pardons were never going to play a major role in the Trump-Russia scandal. That said, there does appear to be one interesting tidbit to be gleaned from this about Rosenstein and Mueller.\n\nBased on the leaks that keep surfacing about Rod Rosenstein supposedly leaving any day now, it\u2019s fairly clear that there is a concerted effort by Team Trump to nudge him toward the door. Donald Trump\u2019s periodic negative tweets about Rosenstein underscore this. But now the DOJ is acknowledging to the media that Rosenstein is sticking around \u201ca little longer.\u201d That\u2019s probably all the time Rosenstein can buy himself \u2013 and it suggests that Mueller will carry out his big endgame moves before much longer."

    "text": "Marshall Cohen, a reporter and producer for CNN, tweeted an item on Monday that smells of an inspirational moment for President Donald Trump. It should raise alarms in all of us, that the current occupant of the White House will get grand ideas from his puppet master, Vladimir Putin. Cohen tweeted: \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin has signed two new laws that impose strict prohibitions on Internet activities and speech. They allow Russian authorities to jail or fine people who spread \u2018fake news\u2019 or if they \u2018disrespect\u2019 government officials online.\u201d\n\nAnyone who reads Palmer Report knows that Trump has repeatedly attacked the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and disrespectful and, in a tweet binge perhaps influenced by other kinds of binging, Trump tweeted an astounding twenty-eight times on Sunday. This included stating that Saturday Night Live should be investigated by both the Federal Election Commission and the Federal Trade Commission for collusion with Russia and Democrats and for disrespecting Trump.\n\nRepresentative Eric Swalwell rang the cautionary bell, warning that he expects Trump to emulate his dictatorial hero and try this at home, tweeting: \u201cI will do everything physically possible \u2014 march with my feet, shout from my lungs, and out-maneuver with my mind \u2014 to stop this from happening in America. But you better believe Donald Trump will try. And I know you\u2019re with me. Not on our watch.\u201d\n\nOn a day that many have openly and with concern raised issues about the mental wellbeing of the \u201cpresident,\u201d this news from Russia is troubling. That\u2019s not because it raises concerns about Russian citizens (it does not appear to be much different than other actions Putin has taken without needing laws), but because it raises concerns about Trump seeing this and either being informed that this is his next item to implement in the United States or thinking that this is a brilliant way for Trump to silence the critics in all forms of media and in the general population.\n\nOne of the twenty-eight tweets on Sunday was an attack against Fox News, so it appears nobody might be off limits. If we get a whiff of this, as Swalwell notes, we must march, advocate and ensure that our rights to speak and criticize remain intact."

Weeks ago, Michael Cohen publicly accused Trump of lying to the bank about his financial situation, in the hope of convincing it to loan him the money to buy the team. Now it turns out the bank knew Trump was lying, but was willing to loan him the money anyway. Wait, what?\n\nThis isn\u2019t something that banks do, period. Even corrupt banks don\u2019t do this kind of thing, because there\u2019s nothing to be gained here. If Donald Trump had managed to buy the Buffalo Bills, his crippled financial situation would have prevented him from being able to keep the team operational. So he would have had to either dump the team in a fire sale or declare yet another bankruptcy. Either way, Deutsche Bank would have lost its shirt on the deal.\n\nThis leads us back to the central question of Donald Trump and Deutsche Bank. Why would a major bank keep putting itself in financial peril by continuing to make bad loans to a broke criminal who wasn\u2019t paying the money back? The answer keeps coming back to Deutsche Bank\u2019s status during this same timeframe as a massive launderer of Russian money.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to surmise that Vladimir Putin has been using Deutsche Bank to funnel money to Donald Trump, as a way of controlling him. The \u201cloans\u201d were never intended to be paid back. So when Deutsche Bank agreed to put itself in a bad financial situation by knowingly loaning Trump the money to buy a Buffalo Bills team he couldn\u2019t afford to keep afloat, it had to have been at Putin\u2019s behest. On some direct or indirect level, Putin was trying to use Trump to buy an NFL football team."

But now Trump has gone and made it worse.\n\nGeorge Conway\u2019s ongoing attacks on Donald Trump have gotten a smidgeon of media coverage here and there, but they\u2019ve often gotten lost in the wash of even more absurd Trump headlines. Up to now, Trump has largely kept quiet about it, perhaps because he didn\u2019t want to give George a platform, or perhaps because he didn\u2019t want Kellyanne to be stuck in the middle, if such rational thoughts on Trump\u2019s part are even possible. But now that\u2019s changed.\n\nAfter George Conway flatly stated yesterday that Donald Trump is too mentally deranged to continue serving as president, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign chairman Brad Parscale fired back at him. Parscale wouldn\u2019t have dared to do something like this unless Trump told him to do it, and here\u2019s what Parscale said: \u201cWe all know that Donald Trump turned down Mr. Kellyanne Conway for a job he desperately wanted. He barely worked the Justice Department and was either fired/quit, didn\u2019t want the scrutiny? Now he hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success. POTUS doesn\u2019t even know him!\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know, or care, how much or little of this is true. What does matter is that Donald Trump has given a whole lot more attention and heft to George Conway\u2019s words by having such a top surrogate fire back in such direct and vicious fashion, and then retweeting this morning and adding that George was a \u201cA total loser!\u201d To whatever extent the Kellyanne-George debacle is humiliating and/or problematic for Trump, he just made it even worse for himself."

Now he\u2019s back, and \u2013 stop us if you\u2019ve heard this one before \u2013 he may have just given something away.\n\nIt turns out Donald Trump and the rest of his legal team decided to banish Rudy Giuliani from doing any television appearances, because he\u2019d screwed up one too many times. This is according to an inside report from Axios, which then interviewed Rudy about the matter. Rudy is insisting that he wasn\u2019t actually banned from doing TV, and instead he went quiet for a different reason.\n\nGiuliani claims that he went silent last month because he and Team Trump thought Robert Mueller\u2019s report could surface at any minute, and he was waiting to see it before heading back onto TV so he could dispute it. This is nonsense, of course. But when Rudy runs his mouth like this, what he says usually ends up being half true.\n\nWe think Rudy Giuliani just gave away that Team Trump has no idea when the Mueller report will be filed, and that Donald Trump has spent the past month living in constant fear that the day could be upon him. If so, no wonder Trump has been acting increasingly frantic over the past month in general, and over the past few days in particular."

But considering that she\u2019s a paying member at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club, and she\u2019s turning around and allegedly selling that access to Chinese nationals, make no mistake: this is a counterintelligence investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s connections to the Chinese government.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the related sex trafficking scandal in Florida, which is being pursued by local officials, will end up tying back to Donald Trump. But considering Trump\u2019s Kraft connection, along with Trump\u2019s connection to the separate but similarly repulsive Jeffrey Epstein child rape scandal, and other creepy connections, this part of the Yang scandal could well lead back to Trump\u2019s doorstep as well."

    "text": "Last night we learned that not only has Steve Bannon sold Donald Trump out to the House Judiciary Committee, he already sold Trump out to Special Counsel Robert Mueller a long time ago. Bannon is far from the only former devoted Trump loyalist now racing to kick dirt on Trump.\n\nToday we\u2019re seeing the public release of the search warrant that the FBI used to raid Michael Cohen\u2019s office and seize evidence, which was ultimately used to send him to prison. Under different circumstances, you\u2019d think Cohen might be upset about this. But last night he released a statement through his attorney, saying that he\u2019s entirely in favor of it, because he\u2019s just that eager to see Trump brought to justice.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more and more of this by the hour. Each time a new piece of legislation goes through Congress, more Republicans vote against Donald Trump on it, as even Trump\u2019s own political party begins to try to insulate itself from his expected downfall. Fox News just suspended one of Trump\u2019s favorite hosts, Jeanine Pirro, and may be on the verge of dumping Tucker Carlson as well, because Fox cares more about its own bottom line than it does about trying to keep Trump from drowning.\n\nIn the coming days we\u2019ll hear about the additional current and former Donald Trump associates who have sold him out by turning over incriminating documents to the House Judiciary Committee. The hits just keep coming. More and more people in Trump\u2019s orbit have concluded that Trump is going down, and they\u2019re afraid of going down with him."

    "text": "Despite his erratic and unstable nature, Donald Trump is largely a man of patterns. In fact he seems so at home with his patterns, he doesn\u2019t appear to even know he\u2019s engaging in them. For instance, while he hurls cheap insults at all of his adversaries, he consistently accuses his black adversaries of being unintelligent. But something just shifted.\n\nWhenever Donald Trump wants to lash out at an African American public figure, he nearly always does so by calling them a dummy. Democratic Chairwoman Maxine Waters is a low IQ individual. CNN host Don Lemon is a low IQ individual. Basketball star LeBron James is a low IQ individual. We all know what the commonality is here in Trump\u2019s deranged mind. But over the past few weeks, Trump\u2019s lack of intellect and cognitive ability has come directly under fire, and his attack pattern has shifted accordingly.\n\nFirst, Michael Cohen testified that Donald Trump\u2019s grades and SAT scores are so bad, he sent threatening letters to everyone who might have been in position to publish them. Then Trump unwittingly played into the stereotype by referring to Apple CEO Tim Cook as \u201cTim Apple.\u201d Okay, so Trump was a poor student, he isn\u2019t particularly bright, and he frequently misspeaks. So what?\n\nWhen Donald Trump attacked John McCain over the weekend, he insisted that McCain was \u201clast in his class\u201d at Annapolis. Hmm, so Trump suddenly cares about other people\u2019s grades. Then after Joe Biden got a bit tongue tied, Trump tweeted that Biden was a \u201clow I.Q. individual.\u201d Wait a minute here.\n\nTrump has expanded beyond his default racist position of attacking the intelligence of black people, and he\u2019s now making a point of attacking the intelligence of white men. We think we know what\u2019s going on here. Before, it was just a matter of Trump being racist enough to think that black people are dumb, and his base being racist enough to eat up the stereotype. But Trump has always viewed other white men as being on his own plane of existence. Now that one incident after another is shining a light on Trump\u2019s lack of intellect, he\u2019s lashing out at his fellow white men, because he sees them as his real competition. Racist is as racist does."

    "text": "Is the love affair between the Fox News channel and the Trump administration cooling off? We\u2019ve seen numerous indicators lately that both sides in this twisted partnership are feeling somewhat slighted, causing a strain on the relationship. Early March saw Bill Shine, former Fox News executive and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to former Fox CEO Roger Ailes, \u201cresign\u201d from his post as Trump White House Communications Director. Shine\u2019s formal reason for leaving was that he was a \u201cdistraction\u201d for Trump, but reports were rampant that Trump was unhappy Shine hadn\u2019t done enough to improve Trump\u2019s image in the media.\n\nOn the Fox News end of the partnership, a recent New Yorker article by Jane Meyer about the unnatural relationship between the White House and the cable channel led to the Democratic National Committee decision to exclude Fox News from televising any debates in the upcoming season. Whether this was a smart decision on the part of the Democrats is debatable, but it is certain to be a financial blow to Fox.\n\nMore recently two of Trump\u2019s biggest Fox cheerleaders, Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro, have come under fire for past and present remarks they\u2019ve made. Media Matters recently published an article which provided transcripts of Carlson calling in to a radio program where he made numerous racist, misogynist, and just plain gross and disgusting statements. Jeanine Pirro made waves with several anti-Muslim comments with regards to Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\n\nThis led to anti-Fox protests and caused several companies to pull their advertising from the offending shows. Fox News claimed to be \u201caddressing\u201d the matter, and this past weekend Pirro\u2019s show was not broadcast. It\u2019s currently unknown how long the show will be off the air, but \u201cPresident\u201d Trump was clearly upset by the show\u2019s absence. At least three vitriolic tweets from Trump this weekend attacked \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats\u201d and the \u201cFake News Media\u201d, and encouraged Fox to \u201cstay strong\u201d and \u201cfight\u201d for Pirro and Tucker, and to stop \u201cworking soooo hard on being politically correct\u201d.\n\nDonald Trump is obviously frustrated by Fox\u2019s reaction to the controversies. He expects his supporters, including Fox News, to stand by him no matter what and to do whatever is necessary to support his cause, regardless of the cost. As a business, Fox News has to be concerned with profits, a majority of which come from advertisers. While Fox will always remain a conservative-leaning media organization, it remains to be seen if they can continue to play their role as the channel of faithful Trump apologists without sustaining serious reputational and/or financial damage. It\u2019s unlikely that the opposing goals of profits vs. unquestioning support will both be able to withstand the tests of time."

    "text": "We\u2019re all learning today that the Feds raided the office of Donald Trump\u2019s associate Elliott Broidy last summer. This remained a secret until just now, thanks to documents that have been obtained by ProPublica. This is a very big deal, not only for Trump, but for the Republican National Committee \u2013 and things are going to get ugly.\n\nWhat immediately stands out here is that, as opposed to the highly publicized raid of Michael Cohen\u2019s office last year, the Feds have kept the raid of Elliott Broidy\u2019s office a secret all this time. This strongly suggests that the evidence obtained in the raid is being used in ongoing investigations into bigger fish. One could also make the argument that Broidy\u2019s willingness to keep the raid a secret is a sign that he\u2019s cooperating, but this is not a definitive argument; it could be that Broidy has been keeping quiet because he\u2019s embarrassed, or values his privacy. But the real story here is going to be what the raid has turned up about others.\n\nThe reporting from ProPublica reveals that the Feds targeted Broidy over allegations of money laundering and lobbying the Trump regime on behalf of Middle Eastern nations. This more or less cements that the Feds\u2019 goal here is to use Broidy\u2019s crimes to get to Trump and his administration. Based on the timeline, the Feds have now had roughly nine months to work with whatever evidence they seized from this raid. That means they have a big head start here.\n\nThis brings us to the still unresolved questions about Elliott Broidy\u2019s personal scandals. He allegedly paid his mistress $1.6 million to have an abortion and keep quiet about it all. It\u2019s widely suspected that it was actually Donald Trump who impregnated the woman, and that Broidy was merely acting as a middleman for the payoff and ended up taking the fall for it, but no specific evidence has surfaced in this regard. The raid has likely either confirmed or disproven this notion, and it\u2019ll eventually come out one way or the other. We just don\u2019t know when, because there is no indication from the Feds about the progress that\u2019s been made since the raid.\n\nFinally, there is the matter of Elliott Broidy\u2019s position as a Deputy Finance Chairman for the Republican National Committee, a role he only lost after his recent scandals started surfacing. The financial records and emails seized in the Broidy raid surely connect back to the RNC, as well as to the Trump campaign and the Trump White House. Bottom line: we don\u2019t know specifically what the Feds got their hands on in this raid, but a whole lot of people in Trump land and GOP land should be sweating right now."

The trouble for them: that\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nDonald Trump and his lawyers have announced that they don\u2019t have to turn over any documents, because the House Judiciary Committee merely asked for the same documents they perviously turned over to Robert Mueller, and they didn\u2019t turn over any documents to Robert Mueller. Nice try, but this isn\u2019t a legal defense, and it won\u2019t help at all when this becomes a subpoena battle in court.\n\nNot that it matters anyway. Here\u2019s the thing about a wide-scale document request effort like this. No one is expecting Donald Trump and his team to cooperate. But nearly every document they\u2019re sitting on is likely also in the possession of other people on the list of eighty-one names, and plenty of those people are going to turn over their copies of those documents. For instance, if two people have a conversation over email or text messaging, they both have a full record of the conversation, and only one of them has to turn it over.\n\nDonald Trump and his team can pat themselves on the back all they like for what they think is a clever response here. But they don\u2019t appear to understand what\u2019s going on here. In order to \u201cwin\u201d this round, they would have had to convince every last one of those eighty-one recipients not to cooperate. There\u2019s no chance that happened. Trump lost this round."

    "text": "\u201cPresident\u201d Donald Trump took to Twitter this past weekend to complain about Saturday Night Live. He suggested that SNL should be investigated for \u201ccollusion with the Democrats and Russia.\u201d He wondered why SNL mocks him since he has a \u201c52%\u201d approval rating and \u201c93%\u201d approval with Republicans. It\u2019s hard to believe that he has either approval rating, but especially hard to believe that overall he has 52%, so a little investigation is in order.\n\nAccording to Gallup, Trump\u2019s current approval rating is 39% (March 1-10, 2019). The highest he has ever been in this survey is 45% (January 20-29, 2017 and June 11-17, 2018). Trump has never had a rating at Gallup above 50%. Gallup takes these numbers one step further. They examined the presidencies of Obama, G.W. Bush, Clinton, G.H.W. Bush, Reagan, Carter, Nixon, Kennedy, and Eisenhower. The lowest of all presidents in January of the third year belongs to Reagan at 41%, with the highest being Eisenhower at 69%. Trump can\u2019t even beat Nixon, whose approval rating was 50%. Amazingly, Trump\u2019s Republican support stands at 90%, with his lowest rating from Republicans at 77% (December 11-17, 2017). It\u2019s frankly puzzling that Republicans continue to support this clown in such numbers.\n\nTrump loves to brag and inflate numbers to placate his base. Trump is a failure in the land of the lucid. He attempts to mask his failure with hateful rhetoric, lies, and intimidation. In this instance as reported by MSNBC, he asked via tweet: \u201cShould Federal Election Commission and/or FCC look into this?\u201d Really, Trump? It\u2019s sad that this man doesn\u2019t know the difference between a news outlet and a comedy show. If Trump doesn\u2019t like being mocked, he should stop acting like an idiot. Trump\u2019s tweetfest doesn\u2019t help to prove otherwise; the show on Saturday night was a rerun from Christmas.\n\nAs MSNBC pointed out, \u201centertainment programming mocking newsworthy figures is protected as free speech.\u201d Trump further claims that SNL is \u201clike advertising without consequences\u201d and \u201ca boost to help Democrats.\u201d MSNBC analyzed Trump\u2019s comments and clarified: Trump seems to be referring to the \u2018equal time rule\u2019 which mandates that U.S. broadcast TV stations give equal air-time opportunities to opposing political candidates in prime-time if requested. But Trump is president, not a candidate, and SNL is in late-night and, again, parody. There\u2019s also FCC\u2019s \u2018fairness doctrine,\u2019 a regulation that required networks to give balanced coverage to matters of public controversy. The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t even bother to research anything before he speaks, not that it should surprise anyone.\n\nDonald Trump needs to try doing his job, which is apparently all but impossible for him; it\u2019s much easier for him to start conflicts to cover for his failures. He does absolutely nothing for our country but continue to tout numbers that don\u2019t exist, claim accolades that are not his and divide the country. That division is the one thing he does well. He should start claiming that instead."

As it turns out, we\u2019re about to learn a whole lot more about it. In fact we\u2019re suddenly just hours away from what appears to be a deluge.\n\nFor quite some time now, multiple major media outlets have been fighting to get their hands on copies of the search warrant and the seized materials from the FBI raid of Michael Cohen\u2019s office. The Feds have been fighting against this, arguing that it\u2019s all part of an ongoing investigation. While not explicitly stated, the unmistakable implication has been that the evidence seized in the raid is being used to build the SDNY criminal case against Donald Trump. But today a judge ruled that these materials must be publicly released tomorrow.\n\nTo be clear, these documents will be partially redacted. But this is different from situations like the one in which Robert Mueller redacted nearly the entire Michael Flynn sentencing memo, because it was entirely at his discretion, and no one was fighting him on it. In this instance, the SDNY has to do the redactions in a manner which complies with the judge\u2019s ruling that the media has a right to the documents, which means those redactions should be comparatively light.\n\nThe net result is that we\u2019re about to learn a lot tomorrow. When Michael Cohen testified before Congress this month, he brought a few stray pieces of evidence that he\u2019d hunted down of his own accord. But tomorrow we\u2019re going to get a peek at what all was seized from his office, which is a motherlode when it comes to the crimes that Cohen committed at Donald Trump\u2019s instruction."

That\u2019s the point when you start to realize just how much those two storylines overlap, and sometimes you realize they\u2019re one big story. That brings us to Donald Trump\u2019s long running Michael Cohen scandal and Donald Trump\u2019s long running Elliott Broidy scandal, which are both suddenly coming to a head.\n\nToday we learned that the original search warrant for the FBI raid on Michael Cohen\u2019s office, along with partially redacted evidence seized during the raid, will be abruptly made public tomorrow. Today we also learned that the FBI raided Elliott Broidy\u2019s office not long after it raided Cohen\u2019s office.\n\nRemarkably, neither of these storylines is a result of any official action taken by prosectors, and is instead a result of the media scratching and clawing its way to getting its hands on the story. In fact the same media outlets were not involved in these two stories. This is, by all appearances, coincidentally coming to a head all at once. But if you\u2019ve been following these two scandals, you know that these two scandals don\u2019t have a coincidental relationship with each other.\n\nFor instance, Michael Cohen and Elliott Broidy both worked for Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, and afterward, he gave them each cushy senior jobs with the Republican National Committee. Trump and Broidy both had affairs with women and then paid them to keep quiet. Cohen claimed last year that Trump and Broidy were both his clients. And now we know that not long after the Feds raided Cohen\u2019s office, they raided Broidy\u2019s office.\n\nOver the past nine months we\u2019ve seen the results of the Michael Cohen raid play out in public, from his plea deal, to his congressional testimony, to the SDNY naming \u201cIndividual-1\u201d Donald Trump as a co-conspirator in court filings against Cohen. We haven\u2019t seen results of the Elliott Broidy raid play out in public at all; we\u2019re just now learning that it even happened. But these two raids have to be connected, and all roads lead back to Donald Trump. No wonder he\u2019s so agitated lately."

    "text": "Last week, Republican senators received quite a bit of praise for voting with their Democratic peers to publicly rebuke Donald Trump for his fake national emergency declaration and to end American involvement in the war in Yemen. There was even a rare unanimous vote on a resolution to make Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report public once it will be finished. But behind closed doors, Republicans still steadfastly supported Trump\u2019s agenda on an issue where it aligns with their own \u2013 the appointment of conservative federal judges.\n\nOn March 12, the Senate confirmed Paul Matey as an appointee to the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a vote that came down strictly along party lines. As a consequence, this court now has a 7\u20146 majority of Republican appointees, with one more pending vacancy. The next day, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham conducted hearings for two Trump nominees to the Ninth Circuit against objections from the candidates\u2018 home state senators, Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein. On this occasion, Senator Harris tweeted out:\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now in the Senate Judiciary Committee: Neither @SenFeinstein nor I have returned blue slips for the two Ninth Circuit nominees from CA before us today. Republicans are disregarding this 100 year old tradition to push extreme & ideological nominees.\n\nIn the Senate, blue slips are a convention which allows the senators from the state of residence of a federal judicial nominee to give an opinion on the candidate which is then taken into account in the confirmation process. There is no enforceable rule that obliges the Judiciary Committee to reject a nominee if one or both home state senators return a negative blue slip or fail to return blue slips altogether, but it is nevertheless a tradition that in the past both parties have had the decency to uphold. However, the current Senate under the leadership of Mitch McConnell has chosen to ride roughshod over this tradition, as Senator Dianne Feinstein pointed out in a tweet referencing the confirmation of Paul Matey:\n\nNo Democratic majority has EVER held a hearing or confirmed a judicial nominee over the objection of a home-state Republican senator \u2013 NEVER. Matey will be the SEVENTH circuit court judge confirmed under President Trump over the objection of home-state Democratic senators.\n\nAs of March 13, the number has risen from seven to eight, since on that day the Senate Judiciary Committee also confirmed Neomi Rao as replacement for Brett Kavanaugh on the powerful D.C. Circuit Court, the second most important court in the country. Rao shares a number of characteristics with other Trump appointees in that she is controversial, young and has no experience when it comes to practicing law in a courtroom.\n\nAll these new judges who are strong on partisan ideology rather than having a proven record of impartially serving the American people now have lifetime appointments and the ability to influence the judicial system for decades to come. This will be the legacy of a presidency that never should have happened. But Republicans are obviously grimly determined to squeeze the last bit of juice out of Donald Trump\u2019s incumbency before supporting him becomes too politically costly for them and they opportunistically decide to drop him like a hot potato."

It can be hard to make heads or tails of this situation, so let\u2019s take some time to analyze the most basic elements involved here.\n\nDemocrats, more than anything, do not want Trump to be reelected. By sounding the alarm now, the party is acting with the motive of self-preservation by scaring people into thinking that Trump is out to steamroll the election. And yes, as an unabashed demagogue, he\u2019s a powerful campaigner. They also know that the fear of another Trump presidency is enough to get people to the voting booth.\n\nRepublicans, more than anything, seem to be out to undermine democracy again with a reelection campaign chimera in the form of a unified national party committee and presidential reelection committee. This has a chilling effect on any republican presidential hopefuls who aren\u2019t named Trump, by signaling early on that other candidates are unwelcome. It also might scare some non-Republicans into thinking it\u2019s pointless to vote, because a second Trump victory is inevitable. Trumpism does have a stranglehold on the Republican Party and, when considering this alone, one could understandably assume that it isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nEvidently, the Republicans heard the phrase \u201cputting all your eggs in one basket\u201d and collectively thought, \u201cThat\u2019s genius.\u201d Trump is a strong campaigner; it\u2019s in his nature as a C-list televangelist for authoritarianism. He\u2019s good at it and he likes it. It\u2019s one reason why he\u2019s never really stopped campaigning. Why try to construct a team of political and military strategists to address the quagmire in Syria when you can go to Tampa to give a litany of howling MAGA baboons the time of their lives?\n\nBy contrast, Trump is a spectacular imbecile when it comes to being a government official. I don\u2019t need to get into the reasons \u201cwhy,\u201d because we\u2019re all well-apprised in this matter. These reasons are exactly why we need to step back, take a calm breath, and realize that the unstoppable apparatus of criminal behavior by Trump administration will be the timely undoing that makes the 2020 campaign come to a bone-rattling halt. It won\u2019t matter how impressive a campaign it is.\n\nDonald Trump will either be out of the White House by the time the 2020 election rolls around, or he\u2019ll be in such bad political shape from a highly toxic, scandal-ridden fourth year in office that he\u2019ll be an even more unappealing candidate than he is today. If the political efficacy we saw in the midterms is similar in 2020, Trump\u2019s toast. To ensure that, you need to vote, and you need to make sure that everyone you know who\u2019s eligible goes out and casts a vote too. When the people vote in big numbers, the Democrats win. It\u2019s that simple."

    "text": "Is the love affair between the Fox News channel and the Trump administration cooling off? We\u2019ve seen numerous indicators lately that both sides in this twisted partnership are feeling somewhat slighted, causing a strain on the relationship. Early March saw Bill Shine, former Fox News executive and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to former Fox CEO Roger Ailes, \u201cresign\u201d from his post as Trump White House Communications Director. Shine\u2019s formal reason for leaving was that he was a \u201cdistraction\u201d for Trump, but reports were rampant that Trump was unhappy Shine hadn\u2019t done enough to improve Trump\u2019s image in the media.\n\nOn the Fox News end of the partnership, a recent New Yorker article by Jane Meyer about the unnatural relationship between the White House and the cable channel led to the Democratic National Committee decision to exclude Fox News from televising any debates in the upcoming season. Whether this was a smart decision on the part of the Democrats is debatable, but it is certain to be a financial blow to Fox.\n\nMore recently two of Trump\u2019s biggest Fox cheerleaders, Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro, have come under fire for past and present remarks they\u2019ve made. Media Matters recently published an article which provided transcripts of Carlson calling in to a radio program where he made numerous racist, misogynist, and just plain gross and disgusting statements. Jeanine Pirro made waves with several anti-Muslim comments with regards to Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\n\nThis led to anti-Fox protests and caused several companies to pull their advertising from the offending shows. Fox News claimed to be \u201caddressing\u201d the matter, and this past weekend Pirro\u2019s show was not broadcast. It\u2019s currently unknown how long the show will be off the air, but \u201cPresident\u201d Trump was clearly upset by the show\u2019s absence. At least three vitriolic tweets from Trump this weekend attacked \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats\u201d and the \u201cFake News Media\u201d, and encouraged Fox to \u201cstay strong\u201d and \u201cfight\u201d for Pirro and Tucker, and to stop \u201cworking soooo hard on being politically correct\u201d.\n\nDonald Trump is obviously frustrated by Fox\u2019s reaction to the controversies. He expects his supporters, including Fox News, to stand by him no matter what and to do whatever is necessary to support his cause, regardless of the cost. As a business, Fox News has to be concerned with profits, a majority of which come from advertisers. While Fox will always remain a conservative-leaning media organization, it remains to be seen if they can continue to play their role as the channel of faithful Trump apologists without sustaining serious reputational and/or financial damage. It\u2019s unlikely that the opposing goals of profits vs. unquestioning support will both be able to withstand the tests of time."

Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy abruptly announced he was retiring, thus allowing Trump to nominate his replacement. This was suspicious beyond words, because Kennedy\u2019s son was an executive at Deutsche Bank, which was at the financial center of Donald Trump\u2019s Russia scandal.\n\nThis set off a million theories about how Donald Trump might have used Trump-Russia dirt on Justin Kennedy as leverage to force Anthony Kennedy into retirement. The trouble was that, while it all made sense, it was all vague and circumstantial. But that\u2019s no longer the case. Tonight the New York Times published a verty lengthy expose about the mutually corrupt relationship between Trump and Deutsche Bank over the years \u2013 and both the older and younger Kennedy play a role in the story.\n\nThe NY Times article confirms, once and for all, what had long been suspected: Justin Kennedy was indeed the Deutsche Bank senior executive who kept making the decision to loan large amounts of money to Donald Trump for bad real estate deals, even after every other bank in the world had sworn off lending money to Trump. Oh, and there\u2019s this sentence: \u201cOccasionally, Justice Kennedy stopped by Deutsche Bank\u2019s offices to say hello to the team.\u201d\n\nSo now we only have two possibilities. The first is that a Supreme Court Justice abruptly retired at the perfect time to save Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, after the Justice\u2019s son had coincidentally spent years signing off on absurd loans to Trump, from a bank that\u2019s best known for laundering Russian money. The second is that Justin Kennedy is a Kremlin asset who spent years funneling money from Vladimir Putin to Donald Trump, and Anthony Kennedy retired in order to keep Trump afloat, because it was the only way to protect his son. Pick one."

Now he\u2019s back, and \u2013 stop us if you\u2019ve heard this one before \u2013 he may have just given something away.\n\nIt turns out Donald Trump and the rest of his legal team decided to banish Rudy Giuliani from doing any television appearances, because he\u2019d screwed up one too many times. This is according to an inside report from Axios, which then interviewed Rudy about the matter. Rudy is insisting that he wasn\u2019t actually banned from doing TV, and instead he went quiet for a different reason.\n\nGiuliani claims that he went silent last month because he and Team Trump thought Robert Mueller\u2019s report could surface at any minute, and he was waiting to see it before heading back onto TV so he could dispute it. This is nonsense, of course. But when Rudy runs his mouth like this, what he says usually ends up being half true.\n\nWe think Rudy Giuliani just gave away that Team Trump has no idea when the Mueller report will be filed, and that Donald Trump has spent the past month living in constant fear that the day could be upon him. If so, no wonder Trump has been acting increasingly frantic over the past month in general, and over the past few days in particular."

Weeks ago, Michael Cohen publicly accused Trump of lying to the bank about his financial situation, in the hope of convincing it to loan him the money to buy the team. Now it turns out the bank knew Trump was lying, but was willing to loan him the money anyway. Wait, what?\n\nThis isn\u2019t something that banks do, period. Even corrupt banks don\u2019t do this kind of thing, because there\u2019s nothing to be gained here. If Donald Trump had managed to buy the Buffalo Bills, his crippled financial situation would have prevented him from being able to keep the team operational. So he would have had to either dump the team in a fire sale or declare yet another bankruptcy. Either way, Deutsche Bank would have lost its shirt on the deal.\n\nThis leads us back to the central question of Donald Trump and Deutsche Bank. Why would a major bank keep putting itself in financial peril by continuing to make bad loans to a broke criminal who wasn\u2019t paying the money back? The answer keeps coming back to Deutsche Bank\u2019s status during this same timeframe as a massive launderer of Russian money.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to surmise that Vladimir Putin has been using Deutsche Bank to funnel money to Donald Trump, as a way of controlling him. The \u201cloans\u201d were never intended to be paid back. So when Deutsche Bank agreed to put itself in a bad financial situation by knowingly loaning Trump the money to buy a Buffalo Bills team he couldn\u2019t afford to keep afloat, it had to have been at Putin\u2019s behest. On some direct or indirect level, Putin was trying to use Trump to buy an NFL football team."

That\u2019s the point when you start to realize just how much those two storylines overlap, and sometimes you realize they\u2019re one big story. That brings us to Donald Trump\u2019s long running Michael Cohen scandal and Donald Trump\u2019s long running Elliott Broidy scandal, which are both suddenly coming to a head.\n\nToday we learned that the original search warrant for the FBI raid on Michael Cohen\u2019s office, along with partially redacted evidence seized during the raid, will be abruptly made public tomorrow. Today we also learned that the FBI raided Elliott Broidy\u2019s office not long after it raided Cohen\u2019s office.\n\nRemarkably, neither of these storylines is a result of any official action taken by prosectors, and is instead a result of the media scratching and clawing its way to getting its hands on the story. In fact the same media outlets were not involved in these two stories. This is, by all appearances, coincidentally coming to a head all at once. But if you\u2019ve been following these two scandals, you know that these two scandals don\u2019t have a coincidental relationship with each other.\n\nFor instance, Michael Cohen and Elliott Broidy both worked for Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, and afterward, he gave them each cushy senior jobs with the Republican National Committee. Trump and Broidy both had affairs with women and then paid them to keep quiet. Cohen claimed last year that Trump and Broidy were both his clients. And now we know that not long after the Feds raided Cohen\u2019s office, they raided Broidy\u2019s office.\n\nOver the past nine months we\u2019ve seen the results of the Michael Cohen raid play out in public, from his plea deal, to his congressional testimony, to the SDNY naming \u201cIndividual-1\u201d Donald Trump as a co-conspirator in court filings against Cohen. We haven\u2019t seen results of the Elliott Broidy raid play out in public at all; we\u2019re just now learning that it even happened.

This comes even as another huge Trump apologist, Tucker Carlson, is in danger of losing his Fox News gig.\n\nTrump started off this morning by simply demanding that Fox News put Pirro back on the air, while calling for his fans to fight on behalf of Pirro and Carlson. But that wasn\u2019t enough, so by this afternoon Trump was posting rants like this: \u201cWere Fox News weekend anchors, Arthel Neville and Leland Vittert, trained by CNN prior to their ratings collapse? In any event, that\u2019s where they should be working, along with their lowest rated anchor, Shepard Smith!\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. Donald Trump is now calling for three Fox News hosts to be removed from the channel, because they don\u2019t spend enough time kissing up to him. It\u2019s telling that Neville, Vittert, and Smith all seem to have job security, while Pirro and Carlson don\u2019t. Those still riding the Trump train as it goes off the rails are going right off a cliff with him."

For instance, while he hurls cheap insults at all of his adversaries, he consistently accuses his black adversaries of being unintelligent. But something just shifted.\n\nWhenever Donald Trump wants to lash out at an African American public figure, he nearly always does so by calling them a dummy. Democratic Chairwoman Maxine Waters is a low IQ individual. CNN host Don Lemon is a low IQ individual. Basketball star LeBron James is a low IQ individual. We all know what the commonality is here in Trump\u2019s deranged mind. But over the past few weeks, Trump\u2019s lack of intellect and cognitive ability has come directly under fire, and his attack pattern has shifted accordingly.\n\nFirst, Michael Cohen testified that Donald Trump\u2019s grades and SAT scores are so bad, he sent threatening letters to everyone who might have been in position to publish them. Then Trump unwittingly played into the stereotype by referring to Apple CEO Tim Cook as \u201cTim Apple.\u201d Okay, so Trump was a poor student, he isn\u2019t particularly bright, and he frequently misspeaks. So what?\n\nWhen Donald Trump attacked John McCain over the weekend, he insisted that McCain was \u201clast in his class\u201d at Annapolis. Hmm, so Trump suddenly cares about other people\u2019s grades. Then after Joe Biden got a bit tongue tied, Trump tweeted that Biden was a \u201clow I.Q. individual.\u201d Wait a minute here.\n\nTrump has expanded beyond his default racist position of attacking the intelligence of black people, and he\u2019s now making a point of attacking the intelligence of white men. We think we know what\u2019s going on here. Before, it was just a matter of Trump being racist enough to think that black people are dumb, and his base being racist enough to eat up the stereotype. But Trump has always viewed other white men as being on his own plane of existence. Now that one incident after another is shining a light on Trump\u2019s lack of intellect, he\u2019s lashing out at his fellow white men, because he sees them as his real competition.

The Feds have been fighting against this, arguing that it\u2019s all part of an ongoing investigation. While not explicitly stated, the unmistakable implication has been that the evidence seized in the raid is being used to build the SDNY criminal case against Donald Trump. But today a judge ruled that these materials must be publicly released tomorrow.\n\nTo be clear, these documents will be partially redacted. But this is different from situations like the one in which Robert Mueller redacted nearly the entire Michael Flynn sentencing memo, because it was entirely at his discretion, and no one was fighting him on it. In this instance, the SDNY has to do the redactions in a manner which complies with the judge\u2019s ruling that the media has a right to the documents, which means those redactions should be comparatively light.\n\nThe net result is that we\u2019re about to learn a lot tomorrow. When Michael Cohen testified before Congress this month, he brought a few stray pieces of evidence that he\u2019d hunted down of his own accord. But tomorrow we\u2019re going to get a peek at what all was seized from his office, which is a motherlode when it comes to the crimes that Cohen committed at Donald Trump\u2019s instruction."

This is a big deal, for a few reasons, and none of them are good for Donald Trump.\n\nFor starters, there is every reason to expect that the FBI will go ahead and conduct a good faith investigation into the matter. In this case Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have the jurisdiction to stop the FBI from using its own judgment in pursuing the case. Yang is technically the target of the investigation, not Trump. But considering that she\u2019s a paying member at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club, and she\u2019s turning around and allegedly selling that access to Chinese nationals, make no mistake: this is a counterintelligence investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s connections to the Chinese government.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the related sex trafficking scandal in Florida, which is being pursued by local officials, will end up tying back to Donald Trump. But considering Trump\u2019s Kraft connection, along with Trump\u2019s connection to the separate but similarly repulsive Jeffrey Epstein child rape scandal, and other creepy connections, this part of the Yang scandal could well lead back to Trump\u2019s doorstep as well."

He suggested that SNL should be investigated for \u201ccollusion with the Democrats and Russia.\u201d He wondered why SNL mocks him since he has a \u201c52%\u201d approval rating and \u201c93%\u201d approval with Republicans. It\u2019s hard to believe that he has either approval rating, but especially hard to believe that overall he has 52%, so a little investigation is in order.\n\nAccording to Gallup, Trump\u2019s current approval rating is 39% (March 1-10, 2019). The highest he has ever been in this survey is 45% (January 20-29, 2017 and June 11-17, 2018). Trump has never had a rating at Gallup above 50%. Gallup takes these numbers one step further. They examined the presidencies of Obama, G.W. Bush, Clinton, G.H.W. Bush, Reagan, Carter, Nixon, Kennedy, and Eisenhower. The lowest of all presidents in January of the third year belongs to Reagan at 41%, with the highest being Eisenhower at 69%. Trump can\u2019t even beat Nixon, whose approval rating was 50%. Amazingly, Trump\u2019s Republican support stands at 90%, with his lowest rating from Republicans at 77% (December 11-17, 2017). It\u2019s frankly puzzling that Republicans continue to support this clown in such numbers.\n\nTrump loves to brag and inflate numbers to placate his base. Trump is a failure in the land of the lucid. He attempts to mask his failure with hateful rhetoric, lies, and intimidation. In this instance as reported by MSNBC, he asked via tweet: \u201cShould Federal Election Commission and/or FCC look into this?\u201d Really, Trump? It\u2019s sad that this man doesn\u2019t know the difference between a news outlet and a comedy show. If Trump doesn\u2019t like being mocked, he should stop acting like an idiot. Trump\u2019s tweetfest doesn\u2019t help to prove otherwise; the show on Saturday night was a rerun from Christmas.\n\nAs MSNBC pointed out, \u201centertainment programming mocking newsworthy figures is protected as free speech.\u201d Trump further claims that SNL is \u201clike advertising without consequences\u201d and \u201ca boost to help Democrats.\u201d MSNBC analyzed Trump\u2019s comments and clarified: Trump seems to be referring to the \u2018equal time rule\u2019 which mandates that U.S. broadcast TV stations give equal air-time opportunities to opposing political candidates in prime-time if requested. But Trump is president, not a candidate, and SNL is in late-night and, again, parody. There\u2019s also FCC\u2019s \u2018fairness doctrine,\u2019 a regulation that required networks to give balanced coverage to matters of public controversy. The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t even bother to research anything before he speaks, not that it should surprise anyone.\n\nDonald Trump needs to try doing his job, which is apparently all but impossible for him; it\u2019s much easier for him to start conflicts to cover for his failures. He does absolutely nothing for our country but continue to tout numbers that don\u2019t exist, claim accolades that are not his and divide the country. That division is the one thing he does well. He should start claiming that instead."

    "text": "We\u2019re all learning today that the Feds raided the office of Donald Trump\u2019s associate Elliott Broidy last summer. This remained a secret until just now, thanks to documents that have been obtained by ProPublica. This is a very big deal, not only for Trump, but for the Republican National Committee \u2013 and things are going to get ugly.\n\nWhat immediately stands out here is that, as opposed to the highly publicized raid of Michael Cohen\u2019s office last year, the Feds have kept the raid of Elliott Broidy\u2019s office a secret all this time. This strongly suggests that the evidence obtained in the raid is being used in ongoing investigations into bigger fish. One could also make the argument that Broidy\u2019s willingness to keep the raid a secret is a sign that he\u2019s cooperating, but this is not a definitive argument; it could be that Broidy has been keeping quiet because he\u2019s embarrassed, or values his privacy. But the real story here is going to be what the raid has turned up about others.\n\nThe reporting from ProPublica reveals that the Feds targeted Broidy over allegations of money laundering and lobbying the Trump regime on behalf of Middle Eastern nations. This more or less cements that the Feds\u2019 goal here is to use Broidy\u2019s crimes to get to Trump and his administration. Based on the timeline, the Feds have now had roughly nine months to work with whatever evidence they seized from this raid. That means they have a big head start here.\n\nThis brings us to the still unresolved questions about Elliott Broidy\u2019s personal scandals. He allegedly paid his mistress $1.6 million to have an abortion and keep quiet about it all. It\u2019s widely suspected that it was actually Donald Trump who impregnated the woman, and that Broidy was merely acting as a middleman for the payoff and ended up taking the fall for it, but no specific evidence has surfaced in this regard. The raid has likely either confirmed or disproven this notion, and it\u2019ll eventually come out one way or the other. We just don\u2019t know when, because there is no indication from the Feds about the progress that\u2019s been made since the raid.\n\nFinally, there is the matter of Elliott Broidy\u2019s position as a Deputy Finance Chairman for the Republican National Committee, a role he only lost after his recent scandals started surfacing. The financial records and emails seized in the Broidy raid surely connect back to the RNC, as well as to the Trump campaign and the Trump White House. Bottom line: we don\u2019t know specifically what the Feds got their hands on in this raid, but a whole lot of people in Trump land and GOP land should be sweating right now."

    "text": "We\u2019ve been told all about the \u201cunstoppable apparatus\u201d and \u201cmachine\u201d that is supposed to be the 2020 Trump reelection campaign with the unquestionable intent from both sides of the aisle of scaring us. It can be hard to make heads or tails of this situation, so let\u2019s take some time to analyze the most basic elements involved here.\n\nDemocrats, more than anything, do not want Trump to be reelected. By sounding the alarm now, the party is acting with the motive of self-preservation by scaring people into thinking that Trump is out to steamroll the election. And yes, as an unabashed demagogue, he\u2019s a powerful campaigner. They also know that the fear of another Trump presidency is enough to get people to the voting booth.\n\nRepublicans, more than anything, seem to be out to undermine democracy again with a reelection campaign chimera in the form of a unified national party committee and presidential reelection committee. This has a chilling effect on any republican presidential hopefuls who aren\u2019t named Trump, by signaling early on that other candidates are unwelcome. It also might scare some non-Republicans into thinking it\u2019s pointless to vote, because a second Trump victory is inevitable. Trumpism does have a stranglehold on the Republican Party and, when considering this alone, one could understandably assume that it isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nEvidently, the Republicans heard the phrase \u201cputting all your eggs in one basket\u201d and collectively thought, \u201cThat\u2019s genius.\u201d Trump is a strong campaigner; it\u2019s in his nature as a C-list televangelist for authoritarianism. He\u2019s good at it and he likes it. It\u2019s one reason why he\u2019s never really stopped campaigning. Why try to construct a team of political and military strategists to address the quagmire in Syria when you can go to Tampa to give a litany of howling MAGA baboons the time of their lives?\n\nBy contrast, Trump is a spectacular imbecile when it comes to being a government official. I don\u2019t need to get into the reasons \u201cwhy,\u201d because we\u2019re all well-apprised in this matter. These reasons are exactly why we need to step back, take a calm breath, and realize that the unstoppable apparatus of criminal behavior by Trump administration will be the timely undoing that makes the 2020 campaign come to a bone-rattling halt. It won\u2019t matter how impressive a campaign it is.\n\nDonald Trump will either be out of the White House by the time the 2020 election rolls around, or he\u2019ll be in such bad political shape from a highly toxic, scandal-ridden fourth year in office that he\u2019ll be an even more unappealing candidate than he is today. If the political efficacy we saw in the midterms is similar in 2020, Trump\u2019s toast. To ensure that, you need to vote, and you need to make sure that everyone you know who\u2019s eligible goes out and casts a vote too. When the people vote in big numbers, the Democrats win. It\u2019s that simple."

    "text": "When Donald Trump first nominated William Barr to be his new Attorney General, it sent a lot of us looking over his several-decade record in politics, in the hope of figuring out what he\u2019d do once he got into power. After all, he\u2019d have a hand in Trump\u2019s racist DOJ agenda, and a hand in the Robert Mueller probe.\n\nWilliam Barr\u2019s record suggested two things. First, he\u2019d try to side with Donald Trump in the Mueller probe to the extent that he thought he legally could, but he wouldn\u2019t be willing to commit obstruction of justice on Trump\u2019s behalf. Second, Barr would eagerly get behind Trump\u2019s racist agenda, particularly with regard to immigrants. Sure enough, that\u2019s more or less precisely what we\u2019re seeing play out right now.\n\nIt\u2019s repulsive, and scary, that Barr loudly backed Donald Trump this week on his national emergency border wall stunt. It\u2019s a sign that Barr will try to use the DOJ to carry out racist policy in general, just as his predecessor Jeff Sessions did. This is something we need to fight back against every step of the way. That said, it is not a sign that Barr is going to do Trump\u2019s corrupt bidding when it comes to the Mueller probe.\n\nSince William Barr took office, we\u2019ve seen Robert Mueller post various court filings that have made Donald Trump and his regime look particularly criminal. Thus far Barr hasn\u2019t done anything to try to stop those filings from happening. Barr has also, obviously, not fired Mueller. Barr could be behind the persistent media leaks that Mueller is about to \u201cwind down\u201d his investigation at any moment, but even if so, those leaks haven\u2019t translated to anything negative for Mueller. Barr has declined to recuse himself, but he knows that if he did that, Trump would immediately fire him for it.\n\nSo far Attorney General William Barr has turned out to be a xenophobe who really wants use his position to stick it to non-white people, and a careful cretin who isn\u2019t willing to risk going to prison just to save Donald Trump\u2019s hide. Barr is Jeff Sessions all over again, just as we were expecting. That\u2019s bad news for America \u2013 but it\u2019s also bad news for Trump."

    "text": "Last week, Republican senators received quite a bit of praise for voting with their Democratic peers to publicly rebuke Donald Trump for his fake national emergency declaration and to end American involvement in the war in Yemen. There was even a rare unanimous vote on a resolution to make Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report public once it will be finished. But behind closed doors, Republicans still steadfastly supported Trump\u2019s agenda on an issue where it aligns with their own \u2013 the appointment of conservative federal judges.\n\nOn March 12, the Senate confirmed Paul Matey as an appointee to the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a vote that came down strictly along party lines. As a consequence, this court now has a 7\u20146 majority of Republican appointees, with one more pending vacancy. The next day, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham conducted hearings for two Trump nominees to the Ninth Circuit against objections from the candidates\u2018 home state senators, Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein. On this occasion, Senator Harris tweeted out:\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now in the Senate Judiciary Committee: Neither @SenFeinstein nor I have returned blue slips for the two Ninth Circuit nominees from CA before us today. Republicans are disregarding this 100 year old tradition to push extreme & ideological nominees.\n\nIn the Senate, blue slips are a convention which allows the senators from the state of residence of a federal judicial nominee to give an opinion on the candidate which is then taken into account in the confirmation process. There is no enforceable rule that obliges the Judiciary Committee to reject a nominee if one or both home state senators return a negative blue slip or fail to return blue slips altogether, but it is nevertheless a tradition that in the past both parties have had the decency to uphold. However, the current Senate under the leadership of Mitch McConnell has chosen to ride roughshod over this tradition, as Senator Dianne Feinstein pointed out in a tweet referencing the confirmation of Paul Matey:\n\nNo Democratic majority has EVER held a hearing or confirmed a judicial nominee over the objection of a home-state Republican senator \u2013 NEVER. Matey will be the SEVENTH circuit court judge confirmed under President Trump over the objection of home-state Democratic senators.\n\nAs of March 13, the number has risen from seven to eight, since on that day the Senate Judiciary Committee also confirmed Neomi Rao as replacement for Brett Kavanaugh on the powerful D.C. Circuit Court, the second most important court in the country. Rao shares a number of characteristics with other Trump appointees in that she is controversial, young and has no experience when it comes to practicing law in a courtroom.\n\nAll these new judges who are strong on partisan ideology rather than having a proven record of impartially serving the American people now have lifetime appointments and the ability to influence the judicial system for decades to come. This will be the legacy of a presidency that never should have happened. But Republicans are obviously grimly determined to squeeze the last bit of juice out of Donald Trump\u2019s incumbency before supporting him becomes too politically costly for them and they opportunistically decide to drop him like a hot potato."

When it comes to what the GOP\u2019s official Twitter account tried to do to Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke yesterday, we feel like speaking up is a moral imperative, for a few reasons.\n\nIf you missed it, consider yourself lucky. The official @GOP account on Twitter posted this tweet: \u201cOn this St. Paddy\u2019s Day, a special message from noted Irishman Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke.\u201d Attached was Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s years-old mug shot, with a leprechaun hat very poorly photoshopped onto his head, and the words \u201cPlease Drink Responsibly\u201d tacked onto the bottom. Make no mistake: this is racist.\n\nYes, Beto O\u2019Rourke is white. But he\u2019s part Irish, and this tweet is specifically invoking his heritage while playing into a long-running harmful stereotype about people of Irish descent being alcoholics. Throw in America\u2019s unfortunate past history of discrimination against Irish immigrants, and this is just plain ugly. This is racism, and it\u2019s intolerable.\n\nThe Republican Party has long had a race problem. But in the past few years the Republican Party has become gleefully, consistently, manically racist, whether it be the lies about Barack Obama being a Muslim from Kenya, or the ongoing racist attacks on various Democrats in Congress. Now the GOP has even found a way to say something racist about a white Democratic candidate.\n\nThis tweet came from the official @GOP account, which is shameful beyond words. If there\u2019s any saving grace here, it\u2019s that the tweet was particularly poorly received. It received more comments than likes. When that happens, and the vast majority of the comments are negative, it\u2019s often said that a tweet got \u201cratioed\u201d \u2013 and it generally indicates a failed tweet. It\u2019s time for the Republican Party to shut itself down and retire to the ash bin of history."

Trump just lies to you about the cards he\u2019s holding, and his lie are so unimaginative, it becomes easy to figure out what he thinks he\u2019s got up his sleeve.\n\nOver a fourteen hour period on Sunday, Donald Trump posted nearly two dozen tweets and retweets. Most of them were frantic, deranged, or some combination of both. By the time he was done, he had attacked everyone from John McCain, to some local union boss, to Saturday Night Live, and in the process he gave something away.\n\nWe all know what Trump\u2019s Twitter feed looks like when he\u2019s bored on the weekend. But this was something far more. Trump has a series of go-to moves when he\u2019s trying to generate controversy so it\u2019ll get headlines and thus serve as a distraction from whatever he wants us not to pay attention to. Trump went through all his greatest hits on Sunday, making clear that he\u2019s desperately trying to ensure that at least some of Monday\u2019s headlines are about his Twitter meltdown, as opposed to what they should be about.\n\nDonald Trump does this whenever he thinks a major bombshell is about to land on him. Has he been tipped off by the Justice Department about a specific Robert Mueller move? Has the media asked him to comment on a big new story about one his scandals, and he knows it\u2019s about to be published? Or is Trump just watching everything closing in on him, and convincing himself that it\u2019s all about to crush him this week? Stay tuned. His super sized meltdown today wasn\u2019t about nothing, that\u2019s for sure."

The thing is, today is the day where the unstoppable force meets the supposedly immovable object.\n\nThat\u2019s right, today is deadline day for those document requests that the House Judiciary Committee sent to eighty-one Trump related people and entities. The committee publicly stated last week that at least some of the people involved have already turned over all of the documents they\u2019ve been asked for, without naming names. That leaves the others in a lurch, because for all they know, the documents they\u2019re tempted to withhold have already been turned over by other people on the list. So what happens when the clock hits the deadline later today?\n\nWe couldn\u2019t begin to tell you, and that\u2019s the intriguing part.

We could see a second and more detailed round of document requests go out today, including to people who weren\u2019t on the initial list. We could also see the committee begin making certain things public today or tomorrow, in order to rattle the cages of some of the people involved, in the hope of pressuring them into becoming cooperators."

Okay, so maybe he just didn\u2019t see it the first time it aired, so he thought it was new. But he didn\u2019t catch on that this was an SNL Christmas episode. Even though the opening sketch had a Christmas theme. Even though the opening monologue referenced the holiday season. Even though the Weekend Update jokes were about events that happened three months ago.\n\nAgain, this is a guy who was so triggered by last night\u2019s SNL episode, he woke up this morning, and called for the Federal Communications Commission and (somehow) the Federal Election Commission to retaliate against the show, all while not being able to figure out that this was an old Christmas episode, or remember that he had already watched it three months ago.\n\nSure, this is a small thing in comparison to everything else that\u2019s wrong, objectionable, unfit, and scary about this guy.

Such one sided media coverage, most of it Fake News. Hard to believe I won and am winning. Approval Rating 52%, 93% with Republicans. Sorry! #MAGA\u201d\n\nAs Ronald Reagan might have said if he were still alive, \u201cThere you go again.\u201d Trump might consider trying to Google something before looking like he does not know anything about the United States or politics. President Reagan\u2019s FCC eliminated the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, and the equal-time doctrine only applies to political candidates. So no, the FCC should not look into this, and the FEC also need not look into this either.\n\nMore importantly, as has been written about and discussed by many, SNL is a parody or comedy show. Late night shows are entertainment. So no, there is no duty to show \u201cthe other side.\u201d But from what I understand, Trump has always been very insistent that there are good people on both sides.\n\nIf what Donald Trump suggested in this morning\u2019s tweets were actual United States policy, it would be the end of our form of government as we know it. The president is not a king or despot, free from criticism or mockery. The tweets also should concern us as Americans, when the occupier of the White House might more appropriately belong in a padded cell, as his incoherent babblings about collusion with Democrats and Russians seems at best unhinged. In all seriousness, something is not right with Trump."

No, twelve Republican Senators voted against Donald Trump on his signature campaign promise \u2013 the border wall that is still so popular with his base.\n\nThis is significant because this is a clear sign that at least twelve GOP Senators are sick of Donald Trump and will vote against him if they think they can get away with it politically, and they clearly do think they can get away with it. It just takes eight more Republican Senators willing to vote against Trump to get to the magic impeachment number. Eight may sound like a lot of additional Republican Senators to get to vote against Trump, and it is, but there are surely more than eight who are secretly sick of Donald Trump and would love to get his toxic and sloppy criminal family out of the White House and out of the Republican Party.\n\nThat means now is the time to release the Mueller Report, or, to release enough solid evidence that Trump and his family are guilty of high crimes, and begin impeachment. With nearly two years still left before the 2020 elections, Republican Senators could vote to oust Trump now, and in their mind they will have time to change the narrative of the 2020 elections and make it about something other than Trump.\n\nIf the impeachment process does not begin within the next five months, Republicans will argue that the process is a political stunt to hurt their chances in the upcoming elections, and they will be less likely to vote against Donald Trump, if he is still popular with the Republican base. If impeachment has any chance of succeeding, the vote needs to take place before Republican Senators begin campaigning for their own re-election."

Some people have a subtle \u201ctell\u201d that tips you off what kind of hand they\u2019ve got. Trump just lies to you about the cards he\u2019s holding, and his lie are so unimaginative, it becomes easy to figure out what he thinks he\u2019s got up his sleeve.\n\nOver a fourteen hour period on Sunday, Donald Trump posted nearly two dozen tweets and retweets. Most of them were frantic, deranged, or some combination of both. By the time he was done, he had attacked everyone from John McCain, to some local union boss, to Saturday Night Live, and in the process he gave something away.\n\nWe all know what Trump\u2019s Twitter feed looks like when he\u2019s bored on the weekend. But this was something far more. Trump has a series of go-to moves when he\u2019s trying to generate controversy so it\u2019ll get headlines and thus serve as a distraction from whatever he wants us not to pay attention to. Trump went through all his greatest hits on Sunday, making clear that he\u2019s desperately trying to ensure that at least some of Monday\u2019s headlines are about his Twitter meltdown, as opposed to what they should be about.\n\nDonald Trump does this whenever he thinks a major bombshell is about to land on him. Has he been tipped off by the Justice Department about a specific Robert Mueller move? Has the media asked him to comment on a big new story about one his scandals, and he knows it\u2019s about to be published? Or is Trump just watching everything closing in on him, and convincing himself that it\u2019s all about to crush him this week? Stay tuned. His super sized meltdown today wasn\u2019t about nothing, that\u2019s for sure."

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi knows this better than anyone. It\u2019s why she said what she said about impeachment. She knew what the media would do with it \u2013 and her plan is already working.\n\nTo be clear, Nancy Pelosi didn\u2019t actually say she\u2019s not going to impeach Donald Trump. She simply said she\u2019s not going to do it right this minute, before the votes are there for removal, and that she\u2019s going to wait for the ugliest of dirt on Trump to surface first. In reality, with the Mueller report forthcoming, and Trump\u2019s criminal scandals getting worse by the day, Pelosi\u2019s impeachment timetable could be just a few months or even weeks away.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop the media from falsely claiming that Pelosi said she\u2019ll never impeach Trump. After all, this kind of misleading reporting is an easy way to get the Democrats, and the anti-Trump resistance in general, angry at Pelosi \u2013 and that\u2019s great for ratings and page views. But Pelosi doesn\u2019t care about that, because as major media outlets trip over each other in the race to criticize her over this, they\u2019re making the case for impeachment in the process.\n\nJust this morning, NBC News published the latest article arguing for the swift impeachment of Donald Trump, if only as a way of dinging Nancy Pelosi. Numerous other major news outlets have done the same. They\u2019re doing her work for her, by convincing the general public that Trump needs to be ousted. It\u2019s why she said what she said; she\u2019s playing the media game like a fiddle."

We know this because in a tweet rant, Trump stated: \u201cIt\u2019s truly incredible that shows like Saturday Night Live, not funny/no talent, can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me), over & over, without so much of a mention of \u201cthe other side.\u201d Like an advertisement without consequences. Same with Late Night Shows. Should Federal Election Commission and/or FCC look into this? There must be Collusion with the Democrats and, of course, Russia! Such one sided media coverage, most of it Fake News. Hard to believe I won and am winning. Approval Rating 52%, 93% with Republicans. Sorry! #MAGA\u201d\n\nAs Ronald Reagan might have said if he were still alive, \u201cThere you go again.\u201d Trump might consider trying to Google something before looking like he does not know anything about the United States or politics. President Reagan\u2019s FCC eliminated the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, and the equal-time doctrine only applies to political candidates. So no, the FCC should not look into this, and the FEC also need not look into this either.\n\nMore importantly, as has been written about and discussed by many, SNL is a parody or comedy show. Late night shows are entertainment. So no, there is no duty to show \u201cthe other side.\u201d But from what I understand, Trump has always been very insistent that there are good people on both sides.\n\nIf what Donald Trump suggested in this morning\u2019s tweets were actual United States policy, it would be the end of our form of government as we know it. The president is not a king or despot, free from criticism or mockery. The tweets also should concern us as Americans, when the occupier of the White House might more appropriately belong in a padded cell, as his incoherent babblings about collusion with Democrats and Russians seems at best unhinged. In all seriousness, something is not right with Trump."

    "text": "This week Donald Trump decided that the best way to stop his impending downfall was to begin attacking as many American heroes, American institutions, and American locations as possible. His hit list has included everyone from John McCain, to General Motors and Google, to New York and California. How is this supposed to help Trump? He surely doesn\u2019t know. But now he\u2019s trying an even stranger tactic: attacking his few remaining allies.\n\nWe should have seen it coming last week when Donald Trump attacked his fellow white supremacist Ann Coulter, after she stopped being impressed with his crap. Now Trump is attacking, of all things, Fox News. Last night the network pulled Judge Jeanine Pirro, one of Trump\u2019s biggest apologists, from the air after her hideous anti-Muslim remarks. This comes even as another huge Trump apologist, Tucker Carlson, is in danger of losing his Fox News gig.\n\nTrump started off this morning by simply demanding that Fox News put Pirro back on the air, while calling for his fans to fight on behalf of Pirro and Carlson. But that wasn\u2019t enough, so by this afternoon Trump was posting rants like this: \u201cWere Fox News weekend anchors, Arthel Neville and Leland Vittert, trained by CNN prior to their ratings collapse? In any event, that\u2019s where they should be working, along with their lowest rated anchor, Shepard Smith!\u201d\n\nSo there you have it. Donald Trump is now calling for three Fox News hosts to be removed from the channel, because they don\u2019t spend enough time kissing up to him. It\u2019s telling that Neville, Vittert, and Smith all seem to have job security, while Pirro and Carlson don\u2019t. Those still riding the Trump train as it goes off the rails are going right off a cliff with him."

In the process, he gave away that he\u2019s even further gone than we thought.\n\nWhy is Donald Trump ranting about Saturday Night Live? Because it was on the air last night, and he watched it, like he always does. The trouble: he must not have realized it was a rerun from last December. Okay, so maybe he just didn\u2019t see it the first time it aired, so he thought it was new. But he didn\u2019t catch on that this was an SNL Christmas episode. Even though the opening sketch had a Christmas theme. Even though the opening monologue referenced the holiday season. Even though the Weekend Update jokes were about events that happened three months ago.\n\nAgain, this is a guy who was so triggered by last night\u2019s SNL episode, he woke up this morning, and called for the Federal Communications Commission and (somehow) the Federal Election Commission to retaliate against the show, all while not being able to figure out that this was an old Christmas episode, or remember that he had already watched it three months ago.\n\nSure, this is a small thing in comparison to everything else that\u2019s wrong, objectionable, unfit, and scary about this guy. But it perfectly encapsulates just how far gone he is, and how utterly absurd it is that the Republican Senate is thus far unwilling to go along with impeachment and removal."

    "text": "It\u2019s still early in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. Very early. But with so many notable candidates having entered the race, and so much maneuvering and opinion-forming already underway, we\u2019ve reached a point where it\u2019s time to begin handicapping the field. These rankings are based on the full spectrum of available evidence, including performance vs expectations, momentum, and other factors. We\u2019ll update our rankings on a regular basis. And yes, statistically speaking, you\u2019re going to strongly disagree with us about at least some of these rankings.\n\n1) Kamala Harris: Her entry into the race has thus far managed to achieve the trifecta: broadly positive popular response to her candidacy, a wide embrace of her ideas and platform, and little interest in any (real or imaginary) scandals. This early on, the polls don\u2019t tell us anything about a candidate who has never run in a national race before, and who is still building name recognition. Every other factor says that, for the moment at least, she\u2019s the closest thing to a frontrunner that this crowded field has.\n\n2) Joe Biden: It\u2019s a testament to his built in broad popularity that he\u2019s not even in the race yet, and he\u2019s already one of the most popular and talked-about candidates. Most people out there think he already is in the race. Once he does enter the race, his decades-long track record in politics will work for and against him, and we\u2019ll see how that balances out. But for now, unless another first-timer can establish Kamala-like momentum, we\u2019re leaving Biden in the number two spot on this list.\n\n3) Elizabeth Warren: The bad news for her is that she\u2019s not getting nearly as much coverage and attention as she was getting two weeks ago. The good news for her is that the media hype about her \u201cheritage scandal\u201d has dissipated, now that the media has seen it\u2019s not as much of a ratings-friendly controversy as it had been hoping. We expect that voters are going to gradually figure out that Elizabeth Warren is a smarter, more capable, and less divisive version of Bernie Sanders, and that she\u2019ll pick up large chunks of his 2016 base along the way. If you\u2019ve been paying attention for the past decade, it was really her base to begin with.\n\n4) Beto O\u2019Rourke: His decision to wait so long to enter the race served its purpose, as the hype leading to his announcement was significant. The trouble is that by waiting, he put so much attention on his launch, it hurt him when he finally came out of the gate in a weird manner. He\u2019s already had to apologize in the past few days for a remark about his wife, and for something disturbing he wrote when he was in high school. We thought he\u2019d enter this list at #3 instead of #4, but as it turns out, he\u2019s got some things to clean up. Still, if he can salvage his botched launch, he can get back his momentum.\n\n5) Amy Klobuchar: She\u2019s managed to get past the \u201cangry boss\u201d scandal and the \u201ccomb\u201d scandal, as expected. She\u2019s always been considered broadly likable, and most people still view her that way. The challenge now is that she may get lost in the crowd.\n\n6) Cory Booker: We expected him to be higher on this list by now, but he hasn\u2019t had a particularly high profile since entering the race. That said, he has built-in popularity, which could allow him to climb higher later.\n\n7) Kirsten Gillibrand: When her name is mentioned, most people immediately bring up Al Franken. Fair or not, it\u2019s defining her campaign for now, and she\u2019ll have to find a way to get past that.\n\n8) Julian Castro: We really thought he\u2019d have more of an impact as a candidate by now. He was the first on this list to enter the race, and we\u2019re almost left wondering if he missed an opportunity for a higher-attention rollout by jumping in too early.\n\n9) Pete Buttigieg: He\u2019s the mayor of a small city, and he had zero national name recognition when he entered the race. We liked him, but we didn\u2019t think he had a chance. Yet each time the media gives him a narrow opportunity for exposure, he\u2019s come off very well \u2013 and he\u2019s emerging as a potential dark horse.\n\n10) Bernie Sanders: Many of you are spitting mad that we\u2019ve placed him this low on the list, while many of you are celebrating. That\u2019s his problem, of course. His support base is fierce but narrow, and most liberals and Democrats outside of his base don\u2019t like him at all. Bernie and Biden are the only two candidates in the race with a full dose of preexisting national name recognition, and the polls say Bernie is losing pretty badly to Biden. If anything, Bernie\u2019s numbers will drop as the first-time candidates gain more traction. We know this placement is controversial, but this is about odds of winning, not whose fans love him the most.\n\n11) Jay Inslee: He says he\u2019s running as a single-issue candidate so he can solely focus on climate change. That\u2019s laudable, as he\u2019ll force other candidates to place more focus on the issue. But it means he\u2019s not even trying to win, and it means he won\u2019t come close to winning.\n\n12) Andrew Yang: The attention he\u2019s getting so far is almost entirely positive. The trouble is that he\u2019s getting almost no attention. Pete Buttigieg has ended up with the dark horse spotlight that we thought Yang might get. Yang\u2019s challenge will be to climb just high enough to make it onto the main debate stage, so the average voter watching at home can find out he exists.\n\n13) John Hickenlooper: He\u2019s running to see if Democrats have an appetite for a straight up moderate candidate. They don\u2019t. We don\u2019t know why he\u2019s running, and we don\u2019t think he does either.\n\n14) Tulsi Gabbard: Even if you forgive her for her past anti-gay stances, she has no answers for her recent pro-Assad, pro-Putin, anti-Obama stances. Kremlin-controlled publication Russia Today loves her. Trump flunky Matt Gaetz has voiced strong support for her. Gabbard\u2019s campaign has gotten almost no traction, so now she\u2019s attacking the media, Trump-style. Something doesn\u2019t add up here."

No, twelve Republican Senators voted against Donald Trump on his signature campaign promise \u2013 the border wall that is still so popular with his base.\n\nThis is significant because this is a clear sign that at least twelve GOP Senators are sick of Donald Trump and will vote against him if they think they can get away with it politically, and they clearly do think they can get away with it. It just takes eight more Republican Senators willing to vote against Trump to get to the magic impeachment number. Eight may sound like a lot of additional Republican Senators to get to vote against Trump, and it is, but there are surely more than eight who are secretly sick of Donald Trump and would love to get his toxic and sloppy criminal family out of the White House and out of the Republican Party.\n\nThat means now is the time to release the Mueller Report, or, to release enough solid evidence that Trump and his family are guilty of high crimes, and begin impeachment. With nearly two years still left before the 2020 elections, Republican Senators could vote to oust Trump now, and in their mind they will have time to change the narrative of the 2020 elections and make it about something other than Trump.\n\nIf the impeachment process does not begin within the next five months, Republicans will argue that the process is a political stunt to hurt their chances in the upcoming elections, and they will be less likely to vote against Donald Trump, if he is still popular with the Republican base. If impeachment has any chance of succeeding, the vote needs to take place before Republican Senators begin campaigning for their own re-election."

    "text": "When Donald Trump first nominated William Barr to be his new Attorney General, it sent a lot of us looking over his several-decade record in politics, in the hope of figuring out what he\u2019d do once he got into power. After all, he\u2019d have a hand in Trump\u2019s racist DOJ agenda, and a hand in the Robert Mueller probe.\n\nWilliam Barr\u2019s record suggested two things. First, he\u2019d try to side with Donald Trump in the Mueller probe to the extent that he thought he legally could, but he wouldn\u2019t be willing to commit obstruction of justice on Trump\u2019s behalf. Second, Barr would eagerly get behind Trump\u2019s racist agenda, particularly with regard to immigrants. Sure enough, that\u2019s more or less precisely what we\u2019re seeing play out right now.\n\nIt\u2019s repulsive, and scary, that Barr loudly backed Donald Trump this week on his national emergency border wall stunt. It\u2019s a sign that Barr will try to use the DOJ to carry out racist policy in general, just as his predecessor Jeff Sessions did. This is something we need to fight back against every step of the way. That said, it is not a sign that Barr is going to do Trump\u2019s corrupt bidding when it comes to the Mueller probe.\n\nSince William Barr took office, we\u2019ve seen Robert Mueller post various court filings that have made Donald Trump and his regime look particularly criminal. Thus far Barr hasn\u2019t done anything to try to stop those filings from happening. Barr has also, obviously, not fired Mueller. Barr could be behind the persistent media leaks that Mueller is about to \u201cwind down\u201d his investigation at any moment, but even if so, those leaks haven\u2019t translated to anything negative for Mueller. Barr has declined to recuse himself, but he knows that if he did that, Trump would immediately fire him for it.\n\nSo far Attorney General William Barr has turned out to be a xenophobe who really wants use his position to stick it to non-white people, and a careful cretin who isn\u2019t willing to risk going to prison just to save Donald Trump\u2019s hide. Barr is Jeff Sessions all over again, just as we were expecting. That\u2019s bad news for America \u2013 but it\u2019s also bad news for Trump."

    "text": "An essential philosophical actuality comes to us compliments of Karl Popper, who tells us that if we are tolerant of everything, including intolerance itself, we are doomed to destruction. As a philosophy, therefore, a strict adherence to tolerance is unsustainable.\n\nContradicting that notion is a pastime commonly playing out on the internet these days \u2013 it\u2019s the sort of game I could easily imagine Kellyanne Conway playing \u2013 a game that tacitly assigns demerits to opponents for perceived hatefulness. It goes in principal like this: the debate belongs not to who has the best point, but who is the least hateful in how they say it. Thus comparisons are riddled, Kellyanne-like, with false equivalencies. They\u2019re intended to communicate that the real crimes in all activities between Trumpers and anti-Trumpers are committed by the participants who are, in language particularly, the most hateful. In other words, hateful speech is the actual crime, and actual \u201chate-crime\u201d is merely in the eye of the beholder. And if you are just as hateful in your speech as your opponent, then the debate is a tie and nobody wins.\n\nWell I call rubbish, or its more potent vulgar equivalent. We do not have time to temper our language or the volume of our invective when dealing with proponents of Donald Trump, and we particularly don\u2019t have to do it in order to be right or virtuous. I do not tolerate the notion that referring to Trump supporters as \u201cmorons\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d or even \u201cevil morons\u201d qualifies me for an automatic blot on my forensic escutcheon. I call Trump supporters evil morons because that is precisely what they are, and if you don\u2019t like it, you can jolly well lump it.\n\nThere is simply too much at stake in the world right now, so much so that we can no longer afford the luxury of polite tolerance. We don\u2019t know just how bad climate change is, or how quickly it will spell our ruin, which is precisely why we cannot afford to waste time with a man like Donald Trump. We do not know how close to midnight the Doomsday Clock is in actuality, we just know that we cannot afford to continue to permit a hamfisted evil idiot like Donald Trump to remain in charge of the nuclear codes.\n\nWe very well may survive Donald Trump as a species, even if we continue to tolerate him and his followers. But we shouldn\u2019t hesitate to fill every American, every Briton and every citizen of the world with appropriate and urgent dread \u2013 and an equivalent intolerance to match it."

    ],
    "text": "Donald Trump is clearly skilled enough at con artistry to cheat his way through an election and steal the presidency. But as good as he is at the whole fraud thing, he\u2019s just as good at sabotaging himself by saying or doing the dumbest thing possible at the worst possible time for him. We just saw a prime example of that when Trump abruptly turned what had been a comparatively quiet news day into a flaming toxic waste dump.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s SAT scores were so embarrassingly low that he made threats against anyone who might have been tempted to release them publicly, but we suspect that even Trump has just enough brain cells to count to twenty. That\u2019s the number of Senate Republicans who would have to go along with impeachment, if it\u2019s going to result in his ouster.\n\nWhen it comes to the GOP we\u2019re talking about a bunch of corrupt wishy-washy cowards, of course. But they\u2019ve spent the past week voting against Trump in increasing numbers, because they\u2019re getting the sense that his criminal scandals are going to take him down, and they don\u2019t want to go down with him.\n\nThe key number is twelve, because that\u2019s how many GOP Senators just voted against Trump on what he considers his most crucial issue, his national emergency border wall stunt. It was four last week, and now it\u2019s twelve, so it could be even higher by the time this comes back for a veto override vote. If and when it does reach twenty, it\u2019s time for Trump to panic. If twenty Senate Republicans are willing to vote to kill Trump\u2019s wall fantasy, then they\u2019re probably willing to vote to remove him from office if they conclude that it\u2019s what\u2019s selfishly best for their own Senate reelection chances.\n\nIn other words, with these weakling Senate Republicans now holding Donald Trump\u2019s fate in their quivering hands, it would be really smart of Trump to try to make nice with them, and to throw them a bone. After all, they\u2019re more likely to keep him around longer if they think they can get a bit more usefulness out of him.\n\nSo what did Donald Trump do in furtherance of this goal? He launched a vicious Twitter attack today on the late John McCain. Someone mentioned McCain on Fox News, and Trump was watching, and he just couldn\u2019t help himself. Trump has attacked McCain before and gotten away with it, but that was back when he still had leverage over the Republican Party. These days it\u2019s the opposite. Trump needs the GOP Senate\u2019s help to survive, and now he\u2019s attacking the patron saint of the GOP Senate.\n\nIt\u2019s not that any Republican Senators are saying to themselves, \u201cYou know what? I was going to stick with Donald Trump, but now that he\u2019s insulted John McCain, I\u2019m too offended to stick with him.\u201d They don\u2019t operate that way. But they do operate this way: \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to vote against Trump\u2019s survival, and I\u2019ve been afraid of taking too much heat for it, but now that he\u2019s attacked GOP war hero McCain, I can opportunistically sell that to my constituents as the reason I had to finally turn against him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not even that the GOP Senate will use this now. They\u2019ll stick it in their back pocket, for when Robert Mueller\u2019s report comes out and fully exposes Donald Trump for the criminal and traitor he is, and the inevitable impeachment movement begins. At whatever point these Republican Senators selfishly calculate that it\u2019s in their best interest to throw Trump to the SDNY wolves, whether it\u2019s weeks or months from now, they\u2019ll start making a big deal out of the fact that Trump attacked McCain today. Trump just made it so much easier for the GOP to dunk him once it finally decides to."

    ],
    "text": "Last week \u201cJudge\u201d Jeanine Pirro launched into such a stunningly racist attack against Congresswoman Ilhan Omar in particular, and against Muslim Americans in general, it was jarring even by Fox News standards. Fox quickly released a statement distancing itself from Pirro\u2019s tirade. Now she\u2019s gone missing from the air altogether.\n\nJeanine Pirro\u2019s show has been pulled off the air tonight, in favor of a rerun of some other Fox News program. The decision was apparently made at the last minute, as Variety managed to suss out that Fox had been running advertisements for a new Pirro episode as recently as a few days ago. So what\u2019s really going on here?\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this strategy from Fox News a number of times before. When controversial hosts Bill O\u2019Reilly and Laura Ingraham came up against huge scandals that were causing advertisers to flee, Fox News sent them each on a conveniently timed vacation in the hope that their absence from the airwaves would cause the controversy to die down, so they could then return. It worked for Ingraham, who is still on the air, albeit far less profitably. It didn\u2019t work for O\u2019Reilly, who was fired after his \u201cvacation\u201d didn\u2019t put a dent in his scandals.\n\nSo we\u2019ll see if Fox News has merely taken Judge Jeanine Pirro off the air for tonight, or if this ends up being permanent. Considering that Tucker Carlson is losing advertisers by the day, and Sean Hannity is caught up in the Trump-Cohen scandal, will there be anyone left at Fox before much longer? In any case, Pirro is one of Donald Trump\u2019s favorites. Perhaps he\u2019ll be lashing out at Fox News before the night\u2019s end."

    "text": "It\u2019s still early in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. Very early. But with so many notable candidates having entered the race, and so much maneuvering and opinion-forming already underway, we\u2019ve reached a point where it\u2019s time to begin handicapping the field. These rankings are based on the full spectrum of available evidence, including performance vs expectations, momentum, and other factors. We\u2019ll update our rankings on a regular basis. And yes, statistically speaking, you\u2019re going to strongly disagree with us about at least some of these rankings.\n\n1) Kamala Harris: Her entry into the race has thus far managed to achieve the trifecta: broadly positive popular response to her candidacy, a wide embrace of her ideas and platform, and little interest in any (real or imaginary) scandals. This early on, the polls don\u2019t tell us anything about a candidate who has never run in a national race before, and who is still building name recognition. Every other factor says that, for the moment at least, she\u2019s the closest thing to a frontrunner that this crowded field has.\n\n2) Joe Biden: It\u2019s a testament to his built in broad popularity that he\u2019s not even in the race yet, and he\u2019s already one of the most popular and talked-about candidates. Most people out there think he already is in the race. Once he does enter the race, his decades-long track record in politics will work for and against him, and we\u2019ll see how that balances out. But for now, unless another first-timer can establish Kamala-like momentum, we\u2019re leaving Biden in the number two spot on this list.\n\n3) Elizabeth Warren: The bad news for her is that she\u2019s not getting nearly as much coverage and attention as she was getting two weeks ago. The good news for her is that the media hype about her \u201cheritage scandal\u201d has dissipated, now that the media has seen it\u2019s not as much of a ratings-friendly controversy as it had been hoping. We expect that voters are going to gradually figure out that Elizabeth Warren is a smarter, more capable, and less divisive version of Bernie Sanders, and that she\u2019ll pick up large chunks of his 2016 base along the way. If you\u2019ve been paying attention for the past decade, it was really her base to begin with.\n\n4) Beto O\u2019Rourke: His decision to wait so long to enter the race served its purpose, as the hype leading to his announcement was significant. The trouble is that by waiting, he put so much attention on his launch, it hurt him when he finally came out of the gate in a weird manner. He\u2019s already had to apologize in the past few days for a remark about his wife, and for something disturbing he wrote when he was in high school. We thought he\u2019d enter this list at #3 instead of #4, but as it turns out, he\u2019s got some things to clean up. Still, if he can salvage his botched launch, he can get back his momentum.\n\n5) Amy Klobuchar: She\u2019s managed to get past the \u201cangry boss\u201d scandal and the \u201ccomb\u201d scandal, as expected. She\u2019s always been considered broadly likable, and most people still view her that way. The challenge now is that she may get lost in the crowd.\n\n6) Cory Booker: We expected him to be higher on this list by now, but he hasn\u2019t had a particularly high profile since entering the race. That said, he has built-in popularity, which could allow him to climb higher later.\n\n7) Kirsten Gillibrand: When her name is mentioned, most people immediately bring up Al Franken. Fair or not, it\u2019s defining her campaign for now, and she\u2019ll have to find a way to get past that.\n\n8) Julian Castro: We really thought he\u2019d have more of an impact as a candidate by now. He was the first on this list to enter the race, and we\u2019re almost left wondering if he missed an opportunity for a higher-attention rollout by jumping in too early.\n\n9) Pete Buttigieg: He\u2019s the mayor of a small city, and he had zero national name recognition when he entered the race. We liked him, but we didn\u2019t think he had a chance. Yet each time the media gives him a narrow opportunity for exposure, he\u2019s come off very well \u2013 and he\u2019s emerging as a potential dark horse.\n\n10) Bernie Sanders: Many of you are spitting mad that we\u2019ve placed him this low on the list, while many of you are celebrating. That\u2019s his problem, of course. His support base is fierce but narrow, and most liberals and Democrats outside of his base don\u2019t like him at all. Bernie and Biden are the only two candidates in the race with a full dose of preexisting national name recognition, and the polls say Bernie is losing pretty badly to Biden. If anything, Bernie\u2019s numbers will drop as the first-time candidates gain more traction. We know this placement is controversial, but this is about odds of winning, not whose fans love him the most.\n\n11) Jay Inslee: He says he\u2019s running as a single-issue candidate so he can solely focus on climate change. That\u2019s laudable, as he\u2019ll force other candidates to place more focus on the issue. But it means he\u2019s not even trying to win, and it means he won\u2019t come close to winning.\n\n12) Andrew Yang: The attention he\u2019s getting so far is almost entirely positive. The trouble is that he\u2019s getting almost no attention. Pete Buttigieg has ended up with the dark horse spotlight that we thought Yang might get. Yang\u2019s challenge will be to climb just high enough to make it onto the main debate stage, so the average voter watching at home can find out he exists.\n\n13) John Hickenlooper: He\u2019s running to see if Democrats have an appetite for a straight up moderate candidate. They don\u2019t. We don\u2019t know why he\u2019s running, and we don\u2019t think he does either.\n\n14) Tulsi Gabbard: Even if you forgive her for her past anti-gay stances, she has no answers for her recent pro-Assad, pro-Putin, anti-Obama stances. Kremlin-controlled publication Russia Today loves her. Trump flunky Matt Gaetz has voiced strong support for her. Gabbard\u2019s campaign has gotten almost no traction, so now she\u2019s attacking the media, Trump-style. Something doesn\u2019t add up here."

Trump, a five time draft dodger, has always been resentful of the across-the-board respect that McCain has engendered.

As the Republican votes against Trump have continued to rack up this week, Trump has tried to act like he was just fine with his own party selling him out. But then Trump went and betrayed his true feelings today, posting this tweet about McCain:\n\nSpreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier \u201cis unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain.\u201d Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel. He had far worse \u201cstains\u201d than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!\n\nIn other words, Donald Trump is scared to death of what\u2019s happening to him right now, and he\u2019s lashing out accordingly. After attacking John McCain, Trump went on to also attack General Motors, China, Hillary Clinton, and Google. When going after GM, he insisted that the company comply with his demands quickly, because \u201cTime is of the essence!\u201d Trump knows he\u2019s a man who\u2019s out of time."

Two of the most influential states in the United States. One iconic American company, and one newly crucial American company. This reads a lot like the kind of anti-American list you\u2019d expect Al Qaeda to publish, and yet it\u2019s coming directly from the mouth of the \u201cPresident\u201d of the United States.\n\nOf course there\u2019s one demographic missing from Donald Trump\u2019s attack list: white supremacists.

    "text": "Donald Trump is still the president of the United States, but the past week has revealed that his power is fading. The week began with Speaker Nancy Pelosi telling The Washington Post on Monday that the House will consider impeachment if there is \u201csomething so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan.\u201d It is not hard to imagine that something \u201ccompelling and overwhelming\u201d will arise, given how much the investigations have already produced. But when push comes to shove, will Congress care more about protecting Trump or the truth?\n\nThere is certainly cause for concern that the \u201cbipartisan\u201d part of Pelosi\u2019s impeachment test could fail. But there is also now some reason to be optimistic. Republicans in Congress made it clear this week that they are not afraid to work with Democrats to rebuke Trump on a range of topics.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate rebuked Trump by passing a second resolution to stop U.S. military aid for the war in Yemen. The 54-46 vote effectively scolded Trump for blindly defending Saudi Arabia in the gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi and its shameful coverup. A House resolution is now expected to pass after one that passed in February hit a procedural snag.\n\nThe bipartisan rebuking of Donald Trump continued two more times on Thursday. First, the Senate voted 59-41 to overturn Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration over the southern border. Trump\u2019s declaration came after he threw a tantrum and \u201cproudly\u201d shut down the government for a record 35 days. The Senate resolution, following a 245-182 House vote in February, means that Congress is now shutting down Trump for veering way out of his lane. Predictably, Trump fired back on Friday with a veto. But the fact it is his first veto is yet another sign that Trump\u2019s grip on government is slipping.\n\nThursday\u2019s other rebuke of Trump came in the form of a rare unanimous House resolution about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. In a 420-0 vote (with four GOP members voting \u201cpresent\u201d), the House called for the Attorney General to release Mueller\u2019s upcoming report to the public. This non-binding resolution does not have the power of law, yet the House GOP decided it was important to send Trump a unified demand for transparency. Now, as a new week begins, Trump continues to sit in the Oval Office. But the chair he is sitting on looks much less like a throne."

Both the AP and the BBC report she may have been poisoned with a radioactive substance.\n\nBerlusconi\u2019s relationship with Putin is deep and troubling. Putin, in fact, cultivated Berlusconi personally over the years. The former Italian PM\u2019s biggest defender in the underage prostitute scandal was, why, Putin. Of course. Polonium anyone? Do you ever wonder why Trump likes his fast food? Delivered to him personally by the Secret Service? Even he admitted his Filet O\u2019 Fish is too hard to poison."

    "text": "When dealing with someone as malignantly narcissistic, sociopathic, and delusional as Donald Trump, it can be tricky to figure out what he\u2019s really thinking and feeling, because his thought processes are often incompatible with that of a mentally competent person.\n\nTake, for instance, Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing approach toward Special Counsel Robert Mueller. There are reports going back more than a year that he has periodically told his handlers to fire Mueller, only for them to tell him they refuse to do it. Then Trump just goes along with it, making clear that he\u2019s not the one driving the train. Does he understand that Mueller is going to take him down? Does he only try to fire Mueller now and then out of annoyance, as opposed to a true understanding of the situation?\n\nThis week The House unanimously voted for a resolution stating that Robert Mueller\u2019s report should be public. This is a bodyblow to Trump, because even his closest Republican allies in the House felt compelled to give a vote of confidence to Mueller, for fear that it would blow back on them. And of course Mueller\u2019s report becoming public will be the tipping point in ending his presidency. But does Trump know that?\n\nHere\u2019s what Donald Trump just tweeted about it: \u201cOn the recent non-binding vote (420-0) in Congress about releasing the Mueller Report, I told leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency. Makes us all look good and doesn\u2019t matter. Play along with the game!\u201d Well, no, this is not what happened. But is Trump saying this because he\u2019s just putting on a brave face in defeat, or because he\u2019s actually convinced himself to believe it? Unraveling sociopaths can be so tricky to parse."

    "text": "On Thursday, white supremacist propaganda site Breitbart published a new interview with Donald Trump. In that interview, Trump semi-coherently threatened to have bikers carry out unspecified violence against the American people if they don\u2019t reelect him or don\u2019t support him. Half a day later, a white supremacist murdered forty-nine Muslims in New Zealand, while specifically crediting Donald Trump.\n\nDid Donald Trump\u2019s latest violent threat about bikers cause the New Zealand shooting to happen? No. But it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s overall ongoing violent and racist rhetoric did at least partially contribute to motivating this monstrous shooter to do what he did. Trump\u2019s bodycount, which already includes Heather Heyer as well as the children who have died in his immigrant concentration camps, just climbed even higher.\n\nTrump\u2019s response to the shooting was to tweet a late-night link to Breitbart last night, which he\u2019s since deleted. Then at the White House on Friday, Trump told the television cameras that the shooting is one of the reasons he wants to build a wall to keep immigrants out.\n\nThe nerve of this guy. The shooter was a white racist, and he was targeting minority immigrants, and yet Trump still tried to spin it to fit his narrative of minority immigrants targeting white people. But then we expect this kind of toxic scumbaggery from Donald Trump. He\u2019s literally the worst person \u2013 or at least the singularly most negatively impactful person \u2013 on the planet. What came next was flabbergasting, however.\n\nWhen various people accurately pointed out that Donald Trump\u2019s violent racist rhetoric played some role in the New Zealand shooting, Trump\u2019s supporters began insisting that Trump has never made any sort of violent threat, and that he\u2019s never said anything racist. This was one day after Trump explicitly threatened to turn bikers loose on the American people, and a few hours after Trump pushed his racist wall agenda yet again.\n\nIt\u2019s a jarring reminder that Donald Trump\u2019s remaining supporters are so far gone psychologically, they can\u2019t even process what\u2019s going on. Trump makes a violent threat, and the next day they\u2019re insisting it never happened. This has all the hallmarks of cult behavior. It\u2019s just that the Trump cult consists of the lowest of people to begin with. These are dangerously deranged people to begin with; Trump\u2019s cult-like leadership has merely enabled them to take things even further into the breach."

In New Zealand, there was a horrible terror attack against the Muslim community during their prayer service, with the death toll as of today reaching fifty. This is an awful experience, the likes of which I have lived through personally when I lived in Israel. Terror is global and it has no remorse, no matter if the victims are women, children, elderly. It comes in many forms, and this week it came in the form of white supremacy.\n\nRight wing media plays a key part using incitement against Muslims. We see the same incitement against the Jewish people with anti-Semitism, which brings me to my main point of this column. Chelsea Clinton went to a vigil to show solidarity with the Muslim Community and was ambushed by an angry Muslim NYC student.\n\nThe student said that Chelsea\u2019s claim that Congresswoman Ilan Omar\u2019s questioning of Israel\u2019s policy was anti-Semitic, was partly responsible for inciting the white terrorist to kill the fifty Muslims in New Zealand. I understand the frustrations and concerns the student had and they were just, but the anger was misdirected. It seemed like there was no one there for her to lash out at about her feelings, and it just so happened to be that Chelsea Clinton was there.\n\nI also hope that the student wasn\u2019t intentionally using this time to seek attention, because at a vigil, this wasn\u2019t the right time to do it. The purpose of the vigil is to honor the dead, and taking your anger out on someone who is nowhere near to blame is irresponsible, and it does not help the situation.\n\nI also want to take this opportunity to say, it\u2019s okay to fight antisemitism and Islamophobia at the same time. Even though Congresswoman Omar had every right to question a foreign country\u2019s policy, Chelsea Clinton, as an American citizen, had the right to question the Congresswoman\u2019s words, and in the long run they had a civil discourse about it. And that\u2019s how things work in a Democracy: we talk to each other. We may have current leadership in the White House who may think otherwise, but he will find out that he is not above the law, as no one is.\n\nAs a Jew, I have seen numerous instances of antisemitism. As a liberal Jew, I have seen support from the Muslim community in fighting against antisemitism, as well as seen the liberal Jewish community fighting against Islamophobia. We should continue this fight together, and keep ourselves in check because we need everyone\u2019s support in this. Misdirected anger will only push people away. Chelsea Clinton, I want you to know, you handled the situation with class, and you have my full respect."

    "text": "Donald Trump is clearly skilled enough at con artistry to cheat his way through an election and steal the presidency. But as good as he is at the whole fraud thing, he\u2019s just as good at sabotaging himself by saying or doing the dumbest thing possible at the worst possible time for him. We just saw a prime example of that when Trump abruptly turned what had been a comparatively quiet news day into a flaming toxic waste dump.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s SAT scores were so embarrassingly low that he made threats against anyone who might have been tempted to release them publicly, but we suspect that even Trump has just enough brain cells to count to twenty. That\u2019s the number of Senate Republicans who would have to go along with impeachment, if it\u2019s going to result in his ouster.\n\nWhen it comes to the GOP we\u2019re talking about a bunch of corrupt wishy-washy cowards, of course. But they\u2019ve spent the past week voting against Trump in increasing numbers, because they\u2019re getting the sense that his criminal scandals are going to take him down, and they don\u2019t want to go down with him.\n\nThe key number is twelve, because that\u2019s how many GOP Senators just voted against Trump on what he considers his most crucial issue, his national emergency border wall stunt. It was four last week, and now it\u2019s twelve, so it could be even higher by the time this comes back for a veto override vote. If and when it does reach twenty, it\u2019s time for Trump to panic. If twenty Senate Republicans are willing to vote to kill Trump\u2019s wall fantasy, then they\u2019re probably willing to vote to remove him from office if they conclude that it\u2019s what\u2019s selfishly best for their own Senate reelection chances.\n\nIn other words, with these weakling Senate Republicans now holding Donald Trump\u2019s fate in their quivering hands, it would be really smart of Trump to try to make nice with them, and to throw them a bone. After all, they\u2019re more likely to keep him around longer if they think they can get a bit more usefulness out of him.\n\nSo what did Donald Trump do in furtherance of this goal? He launched a vicious Twitter attack today on the late John McCain. Someone mentioned McCain on Fox News, and Trump was watching, and he just couldn\u2019t help himself. Trump has attacked McCain before and gotten away with it, but that was back when he still had leverage over the Republican Party. These days it\u2019s the opposite. Trump needs the GOP Senate\u2019s help to survive, and now he\u2019s attacking the patron saint of the GOP Senate.\n\nIt\u2019s not that any Republican Senators are saying to themselves, \u201cYou know what? I was going to stick with Donald Trump, but now that he\u2019s insulted John McCain, I\u2019m too offended to stick with him.\u201d They don\u2019t operate that way. But they do operate this way: \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to vote against Trump\u2019s survival, and I\u2019ve been afraid of taking too much heat for it, but now that he\u2019s attacked GOP war hero McCain, I can opportunistically sell that to my constituents as the reason I had to finally turn against him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not even that the GOP Senate will use this now. They\u2019ll stick it in their back pocket, for when Robert Mueller\u2019s report comes out and fully exposes Donald Trump for the criminal and traitor he is, and the inevitable impeachment movement begins. At whatever point these Republican Senators selfishly calculate that it\u2019s in their best interest to throw Trump to the SDNY wolves, whether it\u2019s weeks or months from now, they\u2019ll start making a big deal out of the fact that Trump attacked McCain today. Trump just made it so much easier for the GOP to dunk him once it finally decides to."

Fox quickly released a statement distancing itself from Pirro\u2019s tirade. Now she\u2019s gone missing from the air altogether.\n\nJeanine Pirro\u2019s show has been pulled off the air tonight, in favor of a rerun of some other Fox News program. The decision was apparently made at the last minute, as Variety managed to suss out that Fox had been running advertisements for a new Pirro episode as recently as a few days ago. So what\u2019s really going on here?\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this strategy from Fox News a number of times before. When controversial hosts Bill O\u2019Reilly and Laura Ingraham came up against huge scandals that were causing advertisers to flee, Fox News sent them each on a conveniently timed vacation in the hope that their absence from the airwaves would cause the controversy to die down, so they could then return. It worked for Ingraham, who is still on the air, albeit far less profitably. It didn\u2019t work for O\u2019Reilly, who was fired after his \u201cvacation\u201d didn\u2019t put a dent in his scandals.\n\nSo we\u2019ll see if Fox News has merely taken Judge Jeanine Pirro off the air for tonight, or if this ends up being permanent. Considering that Tucker Carlson is losing advertisers by the day, and Sean Hannity is caught up in the Trump-Cohen scandal, will there be anyone left at Fox before much longer? In any case, Pirro is one of Donald Trump\u2019s favorites. Perhaps he\u2019ll be lashing out at Fox News before the night\u2019s end."

Mueller and Gates jointly asked the judge for a sixty day delay, because Gates is still actively cooperating. This is a big deal.\n\nRobert Mueller told the courts a few months ago that his work was complete with his other key cooperator, Michael Flynn. This came despite the fact that Flynn\u2019s former business partner is just now headed to trial. So it\u2019s not as if Mueller is keeping all of his cooperators on board just in case they have to testify at trials. He has a reason, and a big one, for specifically keeping Rick Gates in the fold for another two months. It logically has to be about an ongoing investigation.\n\nSo what ongoing investigation are we talking about here? Rick Gates was closest with Paul Manafort, but Mueller is now 100% done with Manafort. In fact, Mueller and his allies have already taken down the key Trump campaign players, including Manafort, Flynn, Michael Cohen, and George Papadopoulos. At this point the still-unfolding investigations appear to be more centered around the Trump administration and Trump transition team. Gates never worked in the administration, so that leaves us with the transition team.\n\nSo the clues strongly point to Robert Mueller actively investigating key players involved in the Trump transition team and the inauguration. Donald Trump fired Chris Christie as the head of the transition team and replaced him with Mike Pence. A recent book asserts that Trump specifically did this so he could embezzle the donations that had been made for the inauguration. This would only have made sense if Pence was criminally complicit. Is Pence the target?\n\nIn any case, the biggest clue of all here may be that while sentencing hearings are usually delayed by ninety days by default, in this instance Robert Mueller is asking for just sixty more days with Rick Gates. This seems to suggest that Mueller expects his current Gates-related investigation to be safely concluded, complete with any corresponding indictments, within sixty days and not ninety."

Now House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings has put this information to good use.\n\nThe reporter in question is no longer with Fox News and is bound by a nondisclosure agreement with the network, but she recently hinted that if Congress were to require her to cooperate, it would free her to go ahead and reveal all the details. Sure enough, Elijah Cummings has now done just that \u2013 and the reporter is not only going to turn over the documents, she\u2019s going to show up and testify next week.\n\nThis remarkable news from the Los Angeles Times doesn\u2019t specify whether the former Fox News reporter, whose name is Diana Falzone, will testify in public or in private. But either way, this is a big deal for two reasons. First, it means the House Oversight Committee gets to expose just how scandalous Fox\u2019s relationship with Trump is \u2013 and that falls under the committee\u2019s purview because it has oversight over everything Trump does.\n\nSecond, this means that the House Oversight Committee is about to gain access to all the information that Falzone dug up on the story. Thus far we\u2019ve heard what Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen know. But Falzone may have uncovered additional details about the scandal that neither of them are aware of, potentially surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s role in the scandal. Stay tuned."

The week began with Speaker Nancy Pelosi telling The Washington Post on Monday that the House will consider impeachment if there is \u201csomething so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan.\u201d It is not hard to imagine that something \u201ccompelling and overwhelming\u201d will arise, given how much the investigations have already produced. But when push comes to shove, will Congress care more about protecting Trump or the truth?\n\nThere is certainly cause for concern that the \u201cbipartisan\u201d part of Pelosi\u2019s impeachment test could fail. But there is also now some reason to be optimistic. Republicans in Congress made it clear this week that they are not afraid to work with Democrats to rebuke Trump on a range of topics.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate rebuked Trump by passing a second resolution to stop U.S. military aid for the war in Yemen. The 54-46 vote effectively scolded Trump for blindly defending Saudi Arabia in the gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi and its shameful coverup. A House resolution is now expected to pass after one that passed in February hit a procedural snag.\n\nThe bipartisan rebuking of Donald Trump continued two more times on Thursday. First, the Senate voted 59-41 to overturn Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration over the southern border. Trump\u2019s declaration came after he threw a tantrum and \u201cproudly\u201d shut down the government for a record 35 days. The Senate resolution, following a 245-182 House vote in February, means that Congress is now shutting down Trump for veering way out of his lane. Predictably, Trump fired back on Friday with a veto. But the fact it is his first veto is yet another sign that Trump\u2019s grip on government is slipping.\n\nThursday\u2019s other rebuke of Trump came in the form of a rare unanimous House resolution about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. In a 420-0 vote (with four GOP members voting \u201cpresent\u201d), the House called for the Attorney General to release Mueller\u2019s upcoming report to the public. This non-binding resolution does not have the power of law, yet the House GOP decided it was important to send Trump a unified demand for transparency. Now, as a new week begins, Trump continues to sit in the Oval Office. But the chair he is sitting on looks much less like a throne."

Some other Trump associates, such as Michael Caputo, have publicly stated that they\u2019re going to resist. Members of the House Judiciary Committee have publicly stated that several unnamed people on the request list have already begun turning over large amounts of documents.\n\nWe\u2019ll find out on Monday, or perhaps first thing Tuesday morning, who complied and who didn\u2019t. Then we\u2019ll see subpoenas flying accordingly. We\u2019ve seen that the committee is not messing around. Now we\u2019ll see how many new cooperating witnesses there are against Donald Trump.

    "text": "When dealing with someone as malignantly narcissistic, sociopathic, and delusional as Donald Trump, it can be tricky to figure out what he\u2019s really thinking and feeling, because his thought processes are often incompatible with that of a mentally competent person.\n\nTake, for instance, Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing approach toward Special Counsel Robert Mueller. There are reports going back more than a year that he has periodically told his handlers to fire Mueller, only for them to tell him they refuse to do it. Then Trump just goes along with it, making clear that he\u2019s not the one driving the train. Does he understand that Mueller is going to take him down? Does he only try to fire Mueller now and then out of annoyance, as opposed to a true understanding of the situation?\n\nThis week The House unanimously voted for a resolution stating that Robert Mueller\u2019s report should be public. This is a bodyblow to Trump, because even his closest Republican allies in the House felt compelled to give a vote of confidence to Mueller, for fear that it would blow back on them. And of course Mueller\u2019s report becoming public will be the tipping point in ending his presidency. But does Trump know that?\n\nHere\u2019s what Donald Trump just tweeted about it: \u201cOn the recent non-binding vote (420-0) in Congress about releasing the Mueller Report, I told leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency. Makes us all look good and doesn\u2019t matter. Play along with the game!\u201d Well, no, this is not what happened. But is Trump saying this because he\u2019s just putting on a brave face in defeat, or because he\u2019s actually convinced himself to believe it? Unraveling sociopaths can be so tricky to parse."

He helped engineer the illegitimate Brexit vote that Putin wanted so badly, he\u2019s been caught conspiring with Julian Assange, and more. Yesterday, after Britain came closer to canceling Brexit, Farage began privately begging European Union nations to kick Britain out \u2013 and he got caught in the act. He\u2019s toast now.\n\nIt got me thinking about how I know Donald Trump is going down. You see, Nigel Farage is the Donald Trump of Great Britain. He\u2019s a Kremlin controlled ringer whose only job is to weaken his nation as thoroughly as possible from within, while keeping just enough racists happy to retain a slight grip on power. Farage is roughly as whacked out as Trump is, but even Farage had to have known that asking the EU to kick Britain out was the kind of step that could put him on an inevitable path to his downfall. The thing is, though, Farage didn\u2019t have a choice.\n\nThe thing about compromised middlemen like Trump and Farage is that they don\u2019t get to decide what their own actions are going to be; their puppet master does. That means even if they want to pull back from a particularly risky ploy, they have to go through with it if it\u2019s what Putin wants. They can\u2019t take steps to protect themselves, which is why they always end up going down in the end.\n\nThe only two questions are how much damage they\u2019ll manage to do before their downfall, and whether or not their puppet master goes down with them. The puppet master gets to control his own actions, so he\u2019s in a far better position to protect himself. Then again, Vladimir Putin is rather beholden to his puppet master oligarchs, so we\u2019ll see if he survives. But Donald Trump and Nigel Farage are going to prison. In hindsight, they never stood a chance."

Obviously, this laughable article has been slapped together by Team Trump to try to help Junior keep up his delusions about somehow surviving his worsening criminal scandals.\n\nThe reality of course is that Donald Trump Jr will be in prison by 2024. Even if Donald Trump were to succeed in pardoning his son on federal charges, we saw this week that New York is bringing state level criminal charges against Trump\u2019s henchmen. So yeah, Junior would be talking about running for president from his prison cell.\n\nFor reference, Eugene Debs ran for president in the 1920 election, and he received 3.4% of the vote despite the fact that he was in prison at the time. He didn\u2019t come close to winning, but he set a legal precedent that you can run for president from a prison cell. So maybe Donald Trump Jr is onto something here. Perhaps his cellmate can end up being his running mate."

    "text": "Even as various House committees simultaneously investigate various Donald Trump scandals, the House Oversight Committee has taken up the lead on the security clearance scandal involving Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. This has left Chairman Elijah Cummings in charge of the matter. Naturally, the Trump regime is trying to stonewall him. So he\u2019s found a way to work around that.\n\nOne of the goals in the security clearance investigation is to find out precisely why former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and former White House Counsel Don McGahn felt that Ivanka and Jared were security risks against the United States. The two key pieces of evidence: the memos that Kelly and McGahn each wrote, documenting their concerns. Elijah Cummings knows the White House will fight tooth and nail to avoid having to turn over those memos, because Trump wants to protect his family.\n\nPalmer Report pointed out earlier this month that if Kelly and McGahn felt strongly enough that they needed to write and file these memos in order to insulate themselves from what Donald Trump was doing, then they certainly would have kept copies of their own. We also pointed out that because Kelly and McGahn have both reportedly been cooperating with Robert Mueller, they\u2019re likely to cooperate with Congress as well.\n\nSure enough, Elijah Cummings has taken the unorthodox step of having his staff reach out directly to John Kelly, as opposed to going through the White House. This is according to CNN, which doesn\u2019t spell out whether Kelly turned over the memo to Cummings. But considering the apoplectic response from the Trump regime when it learned that Cummings had contacted Kelly, we\u2019re guessing Cummings now has the memo. We told you that Cummings knows what he\u2019s doing."

Deripaska is connected to Paul Manafort, who recently was sentenced twice in one week, then indicted by New York.\n\nIn April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on Deripaska and more than twenty other Russian nationals, citing evidence that Deripaska \u201chas been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering.\u201d In January 2019, the United States Treasury, per instructions from Steve Mnuchin and Trump, removed sanctions against Deripaska\u2019s companies, but the ones on him personally remained. Deripaska, not liking being addressed with constraints, has on Friday filed a lawsuit against Mnuchin and others.\n\nDeripaska claims in his suit that the sanctions are devastating to him, claiming in one paragraph: \u201cThe consequence of Defendants\u2019 unlawful action has been the utter devastation of Deripaska\u2019s wealth, reputation, and economic livelihood. As a result of his designations and the sanctions risk to foreign parties dealing with him or his businesses, Deripaska has been effectively shut out from the international business community and the global financial system.

In that interview, Trump semi-coherently threatened to have bikers carry out unspecified violence against the American people if they don\u2019t reelect him or don\u2019t support him. Half a day later, a white supremacist murdered forty-nine Muslims in New Zealand, while specifically crediting Donald Trump.\n\nDid Donald Trump\u2019s latest violent threat about bikers cause the New Zealand shooting to happen? No. But it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s overall ongoing violent and racist rhetoric did at least partially contribute to motivating this monstrous shooter to do what he did. Trump\u2019s bodycount, which already includes Heather Heyer as well as the children who have died in his immigrant concentration camps, just climbed even higher.\n\nTrump\u2019s response to the shooting was to tweet a late-night link to Breitbart last night, which he\u2019s since deleted. Then at the White House on Friday, Trump told the television cameras that the shooting is one of the reasons he wants to build a wall to keep immigrants out.\n\nThe nerve of this guy. The shooter was a white racist, and he was targeting minority immigrants, and yet Trump still tried to spin it to fit his narrative of minority immigrants targeting white people. But then we expect this kind of toxic scumbaggery from Donald Trump. He\u2019s literally the worst person \u2013 or at least the singularly most negatively impactful person \u2013 on the planet. What came next was flabbergasting, however.\n\nWhen various people accurately pointed out that Donald Trump\u2019s violent racist rhetoric played some role in the New Zealand shooting, Trump\u2019s supporters began insisting that Trump has never made any sort of violent threat, and that he\u2019s never said anything racist. This was one day after Trump explicitly threatened to turn bikers loose on the American people, and a few hours after Trump pushed his racist wall agenda yet again.\n\nIt\u2019s a jarring reminder that Donald Trump\u2019s remaining supporters are so far gone psychologically, they can\u2019t even process what\u2019s going on. Trump makes a violent threat, and the next day they\u2019re insisting it never happened. This has all the hallmarks of cult behavior. It\u2019s just that the Trump cult consists of the lowest of people to begin with. These are dangerously deranged people to begin with; Trump\u2019s cult-like leadership has merely enabled them to take things even further into the breach."

After Strzok testified before the House Intelligence Committee, his name began to fade in the media, and he only got the occasional reference in Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\nYesterday the complete transcript of Strzok\u2019s testimony from last June was released to the public. To no one\u2019s surprise, the hearing doesn\u2019t exonerate Trump even remotely. It casts Trump and House Republicans in an even worse light than before, and dispels any notion of a deep state conspiracy. Strzok was removed from the investigation by Robert Mueller for several anti-Trump texts, in order to make sure that an independent investigation into the campaign stayed independent and impartial. House Republicans, however, aren\u2019t concerned about impartiality and did all they could to take messages exchanged by Peter Strzok and Lisa Page out of context.\n\nStrzok\u2019s text \u201cWe\u2019ll stop it,\u201d was held up as a smoking gun \u2013 unmistakable proof that the FBI was thwarting a Trump presidency.

The FBI briefed Trump campaign officials at least twice, warning them that Russia was trying to intervene on their behalf and to contact the FBI if anything seemed suspicious. Michael Flynn, Chris Christie and Donald Trump sat in on those meetings and chose not to call the FBI back.\n\nI suppose Donald Trump could use the excuse that he wasn\u2019t paying attention, but this bodes poorly for a whole lot of Republicans \u2013 not least of all former Congressman Trey Gowdy, who tried to tear apart each word of Strzok\u2019s testimony in the hope that he could get Strzok to leak out more information on the investigation \u2013 a way to obstruct justice and perhaps find a way to charge Strzok, who wasn\u2019t taking the bait."

You\u2019re doing a stellar job there. See *New Zealand*.)\n\nThe second and most glaring is that Robert Mueller is stalking Donald Trump like a boss, and Trump is feeling the heat. Congress doesn\u2019t make much of an impression on Trump, as he doesn\u2019t understand how it works. But words like \u201cRICO\u201d and \u201cNew York State Attorney\u201d make a big impression on him. Those words are starting to creep inside his gold-electroplated false sense of security, and he\u2019s freaking out.\n\nYes, Trump lives in a bubble. But every now and then, he gets the real news. Rick Gates needing another 60 days before sentencing isn\u2019t sitting well with The Donald, nor is the fact that Mueller really does not seem to be winding up what must be a very complicated and wide-reaching probe. The rumors of Mueller\u2019s demise are exaggerated. And, I suspect, largely generated from inside the White House.\n\nThe worst news of all: the House unanimously voted to make public the Mueller Report, and the Senate will also pass it by a veto-proof majority. So there\u2019s no stifling it. The Donald\u2019s bubble is getting ready to burst. Will he create another distraction? You bet. Will it work? No. We\u2019ve been waiting too long and too patiently to see what Trump & Co. have been up to. There is no way to keep a lid on this.\n\nBut will the Deplorables rise up to defend him? No. All we will have to do is run a marathon of Honey Boo Boo episodes, and we\u2019re good."

According to Trump he would have rushed in and saved the day, even if he\u2019d been unarmed. So when Donald Trump criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May by saying he could have done a better job negotiating Brexit than she\u2019s done thus far, you can bet the British people sat up and took notice. After they managed to pick themselves up off the floor and stop laughing, of course.\n\n\u201cI think it [Brexit] could have been negotiated in a different manner,\u201d Trump said, though in precisely what \u201cmanner\u201d he meant he failed to say. But he criticized May\u2019s negotiating performance while complimenting his own.\n\nNeedless to say, the British people are appropriately \u201cimpressed\u201d by Donald Trump\u2019s negotiating skills, what with his disgrace at Helsinki when he betrayed America to Putin, his double failure negotiating disarmament with Kim Jong Un, and his disastrous five week government shutdown over Christmas, a shutdown that impoverished workers, arguably contributed to the recent Boeing 737 MAX 8 crash and accomplished absolutely nothing positive. Yes, Britons haven\u2019t seen the likes of Donald Trump since Neville Chamberlain.\n\nTrump is in favor of Brexit for two reasons. First and most importantly because his puppet master Vladimir Putin wants him to be. But Trump would probably favor Brexit anyway because of a second reason: its proponents are staggeringly overrepresented by racists. Oh, and let us not forget while we\u2019re in the neighborhood, Barack Obama opposed it.\n\nBritons on both sides of the Brexit issue want Trump to jolly well keep his bloody (and not infrequently bloodied) nose out of the discussion. The vast majority of Britons hate Donald Trump and with good reason. He is so despised here one can open a conversation against him in a crowded room and seldom encounter opposition. There is no place for Donald Trump\u2019s opinion here.\n\nPerhaps Donald Trump can best spend his time explaining to the American people how much better he would have been at composing Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony than Beethoven \u2013 what with his two working ears and all \u2013 and stay the hell out of British politics, where he is out of his depth, over his head and emphatically not wanted."

As reported by multiple news outlets, the House unanimously passed a resolution requesting that the Mueller report be made public. That means not one single \u201cno\u201d vote. An argument could be made that all Republicans have lost their minds, but Lindsey Graham\u2019s reasoning behind blocking this resolution gives him the prize for the day.\n\nGraham stood on the Senate floor, and with all seriousness, said that before he could approve the Mueller report becoming public, he wants a Special Counsel appointed to investigate Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and the Department of Justice and the FBI\u2019s handling of that issue. Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t president, and that issue is so dead it has putrefied. Indeed, many believe that this probe \u2014 especially its reopening in late October 2016, mere days before the election \u2014 cost her the election. Why Lindsey Graham believes that reinvestigating a more than two-year-old, closed matter is relevant to the issues surrounding Mueller\u2019s probe is puzzling.\n\nIn his book The Threat, Andrew McCabe painstakingly outlines how the investigation was undertaken. It involved hours of sifting through thousands of emails and data experts rebuilding deleted emails so that the FBI could determine whether any of the deleted emails contained classified information. In relation to wrapping up the investigation, McCabe shares that \u201cumpteen investigation efforts had rendered zero prosecutable results.\u201d\n\nAs part of its detailed probe, the FBI had the Justice Department deliver \u201cmore than a half century of records\u201d to review prosecutions involving mishandled classified information, and what they found \u201cshowed how weak this case was compared to cases that were actually prosecuted.\u201d He further stated: \u201cNo prosecutor would seek a charge based on the evidence we had \u2026 we looked at every single case that had ever been charged.\u201d Take what Andrew McCabe says about \u201cthe evidence we had,\u201d and look at the evidence Mueller has compiled that points to Trump. There is no comparison here.\n\nLindsey Graham is merely grandstanding and doing what he does best: licking Trump\u2019s boots, giving credence to the belief that he, too, is in bed with Russia. No other reasons exist for him to make such overwhelmingly ludicrous statements. Graham is playing partisan politics, which is all the Republicans seem to do these days. Republicans have never been on the people\u2019s side; determining when precisely they went completely over the rails is difficult, but we can\u2019t simply blame it all on Trump. This has been brewing for some time, and Trump is merely the match that lit their candle. Because he is so grossly unpresidential, unprofessional, and any other \u201cun\u201d you can think of, the Republicans have been given permission to come out of hiding, just like all the people who think it\u2019s now okay to show their hate and racism. Our \u201cpresident\u201d is an enabler; it\u2019s unfortunate that he cannot enable for good."

    "text": "The Trump honeymoon is coming to an end. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cTrump honeymoon? On good days it\u2019s been a fever dream, on most days it\u2019s been a lucid nightmare.\u201d You\u2019re right. But for some of his supporters, one part of his presidency has been enough to keep times sweet \u2014 the economy.\n\nThanks to the policies of the Obama administration, Donald Trump lolloped into the helm of a country with a booming economy. Naturally, it was and continues to be his instinct to backpedal from anything Obama did, regardless of the consequences. The economic consequences of Trump\u2019s radical deregulatory policies, erratic governing, and trade war have predictably stymied growth. The markets have stagnated and our trade deficit is eye watering, but because the economy remains relatively good, many people continue supporting Trump. This support is the Trump honeymoon.\n\nIt\u2019s for people who think \u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything he does, but I like some stuff.\u201d That \u201cstuff\u201d always includes the economy, and it\u2019s often their biggest defense of him. The fact that people give Trump contingent support based on the US\u2019s economic performance isn\u2019t something new. Presidents tend to lose favorability when the economy is bad and tend to gain favorability when the economy is good. The bad news for Trump, and all of us, is that this mediocre economic performance might be the best it\u2019ll get for him. There is a silver lining, I promise.\n\nThe United Kingdom is our closest overseas ally and they\u2019re presently dithering towards an uncertain Brexit future with a high potential for global economic repercussions should they fail to properly leave the European Union. This should keep Trump up at night.\n\nBritain requested an extension from the EU today because, with less than two weeks from a hard Brexit, Parliament has yet to approve any leave strategy. If approved, it\u2019ll buy them some time, perhaps enough to hold a second referendum, however unlikely that is. The most likely situation is that Britain\u2019s exit is rough, even with a Brexit deal. The Bank of England actually issued a warning saying that a worst-case-scenario Brexit would be worse than a global financial crisis for Britain, and the chain reactions of this for the US would mean an economic punch in the gut.\n\nThere\u2019s a very strong likelihood that once the economy is down, so goes Donald Trump\u2019s already meager approval. He can\u2019t afford to lose support. If Trump knew what\u2019s best for him, which in this case is not another cheeseburger, he\u2019d be lobbying Britain hard for a second referendum. He\u2019d threaten cutting economic and political ties should they leave. But no. The man with no sense of foresight and a penchant for hoisting himself by his own political petard is staying true to form. While this would be a bad economy for all of us, Trump would be having it much, much worse. Republicans would feel far less beholden to him because he would have nothing going for him. And that\u2019s the silver lining."

    "text": "\u201cPresident\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s little world is crashing down upon him by the moment. Sometimes, karma works as it should, and it\u2019s leaving Trump up Schitt Creek. According to various media outlets including CNN, Michael Cohen has turned over evidence of an offered pardon from Trump. Even as attorney Robert Costello claims the emails reference a Garth Brooks song and Trump tries to change the narrative, the emails are damning.\n\nI doubt very seriously that Cohen merely thought Trump was \u201cmad at him.\u201d That sounds like some type of high school nonsense. Cohen worked with Trump for ten-plus years. Surely, Trump knew about Cohen\u2019s penchant for recording conversations and keeping paperwork (which all lawyers do). It makes perfect sense that Trump was trying to buy his silence.\n\nThe real fireworks from Trump\u2019s scandals involve Matthew Whitaker, who now appears to have \u201cdropped a dime\u201d on Trump. While Republican Congressman Doug Collins claims that Whitaker said \u201che did not talk to the President about Mr. Cohen at all,\u201d Democratic Chairman Jerry Nadler, appearing on MSNBC, stated: \u201cUnlike in the hearing room, Mr. Whitaker did not deny that the President called him to discuss Michael Cohen\u2014the Michael Cohen case and personnel decisions in the Southern District. Two, while he was acting attorney general, Mr. Whitaker was directly involved in conversations about whether to fire one or more of the U.S. Attorneys, and three, while he was acting attorney general Mr. Whitaker was involved in conversations about the scope of the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney Berman\u2019s recusal and whether the Southern District went too far in pursuing the campaign finance case in which the President was listed as Individual No. 1.\u201d\n\nNadler was followed by Adam Schiff, who pointed out that Jeff Sessions was fired because he recused himself on the advice of ethics lawyers at the Justice Department and that \u201cMatthew Whitaker was hired because he talked about how he could privately cripple the Mueller investigation and because I\u2019m sure the President was confident he would not recuse himself. The ethics lawyers urged him to do so. He refused.\u201d I think we can safely expect more explosions involving Whitaker in very short order.\n\nFinally, Trump has been handed the first veto situation of his \u201cpresidency\u201d with the passage of the resolution to stop his \u201cemergency\u201d declaration. While the Democrats needed only four Republican Senators to vote with them, they ended up with twelve: Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Pat Toomey, Roger Wicker, Marco Rubio, Jerry Moran, Rob Portman, Lamar Alexander, Roy Blount, and Mitt Romney.\n\nIf that\u2019s not a rebuke of Donald Trump, then the Republican-led Senate voting, for the second time, to end aid to the Saudis in Yemen surely is. According to the New York Times, the vote stems from Trump\u2019s defense of the Saudis in the Khashoggi murder. One might like to think the Republicans are finally \u201cgetting\u201d it, but let\u2019s not be too premature. There are still many who support him unconditionally even when he\u2019s wrong, and he is consistently wrong. For Trump, this week gives true meaning to \u201cthank God it\u2019s Friday.\u201d He\u2019d better rest up; his chickens are coming home to roost."

Deripaska is connected to Paul Manafort, who recently was sentenced twice in one week, then indicted by New York.\n\nIn April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on Deripaska and more than twenty other Russian nationals, citing evidence that Deripaska \u201chas been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering.\u201d In January 2019, the United States Treasury, per instructions from Steve Mnuchin and Trump, removed sanctions against Deripaska\u2019s companies, but the ones on him personally remained. Deripaska, not liking being addressed with constraints, has on Friday filed a lawsuit against Mnuchin and others.\n\nDeripaska claims in his suit that the sanctions are devastating to him, claiming in one paragraph: \u201cThe consequence of Defendants\u2019 unlawful action has been the utter devastation of Deripaska\u2019s wealth, reputation, and economic livelihood. As a result of his designations and the sanctions risk to foreign parties dealing with him or his businesses, Deripaska has been effectively shut out from the international business community and the global financial system. Indeed, banks and businesses have terminated existing contracts and agreements with him, and businesses refuse to enter into any further dealings with him out of fear of exposure to U.S. sanctions.\u201d\n\nFunny, we have some Russians fighting jurisdiction, such as in the secret grand jury proceedings in Washington, D.C., while we now have a very bad hombre from Russia using that very same judicial system to try to get any remaining sanctions lifted."

    "text": "Even as various House committees simultaneously investigate various Donald Trump scandals, the House Oversight Committee has taken up the lead on the security clearance scandal involving Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. This has left Chairman Elijah Cummings in charge of the matter. Naturally, the Trump regime is trying to stonewall him. So he\u2019s found a way to work around that.\n\nOne of the goals in the security clearance investigation is to find out precisely why former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and former White House Counsel Don McGahn felt that Ivanka and Jared were security risks against the United States. The two key pieces of evidence: the memos that Kelly and McGahn each wrote, documenting their concerns. Elijah Cummings knows the White House will fight tooth and nail to avoid having to turn over those memos, because Trump wants to protect his family.\n\nPalmer Report pointed out earlier this month that if Kelly and McGahn felt strongly enough that they needed to write and file these memos in order to insulate themselves from what Donald Trump was doing, then they certainly would have kept copies of their own. We also pointed out that because Kelly and McGahn have both reportedly been cooperating with Robert Mueller, they\u2019re likely to cooperate with Congress as well.\n\nSure enough, Elijah Cummings has taken the unorthodox step of having his staff reach out directly to John Kelly, as opposed to going through the White House. This is according to CNN, which doesn\u2019t spell out whether Kelly turned over the memo to Cummings. But considering the apoplectic response from the Trump regime when it learned that Cummings had contacted Kelly, we\u2019re guessing Cummings now has the memo. We told you that Cummings knows what he\u2019s doing."

    "text": "Donald Trump is losing his mind today, over and above his usual whining, crying, and soiling his pants. There are multiple reasons for this. Obviously the first is that in his mind, the world revolves around him, and he doesn\u2019t care about anyone who isn\u2019t a white Christian. (Keep representing on that one, Trump. You\u2019re doing a stellar job there. See *New Zealand*.)\n\nThe second and most glaring is that Robert Mueller is stalking Donald Trump like a boss, and Trump is feeling the heat. Congress doesn\u2019t make much of an impression on Trump, as he doesn\u2019t understand how it works. But words like \u201cRICO\u201d and \u201cNew York State Attorney\u201d make a big impression on him. Those words are starting to creep inside his gold-electroplated false sense of security, and he\u2019s freaking out.\n\nYes, Trump lives in a bubble. But every now and then, he gets the real news. Rick Gates needing another 60 days before sentencing isn\u2019t sitting well with The Donald, nor is the fact that Mueller really does not seem to be winding up what must be a very complicated and wide-reaching probe. The rumors of Mueller\u2019s demise are exaggerated. And, I suspect, largely generated from inside the White House.\n\nThe worst news of all: the House unanimously voted to make public the Mueller Report, and the Senate will also pass it by a veto-proof majority. So there\u2019s no stifling it. The Donald\u2019s bubble is getting ready to burst. Will he create another distraction? You bet. Will it work? No. We\u2019ve been waiting too long and too patiently to see what Trump & Co. have been up to. There is no way to keep a lid on this.\n\nBut will the Deplorables rise up to defend him? No. All we will have to do is run a marathon of Honey Boo Boo episodes, and we\u2019re good."

Obviously, this laughable article has been slapped together by Team Trump to try to help Junior keep up his delusions about somehow surviving his worsening criminal scandals.\n\nThe reality of course is that Donald Trump Jr will be in prison by 2024. Even if Donald Trump were to succeed in pardoning his son on federal charges, we saw this week that New York is bringing state level criminal charges against Trump\u2019s henchmen. So yeah, Junior would be talking about running for president from his prison cell.\n\nFor reference, Eugene Debs ran for president in the 1920 election, and he received 3.4% of the vote despite the fact that he was in prison at the time. He didn\u2019t come close to winning, but he set a legal precedent that you can run for president from a prison cell. So maybe Donald Trump Jr is onto something here. Perhaps his cellmate can end up being his running mate."

    "text": "For the past several weeks, various prominent online news publications have been pushing the notion that Joe Biden and Beto O\u2019Rourke were going to enter the 2020 election as a tag team, with Biden as the presidential nominee and Beto as the preordained running mate. Palmer Report pointed out that nothing works that way, but these Biden-Beto articles have nonetheless gotten a ridiculous amount of traction.\n\nOn Thursday, Beto O\u2019Rourke entered the 2020 presidential race, finally proving that there is obviously no Biden-Beto preordained ticket. Also, duh. Why would any candidate be stupid enough to announce a running mate from day one? It would be a middle finger to supporters of every other candidate, because they\u2019d all be ruled out as potential running mates from the start. It would be one of the most laugh-out-loud idiotic mistakes in the history of American politics, which is why no one ever does it.\n\nSo why was the media making up such nonsense? The short answer: because they could get away with it. Neither Biden nor Beto had entered the race yet, meaning they could make up anything they wanted about how these two candidates were going to enter the race. Because people either loved or hated the idea, these articles got a ton of play across social media, despite having been made up out of thin air.\n\nNow that Beto has entered the race and shattered the Biden-Beto fictional narrative, some prominent news outlets are now publishing fiction about Biden entering the race with Stacey Abrams as his preordained running mate. That\u2019s not a surprise; these are the two most prominent names who haven\u2019t yet entered the race, so it\u2019s easy to just make things up about them.\n\nOf course it\u2019s entirely possible that Joe Biden could win the nomination, and that he could then pick Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 or Stacey Abrams \u2013 as his running mate. But entering the race as some kind of tandem? Sorry, but that\u2019s just not a real thing. The people publishing this crap know better. It\u2019s a callback to the 2016 democratic primary, when the media wrote fake stories about everyone from John Kerry to Michael Dukakis preparing to enter the race. It\u2019s made-up nonsense for the sake of ratings and page views. Buyer beware."

    "text": "There are no two ways about it: Lindsey Graham has lost his raggedy mind. Does anyone even get what he\u2019s babbling about? As reported by multiple news outlets, the House unanimously passed a resolution requesting that the Mueller report be made public. That means not one single \u201cno\u201d vote. An argument could be made that all Republicans have lost their minds, but Lindsey Graham\u2019s reasoning behind blocking this resolution gives him the prize for the day.\n\nGraham stood on the Senate floor, and with all seriousness, said that before he could approve the Mueller report becoming public, he wants a Special Counsel appointed to investigate Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and the Department of Justice and the FBI\u2019s handling of that issue. Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t president, and that issue is so dead it has putrefied. Indeed, many believe that this probe \u2014 especially its reopening in late October 2016, mere days before the election \u2014 cost her the election. Why Lindsey Graham believes that reinvestigating a more than two-year-old, closed matter is relevant to the issues surrounding Mueller\u2019s probe is puzzling.\n\nIn his book The Threat, Andrew McCabe painstakingly outlines how the investigation was undertaken. It involved hours of sifting through thousands of emails and data experts rebuilding deleted emails so that the FBI could determine whether any of the deleted emails contained classified information. In relation to wrapping up the investigation, McCabe shares that \u201cumpteen investigation efforts had rendered zero prosecutable results.\u201d\n\nAs part of its detailed probe, the FBI had the Justice Department deliver \u201cmore than a half century of records\u201d to review prosecutions involving mishandled classified information, and what they found \u201cshowed how weak this case was compared to cases that were actually prosecuted.\u201d He further stated: \u201cNo prosecutor would seek a charge based on the evidence we had \u2026 we looked at every single case that had ever been charged.\u201d Take what Andrew McCabe says about \u201cthe evidence we had,\u201d and look at the evidence Mueller has compiled that points to Trump. There is no comparison here.\n\nLindsey Graham is merely grandstanding and doing what he does best: licking Trump\u2019s boots, giving credence to the belief that he, too, is in bed with Russia. No other reasons exist for him to make such overwhelmingly ludicrous statements. Graham is playing partisan politics, which is all the Republicans seem to do these days. Republicans have never been on the people\u2019s side; determining when precisely they went completely over the rails is difficult, but we can\u2019t simply blame it all on Trump. This has been brewing for some time, and Trump is merely the match that lit their candle. Because he is so grossly unpresidential, unprofessional, and any other \u201cun\u201d you can think of, the Republicans have been given permission to come out of hiding, just like all the people who think it\u2019s now okay to show their hate and racism. Our \u201cpresident\u201d is an enabler; it\u2019s unfortunate that he cannot enable for good."

Mueller and Gates jointly asked the judge for a sixty day delay, because Gates is still actively cooperating. This is a big deal.\n\nRobert Mueller told the courts a few months ago that his work was complete with his other key cooperator, Michael Flynn. This came despite the fact that Flynn\u2019s former business partner is just now headed to trial. So it\u2019s not as if Mueller is keeping all of his cooperators on board just in case they have to testify at trials. He has a reason, and a big one, for specifically keeping Rick Gates in the fold for another two months. It logically has to be about an ongoing investigation.\n\nSo what ongoing investigation are we talking about here? Rick Gates was closest with Paul Manafort, but Mueller is now 100% done with Manafort. In fact, Mueller and his allies have already taken down the key Trump campaign players, including Manafort, Flynn, Michael Cohen, and George Papadopoulos. At this point the still-unfolding investigations appear to be more centered around the Trump administration and Trump transition team. Gates never worked in the administration, so that leaves us with the transition team.\n\nSo the clues strongly point to Robert Mueller actively investigating key players involved in the Trump transition team and the inauguration. Donald Trump fired Chris Christie as the head of the transition team and replaced him with Mike Pence. A recent book asserts that Trump specifically did this so he could embezzle the donations that had been made for the inauguration. This would only have made sense if Pence was criminally complicit. Is Pence the target?\n\nIn any case, the biggest clue of all here may be that while sentencing hearings are usually delayed by ninety days by default, in this instance Robert Mueller is asking for just sixty more days with Rick Gates. This seems to suggest that Mueller expects his current Gates-related investigation to be safely concluded, complete with any corresponding indictments, within sixty days and not ninety."

Yesterday, after Britain came closer to canceling Brexit, Farage began privately begging European Union nations to kick Britain out \u2013 and he got caught in the act. He\u2019s toast now.\n\nIt got me thinking about how I know Donald Trump is going down. You see, Nigel Farage is the Donald Trump of Great Britain. He\u2019s a Kremlin controlled ringer whose only job is to weaken his nation as thoroughly as possible from within, while keeping just enough racists happy to retain a slight grip on power. Farage is roughly as whacked out as Trump is, but even Farage had to have known that asking the EU to kick Britain out was the kind of step that could put him on an inevitable path to his downfall. The thing is, though, Farage didn\u2019t have a choice.\n\nThe thing about compromised middlemen like Trump and Farage is that they don\u2019t get to decide what their own actions are going to be; their puppet master does. That means even if they want to pull back from a particularly risky ploy, they have to go through with it if it\u2019s what Putin wants. They can\u2019t take steps to protect themselves, which is why they always end up going down in the end.\n\nThe only two questions are how much damage they\u2019ll manage to do before their downfall, and whether or not their puppet master goes down with them. The puppet master gets to control his own actions, so he\u2019s in a far better position to protect himself. Then again, Vladimir Putin is rather beholden to his puppet master oligarchs, so we\u2019ll see if he survives. But Donald Trump and Nigel Farage are going to prison. In hindsight, they never stood a chance."

But at this point the Republicans are starting to place their bets that it\u2019ll be even worse for them if they stick with Donald Trump as he\u2019s dismantled, ousted, and imprisoned for his crimes and abuses.\n\nSo now what? Donald Trump just tweeted the word \u201cVETO!\u201d \u2013 making clear that he\u2019s now planning to defy the will of both houses of Congress, and both parties, while trying to unilaterally hijack the nation. If anything, a veto will only drive even more feckless and scared Republicans to vote against him when it comes to the veto override."

In a rare unanimous, bipartisan vote, the House passed a resolution calling for the Attorney General\u2019s release of the Mueller report to the public.\n\nThe Special Counsel regulations require Mueller to submit his report to the AG, with further disclosure coming at the AG\u2019s discretion. But the current AG, William Barr, has not said exactly what he would do, and he refused to commit to making the report public when pressed about it at his recent Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nToday\u2019s resolution is non-binding, which means it does not have the power of law that can force the public release of the report. It is also not likely that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will allow the GOP-controlled Senate to consider a similar resolution anytime soon, and in fact Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham is already trying to sabotage it. But the unanimous vote is nothing short of a primal scream for transparency in the Mueller probe. Jerrold Nadler, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who introduced the resolution, aptly called the results \u201ca clear signal to both the American people and to the Department of Justice that Congress believes transparency is a fundamental principle necessary to ensure that government remains accountable to the public.\u201d\n\nThis House resolution did not pass because a handful of Republican moderates decided to break with their party. On the contrary, House Republicans put up weak resistance on the debate floor, mostly just grumbling about how the resolution appears to be a waste of time. In the end, the resolution passed by a whopping 420-0, with four Republicans voting \u201cpresent.\u201d No one knows when Mueller will wrap up his investigation and submit his report to Barr. But when that day arrives, Barr now knows what kind of furious bipartisan backlash he will face, starting with subpoenas, if he even thinks about trying to bury it."

We know this because Chairman Jerry Nadler, a straight shooter, told us all as much. Now the House Republicans are in a weird panic over it.\n\nTwo unnamed House Republican staffers, who were also in the room with Nadler while Matt Whitaker was testifying, are now claiming to Politico that this never happened, and that Whitaker exonerated Trump instead. Of course there is no reason to believe this, considering that the leading Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are corrupt lying Trump-loyal loons like Jim Jordan and Louie Gohmert.\n\nSo now we\u2019ve reached a point where House Republicans are simply lying about what Whitaker said, even though there\u2019s a transcript, and this gives Nadler a legitimate reason to release the transcript to the public. House Republicans know this, and they know that their lie will only buy them a matter of days before it\u2019s revealed that they\u2019re lying, but this appears to be the closest thing they have left to a defense strategy.\n\nLast week Matt Whitaker resigned the cushy new job that Donald Trump had just given him at the DOJ, in an obvious attempt at keeping Whitaker from flipping on him. This alone was a fairly clear signal that Whitaker was no longer playing for Team Trump, and was more worried about his own criminal liability. This is even more reason to believe what Chairman Nadler told us: Whitaker has sold Trump out."

His former partner had just gotten a sweetheart deal from Judge Amy Berman Jackson when he was tsunamied with multiple charges from New York. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to realize Manafort will die in jail unless he flips on Trump.\n\nAnd frankly Roger Stone, while no rocket scientist, had to have seen his best laid plans crumble to dust once those New York charges were slammed onto Manafort\u2019s head. He was next and he knew it. So what else makes me think Roger flipped? Judge Jackson. She is anything but unprepared. The fact that she said she wouldn\u2019t address Stone\u2019s book being re-released, nor his Snapchat post, nor the insulting condescension by Stone\u2019s lawyers, sent a signal. She\u2019s allowing them all more time. Why? Some believe the delay is to let Stone hang himself, but he\u2019s already swinging from the evidence.\n\nNo, Jackson is no fool. Yes, she got on the bench today in a much more subdued fashion than yesterday. The MAGA crowd says she\u2019s finally realized Q is coming for her. Fox News says she came down hard on Manafort and suffered the political consequences of Manafort\u2019s lawyers calling her harsh. All of that is laughable. What is not laughable? Top Mueller prosecutor, Andrew Weissman, showing up for the Stone procedural this morning. Yes, one of the busiest men on Mueller\u2019s team just showed up in court just to wish Roger well.\n\nRoger Stone was quite turned out for his hearing today, with ubiquitous pocket square and steampunk villain sunglasses.

After Strzok testified before the House Intelligence Committee, his name began to fade in the media, and he only got the occasional reference in Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\nYesterday the complete transcript of Strzok\u2019s testimony from last June was released to the public. To no one\u2019s surprise, the hearing doesn\u2019t exonerate Trump even remotely. It casts Trump and House Republicans in an even worse light than before, and dispels any notion of a deep state conspiracy. Strzok was removed from the investigation by Robert Mueller for several anti-Trump texts, in order to make sure that an independent investigation into the campaign stayed independent and impartial. House Republicans, however, aren\u2019t concerned about impartiality and did all they could to take messages exchanged by Peter Strzok and Lisa Page out of context.\n\nStrzok\u2019s text \u201cWe\u2019ll stop it,\u201d was held up as a smoking gun \u2013 unmistakable proof that the FBI was thwarting a Trump presidency. In reality, Strzok was referring to Russian interference in this text. The FBI briefed Trump campaign officials at least twice, warning them that Russia was trying to intervene on their behalf and to contact the FBI if anything seemed suspicious. Michael Flynn, Chris Christie and Donald Trump sat in on those meetings and chose not to call the FBI back.\n\nI suppose Donald Trump could use the excuse that he wasn\u2019t paying attention, but this bodes poorly for a whole lot of Republicans \u2013 not least of all former Congressman Trey Gowdy, who tried to tear apart each word of Strzok\u2019s testimony in the hope that he could get Strzok to leak out more information on the investigation \u2013 a way to obstruct justice and perhaps find a way to charge Strzok, who wasn\u2019t taking the bait."

Then one of his handlers hijacked his Twitter account and explained that he\u2019s going to veto it, calling it a \u201cDemocrat inspired Resolution.\u201d\n\nWith that, Donald Trump just stepped into the veto trap laid by the Democrats. It\u2019s not that he really had any choice. He didn\u2019t come this far with his imaginary \u201cnational emergency\u201d wall stunt, just to give up and sign a resolution putting an end to it. So unless he gets high on bath salts and changes his mind, he\u2019s going to veto this. That\u2019s when the fun begins.\n\nRight off the bat, the Democrats will have won, because they\u2019ll have forced Donald Trump to take sole ownership of the national emergency, in defiance of both parties. In that respect it doesn\u2019t matter how many or few Republicans tried to stop Trump on this; all the average observer will hear is that Trump went against the will of both the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate. His withering base will love this. But his casual supporters outside of his base \u2013 the ones who were always going to decide whether he sinks or swims \u2013 won\u2019t look on this kindly.\n\nThat\u2019s before getting to the next vote on the matter. Based on today\u2019s numbers, there aren\u2019t enough votes to override the veto. But we\u2019ve seen the number of dissenting Republican Senators grow from four to twelve in just a few days. As the public turns more loudly against Donald Trump\u2019s national emergency wall nonsense by the day, that number should go higher, in both the House and Senate.

    "text": "It is being reported by major British publication The Spectator that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is ready to indict Donald Trump, but Attorney General William Barr is preventing him from moving forward, because of a decades old DOJ memo that suggests you cannot indict a sitting President.\n\nA very interesting thing just happened in New York State: Paul Manafort was indicted on state charges for sixteen felony offenses. Several of Manafort\u2019s crimes involved falsifying business records in the first degree. As reported by Rachel Maddow on Wednesday night, this is the same kind of criminal charge in the same state for which Donald Trump was named as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThis raises the very real possibility that New York State could indict President Trump at any time. New York State prosecutors are not federal prosecutors (not to be confused with the Southern District of NY, which is a federal office). They are not part of the Department of Justice and are not subject to DOJ internal policies. They have no restrictions on indicting a President.\n\nSo, why haven\u2019t they indicted Trump yet? First of all, most if not all, law enforcement offices work together, especially in determining jurisdiction issues. Clearly, Mueller\u2019s office has been in communication with state law enforcement offices. If the President of the United States is indicted by anyone, that indictment would be challenged in the courts, and the courts would have to decide if a sitting President could be indicted.\n\nRobert Mueller and his team of prosecutors are first-rate, and they are by far the best-equipped office to handle that court case. Additionally, the list of charges Mueller could potentially bring are much more likely to include post-election crimes that include abuse of power and other high impact crimes that could more effectively counter the defense argument that indicting a sitting President is too disruptive to the country.\n\nIt is clearly better for the Special Counsel\u2019s office to take the lead in indicting Donald Trump, and to argue the resulting court cases, but if Mueller is prohibited from moving forward, it is quite likely that New York State could take the lead and indict Trump.\n\nImagine New York State taking the lead after the Department of Justice sat on its hands and took a pass on its requirement to uphold the rule of law and provide a check to abuse of Executive power. What a stain on the reputation of the Department of Justice that would be. I can almost hear Robert Mueller saying as much to Attorney General Barr. Will the Attorney General allow the DOJ be embarrassed by allowing New York State do the work it refused to do?"

That\u2019s right, this is legislation that calls for a report about Donald Trump\u2019s crimes to be made public, and not a single House Republican voted against it. Translation: they think Trump is toast, and when they run for reelection, they don\u2019t want to have to answer questions about how they tried to protect him in the end. That of course means that the legislation now moves over to the Senate.\n\nThis next part should be easy, right? If House Republicans unanimously supported it, then most Senate Republicans are going to vote for it as well. Even if Mitch McConnell wanted to scuttle a vote, his own GOP ranks would force his hand. But now Lindsey Graham is trying to hold up the vote by insisting that an amendment be added that appoints a second Special Counsel to investigate the people who are investigating Trump\u2019s crimes.\n\nThat\u2019s right, Lindsey Graham has now gone full tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist demon. We think a Special Counsel should be appointed to investigate how Donald Trump and the Kremlin have managed to turn Graham, and whether the personal emails he admits were hacked in 2016 are being used to blackmail him."

    "text": "As Donald Trump fails to lobby Republican Senators to vote in favor of his national emergency declaration to build the wall he had campaigned on, investigators and committees are busy on several fronts, tearing down the walls he has built around a lifetime of shady activities as a businessman and real estate mogul.\n\nWe have all heard and read about how the Trump Organization has come under suspicion for insurance fraud and asset inflation in the wake of Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony, and the list of document requests issued by congressional committees included a number of high profile members of the Trump Organization, such as Allen Weisselberg and Alan Garten, for example.\n\nIn the context of all these investigations, one storyline related to the Trump family\u2019s real estate ventures that might finally receive the public attention it most likely deserves, is that of the Trump Organization\u2019s involvement in the now abandoned Trump International Hotel & Tower project in Baku, Azerbaijan. According to The New Yorker\u2019s reporter Adam Davidson, this real estate project, in which the Trump Organization partnered with an Azerbaijani family that a 2014 Foreign Policy article characterized as \u201cThe Corleones of the Caspian\u201d has all the hallmarks of a corrupt money laundering operation that may even involve dark money coming from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\nThe questions raised by Davidson\u2019s article were serious enough to prompt Senator Sherrod Brown in March 2017 to call for a federal investigation of Donald Trump\u2019s involvement. Together with Senators Dianne Feinstein and Ben Cardin of the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations, Banking, and Judiciary committees, Brown wrote a joint letter to several Trump administration officials stating that \u201cit appears that the lack of due diligence by the Trump Organization [ \u2026 ] exposed President Trump and his organization to notoriously corrupt Azerbaijani oligarchs, and may also have exposed the Trump Organization to the IRGC. Even though the Trump Organization appears to have withdrawn from the Baku Tower deal, serious questions remain unanswered about the Trump Organization\u2019s potential criminal liability.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration officials addressed in the Senators\u2019 joint letter have so far failed to answer those questions and the relevant congressional committees were at the time chaired by Republicans who apparently preferred covering for their president to exposing the truth. As we all know, things have changed with the coming-in of the new Congress in January this year, so there is hope that some progress will be made on that front now.\n\nBy the way, the person running point on the Baku Tower project by all accounts was Ivanka Trump, who visited Azerbaijan in 2014 and proudly posed inside the tower building for a photo she posted on her Instagram account on November 24 of that year. Perhaps the reason why Donald Trump\u2019s daughter did not receive a request to provide documents to a congressional committee is that the incriminating evidence against her is already publicly available."

The violations in question can result in massive monetary fines, which cash-poor Trump can\u2019t pay, meaning the state can then begin seizing his assets. Now, New York is moving further ahead on this plan.\n\nToday the New York Attorney General brought new legal action against Donald Trump over the charitable fraud and election fraud he committed with regard to his Trump Foundation. Between restitution and damages, New York is seeking about eight million dollars from Donald Trump. Maybe he can come up with eight million dollars in cash (or steal it from his reelection campaign) to pay off this one infraction. But this is just one of the numerous areas in which the state is targeting Trump with financial penalties, and it\u2019s not even one of the larger ones.\n\nBy the time you finish adding up the expected fines in the various cases New York is pursuing against Donald Trump, they could quickly total in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump can\u2019t finagle his way into getting his hands on that much cash. So this is where New York can start seizing his bank accounts in the state, his properties in the state, and whatever else the state courts end up signing off on.\n\nWhat can Donald Trump do to stop this? Nothing. He can\u2019t fire anyone, or pardon himself, in a state level case. This is going to happen to Trump. His only way out would be to negotiate a resignation deal in exchange for reduced criminal charges and reduced financial penalties, from both the Feds and New York State."

Not only did BuzzFeed prevail in that suit, the evidence in the suit has just been released publicly tonight. It confirms that the allegations in the dossier about Russian hackers are indeed legitimate.\n\nThis is, by far, the biggest concrete step yet when it comes to proving that the Trump-Russia dossier is indeed a work of fact and not a work of fiction. Considering how much of the dossier has now been proven, it means the Pee Pee Tape is also very probably real. That puts us a lot closer to seeing it come to light.\n\nAfter all, once the public gets confirmation of what material a blackmailer is holding over an asset\u2019s head, that material starts to become useless. At that point, the blackmailer will sometimes simply release the material publicly, under the calculation that it\u2019s better to finish off the now useless asset. Stay tuned."

But to see him walk away now? It tells us that Mueller really is gearing up to issue his report soon. And as we\u2019ve explained all along, Mueller isn\u2019t simply going to turn in a report and then go fishing.

At the end of Cuomo\u2019s show, one of his CNN colleagues lectured him on-air about having Conway on the show.\n\nDuring the handoff at the top of the hour, Don Lemon spent a good five minutes trying to convince Chris Cuomo to stop giving Kellyanne Conway airtime so she can keep spreading her lies while not answering a single question. This isn\u2019t the first time Lemon has told Cuomo to stop having Conway as a guest. But the sheer length of the back-and-forth, and the frustration on both sides, was unprecedented.\n\nCuomo and Lemon both handled the debate respectfully. While they never did see eye to eye on the Kellyanne Conway question, they were both clearly the most frustrated by the fact that the so-called President of the United States is a pathological liar who keeps sending another pathological liar to do his on-air bidding. When CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter posted a video of the lengthy Lemon-Cuomo exchange on Twitter without taking a side, roughly 95% of the commenters agreed with Lemon that Kellyanne should never be on CNN again.\n\nThe real solution here of course is for a psychologically deranged lying lunatic like Donald Trump not to be the President of the United States to begin with, so that news networks aren\u2019t stuck dealing with a psychologically deranged lying lunatic like Kellyanne Conway as his spokesperson. Until Trump is ousted and America returns to being a democracy, there is no right answer. But we hope Cuomo, who\u2019s a straight shooter, decides that Don Lemon is right."

But he criticized May\u2019s negotiating performance while complimenting his own.\n\nNeedless to say, the British people are appropriately \u201cimpressed\u201d by Donald Trump\u2019s negotiating skills, what with his disgrace at Helsinki when he betrayed America to Putin, his double failure negotiating disarmament with Kim Jong Un, and his disastrous five week government shutdown over Christmas, a shutdown that impoverished workers, arguably contributed to the recent Boeing 737 MAX 8 crash and accomplished absolutely nothing positive. Yes, Britons haven\u2019t seen the likes of Donald Trump since Neville Chamberlain.\n\nTrump is in favor of Brexit for two reasons. First and most importantly because his puppet master Vladimir Putin wants him to be. But Trump would probably favor Brexit anyway because of a second reason: its proponents are staggeringly overrepresented by racists. Oh, and let us not forget while we\u2019re in the neighborhood, Barack Obama opposed it.\n\nBritons on both sides of the Brexit issue want Trump to jolly well keep his bloody (and not infrequently bloodied) nose out of the discussion. The vast majority of Britons hate Donald Trump and with good reason. He is so despised here one can open a conversation against him in a crowded room and seldom encounter opposition. There is no place for Donald Trump\u2019s opinion here.\n\nPerhaps Donald Trump can best spend his time explaining to the American people how much better he would have been at composing Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony than Beethoven \u2013 what with his two working ears and all \u2013 and stay the hell out of British politics, where he is out of his depth, over his head and emphatically not wanted."

    "text": "\u201cPresident\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s little world is crashing down upon him by the moment. Sometimes, karma works as it should, and it\u2019s leaving Trump up Schitt Creek. According to various media outlets including CNN, Michael Cohen has turned over evidence of an offered pardon from Trump. Even as attorney Robert Costello claims the emails reference a Garth Brooks song and Trump tries to change the narrative, the emails are damning.\n\nI doubt very seriously that Cohen merely thought Trump was \u201cmad at him.\u201d That sounds like some type of high school nonsense. Cohen worked with Trump for ten-plus years. Surely, Trump knew about Cohen\u2019s penchant for recording conversations and keeping paperwork (which all lawyers do). It makes perfect sense that Trump was trying to buy his silence.\n\nThe real fireworks from Trump\u2019s scandals involve Matthew Whitaker, who now appears to have \u201cdropped a dime\u201d on Trump. While Republican Congressman Doug Collins claims that Whitaker said \u201che did not talk to the President about Mr. Cohen at all,\u201d Democratic Chairman Jerry Nadler, appearing on MSNBC, stated: \u201cUnlike in the hearing room, Mr. Whitaker did not deny that the President called him to discuss Michael Cohen\u2014the Michael Cohen case and personnel decisions in the Southern District. Two, while he was acting attorney general, Mr. Whitaker was directly involved in conversations about whether to fire one or more of the U.S. Attorneys, and three, while he was acting attorney general Mr. Whitaker was involved in conversations about the scope of the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney Berman\u2019s recusal and whether the Southern District went too far in pursuing the campaign finance case in which the President was listed as Individual No. 1.\u201d\n\nNadler was followed by Adam Schiff, who pointed out that Jeff Sessions was fired because he recused himself on the advice of ethics lawyers at the Justice Department and that \u201cMatthew Whitaker was hired because he talked about how he could privately cripple the Mueller investigation and because I\u2019m sure the President was confident he would not recuse himself. The ethics lawyers urged him to do so. He refused.\u201d I think we can safely expect more explosions involving Whitaker in very short order.\n\nFinally, Trump has been handed the first veto situation of his \u201cpresidency\u201d with the passage of the resolution to stop his \u201cemergency\u201d declaration. While the Democrats needed only four Republican Senators to vote with them, they ended up with twelve: Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Pat Toomey, Roger Wicker, Marco Rubio, Jerry Moran, Rob Portman, Lamar Alexander, Roy Blount, and Mitt Romney.\n\nIf that\u2019s not a rebuke of Donald Trump, then the Republican-led Senate voting, for the second time, to end aid to the Saudis in Yemen surely is. According to the New York Times, the vote stems from Trump\u2019s defense of the Saudis in the Khashoggi murder. One might like to think the Republicans are finally \u201cgetting\u201d it, but let\u2019s not be too premature. There are still many who support him unconditionally even when he\u2019s wrong, and he is consistently wrong. For Trump, this week gives true meaning to \u201cthank God it\u2019s Friday.\u201d He\u2019d better rest up; his chickens are coming home to roost."

    "text": "Earlier this month an expose from the New Yorker examined the close and inappropriate relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News. One of the revelations in the story was that during the election, a Fox News reporter had uncovered the story of Trump\u2019s payoffs to Stormy Daniels, but Fox boss Rupert Murdoch killed the story because he wanted Trump to win. Now House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings has put this information to good use.\n\nThe reporter in question is no longer with Fox News and is bound by a nondisclosure agreement with the network, but she recently hinted that if Congress were to require her to cooperate, it would free her to go ahead and reveal all the details. Sure enough, Elijah Cummings has now done just that \u2013 and the reporter is not only going to turn over the documents, she\u2019s going to show up and testify next week.\n\nThis remarkable news from the Los Angeles Times doesn\u2019t specify whether the former Fox News reporter, whose name is Diana Falzone, will testify in public or in private. But either way, this is a big deal for two reasons. First, it means the House Oversight Committee gets to expose just how scandalous Fox\u2019s relationship with Trump is \u2013 and that falls under the committee\u2019s purview because it has oversight over everything Trump does.\n\nSecond, this means that the House Oversight Committee is about to gain access to all the information that Falzone dug up on the story. Thus far we\u2019ve heard what Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen know. But Falzone may have uncovered additional details about the scandal that neither of them are aware of, potentially surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s role in the scandal. Stay tuned."

    "text": "For the past several weeks, various prominent online news publications have been pushing the notion that Joe Biden and Beto O\u2019Rourke were going to enter the 2020 election as a tag team, with Biden as the presidential nominee and Beto as the preordained running mate. Palmer Report pointed out that nothing works that way, but these Biden-Beto articles have nonetheless gotten a ridiculous amount of traction.\n\nOn Thursday, Beto O\u2019Rourke entered the 2020 presidential race, finally proving that there is obviously no Biden-Beto preordained ticket. Also, duh. Why would any candidate be stupid enough to announce a running mate from day one? It would be a middle finger to supporters of every other candidate, because they\u2019d all be ruled out as potential running mates from the start. It would be one of the most laugh-out-loud idiotic mistakes in the history of American politics, which is why no one ever does it.\n\nSo why was the media making up such nonsense? The short answer: because they could get away with it. Neither Biden nor Beto had entered the race yet, meaning they could make up anything they wanted about how these two candidates were going to enter the race. Because people either loved or hated the idea, these articles got a ton of play across social media, despite having been made up out of thin air.\n\nNow that Beto has entered the race and shattered the Biden-Beto fictional narrative, some prominent news outlets are now publishing fiction about Biden entering the race with Stacey Abrams as his preordained running mate. That\u2019s not a surprise; these are the two most prominent names who haven\u2019t yet entered the race, so it\u2019s easy to just make things up about them.\n\nOf course it\u2019s entirely possible that Joe Biden could win the nomination, and that he could then pick Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 or Stacey Abrams \u2013 as his running mate. But entering the race as some kind of tandem? Sorry, but that\u2019s just not a real thing. The people publishing this crap know better. It\u2019s a callback to the 2016 democratic primary, when the media wrote fake stories about everyone from John Kerry to Michael Dukakis preparing to enter the race. It\u2019s made-up nonsense for the sake of ratings and page views. Buyer beware."

He did the best he could to hold her feet to the fire, and we think he got the best of her, as she seemed befuddled by the end of it. But the whole thing was pointless and painful to watch. At the end of Cuomo\u2019s show, one of his CNN colleagues lectured him on-air about having Conway on the show.\n\nDuring the handoff at the top of the hour, Don Lemon spent a good five minutes trying to convince Chris Cuomo to stop giving Kellyanne Conway airtime so she can keep spreading her lies while not answering a single question. This isn\u2019t the first time Lemon has told Cuomo to stop having Conway as a guest. But the sheer length of the back-and-forth, and the frustration on both sides, was unprecedented.\n\nCuomo and Lemon both handled the debate respectfully. While they never did see eye to eye on the Kellyanne Conway question, they were both clearly the most frustrated by the fact that the so-called President of the United States is a pathological liar who keeps sending another pathological liar to do his on-air bidding. When CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter posted a video of the lengthy Lemon-Cuomo exchange on Twitter without taking a side, roughly 95% of the commenters agreed with Lemon that Kellyanne should never be on CNN again.\n\nThe real solution here of course is for a psychologically deranged lying lunatic like Donald Trump not to be the President of the United States to begin with, so that news networks aren\u2019t stuck dealing with a psychologically deranged lying lunatic like Kellyanne Conway as his spokesperson. Until Trump is ousted and America returns to being a democracy, there is no right answer. But we hope Cuomo, who\u2019s a straight shooter, decides that Don Lemon is right."

On good days it\u2019s been a fever dream, on most days it\u2019s been a lucid nightmare.\u201d You\u2019re right. But for some of his supporters, one part of his presidency has been enough to keep times sweet \u2014 the economy.\n\nThanks to the policies of the Obama administration, Donald Trump lolloped into the helm of a country with a booming economy. Naturally, it was and continues to be his instinct to backpedal from anything Obama did, regardless of the consequences. The economic consequences of Trump\u2019s radical deregulatory policies, erratic governing, and trade war have predictably stymied growth. The markets have stagnated and our trade deficit is eye watering, but because the economy remains relatively good, many people continue supporting Trump. This support is the Trump honeymoon.\n\nIt\u2019s for people who think \u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything he does, but I like some stuff.\u201d That \u201cstuff\u201d always includes the economy, and it\u2019s often their biggest defense of him. The fact that people give Trump contingent support based on the US\u2019s economic performance isn\u2019t something new. Presidents tend to lose favorability when the economy is bad and tend to gain favorability when the economy is good. The bad news for Trump, and all of us, is that this mediocre economic performance might be the best it\u2019ll get for him. There is a silver lining, I promise.\n\nThe United Kingdom is our closest overseas ally and they\u2019re presently dithering towards an uncertain Brexit future with a high potential for global economic repercussions should they fail to properly leave the European Union. This should keep Trump up at night.\n\nBritain requested an extension from the EU today because, with less than two weeks from a hard Brexit, Parliament has yet to approve any leave strategy. If approved, it\u2019ll buy them some time, perhaps enough to hold a second referendum, however unlikely that is. The most likely situation is that Britain\u2019s exit is rough, even with a Brexit deal. The Bank of England actually issued a warning saying that a worst-case-scenario Brexit would be worse than a global financial crisis for Britain, and the chain reactions of this for the US would mean an economic punch in the gut.\n\nThere\u2019s a very strong likelihood that once the economy is down, so goes Donald Trump\u2019s already meager approval. He can\u2019t afford to lose support. If Trump knew what\u2019s best for him, which in this case is not another cheeseburger, he\u2019d be lobbying Britain hard for a second referendum. He\u2019d threaten cutting economic and political ties should they leave. But no. The man with no sense of foresight and a penchant for hoisting himself by his own political petard is staying true to form. While this would be a bad economy for all of us, Trump would be having it much, much worse. Republicans would feel far less beholden to him because he would have nothing going for him. And that\u2019s the silver lining."

But now, in addition to being incomprehensible, Trump is also throwing violent threats into the mix, or at least we think they\u2019re violent threats.\n\nHere\u2019s what Donald Trump said to white supremacist propaganda site Breitbart: \u201cI have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump. I have the tough people, but they don\u2019t play it tough, until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.\u201d Okay, wait a minute here, because this just doesn\u2019t sound good.\n\nIf you wanted to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, you could argue that he\u2019s merely threatening to have the police enforce the law against anyone who breaks it. But then you get to the part about the military, which isn\u2019t allowed to do domestic law enforcement, so what is he even talking about? Once he throws in the part about the bikers being on our side, it seems he\u2019s talking about having bikers beat us all up if we don\u2019t vote for him, or something. And if he\u2019s saying that about bikers, is he also saying he\u2019s going to sic the police and military on us if we don\u2019t vote for him?\n\nDonald Trump just made the argument for why he absolutely must be ousted for his crimes, and his violent mental instability, before the end of his current term. He can\u2019t be in a position to even try to order the police and the military to carry out whatever violent fantasies he\u2019s imagining for the transition period if he loses the 2020 election. There aren\u2019t the votes to impeach Trump today, but he must be impeached and removed before the end of the current term."

Then one of his handlers hijacked his Twitter account and explained that he\u2019s going to veto it, calling it a \u201cDemocrat inspired Resolution.\u201d\n\nWith that, Donald Trump just stepped into the veto trap laid by the Democrats. It\u2019s not that he really had any choice. He didn\u2019t come this far with his imaginary \u201cnational emergency\u201d wall stunt, just to give up and sign a resolution putting an end to it. So unless he gets high on bath salts and changes his mind, he\u2019s going to veto this. That\u2019s when the fun begins.\n\nRight off the bat, the Democrats will have won, because they\u2019ll have forced Donald Trump to take sole ownership of the national emergency, in defiance of both parties. In that respect it doesn\u2019t matter how many or few Republicans tried to stop Trump on this; all the average observer will hear is that Trump went against the will of both the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate. His withering base will love this. But his casual supporters outside of his base \u2013 the ones who were always going to decide whether he sinks or swims \u2013 won\u2019t look on this kindly.\n\nThat\u2019s before getting to the next vote on the matter. Based on today\u2019s numbers, there aren\u2019t enough votes to override the veto. But we\u2019ve seen the number of dissenting Republican Senators grow from four to twelve in just a few days. As the public turns more loudly against Donald Trump\u2019s national emergency wall nonsense by the day, that number should go higher, in both the House and Senate. We\u2019ll see how the veto math plays out. But Trump just stepped in a trap, albeit one that he had no choice but to step in."

Donald Trump never forgets a sling nor an arrow, no matter how inconsequential. Not even becoming President of the United States is sufficient to assuage his endless, bottomless need to be respected, praised and, above all, taken seriously.

I point this out because it occurs to me that we of the left have been barking up the wrong tree for some time now. The narrative that Trump supporters are embarrassed by Donald Trump\u2019s tweets, by their illiteracy, their simplistic take on border defense and climate science and, above all, their vituperative vindictiveness \u2013 may simply be wrong. Maybe someone else out there has said the same, but that voice has not been loud enough to penetrate the collective conventional wisdom.\n\nWhen Barack Obama gently rebuked an angry crowd for disrespecting an elderly veteran who was heckling his speech, one wonders how Trump supporters saw that. As weakness? Did they think Obama should have encouraged the mob to throw the old man out, and, like Trump, offer to pay their legal fees?\n\nTrump\u2019s followers love Donald Trump because they are so much like him. They don\u2019t mind in the least that the \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian\u201d behaves like a classic schoolyard bully who is a coward at heart.

Palmer Report pointed out that even if the report was true, nothing was \u201cwinding down\u201d at all, and the submission of the report would mean that Mueller was about to crank his amps up to eleven. Of course the whole thing turned out to have been some kind of phony story planted by Team Trump, in the hope of putting pressure on Mueller. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nNow suddenly the story is that Robert Mueller\u2019s right hand man Andrew Weissmann is about to leave Team Mueller in favor of a job in the education field. It sounds like the kind of story that Team Trump would plant, in order to get the media to once again start chirping that Mueller is \u201cwinding down,\u201d as if his investigation were a late night party where most people had already gone home because nothing else was going to happen. But Mueller\u2019s spokesman has confirmed that it\u2019s true. As it turns out, this is a big deal \u2013 just not in the way that most of the media is spinning it.\n\nAndrew Weissmann led the way in putting Paul Manafort behind bars. Outside observers were all expecting him to do the same with the Roger Stone trial. That\u2019s not set to take place for another half a year, but there will be frequent court hearings leading up to it, and Weissmann isn\u2019t sticking around for it. It\u2019s difficult to imagine Weissman putting all this work into building a case against Stone, only to not stick around and ensure he\u2019s finished off \u2013 unless Mueller does indeed plan to call it a day fairly soon, in which case the Stone case would be handed off to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for Washington DC anyway.\n\nRobert Mueller has an all star team, and there highly competent prosecutors on board beyond Weissmann. But to see him walk away now? It tells us that Mueller really is gearing up to issue his report soon. And as we\u2019ve explained all along, Mueller isn\u2019t simply going to turn in a report and then go fishing. The really big fireworks, whether they be the arrest of Trump\u2019s kids, or the indictment of Trump, or all of the above, will coincide with his report."

I brought this to his attention before blocking him. I\u2019m told by a friend that I\u2019m still being stalked by this same troll months later, and that his invective has escalated \u2013 in length, in hysteria, and in the deeply personal nature of his insults \u2013 as befits an ego too weak to recover from a self-inflicted wound.\n\nYet for all this, my troll cannot touch Donald Trump when it comes to good old-fashioned, butthurt vindictiveness. Donald Trump never forgets a sling nor an arrow, no matter how inconsequential. Not even becoming President of the United States is sufficient to assuage his endless, bottomless need to be respected, praised and, above all, taken seriously. We are fortunate that we do not live in a world where failure to perform adequate obeisance to the \u201cDear Leader\u201d is mandated by law, but that day would be inevitable if Donald Trump had anything to say about it.\n\nNowhere is Trump\u2019s vindictiveness more in evidence than in his tweets. I point this out because it occurs to me that we of the left have been barking up the wrong tree for some time now. The narrative that Trump supporters are embarrassed by Donald Trump\u2019s tweets, by their illiteracy, their simplistic take on border defense and climate science and, above all, their vituperative vindictiveness \u2013 may simply be wrong. Maybe someone else out there has said the same, but that voice has not been loud enough to penetrate the collective conventional wisdom.\n\nWhen Barack Obama gently rebuked an angry crowd for disrespecting an elderly veteran who was heckling his speech, one wonders how Trump supporters saw that. As weakness? Did they think Obama should have encouraged the mob to throw the old man out, and, like Trump, offer to pay their legal fees?\n\nTrump\u2019s followers love Donald Trump because they are so much like him. They don\u2019t mind in the least that the \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian\u201d behaves like a classic schoolyard bully who is a coward at heart. Like my anonymous troll, they look at Donald Trump and see exactly what they have been looking for all along. They see someone just like themselves."

According to the much debated Christopher Steele Trump-Russia dossier, it exists, and Vladimir Putin is using it to blackmail Trump. But is this a real thing? We\u2019re suddenly much closer to getting there.\n\nAwhile back, one of the people named in the dossier decided to sue BuzzFeed, who originally published the dossier. The dossier accused this guy of conspiring with Russian hackers to alter the outcome of the election. Not only did BuzzFeed prevail in that suit, the evidence in the suit has just been released publicly tonight. It confirms that the allegations in the dossier about Russian hackers are indeed legitimate.\n\nThis is, by far, the biggest concrete step yet when it comes to proving that the Trump-Russia dossier is indeed a work of fact and not a work of fiction. Considering how much of the dossier has now been proven, it means the Pee Pee Tape is also very probably real. That puts us a lot closer to seeing it come to light.\n\nAfter all, once the public gets confirmation of what material a blackmailer is holding over an asset\u2019s head, that material starts to become useless. At that point, the blackmailer will sometimes simply release the material publicly, under the calculation that it\u2019s better to finish off the now useless asset. Stay tuned."

    "text": "Earlier this week, when New York subpoenaed financial records in relation to specific acts of bank fraud and insurance fraud committed by Donald Trump, Palmer Report explained that the state was embarking on a plan to take Trump\u2019s assets from him. The violations in question can result in massive monetary fines, which cash-poor Trump can\u2019t pay, meaning the state can then begin seizing his assets. Now, New York is moving further ahead on this plan.\n\nToday the New York Attorney General brought new legal action against Donald Trump over the charitable fraud and election fraud he committed with regard to his Trump Foundation. Between restitution and damages, New York is seeking about eight million dollars from Donald Trump. Maybe he can come up with eight million dollars in cash (or steal it from his reelection campaign) to pay off this one infraction. But this is just one of the numerous areas in which the state is targeting Trump with financial penalties, and it\u2019s not even one of the larger ones.\n\nBy the time you finish adding up the expected fines in the various cases New York is pursuing against Donald Trump, they could quickly total in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump can\u2019t finagle his way into getting his hands on that much cash. So this is where New York can start seizing his bank accounts in the state, his properties in the state, and whatever else the state courts end up signing off on.\n\nWhat can Donald Trump do to stop this? Nothing. He can\u2019t fire anyone, or pardon himself, in a state level case. This is going to happen to Trump. His only way out would be to negotiate a resignation deal in exchange for reduced criminal charges and reduced financial penalties, from both the Feds and New York State."

Nobody, outside the diminishing cult that believes every word out of his mouth, believes that Trump legitimately made money in any investment he ever made. Instead, Trump has proven to be a failure as the head of a casino, a professional football owner, and as an illegitimate president.\n\nIf professional failure wasn\u2019t enough, it has now become evident \u2013 not that it wasn\u2019t already assumed \u2013 that Trump was unsuccessful in academia. For someone who publicly called out for the release of President Obama\u2019s school records, it is rather pathetic that a fraud would do everything in his power to prevent the release of his own personal academic scores.\n\nWhile Trump employs a team of individuals paid to lie on his behalf, things become awkward when such individuals are called out by loved ones. Trump\u2019s top propagandist, Kellyanne Conway, is most well known for spewing \u201calternative facts\u201d that conflate the truth in order to benefit Trump\u2019s proposed point of view. Conway\u2019s own husband has clearly become sick of such lies, as evidenced by his recent tweets.\n\nGeorge Conway, Kellyanne\u2019s husband, recently agreed with S.V. Date, a White House correspondent for Huffington Post who corrected Trump by saying, \u201cNo, \u201c\u2019major sections of Wall\u201d are not being built\u2019.\u201d Conway added \u201cExactly. It\u2019s a brazen and ridiculous lie, repeated over and over and over and over again, to cover the fact that he was asleep at the switch for two years. #SummaCumLiar\u201d\n\nConway was one of the first to utilize that hashtag in an effort to publicize the fact that Trump not only was never at the apex of his academic life, but was also never near the top. While it is clear to the majority of people that Trump was never at the summit of anything in his life, it seems necessary to state that Trump has always been, and will continue to be, an absolute failure."

    "text": "As Donald Trump fails to lobby Republican Senators to vote in favor of his national emergency declaration to build the wall he had campaigned on, investigators and committees are busy on several fronts, tearing down the walls he has built around a lifetime of shady activities as a businessman and real estate mogul.\n\nWe have all heard and read about how the Trump Organization has come under suspicion for insurance fraud and asset inflation in the wake of Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony, and the list of document requests issued by congressional committees included a number of high profile members of the Trump Organization, such as Allen Weisselberg and Alan Garten, for example.\n\nIn the context of all these investigations, one storyline related to the Trump family\u2019s real estate ventures that might finally receive the public attention it most likely deserves, is that of the Trump Organization\u2019s involvement in the now abandoned Trump International Hotel & Tower project in Baku, Azerbaijan. According to The New Yorker\u2019s reporter Adam Davidson, this real estate project, in which the Trump Organization partnered with an Azerbaijani family that a 2014 Foreign Policy article characterized as \u201cThe Corleones of the Caspian\u201d has all the hallmarks of a corrupt money laundering operation that may even involve dark money coming from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\nThe questions raised by Davidson\u2019s article were serious enough to prompt Senator Sherrod Brown in March 2017 to call for a federal investigation of Donald Trump\u2019s involvement. Together with Senators Dianne Feinstein and Ben Cardin of the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations, Banking, and Judiciary committees, Brown wrote a joint letter to several Trump administration officials stating that \u201cit appears that the lack of due diligence by the Trump Organization [ \u2026 ] exposed President Trump and his organization to notoriously corrupt Azerbaijani oligarchs, and may also have exposed the Trump Organization to the IRGC. Even though the Trump Organization appears to have withdrawn from the Baku Tower deal, serious questions remain unanswered about the Trump Organization\u2019s potential criminal liability.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration officials addressed in the Senators\u2019 joint letter have so far failed to answer those questions and the relevant congressional committees were at the time chaired by Republicans who apparently preferred covering for their president to exposing the truth. As we all know, things have changed with the coming-in of the new Congress in January this year, so there is hope that some progress will be made on that front now.\n\nBy the way, the person running point on the Baku Tower project by all accounts was Ivanka Trump, who visited Azerbaijan in 2014 and proudly posed inside the tower building for a photo she posted on her Instagram account on November 24 of that year. Perhaps the reason why Donald Trump\u2019s daughter did not receive a request to provide documents to a congressional committee is that the incriminating evidence against her is already publicly available."

What didn\u2019t rank so high in the ratings was yet another horrific story coming from this administration\u2019s internment camps. Sen.

This is the real face of a national tragedy this administration owns \u2013 inerasable damage to human lives that their outright bigotry, xenophobia, and aspirations of autocracy can do.\n\nAs Speaker Pelosi said, Donald Trump isn\u2019t worth it. Rather than covering his idiotic ramblings and tweets, a way to just amplify the number of people he can lie to, we need to put a face on the damage he is doing to America and its reputation abroad \u2013 harm that we could still be repairing years after he leaves office.\n\nThe focus throughout 2019 needs to be on the faces of everyday people \u2013 the families separated for months due to the racist policies of Homeland Security, the workers who suffer every time Trump shuts down the government in a tantrum, the journalists like Jamal Khashoggi, who are crucial for a functioning democracy and now face a job made more dangerous by emboldened despots throughout the world.

That\u2019s right, this is legislation that calls for a report about Donald Trump\u2019s crimes to be made public, and not a single House Republican voted against it.

That of course means that the legislation now moves over to the Senate.\n\nThis next part should be easy, right? If House Republicans unanimously supported it, then most Senate Republicans are going to vote for it as well. Even if Mitch McConnell wanted to scuttle a vote, his own GOP ranks would force his hand. But now Lindsey Graham is trying to hold up the vote by insisting that an amendment be added that appoints a second Special Counsel to investigate the people who are investigating Trump\u2019s crimes.\n\nThat\u2019s right, Lindsey Graham has now gone full tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist demon. We think a Special Counsel should be appointed to investigate how Donald Trump and the Kremlin have managed to turn Graham, and whether the personal emails he admits were hacked in 2016 are being used to blackmail him."

    "text": "It is being reported by major British publication The Spectator that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is ready to indict Donald Trump, but Attorney General William Barr is preventing him from moving forward, because of a decades old DOJ memo that suggests you cannot indict a sitting President.\n\nA very interesting thing just happened in New York State: Paul Manafort was indicted on state charges for sixteen felony offenses. Several of Manafort\u2019s crimes involved falsifying business records in the first degree. As reported by Rachel Maddow on Wednesday night, this is the same kind of criminal charge in the same state for which Donald Trump was named as an unindicted co-conspirator.\n\nThis raises the very real possibility that New York State could indict President Trump at any time. New York State prosecutors are not federal prosecutors (not to be confused with the Southern District of NY, which is a federal office). They are not part of the Department of Justice and are not subject to DOJ internal policies. They have no restrictions on indicting a President.\n\nSo, why haven\u2019t they indicted Trump yet? First of all, most if not all, law enforcement offices work together, especially in determining jurisdiction issues. Clearly, Mueller\u2019s office has been in communication with state law enforcement offices. If the President of the United States is indicted by anyone, that indictment would be challenged in the courts, and the courts would have to decide if a sitting President could be indicted.\n\nRobert Mueller and his team of prosecutors are first-rate, and they are by far the best-equipped office to handle that court case. Additionally, the list of charges Mueller could potentially bring are much more likely to include post-election crimes that include abuse of power and other high impact crimes that could more effectively counter the defense argument that indicting a sitting President is too disruptive to the country.\n\nIt is clearly better for the Special Counsel\u2019s office to take the lead in indicting Donald Trump, and to argue the resulting court cases, but if Mueller is prohibited from moving forward, it is quite likely that New York State could take the lead and indict Trump.\n\nImagine New York State taking the lead after the Department of Justice sat on its hands and took a pass on its requirement to uphold the rule of law and provide a check to abuse of Executive power. What a stain on the reputation of the Department of Justice that would be. I can almost hear Robert Mueller saying as much to Attorney General Barr. Will the Attorney General allow the DOJ be embarrassed by allowing New York State do the work it refused to do?"

His former partner had just gotten a sweetheart deal from Judge Amy Berman Jackson when he was tsunamied with multiple charges from New York. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to realize Manafort will die in jail unless he flips on Trump.\n\nAnd frankly Roger Stone, while no rocket scientist, had to have seen his best laid plans crumble to dust once those New York charges were slammed onto Manafort\u2019s head. He was next and he knew it. So what else makes me think Roger flipped? Judge Jackson. She is anything but unprepared. The fact that she said she wouldn\u2019t address Stone\u2019s book being re-released, nor his Snapchat post, nor the insulting condescension by Stone\u2019s lawyers, sent a signal. She\u2019s allowing them all more time. Why? Some believe the delay is to let Stone hang himself, but he\u2019s already swinging from the evidence.\n\nNo, Jackson is no fool. Yes, she got on the bench today in a much more subdued fashion than yesterday. The MAGA crowd says she\u2019s finally realized Q is coming for her. Fox News says she came down hard on Manafort and suffered the political consequences of Manafort\u2019s lawyers calling her harsh. All of that is laughable. What is not laughable? Top Mueller prosecutor, Andrew Weissman, showing up for the Stone procedural this morning. Yes, one of the busiest men on Mueller\u2019s team just showed up in court just to wish Roger well.\n\nRoger Stone was quite turned out for his hearing today, with ubiquitous pocket square and steampunk villain sunglasses.

Of course there is no reason to believe this, considering that the leading Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are corrupt lying Trump-loyal loons like Jim Jordan and Louie Gohmert.\n\nSo now we\u2019ve reached a point where House Republicans are simply lying about what Whitaker said, even though there\u2019s a transcript, and this gives Nadler a legitimate reason to release the transcript to the public. House Republicans know this, and they know that their lie will only buy them a matter of days before it\u2019s revealed that they\u2019re lying, but this appears to be the closest thing they have left to a defense strategy.\n\nLast week Matt Whitaker resigned the cushy new job that Donald Trump had just given him at the DOJ, in an obvious attempt at keeping Whitaker from flipping on him. This alone was a fairly clear signal that Whitaker was no longer playing for Team Trump, and was more worried about his own criminal liability. This is even more reason to believe what Chairman Nadler told us: Whitaker has sold Trump out."

    "text": "For the past year, the worst of the TV pundits have tried to scare you into staying tuned in by pushing the frightening narrative that Donald Trump could just pardon everyone at any moment and magically get away with it all. If you\u2019ve been reading Palmer Report, or if you\u2019re familiar with pardons at all, you know they don\u2019t work that way. Yesterday, when New York brought its entirely expected state level charges against Manafort in order to ensure there would be no point in pardoning him, these same pundits treated it like shocking breaking news.\n\nAt least the most breathless of pundits have finally moved past the nonsensical pardon narrative. After all, they can\u2019t keep credibly claiming that Donald Trump is going to pardon his way out of this, now that they\u2019ve just had to acknowledge to their audiences that pardons are out the window. But now they need something new to scare people into staying tuned in, and it appears the worst of the lot have already settled on it: double jeopardy.\n\nThe new \u201cBig Scary Narrative\u201d goes like this. Even though the state level criminal charges against Paul Manafort are for different crimes than the federal charges he was just convicted on, these state charges are somehow going to magically get thrown due to double jeopardy. Nevermind that double jeopardy doesn\u2019t work that way. Nevermind that state prosecutors bring complementary charges against federal criminals all the time, and they know exactly how to do it, and it never gets thrown out, and it usually results in a conviction.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney isn\u2019t some complete idiot who was born yesterday. He\u2019s clearly choreographed this with Robert Mueller from the start, which is to say that Mueller didn\u2019t bring federal charges on these sixteen specific counts, because he was always going to let the state handle them as an insurance policy. Donald Trump and Paul Manafort cannot simply wave a \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d magic wand and ride off into the sunset, because nothing comes even close to working that way.\n\nThose facts about double jeopardy don\u2019t matter, of course, for the same reason it didn\u2019t matter that Donald Trump was never going to be able to pardon the state level charges that were always going to be a part of this. Manafort will try to use a double jeopardy defense, but it won\u2019t get him anywhere. Let\u2019s not forget he just went down on ten federal charges. His attorneys don\u2019t have superpowers.\n\nSo here\u2019s my advice: ignore the double jeopardy narrative. Any legal expert (who\u2019s not hyping it up for the cameras) will tell you that this isn\u2019t even an issue. Further, ignore any TV pundits who try to spend the next few weeks trying to keep you tuned in by insisting that the double jeopardy magic wand is about to be waved at any moment. It\u2019s an easy litmus test for figuring out who\u2019s worth watching and who isn\u2019t."

Like a villain who\u2019s permanently high on laughing gas, Junior just can\u2019t seem to treat the news of the day as anything other than a bizarre \u201cus vs them\u201d punchline. Today he reminded us just how much of an oblivious idiot he is.\n\nBy now you\u2019ve surely heard that actress Felicity Huffman and several others were arrested for allegedly paying bribes in order to get their kids into prestigious universities. Considering that Donald Trump Jr has spent his entire life having things handed to him that he didn\u2019t deserve by his wealthy criminal father, you\u2019d think he might want to sit this one out. But no, he\u2019s just that stupid.\n\nDonald Trump Jr, who still thinks Palmer Report can\u2019t see his tweets just because he blocked us on Twitter, made a point of quoting old tweets from Huffman and Lori Laughlin in order to rub it in. Nevermind, of course, that he\u2019s the poster child for this kind of thing. Then he added \u201cIs it just me or is everyone in Hollywood strangely silent today? Come on guys you\u2019re always very vocal in forcing your opinions on everyone\u2026 What changed?\u201d Wait, what the hell does any of this have to do with Hollywood?\n\nOf course Donald Trump Jr still seems to think that anyone who\u2019s on Team Trump automatically deserves a free pass for anything, and the more egregious the better. After Trump sycophant Tucker Carlson was caught appearing to endorse child rape during an old radio interview, and then refused to apologize for what he claimed were merely \u201cnaughty\u201d remarks, Junior tweeted this: \u201cThis is how to handle the outrage mob. Remember, even the most sincere apology means nothing to them. They want to break and ruin you. That\u2019s their end goal.\u201d What an idiot."

The media then tripped over itself in the race to insist that Pelosi had just \u201cruled out impeachment\u201d forever, scaring a lot of observers into thinking that impeachment won\u2019t happen. But now Adam Schiff is hinting at Pelosi\u2019s real strategy for taking Trump down.\n\nAs the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff is deeply involved in the House investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s crimes, and he surely knows what Speaker Pelosi\u2019s overall strategy is. So it\u2019s a big deal that when Schiff spoke with reporters this morning, he signed off on what Pelosi just said about impeachment, even while hinting at a far more devastating strategy instead.\n\nAdam Schiff used the opportunity to make the argument that there is already enough publicly available evidence for Donald Trump be indicted, even before getting that what Special Counsel Robert Mueller is about to expose. Schiff then went on to make the argument that if Michael Cohen belongs in prison for the crimes he committed with Donald Trump, then Trump belongs in prison as well.\n\nIn other words, House Democrats are doing more or less precisely what Palmer Report expected them to. They\u2019re setting up a scenario where Donald Trump knows he\u2019ll be indicted and arrested the second he\u2019s no longer president. Combine that with New York State dropping a big hint yesterday that it\u2019s going to start seizing Trump\u2019s assets while he\u2019s still in office, and it adds up to Trump being in a no-win situation and only having one way out.\n\nThe longer Donald Trump tries to remain in office, the worse it will get for him. His kids will be arrested. His assets will be seized. His ugly crimes and humiliating scandals will continue to be exposed. And he\u2019ll have a lifelong prison sentence waiting for him at the end of his presidency. Rather than try to stick it out and continue to get dismantled, at some point Trump will realize his only way out is to once again declare \u201cbankruptcy\u201d by negotiating a resignation deal in exchange for less time in prison."

    "text": "This evening Michael Flynn took the surprise step of asking the judge for yet another ninety days to continue cooperating with prosecutors. For its part, Robert Mueller\u2019s office stated that it had no opinion on the matter, while confirming that its cooperation with Flynn is complete. So where does this get us?\n\nMueller is essentially taking the same position that he took ninety days ago, which is that Michael Flynn has been such a big help, he doesn\u2019t even need to go to prison. Of course the judge didn\u2019t like that idea at all last time around, asking aloud if Flynn had committed \u201ctreason,\u201d and encouraged Flynn to go back and find more ways to cooperate. If Flynn had found a way to provide any additional cooperation during these past ninety days, Mueller would surely be saying so, instead of leaving him hanging.\n\nFlynn is ostensibly asking for another ninety days because he fears the judge will throw him in prison if the sentencing happens this week, and he\u2019s hoping something will come up along the way, where he can help some prosecutor on some case, even if it\u2019s not Mueller. But there\u2019s no looking past the underlying point here: despite his hugely serious crimes, Flynn helped Mueller so much, Mueller doesn\u2019t think he should go to prison. Contrast this with Mueller\u2019s ongoing quest to find a way to put Paul Manafort in prison for life, and to bankrupt Manafort in the process.\n\nIn other words, Robert Mueller is no pushover. He doesn\u2019t believe in leniency for anyone, without a darn good reason. Yet even after pushback from the judge, Mueller thinks Michael Flynn\u2019s punishment should be to go to Disney World. There\u2019s no way Mueller sees it this way unless Flynn gave up enough evidence to take down Donald Trump and all the other biggest of fish. We may have to wait longer to learn Flynn\u2019s fate, but I think we just learned Trump\u2019s fate."

This is where we\u2019re at in the psychological collapse, political collapse, and criminal collapse of the pretend President of the United States.\n\nIt took a second to figure out that Donald Trump was attempting to launch a berserk attack on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo when he claimed in the middle of the night that the \u201cWitch Hunt Hoax\u201d against him was started by \u201clittle Eric Schneiderman & Coumo.\u201d Trump is so far gone, he\u2019s attacking Schneiderman, who has been out of the picture in New York for some time. And how did Trump manage to get \u201cCoumo\u201d past his autocorrect? Anyway, whatever, that\u2019s not the point.\n\nDonald Trump is out of his mind, even by his usual deranged standards, because New York State is now going after him in full force. Michael Cohen used his public testimony and corresponding evidence to telegraph to investigators precisely how to hit Trump where it hurts, and sure enough, New York is subpoenaing bank records and insurance records for specific Trump transactions that it already knows are fraudulent.\n\nSome of these transactions involve millions of dollars in fraud. That means New York can and will hit Donald Trump with massive fines and penalties. Because Trump is so cash-poor, he won\u2019t be able to pay the fines, meaning the state can simply start seizing his assets. And because this is state level, Trump can\u2019t even try to pardon himself or fire anyone who\u2019s coming after him.

    "text": "The criminal justice system usually only operates this poetically in the movies. Moments after Paul Manafort got his federal prison sentence effectively doubled to around eight years, the District Attorney for Manhattan announced that Manafort had been indicted on New York state charges. But this wasn\u2019t some convenient timing by a grand jury. This indictment surely came down awhile ago, and was just unsealed today. So what does this have to do with Ivanka Trump? Everything.\n\nNow we know that New York has been secretly obtaining criminal indictments in coordination with Robert Mueller\u2019s federal investigation, and leaving them sealed until the appropriate time. Are we really supposed to believe that New York has only indicted Paul Manafort? Now that we know New York has gone there, there\u2019s almost certainly a whole stack of Trump-related indictments sitting in a vault under seal. This brings us to Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr, and the events of 2012.\n\nIn 2017, the New Yorker revealed that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance nearly indicted Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr for fraud, but then suddenly changed his mind after Donald Trump\u2019s then-attorney began making donations to Vance\u2019s reelection fund. Then a few months ago, the New York Daily News reported that the FBI was investigating whether this qualified as Vance taking a bribe. Now that Vance appears to be in trouble, suddenly he\u2019s helping the Feds by bringing perfectly timed state level charges against Paul Manafort. This tells us he\u2019s surely planning to do the Feds\u2019 bidding against Trump\u2019s kids as well.\n\nBest we can tell, the statute of limitations appears to have expired for the specific charges that Ivanka and Don Jr were nearly indicted on. But if they routinely conduct Trump Organization business in this manner, then they\u2019ve surely done things since that are equally indictable. Being indicted doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guilty, but it means you\u2019re in real trouble. Now we know that New York secretly indicted at least one person in Donald Trump\u2019s orbit awhile ago. Do the math."

In a rare unanimous, bipartisan vote, the House passed a resolution calling for the Attorney General\u2019s release of the Mueller report to the public.\n\nThe Special Counsel regulations require Mueller to submit his report to the AG, with further disclosure coming at the AG\u2019s discretion. But the current AG, William Barr, has not said exactly what he would do, and he refused to commit to making the report public when pressed about it at his recent Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nToday\u2019s resolution is non-binding, which means it does not have the power of law that can force the public release of the report. It is also not likely that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will allow the GOP-controlled Senate to consider a similar resolution anytime soon, and in fact Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham is already trying to sabotage it. But the unanimous vote is nothing short of a primal scream for transparency in the Mueller probe. Jerrold Nadler, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who introduced the resolution, aptly called the results \u201ca clear signal to both the American people and to the Department of Justice that Congress believes transparency is a fundamental principle necessary to ensure that government remains accountable to the public.\u201d\n\nThis House resolution did not pass because a handful of Republican moderates decided to break with their party. On the contrary, House Republicans put up weak resistance on the debate floor, mostly just grumbling about how the resolution appears to be a waste of time. In the end, the resolution passed by a whopping 420-0, with four Republicans voting \u201cpresent.\u201d No one knows when Mueller will wrap up his investigation and submit his report to Barr. But when that day arrives, Barr now knows what kind of furious bipartisan backlash he will face, starting with subpoenas, if he even thinks about trying to bury it."

Yesterday, Republicans voted to end Trump\u2019s sketchy military operation with the Saudis in Yemen. So what\u2019s suddenly going on here?\n\nSuffice it to say that the Republican Party, which these days is based almost entirely on selfishness and corruption, hasn\u2019t suddenly grown a conscience. They know exactly who Donald Trump is. They knew it back when they were rubber stamping his every move, and they know it now. The only thing that\u2019s changed is that they\u2019ve taken a look at Trump\u2019s worsening scandals and concluded that he\u2019s in real danger of going down. They\u2019re trying to put their name on something they can point back to later, so when they run for reelection, they can disingenuously claim that they stood up to Trump.\n\nIt won\u2019t work. We know this because, even after Republicans reluctantly finished off a sinking Richard Nixon, they were punished severely for it in the next congressional election. But at this point the Republicans are starting to place their bets that it\u2019ll be even worse for them if they stick with Donald Trump as he\u2019s dismantled, ousted, and imprisoned for his crimes and abuses.\n\nSo now what? Donald Trump just tweeted the word \u201cVETO!\u201d \u2013 making clear that he\u2019s now planning to defy the will of both houses of Congress, and both parties, while trying to unilaterally hijack the nation. If anything, a veto will only drive even more feckless and scared Republicans to vote against him when it comes to the veto override."

Nobody, outside the diminishing cult that believes every word out of his mouth, believes that Trump legitimately made money in any investment he ever made. Instead, Trump has proven to be a failure as the head of a casino, a professional football owner, and as an illegitimate president.\n\nIf professional failure wasn\u2019t enough, it has now become evident \u2013 not that it wasn\u2019t already assumed \u2013 that Trump was unsuccessful in academia. For someone who publicly called out for the release of President Obama\u2019s school records, it is rather pathetic that a fraud would do everything in his power to prevent the release of his own personal academic scores.\n\nWhile Trump employs a team of individuals paid to lie on his behalf, things become awkward when such individuals are called out by loved ones. Trump\u2019s top propagandist, Kellyanne Conway, is most well known for spewing \u201calternative facts\u201d that conflate the truth in order to benefit Trump\u2019s proposed point of view. Conway\u2019s own husband has clearly become sick of such lies, as evidenced by his recent tweets.\n\nGeorge Conway, Kellyanne\u2019s husband, recently agreed with S.V. Date, a White House correspondent for Huffington Post who corrected Trump by saying, \u201cNo, \u201c\u2019major sections of Wall\u201d are not being built\u2019.\u201d Conway added \u201cExactly. It\u2019s a brazen and ridiculous lie, repeated over and over and over and over again, to cover the fact that he was asleep at the switch for two years. #SummaCumLiar\u201d\n\nConway was one of the first to utilize that hashtag in an effort to publicize the fact that Trump not only was never at the apex of his academic life, but was also never near the top. While it is clear to the majority of people that Trump was never at the summit of anything in his life, it seems necessary to state that Trump has always been, and will continue to be, an absolute failure."

That means she\u2019s a primary target after all, and it only leaves one of two explanations for what\u2019s really going on here.\n\nThe first would be that the House Judiciary Committee is taking the long way around to getting documents about Ivanka Trump because it\u2019s concluded that directly targeting her might prompt Donald Trump to go berserk and try to retaliate. The second explanation would be more fascinating. In multi-tier investigations like this, investigators often wait to contact the primary target until the very end, or not at all, because they\u2019re instead hoping to get others to cooperate against that target.\n\nEither way, this is bad news for Ivanka Trump. Either the House Democrats are working around her because she\u2019s precious to her father but she\u2019s a primary target anyway, or they\u2019re working around her for traditional investigative reasons and she\u2019s the primary target. Now we wait to see which of those 52 people cooperate against her, and which of them are willing to commit obstruction of justice to protect her. It only takes one cooperator to turn over any given document in question."

We\u2019re talking about conviction-level evidence. Bear with me here.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee publicly informed Matt Whitaker a few weeks ago that because he\u2019d committed perjury, he needed to come back and tell the truth about Donald Trump, or the implication was that he\u2019d be criminally charged for it. Right after this, Donald Trump gave Whitaker a nice new DOJ job in an attempt to keep him loyal. But last week Whitaker abruptly resigned that new job, and today he testified to the committee that Trump instructed him to commit several obstruction of justice felonies. This was private testimony, but Chairman Jerry Nadler quickly made Whitaker\u2019s confession public. Here\u2019s the thing.\n\nYou see, this isn\u2019t just Whitaker\u2019s word against Trump\u2019s word. And while I explained earlier the importance of the fact that other witnesses have also testified that they saw Trump commit other similar obstruction crimes, the reality is that no one has to take Whitaker\u2019s word for it when it comes to these specific crimes.\n\nAsk yourself how the House Judiciary Committee knew that Matt Whitaker was lying to begin with. The committee must have had reliable witnesses, or hard evidence, or both, just to make that accusation against Whitaker. He didn\u2019t cave today because he grew a conscience; he caved because he\u2019s seen that they have enough to convict him. And whatever that evidence is against Whitaker, it\u2019s also evidence against Trump. So no one has to take Whitaker\u2019s word for it; the committee already has proof that Trump instructed Whitaker to obstruct justice. Whitaker\u2019s testimony is just icing on the cake.

We just didn\u2019t expect Whitaker to flip quite so quickly or dramatically. He testified today to the House Judiciary Committee about Trump\u2019s obstruction of justice crimes, according to Chairman Jerry Nadler. This is a big deal. But Whitaker isn\u2019t the first cooperating obstruction witness against Trump.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s been widely reported that former White House Counsel Don McGahn has been cooperating with Robert Mueller\u2019s obstruction of justice probe for more than a year, most of that time without Trump\u2019s knowledge. It\u2019s also been reported that Steve Bannon gave Mueller twenty hours of testimony, and no one testifies for that long unless they\u2019re cooperating. Before that, there were major media reports that Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer both documented Trump\u2019s obstruction in real time, and then gave those notes to Mueller.\n\nIn other words, this isn\u2019t merely a matter of Matt Whitaker\u2019s word against Donald Trump\u2019s word. It\u2019s a matter of Whitaker, McGahn, Bannon, Priebus, Spicer, maybe Hope Hicks, and probably others, all testifying that they witnessed Trump commit highly similar crimes in different settings. This adds up to corroboration.\n\nWe\u2019ll see where this goes, but here\u2019s what stands out. If even a dummy like Matt Whitaker can figure out that Donald Trump isn\u2019t really going to pardon any of his henchmen, that tells us that most of Trump\u2019s henchmen have likely figured out by now that there are no magic pardons. So the list of cooperating witnesses against Trump is probably even longer than we could guess at."

She made a point of adding that impeaching Trump right now just for the sake of impeaching him would be pointless, because he\u2019s \u201cjust not worth it.\u201d Palmer Report pointed out that Pelosi was clearly setting a trap for Trump. Sure enough, he just stepped in it.\n\nHere\u2019s what Donald Trump spewed out today: \u201cI greatly appreciate Nancy Pelosi\u2019s statement against impeachment, but everyone must remember the minor fact that I never did anything wrong, the Economy and Unemployment are the best ever, Military and Vets are great \u2013 and many other successes! How do you impeach a man who is considered by many to be the President with the most successful first two years in history, especially when he has done nothing wrong and impeachment is for \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019?\u201d Wow did he just blow it.\n\nFirst, just as we predicted, Donald Trump is the one who\u2019s normalizing the idea of impeaching him, just by talking about it. Second, he just set the bar for his own ouster by acknowledging that a president who has committed \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d should be impeached. Once Robert Mueller indicts Trump, or recommends that he be indicted, or however it ends up going down, Pelosi will use Trump\u2019s own words to explain why she has no choice but to impeach him.\n\nAt that point, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s judicious approach will pressure at least some Senate Republicans to go along with Donald Trump\u2019s ouster, for fear of going down with him. The Republicans are already at a point where they\u2019re voting against Trump\u2019s national emergency, for fear of having to answer for it to voters later. That\u2019s a big first step toward voting against Trump remaining president. Pelosi knows what she\u2019s doing, and Trump doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on here."

Sure enough, emails have now surfaced which prove that Rudy did in fact instruct at least one of these attorneys to strongly hint at a pardon.\n\nEmails from attorney Robert Costello have been obtained by CNN. They reveal that Costello, at Rudy Giuliani\u2019s instruction, told Michael Cohen that he should \u201csleep well tonight\u201d because he has \u201cfriends in high places.\u201d Costello is insisting to CNN that the emails mean that Cohen was seeking a pardon and that he and Giuliani were refusing to give it to him, but Costello\u2019s emails tell a very different story. So now what?\n\nCostello can plead ignorance all he wants, but these emails are the kind of smoking gun that will probably end up leaving him with no choice but to cut a plea deal against Rudy Giuliani. That in turn will leave Giuliani with the option of either flipping on Donald Trump or going to prison. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll find out if Rudy is naive enough to believe that he\u2019s going to get pardoned if he remains loyal to Trump.\n\nMeanwhile back in the real world, as we keep seeing again and again, there are no magic pardons in this scandal. State charges alone negate Donald Trump\u2019s ability to get his henchmen off the legal hook. We were reminded of this today when New York State brought sixteen new felony charges against Paul Manafort. Also, Matt Whitaker flipped on Trump today, because even he knows no pardons are coming. Rudy Giuliani is going to prison unless he flips on Trump."

He visited Mar-a-Lago after AF1 dust-up, & Boeing donated $1M to Trump inaugural.\n\nSo the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 are grounded all over the world, but here, Trump has a chummy phone call with his donor, and we can all roll the dice and take our chances! Sad! Grounding was inevitable, but I do wonder at the timing of it all. Boeing should have taken charge of this problem, and Muilenburg should pay a very high price for that very suspicious phone call with Trump. We Americans flew an entire extra day on planes with software an ex-pilot described as criminally defective.\n\nThis is a good example of cascading events. Another good example is the criminal prosecution of Paul Manafort. The former campaign manager sleazed his way through the federal court system, and ended up with a total of 7 1/2 years placed on his head. He didn\u2019t even get back to his prison in Alexandria before he was slapped with multiple charges brought by New York State.\n\nEvents continue to cascade. You can\u2019t stop that process, nor know where it will end. The judge in the latest Manafort sentencing, Amy Berman Jackson, was crystal clear about Russian collusion not being addressed at all in the case. To make her point, she even condemned the defense\u2019s insistence of \u201cno collusion\u201d with Russia as being a \u201cnon sequitur.\u201d When Manafort\u2019s attorney, Kevin Downing, tried to bring it up again in his statement after sentencing, he was justifiably shouted down as a liar by the audience. We don\u2019t know how this will end, but if I were Trump Jr., Kushner, Ivanka, and Eric, I wouldn\u2019t be humming the tune, \u201cI Love New York!\u201d"

Rather than covering his idiotic ramblings and tweets, a way to just amplify the number of people he can lie to, we need to put a face on the damage he is doing to America and its reputation abroad \u2013 harm that we could still be repairing years after he leaves office.\n\nThe focus throughout 2019 needs to be on the faces of everyday people \u2013 the families separated for months due to the racist policies of Homeland Security, the workers who suffer every time Trump shuts down the government in a tantrum, the journalists like Jamal Khashoggi, who are crucial for a functioning democracy and now face a job made more dangerous by emboldened despots throughout the world.

    "text": "For the past year, the worst of the TV pundits have tried to scare you into staying tuned in by pushing the frightening narrative that Donald Trump could just pardon everyone at any moment and magically get away with it all. If you\u2019ve been reading Palmer Report, or if you\u2019re familiar with pardons at all, you know they don\u2019t work that way. Yesterday, when New York brought its entirely expected state level charges against Manafort in order to ensure there would be no point in pardoning him, these same pundits treated it like shocking breaking news.\n\nAt least the most breathless of pundits have finally moved past the nonsensical pardon narrative. After all, they can\u2019t keep credibly claiming that Donald Trump is going to pardon his way out of this, now that they\u2019ve just had to acknowledge to their audiences that pardons are out the window. But now they need something new to scare people into staying tuned in, and it appears the worst of the lot have already settled on it: double jeopardy.\n\nThe new \u201cBig Scary Narrative\u201d goes like this. Even though the state level criminal charges against Paul Manafort are for different crimes than the federal charges he was just convicted on, these state charges are somehow going to magically get thrown due to double jeopardy. Nevermind that double jeopardy doesn\u2019t work that way. Nevermind that state prosecutors bring complementary charges against federal criminals all the time, and they know exactly how to do it, and it never gets thrown out, and it usually results in a conviction.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney isn\u2019t some complete idiot who was born yesterday. He\u2019s clearly choreographed this with Robert Mueller from the start, which is to say that Mueller didn\u2019t bring federal charges on these sixteen specific counts, because he was always going to let the state handle them as an insurance policy. Donald Trump and Paul Manafort cannot simply wave a \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d magic wand and ride off into the sunset, because nothing comes even close to working that way.\n\nThose facts about double jeopardy don\u2019t matter, of course, for the same reason it didn\u2019t matter that Donald Trump was never going to be able to pardon the state level charges that were always going to be a part of this. Manafort will try to use a double jeopardy defense, but it won\u2019t get him anywhere. Let\u2019s not forget he just went down on ten federal charges. His attorneys don\u2019t have superpowers.\n\nSo here\u2019s my advice: ignore the double jeopardy narrative. Any legal expert (who\u2019s not hyping it up for the cameras) will tell you that this isn\u2019t even an issue. Further, ignore any TV pundits who try to spend the next few weeks trying to keep you tuned in by insisting that the double jeopardy magic wand is about to be waved at any moment. It\u2019s an easy litmus test for figuring out who\u2019s worth watching and who isn\u2019t."

Over the past week, Donald Trump has been posting increasingly apprehensive and agitated tweets about the upcoming Senate vote to kill his national emergency. Senate Democrats can\u2019t pass the measure by themselves, but more than enough Senate Republicans are on board, and Trump will lose this vote. Some of his allies tried to bail him out, but he just screwed them over.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s remaining Senate allies have figured out that the only way to prevent Trump from losing this vote is to keep it from happening at all. To that end, they floated legislation that would essentially let Trump keep this ridiculous \u201cnational emergency\u201d intact (unless the courts intervene), while limiting his ability to declare future national emergencies. The hope within the GOP was that this measure might have been enough to convince the dissenting Senate Republicans to come back into Trump\u2019s fold.\n\nTrump either doesn\u2019t understand this kind of strategy, or he\u2019s too far gone to care, and so he\u2019s stepped in and made a point of killing the intervening legislation that might have prevented him from losing the big vote, according to the Washington Post. This means Trump is now actively sabotaging his own Senate allies, because he wants absolute power or nothing. If anything, we expect this will prompt a lot more GOP Senators to vote in favor of killing his current national emergency, perhaps even enough to override a veto.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidency and freedom are now entirely dependent on convincing Republican Senators not to go along with impeachment and removal. If twenty of them turn against him (out of fifty-three), he\u2019ll be ousted from office, and then he\u2019ll be arrested by the SDNY. Trump just gave Republican Senators every reason to lean toward kicking him out of office. This won\u2019t end well for them or him."

As Palmer Report noted earlier, the Democrats have been joined by enough Republicans to block Trump\u2019s declaration. However, Trump will veto the resolution as soon as it hits his desk. The Democrats have rallied together to weather this storm, but the remaining Republicans just can\u2019t seem to figure out what to do.\n\nMost Republicans don\u2019t want to openly defy Trump by voting against the declaration, even though many of them seem to agree that the declaration violates the Constitution and usurps Congress\u2019 power. Instead of manning up and doing the right thing, The Hill reports that one group of Republicans wants to give Trump a one-time \u201cpass\u201d in order to avoid going against him. Their idea of doing that is ludicrous. There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cone time\u201d when considering the powers bestowed upon the separate branches of government. Pardon the clich\u00e9, but one inch will lead to a mile and fiascos of this type would be fought in future administrations, instead of our country being governed.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Senator Mike Lee of Utah presented a proposal to \u201creform\u201d the National Emergencies Act of 1976 which would require that emergency declarations automatically expire if not passed by Congress in 30 days. Trump indicated to Lee that he would not support the proposal, and Lee will join the other four Republicans in voting to end the declaration. At the same time, Ted Cruz and Lamar Alexander are pushing an alternative that would allow Trump to take the money from elsewhere such as an asset forfeiture fund. This proposal is ridiculous. Trump had no right to declare the emergency. Why in the world should his bad behavior be rewarded by \u201cfinding\u201d money for him? Why can\u2019t the Republicans just admit that they don\u2019t want the wall any more than the Democrats do? They had two years to give him this funding when they controlled both Houses. This proverbial walking on eggshells is no way to run our government.\n\nI liken Trump to a child going through \u201cterrible twos.\u201d He has had a tantrum, and the adults in the room need to send him to time out. Instead, they enable his behavior. Mitch McConnell said to The Hill that \u201c[t]here\u2019s a lot of discomfort with the law.\u201d I suspect that\u2019s only because the child wants something he can\u2019t have. I would be willing to bet my next paycheck that McConnell didn\u2019t say that when Barack Obama was President. When are these people going to start doing what the American people sent them to Washington to do? For this group, I think the answer is, unfortunately, \u201cnever.\u201d\n\nThink of all the time, effort, and yes, money, wasted on this \u201cnational emergency\u201d debate. It continues to amaze me how Trump has no qualms about wasting taxpayer dollars on things that benefit him and not the citizens of this country. Even though opposition to Trump ties things up even more, I am thankful for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who won\u2019t back down on these issues. If we can somehow make it through the last of Trump\u2019s \u201cpresidency\u201d and this Republican tyranny, I see better days ahead for us."

And this guy is a lawyer, so if there were a less ridiculous and desperate defense to be had, then he\u2019d be floating that instead.

    "text": "Roger Stone is a guy who is already awaiting trial on seven felony counts that could put him in prison for the rest of his life, and is in danger of being sent to jail tomorrow for violating the terms of his bail. As terrible of a situation as Stone is currently in, he\u2019s now suddenly facing a new and arguably even bigger problem.\n\nRoger Stone\u2019s primary residence is in Florida, where the Attorney General is a Republican, and the Governor is an overwhelmingly corrupt Trump-allied Republican. For that reason, there won\u2019t be any state level charges brought against Stone in Florida, and even if there were, the Governor might end up pardoning him anyway. So Stone is in a unique situation where, unlike other Trump henchmen, there are no fallback state-level charges to dissuade Trump from trying to pardon the federal charges, right? Wrong.\n\nWhen the FBI raided Roger Stone\u2019s home in Florida and arrested him, it also simultaneously raided his apartment in the Bronx. Stone doesn\u2019t appear to spend much time there, but it still means he\u2019s a part time resident of the State of New York. Then throw in the fact that the FBI also raided the Manhattan apartment of Stone\u2019s friend Kristin Davis. She hasn\u2019t been charged with anything, but this does suggest that he was running some of his alleged criminal schemes out of her apartment.\n\nThe bottom line: New York can bring state level charges against Roger Stone. He can go into court and argue that the charges should be thrown out because he mostly lives in Florida, but there\u2019s no way Stone would be able to guess whether the judge would see it his way. So if New York were to charge Stone, he could no longer pin his hopes on becoming a free man thanks to a Trump pardon. The question has been whether New York was really going to do this.\n\nWe appear to have gotten that answer today, when New York dropped a sixteen count felony indictment on Paul Manafort just a few minutes after Manafort\u2019s federal trial ended. It wasn\u2019t that a grand jury was sitting around and trying to time this indictment; it happened awhile ago, and it\u2019s been under seal. Now that we know New York is sitting on an unknown number of sealed indictments, Roger Stone has to assume one of them is against him.\n\nSo if Roger Stone\u2019s strategy has been to sit back and wait for Donald Trump to pardon him, and everything about Stone\u2019s bizarre antics up to now has suggested that this is the case, as of today Stone can no longer bank on that strategy. We all know Trump was never going to pardon Stone anyway, but Stone was desperate enough to buy into the fantasy. Now that fantasy is over, and Stone will need to cut a plea deal against Trump if he wants a shorter sentence."

    "text": "When former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker abruptly resigned the cushy new DOJ job that Donald Trump had given him, it raised questions about whether it was because Whitaker was flipping on Trump in order to avoid perjury charges. Whitaker erased any doubt as to what was going on when he testified privately today before the House Judiciary Committee, giving up Trump in the process.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler spoke to the television cameras after Matt Whitaker\u2019s testimony, and he confirmed three things. First, Whitaker is no longer denying that he had conversations with Donald Trump about Mueller-related investigations. Second, Whitaker is revealing that he had conversations with Trump about firing U.S. Attorneys for the purpose of obstructing justice. Second, Whitaker is acknowledging that he and Trump discussed the scope of the Trump-Cohen SDNY case. So what does this mean?\n\nWhat stands out about Matt Whitaker\u2019s new story is that Donald Trump committed felonies by asking him to obstruct justice, and that in each instance, Whitaker refused to go along with it. This would mean that he didn\u2019t commit any obstruction crimes; only Trump did. If Whitaker\u2019s story holds up and he continues to cooperate, we don\u2019t imagine Nadler will still refer him for perjury charges. After all, Whitaker is a peon, and Trump is the big fish.\n\nMake no mistake here: whether he has some kind of formal plea deal that hasn\u2019t been revealed, or whether he simply has an informal agreement with the House Judiciary Committee, Matt Whitaker just flipped on Donald Trump, directly incriminating Trump on several felonies. Whitaker is now a cooperating witness against Trump for the prosecution."

    "text": "The massive college cheating scandal that rocked the news yesterday seems like it has nothing to do with Donald Trump. Today on Morning Joe, host Mika Brzezinski even called the explosive development \u201can incredible relief from Trump news and political news.\u201d There is indeed no evidence that Trump or anyone around him is involved in this particular scandal. Nevertheless, what is happening should frighten this president because it may spell big trouble for his legal liability and even his future as a businessman.\n\nThe college cheating scandal\u2019s prosecution is possible in large part because of a 1970 law known as RICO, which stands for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations. RICO offers a path to criminal and civil recovery in situations where leaders of an \u201centerprise\u201d have inspired their underlings to commit a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d From prison sentences to asset forfeiture and more, RICO can help ensure not only that all guilty parties get punished but that an enterprise itself gets shuts down.\n\nRICO was enacted to help fight organized crime. But prosecutors and private individuals have been getting creative, applying the law to other situations in which they argue there is a criminal enterprise at work. For example, RICO has led to indictments against FIFA officials for international soccer corruption, and it is a part of ongoing litigation into Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct.\n\nRICO\u2019s valuable role in the college cheating scandal highlights the law\u2019s proven power and widening applicability. This should scare the bejesus out of Trump and his business associates. RICO cases are challenging to bring, and they are not always successful. But it is not a stretch to think that the SDNY investigation into the Trump Organization could produce enough compelling evidence under RICO to make the whole company come crashing down. At the very least, this serves as a stark reminder that Trump\u2019s future hangs on so much more than the Mueller probe."

Along the way, the judge made a point of sending an unmistakable message to Donald Trump about his own fate.\n\nJudge Jackson began by slam dunking Paul Manafort for conspiring against the United States with a foreign enemy. She didn\u2019t say it, but that\u2019s precisely what Donald Trump did when he conspired with the Kremlin to rig the presidential election in his favor. Jackson then took more specific aim at Trump, calling out his \u201cno collusion\u201d mantra as a \u201cnon-sequitur.\u201d In other words, the judge just told Trump to shut the hell up.\n\nWhile bringing Donald Trump\u2019s catch phrase into the equation, Judge Jackson focused in on the fact that Paul Manafort has been committing a pattern of crimes for his entire life. Sound familiar? But the real hammer drop came when Jackson explicitly stated that because the question of Trump-Russia collusion wasn\u2019t raised at this trial, the outcome of the trial didn\u2019t rule out Trump-Russia collusion.\n\nThis was a clear rebuke of Donald Trump\u2019s stunt last week, in which he falsely claimed that Judge T.S. Ellis had stated that there was no Trump-Russia collusion, when this absolutely did not happen. Judge Amy Berman Jackson was making sure that Trump can\u2019t lie about it this time. By the way, New York State says it\u2019s bringing additional charges against Paul Manafort, which will result in additional prison time. He\u2019s toast. Then again, so is Trump in the end. Update: New York just charged Manafort on sixteen felony counts."

    "text": "The vote to block \u201cPresident\u201d Trump\u2019s fake emergency declaration looms over the Senate. As Palmer Report noted earlier, the Democrats have been joined by enough Republicans to block Trump\u2019s declaration. However, Trump will veto the resolution as soon as it hits his desk. The Democrats have rallied together to weather this storm, but the remaining Republicans just can\u2019t seem to figure out what to do.\n\nMost Republicans don\u2019t want to openly defy Trump by voting against the declaration, even though many of them seem to agree that the declaration violates the Constitution and usurps Congress\u2019 power. Instead of manning up and doing the right thing, The Hill reports that one group of Republicans wants to give Trump a one-time \u201cpass\u201d in order to avoid going against him. Their idea of doing that is ludicrous. There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cone time\u201d when considering the powers bestowed upon the separate branches of government. Pardon the clich\u00e9, but one inch will lead to a mile and fiascos of this type would be fought in future administrations, instead of our country being governed.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Senator Mike Lee of Utah presented a proposal to \u201creform\u201d the National Emergencies Act of 1976 which would require that emergency declarations automatically expire if not passed by Congress in 30 days. Trump indicated to Lee that he would not support the proposal, and Lee will join the other four Republicans in voting to end the declaration. At the same time, Ted Cruz and Lamar Alexander are pushing an alternative that would allow Trump to take the money from elsewhere such as an asset forfeiture fund. This proposal is ridiculous. Trump had no right to declare the emergency. Why in the world should his bad behavior be rewarded by \u201cfinding\u201d money for him? Why can\u2019t the Republicans just admit that they don\u2019t want the wall any more than the Democrats do? They had two years to give him this funding when they controlled both Houses. This proverbial walking on eggshells is no way to run our government.\n\nI liken Trump to a child going through \u201cterrible twos.\u201d He has had a tantrum, and the adults in the room need to send him to time out. Instead, they enable his behavior. Mitch McConnell said to The Hill that \u201c[t]here\u2019s a lot of discomfort with the law.\u201d I suspect that\u2019s only because the child wants something he can\u2019t have. I would be willing to bet my next paycheck that McConnell didn\u2019t say that when Barack Obama was President. When are these people going to start doing what the American people sent them to Washington to do? For this group, I think the answer is, unfortunately, \u201cnever.\u201d\n\nThink of all the time, effort, and yes, money, wasted on this \u201cnational emergency\u201d debate. It continues to amaze me how Trump has no qualms about wasting taxpayer dollars on things that benefit him and not the citizens of this country. Even though opposition to Trump ties things up even more, I am thankful for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who won\u2019t back down on these issues. If we can somehow make it through the last of Trump\u2019s \u201cpresidency\u201d and this Republican tyranny, I see better days ahead for us."

This would represent felony obstruction of justice on the part of Giuliani and Costello, and the emails sure read like a smoking gun that could send them both away. So naturally, Team Trump is now relying on its must absurd excuse to date.\n\nThe emails show that Robert Costello told Michael Cohen that he should \u201csleep well tonight\u201d because he\u2019s got \u201cfriends in high places.\u201d In other words, Cohen had nothing to worry about because Donald Trump was going to step in and pardon him, right? Not according to Costello, who is now blaming it all on \u2013 we can\u2019t make this up \u2013 a Garth Brooks song.\n\nCostello is telling the Daily Beast that while these published emails are indeed real, he wasn\u2019t dangling a pardon, he was just referencing the song \u201cFriends In Low Places.\u201d No really, this is his defense. And this guy is a lawyer, so if there were a less ridiculous and desperate defense to be had, then he\u2019d be floating that instead. Garth Brooks is apparently the best defense available, which means he\u2019s in a really bad situation.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what happens. Our guess is that once everyone finishes laughing at the Garth Brooks defense, Costello will conclude that he has little choice but to cut a plea deal against Rudy Giuliani, who would in turn face pressure to cut a deal against Donald Trump. That is, of course, unless Rudy and Costello are naive enough to fall for the same Trump pardon scam that they tried to play on Michael Cohen.

Vogel: \u201cBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg spoke by phone with TRUMP this a.m., urging him not to ground 737 Max 8s after Sunday\u2019s crash. * Muilenburg has tried to cultivate Trump. He visited Mar-a-Lago after AF1 dust-up, & Boeing donated $1M to Trump inaugural.\n\nSo the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 are grounded all over the world, but here, Trump has a chummy phone call with his donor, and we can all roll the dice and take our chances! Sad! Grounding was inevitable, but I do wonder at the timing of it all. Boeing should have taken charge of this problem, and Muilenburg should pay a very high price for that very suspicious phone call with Trump. We Americans flew an entire extra day on planes with software an ex-pilot described as criminally defective.\n\nThis is a good example of cascading events. Another good example is the criminal prosecution of Paul Manafort. The former campaign manager sleazed his way through the federal court system, and ended up with a total of 7 1/2 years placed on his head. He didn\u2019t even get back to his prison in Alexandria before he was slapped with multiple charges brought by New York State.\n\nEvents continue to cascade. You can\u2019t stop that process, nor know where it will end. The judge in the latest Manafort sentencing, Amy Berman Jackson, was crystal clear about Russian collusion not being addressed at all in the case. To make her point, she even condemned the defense\u2019s insistence of \u201cno collusion\u201d with Russia as being a \u201cnon sequitur.\u201d When Manafort\u2019s attorney, Kevin Downing, tried to bring it up again in his statement after sentencing, he was justifiably shouted down as a liar by the audience. We don\u2019t know how this will end, but if I were Trump Jr., Kushner, Ivanka, and Eric, I wouldn\u2019t be humming the tune, \u201cI Love New York!\u201d"

Now we\u2019re getting at least a big part of the answer, and it\u2019s eyebrow raising to say the least.\n\nWhile none of those 81 document requests were sent to Ivanka Trump, the New York Times dug in and figured out that 52 of the document requests are about Ivanka Trump. That means she\u2019s a primary target after all, and it only leaves one of two explanations for what\u2019s really going on here.\n\nThe first would be that the House Judiciary Committee is taking the long way around to getting documents about Ivanka Trump because it\u2019s concluded that directly targeting her might prompt Donald Trump to go berserk and try to retaliate. The second explanation would be more fascinating. In multi-tier investigations like this, investigators often wait to contact the primary target until the very end, or not at all, because they\u2019re instead hoping to get others to cooperate against that target.\n\nEither way, this is bad news for Ivanka Trump. Either the House Democrats are working around her because she\u2019s precious to her father but she\u2019s a primary target anyway, or they\u2019re working around her for traditional investigative reasons and she\u2019s the primary target. Now we wait to see which of those 52 people cooperate against her, and which of them are willing to commit obstruction of justice to protect her.

Some of his allies tried to bail him out, but he just screwed them over.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s remaining Senate allies have figured out that the only way to prevent Trump from losing this vote is to keep it from happening at all. To that end, they floated legislation that would essentially let Trump keep this ridiculous \u201cnational emergency\u201d intact (unless the courts intervene), while limiting his ability to declare future national emergencies. The hope within the GOP was that this measure might have been enough to convince the dissenting Senate Republicans to come back into Trump\u2019s fold.\n\nTrump either doesn\u2019t understand this kind of strategy, or he\u2019s too far gone to care, and so he\u2019s stepped in and made a point of killing the intervening legislation that might have prevented him from losing the big vote, according to the Washington Post. This means Trump is now actively sabotaging his own Senate allies, because he wants absolute power or nothing. If anything, we expect this will prompt a lot more GOP Senators to vote in favor of killing his current national emergency, perhaps even enough to override a veto.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidency and freedom are now entirely dependent on convincing Republican Senators not to go along with impeachment and removal. If twenty of them turn against him (out of fifty-three), he\u2019ll be ousted from office, and then he\u2019ll be arrested by the SDNY. Trump just gave Republican Senators every reason to lean toward kicking him out of office. This won\u2019t end well for them or him."

Moments after Paul Manafort got his federal prison sentence effectively doubled to around eight years, the District Attorney for Manhattan announced that Manafort had been indicted on New York state charges. But this wasn\u2019t some convenient timing by a grand jury. This indictment surely came down awhile ago, and was just unsealed today. So what does this have to do with Ivanka Trump? Everything.\n\nNow we know that New York has been secretly obtaining criminal indictments in coordination with Robert Mueller\u2019s federal investigation, and leaving them sealed until the appropriate time. Are we really supposed to believe that New York has only indicted Paul Manafort? Now that we know New York has gone there, there\u2019s almost certainly a whole stack of Trump-related indictments sitting in a vault under seal. This brings us to Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr, and the events of 2012.\n\nIn 2017, the New Yorker revealed that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance nearly indicted Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr for fraud, but then suddenly changed his mind after Donald Trump\u2019s then-attorney began making donations to Vance\u2019s reelection fund. Then a few months ago, the New York Daily News reported that the FBI was investigating whether this qualified as Vance taking a bribe. Now that Vance appears to be in trouble, suddenly he\u2019s helping the Feds by bringing perfectly timed state level charges against Paul Manafort. This tells us he\u2019s surely planning to do the Feds\u2019 bidding against Trump\u2019s kids as well.\n\nBest we can tell, the statute of limitations appears to have expired for the specific charges that Ivanka and Don Jr were nearly indicted on. But if they routinely conduct Trump Organization business in this manner, then they\u2019ve surely done things since that are equally indictable. Being indicted doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guilty, but it means you\u2019re in real trouble. Now we know that New York secretly indicted at least one person in Donald Trump\u2019s orbit awhile ago. Do the math."

He testified today to the House Judiciary Committee about Trump\u2019s obstruction of justice crimes, according to Chairman Jerry Nadler. This is a big deal. But Whitaker isn\u2019t the first cooperating obstruction witness against Trump.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s been widely reported that former White House Counsel Don McGahn has been cooperating with Robert Mueller\u2019s obstruction of justice probe for more than a year, most of that time without Trump\u2019s knowledge. It\u2019s also been reported that Steve Bannon gave Mueller twenty hours of testimony, and no one testifies for that long unless they\u2019re cooperating. Before that, there were major media reports that Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer both documented Trump\u2019s obstruction in real time, and then gave those notes to Mueller.\n\nIn other words, this isn\u2019t merely a matter of Matt Whitaker\u2019s word against Donald Trump\u2019s word. It\u2019s a matter of Whitaker, McGahn, Bannon, Priebus, Spicer, maybe Hope Hicks, and probably others, all testifying that they witnessed Trump commit highly similar crimes in different settings. This adds up to corroboration.\n\nWe\u2019ll see where this goes, but here\u2019s what stands out. If even a dummy like Matt Whitaker can figure out that Donald Trump isn\u2019t really going to pardon any of his henchmen, that tells us that most of Trump\u2019s henchmen have likely figured out by now that there are no magic pardons. So the list of cooperating witnesses against Trump is probably even longer than we could guess at."

She made a point of adding that impeaching Trump right now just for the sake of impeaching him would be pointless, because he\u2019s \u201cjust not worth it.\u201d Palmer Report pointed out that Pelosi was clearly setting a trap for Trump. Sure enough, he just stepped in it.\n\nHere\u2019s what Donald Trump spewed out today: \u201cI greatly appreciate Nancy Pelosi\u2019s statement against impeachment, but everyone must remember the minor fact that I never did anything wrong, the Economy and Unemployment are the best ever, Military and Vets are great \u2013 and many other successes!

Second, he just set the bar for his own ouster by acknowledging that a president who has committed \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d should be impeached. Once Robert Mueller indicts Trump, or recommends that he be indicted, or however it ends up going down, Pelosi will use Trump\u2019s own words to explain why she has no choice but to impeach him.\n\nAt that point, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s judicious approach will pressure at least some Senate Republicans to go along with Donald Trump\u2019s ouster, for fear of going down with him. The Republicans are already at a point where they\u2019re voting against Trump\u2019s national emergency, for fear of having to answer for it to voters later. That\u2019s a big first step toward voting against Trump remaining president. Pelosi knows what she\u2019s doing, and Trump doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on here."

    "text": "When former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker abruptly resigned the cushy new DOJ job that Donald Trump had given him, it raised questions about whether it was because Whitaker was flipping on Trump in order to avoid perjury charges. Whitaker erased any doubt as to what was going on when he testified privately today before the House Judiciary Committee, giving up Trump in the process.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler spoke to the television cameras after Matt Whitaker\u2019s testimony, and he confirmed three things. First, Whitaker is no longer denying that he had conversations with Donald Trump about Mueller-related investigations. Second, Whitaker is revealing that he had conversations with Trump about firing U.S. Attorneys for the purpose of obstructing justice. Second, Whitaker is acknowledging that he and Trump discussed the scope of the Trump-Cohen SDNY case. So what does this mean?\n\nWhat stands out about Matt Whitaker\u2019s new story is that Donald Trump committed felonies by asking him to obstruct justice, and that in each instance, Whitaker refused to go along with it. This would mean that he didn\u2019t commit any obstruction crimes; only Trump did. If Whitaker\u2019s story holds up and he continues to cooperate, we don\u2019t imagine Nadler will still refer him for perjury charges. After all, Whitaker is a peon, and Trump is the big fish.\n\nMake no mistake here: whether he has some kind of formal plea deal that hasn\u2019t been revealed, or whether he simply has an informal agreement with the House Judiciary Committee, Matt Whitaker just flipped on Donald Trump, directly incriminating Trump on several felonies. Whitaker is now a cooperating witness against Trump for the prosecution."

We all knew it was coming. We just didn\u2019t know it was coming this dramatically. Moments after Manafort\u2019s federal prison sentence got bumped up to the eight year range, the State of New York criminally indicted Manafort on sixteen new felony charges.\n\nThe new charges against Paul Manafort are centered around his mortgage fraud in the state, and include conspiracy charges. To be clear, these crimes cannot be pardoned by Donald Trump or any future president, and can only be pardoned by the Governor of New York, which is not going to happen. So this ensures two things.\n\nFirst, assuming Paul Manafort is convicted on these charges \u2013 which seems likely given that a federal jury has already convicted him on similar financial fraud charges despite the presence of at least one Trump supporter on the jury \u2013 this will result in additional years being tacked onto Manafort\u2019s prison sentence. He\u2019s already looking at very likely dying behind bars as a result of his age and his federal prison sentence, but this will make it even harder for him to get out of prison within his natural lifespan.\n\nSecond, this means that Donald Trump might as well not even bother trying to pardon Paul Manafort on federal charges. This would result in Manafort becoming a free man while the pardon of an alleged co-conspirator is contested in the courts. But in such case New York State would immediately arrest Manafort, and based on his history of tampering with juries, it would be unlikely that he would get bail.\n\nIn addition, New York State just sent a clear message to Donald Trump about his own crime spree. New York just subpoenaed Trump\u2019s financial records in relation to bank fraud and insurance fraud, suggesting it intends to fine him and seize his assets. And now New York is busting Trump\u2019s henchman Paul Manafort in overtly dramatic fashion, just moments after his federal sentencing. There\u2019s clearly more to come."

Sure enough, emails have now surfaced which prove that Rudy did in fact instruct at least one of these attorneys to strongly hint at a pardon.\n\nEmails from attorney Robert Costello have been obtained by CNN. They reveal that Costello, at Rudy Giuliani\u2019s instruction, told Michael Cohen that he should \u201csleep well tonight\u201d because he has \u201cfriends in high places.\u201d Costello is insisting to CNN that the emails mean that Cohen was seeking a pardon and that he and Giuliani were refusing to give it to him, but Costello\u2019s emails tell a very different story. So now what?\n\nCostello can plead ignorance all he wants, but these emails are the kind of smoking gun that will probably end up leaving him with no choice but to cut a plea deal against Rudy Giuliani. That in turn will leave Giuliani with the option of either flipping on Donald Trump or going to prison. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll find out if Rudy is naive enough to believe that he\u2019s going to get pardoned if he remains loyal to Trump.\n\nMeanwhile back in the real world, as we keep seeing again and again, there are no magic pardons in this scandal. State charges alone negate Donald Trump\u2019s ability to get his henchmen off the legal hook. We were reminded of this today when New York State brought sixteen new felony charges against Paul Manafort. Also, Matt Whitaker flipped on Trump today, because even he knows no pardons are coming. Rudy Giuliani is going to prison unless he flips on Trump."

    "text": "Science is the enemy of ignorance. It is little wonder, therefore, that Donald Trump is an enemy of science. On Tuesday Trump re-established his mistrust of science in two anti-science tweets in succession. In his first anti-science tweet of the day, Trump wrote: \u201cPatrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace: \u2018The whole climate crisis is not only Fake News, it\u2019s Fake Science. There is no climate crisis.'\u201d\n\nFirst, Patrick Moore is not a co-founder of Greenpeace. He was an early member who was later booted out. Second, climate science is not \u201cFake Science.\u201d In fact, there is no such thing as \u201cFake Science.\u201d Referring to science as \u201cFake Science\u201d is like referring to reality as \u201cUnreal Reality.\u201d It\u2019s an instant oxymoron. There is such a thing as pseudoscience, however. Pseudoscience hijacks the language of science in order to deceive the ignorant. Donald Trump is a proponent of pseudoscience. Anthropogenic climate change is established science that is supported by 97% of climate scientists. Donald Trump lacks the credentials to contradict these scientists.\n\nIn his second anti-science tweet of the day, Trump said: \u201cAirplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT \u2026 I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!\u201d\n\nActually, I would board a plane piloted by a young Albert Einstein if he received and passed all the usual training necessary to become a commercial pilot, and I would do so with confidence. I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere near a plane piloted by a man like Donald Trump, who has a reputation for never checking his facts, never reading, and is too arrogant to listen to anything anyone says.\n\nAirplanes are precisely as complicated as they need to be. Onboard airliner computers have built-in redundancy checks and sophisticated software tested by engineers over millions of hours that make aircraft safer and safer year by year. Donald Trump, on the other hand, is an ignoramus with an opinion. Donald Trump is beloved by his base precisely because of this kind of tripe. Science makes them angry because they don\u2019t understand it. When someone like Trump attacks science, someone they look up to in their misplaced zeal, they feel vindicated. Ignorance is Donald Trump\u2019s best friend."

Today on Morning Joe, host Mika Brzezinski even called the explosive development \u201can incredible relief from Trump news and political news.\u201d There is indeed no evidence that Trump or anyone around him is involved in this particular scandal. Nevertheless, what is happening should frighten this president because it may spell big trouble for his legal liability and even his future as a businessman.\n\nThe college cheating scandal\u2019s prosecution is possible in large part because of a 1970 law known as RICO, which stands for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations. RICO offers a path to criminal and civil recovery in situations where leaders of an \u201centerprise\u201d have inspired their underlings to commit a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d From prison sentences to asset forfeiture and more, RICO can help ensure not only that all guilty parties get punished but that an enterprise itself gets shuts down.\n\nRICO was enacted to help fight organized crime. But prosecutors and private individuals have been getting creative, applying the law to other situations in which they argue there is a criminal enterprise at work. For example, RICO has led to indictments against FIFA officials for international soccer corruption, and it is a part of ongoing litigation into Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct.\n\nRICO\u2019s valuable role in the college cheating scandal highlights the law\u2019s proven power and widening applicability. This should scare the bejesus out of Trump and his business associates. RICO cases are challenging to bring, and they are not always successful. But it is not a stretch to think that the SDNY investigation into the Trump Organization could produce enough compelling evidence under RICO to make the whole company come crashing down. At the very least, this serves as a stark reminder that Trump\u2019s future hangs on so much more than the Mueller probe."

Chief among them: Ivanka regularly asked to use Air Force One as her own de facto private jet. It was so outrageous that when then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson tried to put his foot down, Ivanka simply worked around it by taking corrupt Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the plane with her. It gets even worse.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that Ivanka wanted to use Air Force One as her own personal taxi service. For some reason, she wanted to be able to control who did and did not get to go on State Department trips, according to New York Times coverage of the new book. But the whole narrative takes an even stranger turn. At one point Donald Trump asked John Kelly to push Ivanka and Jared out of the White House just to get rid of the constant headaches involved.\n\nIt\u2019s been widely reported that Jared and Ivanka played a role in pushing John Kelly out of the White House, and this new information may help explain why it happened. But it\u2019s doubtful that Ivanka knew just how direct her father was in trying to push her out of the White House. In any case, she knows about it now. Jared Kushner\u2019s lawyer is claiming the entire book is a work of fiction. No wonder."

Along the way, the judge made a point of sending an unmistakable message to Donald Trump about his own fate.\n\nJudge Jackson began by slam dunking Paul Manafort for conspiring against the United States with a foreign enemy. She didn\u2019t say it, but that\u2019s precisely what Donald Trump did when he conspired with the Kremlin to rig the presidential election in his favor.

Sound familiar? But the real hammer drop came when Jackson explicitly stated that because the question of Trump-Russia collusion wasn\u2019t raised at this trial, the outcome of the trial didn\u2019t rule out Trump-Russia collusion.\n\nThis was a clear rebuke of Donald Trump\u2019s stunt last week, in which he falsely claimed that Judge T.S.

Trump apparently didn\u2019t find out about this until last night, and let\u2019s just say that he didn\u2019t take the news well.\n\nThe eruption started last evening when Donald Trump posted this surreal attack on his home state: \u201cNew York State and its Governor, Andrew Cuomo, are now proud members of the group of PRESIDENTIAL HARASSERS. No wonder people are fleeing the State in record numbers. The Witch Hunt continues!\u201d But that was just the beginning.\n\nA few hours later, the Republican Party \u2013 which is now little more than a puppet of the Trump regime \u2013 posted this bizarre tweet: \u201cThe NY Attorney General called President Trump an \u201cillegitimate president.\u201d She has proven to have a vendetta against real Donald Trump & is using her position of power to baselessly smear the President & the work he\u2019s done for the American people.\u201d If Trump is guilty, and he is, does it matter that the New York Attorney General doesn\u2019t like him?\n\nThen sometime around midnight, Donald Trump retweeted the GOP, adding that it\u2019s \u201cAll part of the Witch Hunt!\u201d We suspect he\u2019ll still be yelling that after New York State seizes Trump Tower and he\u2019s in prison. Then after midnight, just for good measure, Trump retweeted disgraced Republican Congressman Jim Jordan several times in a row. Then he attacked someone named \u201cCoumo\u201d before deleting it."

    "text": "Science is the enemy of ignorance. It is little wonder, therefore, that Donald Trump is an enemy of science. On Tuesday Trump re-established his mistrust of science in two anti-science tweets in succession. In his first anti-science tweet of the day, Trump wrote: \u201cPatrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace: \u2018The whole climate crisis is not only Fake News, it\u2019s Fake Science. There is no climate crisis.'\u201d\n\nFirst, Patrick Moore is not a co-founder of Greenpeace. He was an early member who was later booted out. Second, climate science is not \u201cFake Science.\u201d In fact, there is no such thing as \u201cFake Science.\u201d Referring to science as \u201cFake Science\u201d is like referring to reality as \u201cUnreal Reality.\u201d It\u2019s an instant oxymoron. There is such a thing as pseudoscience, however. Pseudoscience hijacks the language of science in order to deceive the ignorant. Donald Trump is a proponent of pseudoscience. Anthropogenic climate change is established science that is supported by 97% of climate scientists. Donald Trump lacks the credentials to contradict these scientists.\n\nIn his second anti-science tweet of the day, Trump said: \u201cAirplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT \u2026 I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!\u201d\n\nActually, I would board a plane piloted by a young Albert Einstein if he received and passed all the usual training necessary to become a commercial pilot, and I would do so with confidence. I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere near a plane piloted by a man like Donald Trump, who has a reputation for never checking his facts, never reading, and is too arrogant to listen to anything anyone says.\n\nAirplanes are precisely as complicated as they need to be. Onboard airliner computers have built-in redundancy checks and sophisticated software tested by engineers over millions of hours that make aircraft safer and safer year by year. Donald Trump, on the other hand, is an ignoramus with an opinion. Donald Trump is beloved by his base precisely because of this kind of tripe. Science makes them angry because they don\u2019t understand it. When someone like Trump attacks science, someone they look up to in their misplaced zeal, they feel vindicated. Ignorance is Donald Trump\u2019s best friend."

That\u2019s just how bad things are in general for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman Paul Manafort right now. But maybe, after last week, he thinks things are looking up for him. That feeling won\u2019t last long \u2013 and Wednesday\u2019s new sentencing hearing is only part of the problem.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what Judge Amy Berman Jackson does to Paul Manafort today. She can tack on another as much as ten additional years to his existing four year sentence. At his age, if Manafort ends up with fourteen years in prison, it\u2019s almost certainly a life sentence. But let\u2019s say he gets less than that. Let\u2019s say he only ends up with a total of eight years in prison. Maybe he\u2019s thinking he can get out by his mid-seventies.\n\nNot so much. New York State says it\u2019s bringing a criminal case against Paul Manafort that\u2019s distinct from the two federal cases we\u2019ve all been focused on. Manafort will be in prison while that trial goes on, and if he\u2019s convicted on any or all of the charges, that\u2019ll get tacked onto the end of his existing sentence. So the odds of Manafort ever getting out of prison are going to be small even if he gets off fairly leniently again on Wednesday. From there it gets even worse.\n\nRemember back when Paul Manafort gave up tens of millions of dollars in assets, including his apartment in Trump Tower, as part of his original plea deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller? He didn\u2019t get any of that back when he broke the deal. Now Mueller is seeking $25 million from him in the criminal case where he didn\u2019t cut a deal. We\u2019ll see if crackpot Judge T.S. Ellis agrees to take even more of Manafort\u2019s money away. But the penalties just keep getting piled on. Manafort caught a lucky break last week, but it was probably for nothing."

    "text": "Donald Trump is the most prolific liar in history. His blatant lies, narcissism, and incompetence have made him a walking disaster for our country. This all pales in comparison to his recent budget proposal. After giving massive tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations, he now wants to make up the difference by stealing from hard-working American citizens who have been contributing members to society and who, upon retirement, are counting on the funds that have been involuntarily extracted from their paychecks for many, many years.\n\nTrump proposes to cut $845 billion from Medicare, but that\u2019s not all \u2014 this proposal also includes across the board cuts to both Social Security and Medicaid according to The Washington Post and MSNBC. Trump would have a massive revolt on his hands if he could pass his spending bill, which he claims will balance the budget in 10 years. According to the Washington Post, this bill cannot possibly balance the budget before 2034. Yet another lie from Trump. Taking money from the elderly, poor, and sick is despicable, and I have a suggestion for Trump to balance his budget without stealing from Americans.\n\nTrump needs to keep his useless butt in Washington and do his job. According to the Washington Post, taxpayers paid over $64 million for Trump\u2019s trips to Mar-a-Lago during 2017 and 2018. To see the full range of his travel activities, take a deep breath first and check out this article. Further, NBC News reported that in 781 days in office, Trump spent 229 days at Trump properties and 173 days at his golf properties. In February 2019, the Government Accountability Office estimates that federal agencies incurred approximately $13.6 million for FOUR trips to Mar-a-Lago (from February 3 to March 5, 2017) as published by NPR. These figures do not include the hundreds of thousands spent in secret service protection for Junior and Eric\u2019s travels.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cpresidency\u201d is about him and no one else. He wants to take healthcare from seniors who can no longer fend for themselves to build a wall in his honor that no one else wants. Not only do the vast majority of Americans NOT want a wall, it has been proven time and again that walls don\u2019t work. The vast majority of illegal drugs come through legal entry ports, and the vast majority of illegals are here on overstayed visas. He continues to ignore the facts, all to leave some useless monument to his failed \u201cpresidency.\u201d\n\nFortunately, the Democrats now hold power in the House and will not allow this act of blatant theft from American citizens who have for years paid into the system. Ted Lieu has been vocal about his opposition, and Dan Pfeiffer, former White House Communications Director under President Obama, tells the Washington Post that the proposed cuts are \u201ca huge gift for Democrats.\u201d I agree. Keep pushing it, Donald Trump. Then, we\u2019ll finally have a reason to thank you."

This is where we\u2019re at in the psychological collapse, political collapse, and criminal collapse of the pretend President of the United States.\n\nIt took a second to figure out that Donald Trump was attempting to launch a berserk attack on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo when he claimed in the middle of the night that the \u201cWitch Hunt Hoax\u201d against him was started by \u201clittle Eric Schneiderman & Coumo.\u201d Trump is so far gone, he\u2019s attacking Schneiderman, who has been out of the picture in New York for some time. And how did Trump manage to get \u201cCoumo\u201d past his autocorrect? Anyway, whatever, that\u2019s not the point.\n\nDonald Trump is out of his mind, even by his usual deranged standards, because New York State is now going after him in full force. Michael Cohen used his public testimony and corresponding evidence to telegraph to investigators precisely how to hit Trump where it hurts, and sure enough, New York is subpoenaing bank records and insurance records for specific Trump transactions that it already knows are fraudulent.\n\nSome of these transactions involve millions of dollars in fraud. That means New York can and will hit Donald Trump with massive fines and penalties. Because Trump is so cash-poor, he won\u2019t be able to pay the fines, meaning the state can simply start seizing his assets. And because this is state level, Trump can\u2019t even try to pardon himself or fire anyone who\u2019s coming after him. Trump is hosed, he knows it, and he sounds like a guy who belongs in a rubber room."

The question was whether mainstream Americans could convince enough of Carlson\u2019s advertisers to bail, such that Fox would conclude he was no longer profitable to keep on the air.\n\nWe know this because it\u2019s the calculus that was used when other Fox News hosts got into scandalous trouble. Laura Ingraham narrowly survived the loss of several advertisers, while Bill O\u2019Reilly didn\u2019t survive that math. Even as we wait for that process to play out with Tucker Carlson, he\u2019s suddenly talking about \u201cvacation.\u201d\n\nOn Fox News tonight, Sean Hannity claimed that Tucker Carlson was supposed to be on vacation this week, and that Carlson only showed up to work this week in order to fight back against the haters. Hannity made it sound like Carlson was heading out on vacation tomorrow, but now Fox News is confirming that Carlson will be on the air all week. Wait, so where did his \u201cvacation\u201d go? Are we really supposed to believe Hannity\u2019s story?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Back when Laura Ingraham attacked the Parkland school shooting survivors and started losing advertisers by the bucketload, she suddenly went on a supposed pre-planned \u201cvacation\u201d as well. Shortly after Megyn Kelly had her feud with Donald Trump, she suddenly went on \u201cvacation.\u201d And of course O\u2019Reilly went on \u201cvacation\u201d just before he got fired. Funny how these Fox people are always going on vacation just as their scandals are exploding. We don\u2019t know if Tucker Carlson is going on vacation or not, but the fact that he was supposedly supposed to be on vacation this week is, well, convenient."

As the sitting Vice President, Mike Pence already has an office on the Senate side of the Capitol building. In fact NPR says that Pence rarely even uses his House office. Pence won\u2019t shed any tears over this. But this particular move isn\u2019t about harming Pence. It\u2019s about sending a message to the public that she\u2019s planning to dismantle this illegitimate administration after all.\n\nThis comes just one day after Pelosi made the strategic move of publicly stating that she\u2019s not going to try to impeach Donald Trump at this particular time. The clear implication was that she\u2019s waiting until she has her hands on the kind of evidence that can ensure that impeachment will result in removal. Sure enough, this put the Resistance in an uproar, just as she was counting on, and now the public is beating the impeachment drum even more loudly, which works in her favor.\n\nBut because Nancy Pelosi knew she would take some heat from the people who can\u2019t figure out how to read between the lines, she\u2019s throwing them a bone today by kicking Mike Pence out of his own office. It\u2019s just one small symbolic sliver of what all she has up her sleeve when it comes to dismantling the Trump regime and taking them down."

As of today it\u2019s finally safe to say that it\u2019s the latter.\n\nWe already know that Yang founded the chain of massage parlors that was later busted for being a front for sex trafficking. We also know that Yang hung out at Mar-a-Lago and took selfies with Donald Trump and his allies. And we know that Yang was selling Chinese executives access to Trump. Today we learned that Yang was also allegedly selling Trump-connected visas to immigrants. But none of that is why the scandal has reached critical mass.\n\nToday the White House issued a formal statement about the matter. It was predictably short and pointless: \u201cThe President doesn\u2019t know this woman.\u201d But the fact that the White House felt compelled to make a formal statement is a clear sign that Donald Trump\u2019s handlers don\u2019t expect this story to go away. Merely commenting on a scandal like this \u2013 even if you\u2019re denying it \u2013 merely adds heft and exposure to the whole thing. You don\u2019t do it unless you think it\u2019s going to blow up anyway.\n\nSo now we have a clear signal that Donald Trump, or at least his handlers, think the Cindy Yang scandal is going to blow up big time. Even more telling, even as his handlers try to publicly address the matter in the feeble hope of getting out ahead of it, Trump himself has been afraid to tweet a word about Yang. This is going to get bigger and uglier, and probably soon."

    "text": "Last night we all learned that the State of New York has subpoenaed banking records relating to several specific instances of Donald Trump\u2019s financial fraud, including the bank fraud he committed while trying and failing to buy the Buffalo Bills. Palmer Report explained that this is New York\u2019s way of targeting his assets, which can be seized after he fails to pay the massive financial fines they\u2019re going to hit him with.\n\nNow it looks like Donald Trump is interpreting New York State\u2019s actions in the same way we are. Rather than merely shaking the whole thing off, Trump revealed this evening that he\u2019s very much scared about what\u2019s being done to him. Not only that, Trump went so bonkers about it, he ended up attacking his home state in the process.\n\nHere\u2019s what Trump tweeted: \u201cNew York State and its Governor, Andrew Cuomo, are now proud members of the group of PRESIDENTIAL HARASSERS. No wonder people are fleeing the State in record numbers. The Witch Hunt continues!\u201d Wait a minute here, because this doesn\u2019t even make sense by Trumpian standards.\n\nFor the record, Trump is wrong about people fleeing the state. New York did see its statewide population decrease by about one percent from 2017 to 2018, but that\u2019s almost a rounding error. According to census estimates, New York City\u2019s population continues to climb. So what\u2019s Trump talking about here? Nothing at all. He just couldn\u2019t think of a better insult about his home state, even as it moves in on bankrupting him."

    "authors": [
      "Bill Palmer"
    ],
    "text": "Here\u2019s the thing about reports that come from unnamed inside sources. In order to believe it, you have to take the reporter\u2019s word on it that the source exists to begin with, and you have to assume that the source is being truthful to the reporter. That can be the tricky part, as insiders only tend to share information with reporters to drive their own agenda, so the information typically is slathered in bias at best. But when a fairly major publication claims to have inside knowledge of something explosive, you have to at least chew on it.\n\nThat brings us to this new report from British publication The Spectator that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has finished his report, and he\u2019s going to use it to push for indictments against four members of Donald Trump\u2019s family. That\u2019s explosive enough, of course, before you get to the additional claim that Mueller also wants to indict Trump himself. Then there\u2019s the kicker: new Attorney General William Barr is cool with indicting Trump\u2019s family, but he\u2019s pushing back on indicting Trump himself. Can any of this be real?\n\nIn a word, maybe. As a first step, I like to try to match up insider claims to what we already know, and see if it makes any logical sense. The Spectator says that Robert Mueller wants indictments against Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump. Let\u2019s see here. Don Jr and Kushner are easy; they each illicitly met with the Russians, and they both appear to have committed perjury, before getting to any financial crimes. Ivanka and Eric both have their fingerprints all over the Trump Organization, which is one big financial fraud outfit. So if Mueller is indeed targeting the Trump family for financial crimes, this all makes sense.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part about Mueller wanting to indict Trump himself. One television pundit after another has spent the past year insisting there\u2019s a Department of Justice \u201cpolicy\u201d or \u201crule\u201d against indicting a sitting president, but as Palmer Report has repeatedly pointed out, there is no such thing. There is only a stray memo from the 1970s that has never been tested and carries no legal weight. So yes, we could buy Mueller seeking to indict Trump. Even if Mueller doesn\u2019t think the indictment would hold up, merely recommending it could be crucial in influencing the general public.\n\nThis leaves us with the question of why William Barr would oppose indicting Donald Trump, but would be fine with indicting Trump\u2019s family. If Barr really is corruptly trying to protect Trump, one would think he would try to protect Trump\u2019s kids as well. So if Barr is okay with Mueller indicting Trump\u2019s kids, then Barr must not be all that interested in protecting Trump. In such case, we would have to assume that Barr is merely opposed to indicting Trump simply because that\u2019s his interpretation of the law.\n\nAll of the above sounds plausible. And we certainly have no reason to believe The Spectator would be making up an inside source, or quoting someone whom it knows isn\u2019t legitimately on the inside. This leads us to the big question, though. Why would anyone involved in this process be motivated to leak it? What would be the point? We could envision a scenario in which Mueller is struggling to convince Barr to indict Trump \u2013 and someone involved in the process, who is on Mueller\u2019s side, is trying to \u201chelp\u201d by leaking this.\n\nBut that in turn would leave questions about why the usually secretive Team Mueller is suddenly resorting to leaks like this. In addition, there\u2019s the question of why they would only leak this to a British publication, without bothering to also leak it to household name news outlets in the U.S., if the goal is to get the American public to believe it. So let\u2019s watch and see if similar leaks appear in additional major news outlets in the coming days. The only thing we logically know for sure is that Mueller doesn\u2019t plan to go small with his endgame; it\u2019s simply not how he operates."

    "text": "Timing is everything, so why did Nancy Pelosi choose this week to say publicly that she would not move to impeach President Trump unless she discovers new and significant information? And, even more curious, why would Maxine Waters, who has been the most vocal proponent of impeachment, suddenly reverse course and support Pelosi\u2019s statement and echo her sentiments that they need Republican support?\n\nIf reports are to be believed, it is all about timing. As Palmer Report stated yesterday, it is being reported that Mueller turned in his report to William Barr last week, and Mueller wants to indict President Trump. Barr, reportedly said no to indicting the President, but agreed to Mueller\u2019s other indictments, including Trump\u2019s children.\n\nInstead of making a final decision and unleashing the indictments however, Barr held off. Speculation on the Hill is that Barr feels it is up to Congress to impeach, not the DOJ to indict, and that Mueller\u2019s counter argument is that if there has to be more than one check to abuse of power, and if one check fails, another check cannot fail. Cue the message from Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters. The message is not that they will not impeach, but it is that you should indict, and if you don\u2019t, you have to send a report so full-throttled it will convince Republicans.\n\nPelosi\u2019s and Water\u2019s statements are intended for an audience of one and that one is William Barr. Many Democrats on the Hill believe that Barr is focused on limiting the damage the Trump scandal will do to the Republican Party, and the Republicans want Trump out by 2020, but Republicans would prefer to force Democrats into the lead position on impeachment, so they could suffer from the inevitable backlash.\n\nPelosi brilliantly sent a message, to Attorney General Barr. Do your part or own the consequences. You cannot hand off your responsibility to Pelosi and expect her to run with it. Nancy Pelosi will not fall into a political trap."

    "text": "When Nancy Pelosi talks about the House\u2019s oversight of President Trump, it is important to understand exactly what she is saying. Last year\u2019s blue wave gave the Democrats a sorely needed majority in the House of Representatives which made oversight possible. In the short time that has elapsed since Pelosi took the gavel for her second time as speaker, we have seen the House\u2019s investigatory wheels shed their rust and start cranking again.\n\nWhen Speaker Pelosi answered questions about impeachment in a recent interview with The Washington Post, one particular phrase about Trump grabbed headlines: \u201cHe\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d It is not surprising that the media chose to feature this phrase because it is indeed catchy. But if you did not get a chance to read past the headlines, you might have the wrong impression of what is going on. Taken out of context, this phrase lends itself to misinterpretation about Pelosi\u2019s impeachment musings in two ways that do not reflect what she actually said.\n\nFirst, \u201cHe\u2019s just not worth it\u201d by itself can come across as an aloof cop-out filled with attitude. In other words, that phrase can imply that Pelosi realizes impeachment will never be possible so she is resorting to making a weird case that somehow Trump is so horrible that they just cannot be bothered. Another misinterpretation of that lone phrase is that Pelosi is simply expressing surrender. \u201cHe\u2019s just not worth it\u201d can be read as a depressing admission that it will never make sense to pursue impeachment because the case will always be weak.\n\nFortunately, none of these interpretations seem realistic if you read Pelosi\u2019s entire quote. Responding to a question about recent calls for impeachment, Pelosi told the interviewer, \u201cImpeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s complete answer gives her catchy phrase some important context, painting a clearer picture. Pelosi simply expressed the idea that impeachment is a potentially harmful process that should never be rushed into. More importantly, she made it clear that if investigations turn up things that people across the aisle consider to be bombshells, then impeachment will be on the table. Finally, in case there was any doubt that her views about Trump\u2019s presidency may be softening, Pelosi swiftly removed them. Later in the interview, she slammed Trump for being \u201cethically,\u201d \u201cintellectually,\u201d and \u201ccuriosity-wise\u201d unfit to be president of the United States."

Take, for instance, Monday\u2019s news that the State of New York has subpoenaed his financial records so it can nail him for specific instances of bank fraud and insurance fraud. Trump apparently didn\u2019t find out about this until last night, and let\u2019s just say that he didn\u2019t take the news well.\n\nThe eruption started last evening when Donald Trump posted this surreal attack on his home state: \u201cNew York State and its Governor, Andrew Cuomo, are now proud members of the group of PRESIDENTIAL HARASSERS. No wonder people are fleeing the State in record numbers. The Witch Hunt continues!\u201d But that was just the beginning.\n\nA few hours later, the Republican Party \u2013 which is now little more than a puppet of the Trump regime \u2013 posted this bizarre tweet: \u201cThe NY Attorney General called President Trump an \u201cillegitimate president.\u201d She has proven to have a vendetta against real Donald Trump & is using her position of power to baselessly smear the President & the work he\u2019s done for the American people.\u201d If Trump is guilty, and he is, does it matter that the New York Attorney General doesn\u2019t like him?\n\nThen sometime around midnight, Donald Trump retweeted the GOP, adding that it\u2019s \u201cAll part of the Witch Hunt!\u201d We suspect he\u2019ll still be yelling that after New York State seizes Trump Tower and he\u2019s in prison. Then after midnight, just for good measure, Trump retweeted disgraced Republican Congressman Jim Jordan several times in a row. Then he attacked someone named \u201cCoumo\u201d before deleting it."

Chief among them: Ivanka regularly asked to use Air Force One as her own de facto private jet. It was so outrageous that when then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson tried to put his foot down, Ivanka simply worked around it by taking corrupt Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the plane with her. It gets even worse.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that Ivanka wanted to use Air Force One as her own personal taxi service. For some reason, she wanted to be able to control who did and did not get to go on State Department trips, according to New York Times coverage of the new book. But the whole narrative takes an even stranger turn. At one point Donald Trump asked John Kelly to push Ivanka and Jared out of the White House just to get rid of the constant headaches involved.\n\nIt\u2019s been widely reported that Jared and Ivanka played a role in pushing John Kelly out of the White House, and this new information may help explain why it happened. But it\u2019s doubtful that Ivanka knew just how direct her father was in trying to push her out of the White House. In any case, she knows about it now. Jared Kushner\u2019s lawyer is claiming the entire book is a work of fiction. No wonder."

As of today it\u2019s finally safe to say that it\u2019s the latter.\n\nWe already know that Yang founded the chain of massage parlors that was later busted for being a front for sex trafficking. We also know that Yang hung out at Mar-a-Lago and took selfies with Donald Trump and his allies. And we know that Yang was selling Chinese executives access to Trump. Today we learned that Yang was also allegedly selling Trump-connected visas to immigrants. But none of that is why the scandal has reached critical mass.\n\nToday the White House issued a formal statement about the matter. It was predictably short and pointless: \u201cThe President doesn\u2019t know this woman.\u201d But the fact that the White House felt compelled to make a formal statement is a clear sign that Donald Trump\u2019s handlers don\u2019t expect this story to go away. Merely commenting on a scandal like this \u2013 even if you\u2019re denying it \u2013 merely adds heft and exposure to the whole thing. You don\u2019t do it unless you think it\u2019s going to blow up anyway.\n\nSo now we have a clear signal that Donald Trump, or at least his handlers, think the Cindy Yang scandal is going to blow up big time. Even more telling, even as his handlers try to publicly address the matter in the feeble hope of getting out ahead of it, Trump himself has been afraid to tweet a word about Yang. This is going to get bigger and uglier, and probably soon."

    "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s negligence, incompetence, and criminal corruption are responsible for so many things that go wrong these days, it\u2019s tempting to just assume that every new scandal or problem is going to trace back to him. That\u2019s overly presumptive without evidence, of course. But when it comes to this new crisis where a particular model of Boeing aircraft keeps crashing, there is now solid evidence that this is indeed at least partly Trump\u2019s fault.\n\nTo be clear, the problem originated with Boeing itself. The company essentially admitted as much when it promised to develop and release a software update to compensate for the apparent hardware defect that\u2019s been causing the 737 MAX 8 to abruptly fall out of the sky and crash, for lack of a better way of putting it. But this evening Rachel Maddow reported on MSNBC that Boeing has been working on this software update for months, and that the work actually stopped for five weeks during Trump\u2019s government shutdown.\n\nTo be clear, the first crash happened in October 2018, long before the shutdown. But there\u2019s real reason to believe that this week\u2019s second crash might have been prevented if the software patch hadn\u2019t been delayed by five weeks. When you throw in the fact that the United States has had no FAA Administrator for more than a year because Trump refused to appoint one after Congress wouldn\u2019t allow him to install his own personal pilot in the position, the whole thing gets uglier.\n\nYes, it\u2019s entirely possible that this second crash would have happened even if the President of the United States weren\u2019t a negligent criminal. But the five week delay on the software patch is indeed Donald Trump\u2019s fault. Considering that the Trump regime still has yet to ground the Boeing 737 MAX 8, even as most other nations have, and that Trump is buddies with the CEO of Boeing, the whole thing is a nightmare."

    "text": "The Republicans are already hard at work interfering in the 2020 election and have identified the one they consider their biggest threat: Beto O\u2019Rourke. The Club for Growth (CFG) calls itself \u201ca 501 conservative organization active in the United States, with an agenda focused on cutting taxes and other economic issues.\u201d I see their agenda as interfering in elections for the sole purpose of electing Republican candidates. Let\u2019s be real: Republicans couldn\u2019t care less about \u201ccutting taxes\u201d other than on the rich and corporations. That will never change.\n\nCFG has targeted Iowa as the place to begin their negative ad campaign against Beto O\u2019Rourke. Early Iowa polls show Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders leading the race in that state; however, CFG sees O\u2019Rourke as the biggest threat to Trump for two reasons: His performance against Cruz in the 2018 midterms and his ability to fundraise and bring folks together. Because of the latter and because O\u2019Rourke has been compared to President Obama by some, CFG is attacking O\u2019Rourke by invoking Obama. Seriously. The heart of the CFG ad calls President Obama \u201ca champion of progressive causes who broke racial barriers.\u201d This alone signals that CFG is up to no good. We all know how much they love Obama.\n\nDoubling down on the Obama comparison is the invocation of the race card. They are attempting to show that O\u2019Rourke is \u201cno Obama\u201d because O\u2019Rourke is the recipient of \u201cwhite male privilege\u201d (like they aren\u2019t), and that he was \u201cborn with a blue blood pedigree\u201d (like most of them weren\u2019t). If those things are true, then O\u2019Rourke is not very different from them \u2014 except he seems to have a soul. The very conspirators in the \u201cbirther\u201d claims now want to applaud President Obama? This attack is laughable at best.\n\nThe goal of the republicans is evident: They want the candidate they view as weakest to win the Democratic nomination so that Trump\u2019s 40% will carry him to victory. Good luck with that. They obviously haven\u2019t seen Public Policy Polling\u2019s poll, which shows that \u201cevery potential Democratic candidate in the 2020 presidential election\u2014announced and unannounced\u2014would beat President Trump in a head-to-head contest.\u201d Marinate on that for a few minutes.\n\nWhile CFG (and likely other Republican organizations) are worried about Beto O\u2019Rourke, their time might be best spent on finding a better candidate than Trump. They\u2019re obviously banking on him surviving his myriad scandals, which is unlikely. He doesn\u2019t stand a proverbial snowball\u2019s chance in hell of getting reelected. Trump has done nothing but wreak havoc on our country. From his divisive, hate-filled speech to his poor policy initiatives that continue to drive up the deficit, America is ripe for a real leader.\n\nWe can make that happen if we don\u2019t fall victim to the GOP\u2019s nonsense that merely serves as cover for their true agenda of divisiveness. For them, it\u2019s all about winning even if America loses. I have news for them: WE\u2019RE NOT STUPID! Stop the dirty tricks and try doing something for the people for a change. Then, you might just have a shot."

Palmer Report explained that this is New York\u2019s way of targeting his assets, which can be seized after he fails to pay the massive financial fines they\u2019re going to hit him with.\n\nNow it looks like Donald Trump is interpreting New York State\u2019s actions in the same way we are. Rather than merely shaking the whole thing off, Trump revealed this evening that he\u2019s very much scared about what\u2019s being done to him. Not only that, Trump went so bonkers about it, he ended up attacking his home state in the process.\n\nHere\u2019s what Trump tweeted: \u201cNew York State and its Governor, Andrew Cuomo, are now proud members of the group of PRESIDENTIAL HARASSERS. No wonder people are fleeing the State in record numbers. The Witch Hunt continues!\u201d Wait a minute here, because this doesn\u2019t even make sense by Trumpian standards.\n\nFor the record, Trump is wrong about people fleeing the state. New York did see its statewide population decrease by about one percent from 2017 to 2018, but that\u2019s almost a rounding error. According to census estimates, New York City\u2019s population continues to climb. So what\u2019s Trump talking about here? Nothing at all. He just couldn\u2019t think of a better insult about his home state, even as it moves in on bankrupting him."

At some point you\u2019d think he\u2019d max himself out, to the point where he couldn\u2019t top himself in the derangement category. Yet Trump\u2019s monologue today about airplanes and Albert Einstein represents a whole new level of, well, weirdness.\n\nFor reference, here\u2019s what Donald Trump tweeted today: \u201cAirplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. I sorta kinda get what he\u2019s trying to say here. There are plenty of modern products that are more complicated than they need to be. All you have to do is try to navigate the interface on some of the lesser \u201csmart televisions\u201d out there, in order to be reminded of this. But one would think that airplanes, considering what they do, are one of those products that should be complex. Further, pilots are smart and professionally trained people who know exactly what they\u2019re doing. Airline pilots do in fact lean closer to Albert Einstein than to Homer Simpson.\n\nDonald Trump knows that his base is full of idiots, simpletons, and people who feel like society has passed them by. They\u2019re not all dumb, but they\u2019re all conditioned to long for the \u201cgood old days\u201d of a \u201csimpler time.\u201d Trump knows what he\u2019s doing here. He\u2019s pandering to them by trying to convince them that they could all be pilots, if the airplane manufacturers weren\u2019t conspiring against them. The dig at Albert Einstein is Trump\u2019s way of signaling to them that intellect isn\u2019t a virtue. It just comes off as one of his most bizarre quotes yet."

Pundits repeatedly thought Trump was finished \u2013 whether it was after he impersonated a disabled New York Times reporter at one of his rallies or ridiculed John McCain\u2019s military record or bragged about sexual assault on video.\n\nWhat should have been obvious is that many of his supporters liked him because of these things \u2013 that his biggest blunders weren\u2019t all that far off from things they\u2019ve said or thought, and he must be a crusader for them, a strong man who will protect their way of life like nobody else could. This idea was even further cemented by the fact that Donald Trump not only promised that he wouldn\u2019t cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid \u2013 but that he alone could prevent these programs from crashing.\n\nHis budget for 2020 and beyond happens to say otherwise. Cutting nearly twice as much from Medicare as he did from last year, the White House budget proposal would cut $846 billion from Medicare over the next decade, and another $1.5 trillion from Medicaid \u2013 as Trump seeks to prevent the very same Medicaid expansion that a number of states backed overwhelmingly in the last election. When Trump told his base \u201cI don\u2019t need your vote anymore,\u201d during his stupid post-election victory tour, he was actually telling the truth for once \u2013 at least as far as what he thought of his own base.\n\nThe death of Medicaid, as this budget would entail, would be a massive kickback for his donors \u2013 and a means for Donald Trump to finally get his wall, for which he is demanding twice the amount of money that he has in the past. He gets all this winning while seniors have an even harder time finding healthcare and paying for prescriptions. We have now reached a point where Trump has proven who he is to both his detractors and supporters alike. The fight to stop this draconian budget has only begun \u2013 and will be one of the most important."

There is, however, one thing that always confuses me about our side of the ideological fence: why are we always so quick to assume that our own liberal leaders are complete idiots, even when the evidence says otherwise?\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi has spent the past few months running circles around Donald Trump, in such rapid fashion it\u2019s left his head spinning. We don\u2019t know precisely how their ongoing battles will play out. But it\u2019s such a mismatch, the one thing we know for sure is that Pelosi will win, and Trump will suffer at her hands accordingly. So why on earth would Pelosi stupidly decide to take impeachment off the table yesterday? She wouldn\u2019t.\n\nEven if you take Pelosi\u2019s impeachment comments at face value without reading between the lines, she\u2019s simply saying that there\u2019s no point in impeaching Donald Trump right now, today, because it wouldn\u2019t succeed. She\u2019s right. What\u2019s the point of ringing up Trump on impeachment charges right now, when we all know the Senate wouldn\u2019t come anywhere close to removing him right now?\n\nWhen you do read between the lines a bit, it becomes clear that because Nancy Pelosi knows she can\u2019t successfully impeach Trump right now, she\u2019s taking the opportunity to screw with his head. She chooses her words very carefully, and \u201cHe\u2019s just not worth it\u201d is intended to provoke a response from him. Let the narcissist Trump fall into the trap of responding to Pelosi\u2019s insult about his importance. Let him start tweeting about impeachment on a daily basis, so he can be the one to normalize the concept, thus allowing her to impeach him sooner.\n\nReally, though, Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats are putting together a strategy to destroy Donald Trump on every level, costing him his money and his kids and what little might be left of his dignity, to the point that he\u2019ll be begging to be allowed to resign in exchange for reduced criminal charges. That\u2019s so much more effective than the slow grind of impeachment.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is why so many liberals and Democrats don\u2019t understand any of this. Nancy Pelosi isn\u2019t a weakling or an idiot. She isn\u2019t going to simply let Donald Trump off the hook for no reason. That\u2019s now how any of this works. She didn\u2019t even say she won\u2019t impeach him, she simply said she won\u2019t impeach him right this very second. That\u2019s before getting to the fact that she\u2019s a brilliant strategist.\n\nNancy Pelosi is trying to win, against an evil and destructive opponent. And she\u2019s going to pull that off. She isn\u2019t looking to impress you, or put you at ease; there are bigger concerns. In fact, if you\u2019re feeling all riled up at the prospect of Donald Trump somehow not being ousted and brought to justice, that works in Pelosi\u2019s favor, because it means you\u2019ll be out there pounding the impeachment drum \u2013 which will make it easier for her to oust him more quickly."

For its part, Robert Mueller\u2019s office stated that it had no opinion on the matter, while confirming that its cooperation with Flynn is complete. So where does this get us?\n\nMueller is essentially taking the same position that he took ninety days ago, which is that Michael Flynn has been such a big help, he doesn\u2019t even need to go to prison. Of course the judge didn\u2019t like that idea at all last time around, asking aloud if Flynn had committed \u201ctreason,\u201d and encouraged Flynn to go back and find more ways to cooperate. If Flynn had found a way to provide any additional cooperation during these past ninety days, Mueller would surely be saying so, instead of leaving him hanging.\n\nFlynn is ostensibly asking for another ninety days because he fears the judge will throw him in prison if the sentencing happens this week, and he\u2019s hoping something will come up along the way, where he can help some prosecutor on some case, even if it\u2019s not Mueller. But there\u2019s no looking past the underlying point here: despite his hugely serious crimes, Flynn helped Mueller so much, Mueller doesn\u2019t think he should go to prison. Contrast this with Mueller\u2019s ongoing quest to find a way to put Paul Manafort in prison for life, and to bankrupt Manafort in the process.\n\nIn other words, Robert Mueller is no pushover. He doesn\u2019t believe in leniency for anyone, without a darn good reason. Yet even after pushback from the judge, Mueller thinks Michael Flynn\u2019s punishment should be to go to Disney World. There\u2019s no way Mueller sees it this way unless Flynn gave up enough evidence to take down Donald Trump and all the other biggest of fish. We may have to wait longer to learn Flynn\u2019s fate, but I think we just learned Trump\u2019s fate."

Major sections of Wall are being built and renovated, with MUCH MORE to follow shortly. Tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended (captured) at the Border and NOT allowed into our Country.

I am stopping an invasion as the Wall gets built.\u201d\n\nYes, Ann Coulter is in fact a \u201cwacky nut job.\u201d Everything else extant in Trump\u2019s tweet is a lie. Trump is not \u201cwinning on the border.\u201d It is not the case that \u201cmajor sections of the wall are being built.\u201d No sections of the wall are being built or have been built.

The term \u201cillegals\u201d is a dehumanizing term invented to stigmatize and tarnish. When refugees are fleeing oppressive situations and presenting themselves at the American border in a lawful and orderly manner, it\u2019s easier to turn your back on them, deny them sanctuary and separate them from and cage their children if you refer to them as \u201cillegals.\u201d\n\nRemember, refugees are human beings, just like you and me, who, as John F Kennedy put it, \u201cinhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children\u2019s future. And we are all mortal.\u201d Trump wants you to join him in hating them instead.

In fact, all swans; all birds; all dinosaurs. Hell, bacteria for that matter. But, folks, he walks among us. We\u2019re going to have to deal with it. He is our black swan.\n\nTrump\u2019s criminal friends are now horseshoeing around him.

It now seems obvious the horseshoe will close with Trump holding hands with both sides to form a circle. One wonders if the interior will hold a bunch of under-aged girls, Chinese or American.\n\nWe can\u2019t know for certain because Trump is our black swan, full of unwelcome and damaging surprises. But here\u2019s one surprise that\u2019s brewing up in our favor. Congressman Adam Schiff is now urging the Office of Special Counsel to interview Trump in person. Trump has already provided written answers to Robert Mueller\u2019s questions, but has avoided having to answer them orally.\n\nOur black swan president is now in Adam Schiff\u2019s range. Donald Trump will do one of two things. He will either fight this with his last breath and last lawyer, or like the black swan he is, he will drum up all his stupid narcissism and head over to Mueller\u2019s office, confident that he can snooker the veteran prosecutor and Vietnam veteran. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the latter. We\u2019ve had enough of the pointlessly destructive black swan. It\u2019s time for a white swan.

    "text": "Heading into what is already set to be a pivotal week in Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation, Erik Prince just threw us all a curveball by admitting that he participated in the long-alleged second Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr and others during the election. He then comically claimed that this meeting is only missing from the transcript of his sworn House testimony because the transcript is somehow wrong. Even as everyone rightly marvels over the absurdity of this, Prince just gave away something larger.\n\nFrom an optics standpoint, what Erik Prince just said looks absolutely terrible. There is no one in the court of public opinion who is going to believe that he confessed to this meeting during his House Intel Committee testimony two years ago, but no one from either party remembers him saying it, and the transcriber somehow missed it as well, and even though Prince has known all this time that this incriminating transcript was incorrect, he\u2019s never thought to ask anyone to go back and check the tape until now. By claiming this, Prince is making himself look like an idiot.\n\nAs Palmer Report likes to point out, there are only two reasons a person tries to make a scandal go away by floating an excuse that has absolutely terrible optics. The first is if they\u2019re simply an idiot and they simply don\u2019t know how bad it\u2019s going to make them look. The second is if they\u2019re savvy enough to know that they\u2019re facing criminal implications in the scandal, and they\u2019re making the calculated decision to sacrifice the optics in the name of establishing a criminal defense. After all, obtaining a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea only requires carving out a sliver of reasonable doubt, even if the jury thinks you\u2019re very probably guilty.\n\nErik Prince is a steaming pile of crap, but he\u2019s definitely not an idiot. He\u2019s a shadowy figure who\u2019s suddenly decided to come out of the shadows and do an interview with a journalist he knew would be hostile toward him, just so he could admit the second Trump Tower meeting happened, while claiming the meeting was about Iran policy instead of conspiring to rig the election, and laying out a legal defense against perjury charges. The only reason for Prince to do this right now: he expects Mueller to indict him any day, and he\u2019s focused on his own trial defense."

George Conway\u2019s opposition to Donald Trump just got a bit louder, however, as he attacked the administration in a speech he made at Georgetown Law School. George\u2019s rhetoric has also gotten more dire.\n\n\u201cIf people were to get indicted or not indicted on the basis of whether or not the president likes them, we wouldn\u2019t have a republic,\u201d he warned. \u201cWe\u2019d have a banana republic.\u201d An unsettling array of news has been emanating from the White House now \u2013 that Donald Trump did indeed order an investigation against his political rivals, and saw people investigating him as disloyal.\n\nAs the House investigations ramp up, we\u2019ll likely be seeing more people emboldened by George Conway\u2019s warning and turning against this administration, which is quickly turning radioactive. We still don\u2019t know how Kellyanne Conway feels about this, but it\u2019s not likely that her husband will be backing down anytime soon."

    "text": "Is John Bolton blind, daft, or what? Just like his boss Donald Trump, he refuses to see what\u2019s right in front of his face. Bolton recently appeared on This Week with Martha Raddatz, who asked him about North Korea rebuilding its long-range rocket launching capabilities. This information has been in the news all week, yet Bolton refused to acknowledge that evidence exists. Seriously, is he just dumb? We best believe something else is afoot, like Bolton trying to play down Trump\u2019s failure in North Korea and being in cahoots with Russian benefactors.\n\nBolton disregarded Raddatz\u2019s questions regarding North Korea by saying, \u201cThe United States government\u2026 expends a lot of resources and effort so we don\u2019t have to rely on commercial satellite imagery.\u201d Well, this is not just \u201ccommercial satellite imagery.\u201d The imagery comes from an outfit called Beyond Parallel.\n\nBeyond Parallel was initiated by the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Its sole purpose is the study of actions in Korea. Beyond Parallel was created to provide \u201cclarity and understanding to policymakers, strategists, and opinion leaders about Korean unification.\u201d Putting it simply, all they do is study Korea, and they are, therefore, very well-versed on activities in both North and South Korea. Just this past Tuesday, Beyond Parallel published photos indicating that the Sohae facility is rapidly being rebuilt. Given that this organization\u2019s very existence is based on observing Korea, wouldn\u2019t you assume that they know what they\u2019re talking about? Apparently, not if you\u2019re John Bolton.\n\nBolton wouldn\u2019t even comment directly on photographs he was presented, responding instead, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot in North Korea. We watch it constantly. There\u2019s a lot of activity all the time in North Korea, but I\u2019m not going to speculate on what that particular commercial satellite picture shows.\u201d Photos and satellite are what they are; they\u2019re showing what they \u201csee.\u201d If a leader refuses to see what\u2019s before his eyes, I\u2019m hard pressed to figure out why unless some ulterior motivation is at play.\n\nJohn Bolton unquestionably has ties to Russia. Elijah Cummings and Stephen Lynch requested records regarding Bolton in August 2018 about Bolton\u2019s connections to the group The Right to Bear Arms, a Russian pro-gun outfit. Because of that connection, Cummings and Lynch voiced concern over Bolton\u2019s security clearance and the Trump administration\u2019s vetting process (or lack thereof). Considering all of the security clearance problems in the Trump administration to date, Cummings and Lynch were right to be concerned. This is before getting to Bolton\u2019s connections to Cambridge Analytica and Russian spy Maria Butina.\n\nNow that the House Democrats are in power, we should see more activity surrounding John Bolton in the coming months. Considering Bolton\u2019s denials of what has been captured in (non-commercial) satellite photographs and his continued attempts to cover for Trump, that may well happen sooner rather than later. Organizations like Beyond Parallel and our intelligence community have kept our nation safe for many years. Only this Administration questions them. This is the most corrupt administration in U.S. history \u2013 and we don\u2019t yet know how far that corruption runs."

Nearly two years ago, Hurricane Maria left massive devastation in Puerto Rico, costing the lives of 3,057 American citizens. Yet, this very real travesty goes completely ignored by the average Trump supporter who eagerly swallows the latest Fox News conspiracy involving the deep state.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason a disaster of this magnitude hasn\u2019t made much of a ripple in the news \u2013 the administration is trying to quietly sweep it under the rug, giving the commonwealth a negligible amount of resources while brazenly attacking its Democratic Governor Ricardo Rossello for the aftermath. That\u2019s yet another lie, as the Federal Emergency Management Agency has direct control over the funds. It\u2019s also a far more consequential lie than when, say, Donald Trump brags about being considered for TIME\u2019s Person of the Year.\n\nThe Puerto Rican government has made a list of 4,792 projects that need major repairs \u2013 an estimated cost of $371 million. FEMA has only paid out $35 million as of now, and only 67 of these projects are being worked on. By comparison, there were 9,000 projects underway in the two years following Hurricane Katrina, the disaster that permanently tarnished President Bush\u2019s legacy. Many comparisons have been made between the two disasters, but because Katrina occurred in New Orleans, it received frequent media attention \u2013 drying up the president\u2019s support throughout the gulf states.\n\nAs Puerto Rico is an island and has no electoral votes in a presidential election, it\u2019s largely out of sight and mind for Donald Trump and his ignorant base, many of whom don\u2019t even realize its residents are U.S. citizens. Things aren\u2019t likely to get better for the commonwealth anytime soon, as Trump\u2019s FEMA director recently resigned amid scandal. It\u2019s time to call this disaster what it is \u2013 an act of genocide, which Donald Trump is actively allowing because he has to rationalize that the people living there somehow brought it on themselves."

Everything about the Trump-Russia scandal changed in general when the Democrats took control of the House. Everything about Matt Whitaker\u2019s involvement has changed in particular now that House Democrats have him rung up on two different perjury charges.\n\nMatt Whitaker stands accused of everything from conspiring with Donald Trump to obstruct justice, to running a scam toilet company. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s enough evidence of these alleged crimes to convict him. And if Whitaker thinks he can beat all the charges at any potential trial, he has little motivation to cut a plea deal and flip on Trump. But perjury charges are a different matter.\n\nJust as the House Judiciary Committee was publicly informing Matt Whitaker that it had him nailed for lying under oath about his conversations with Donald Trump, we saw Trump offer Whitaker a cushy new DOJ job, presumably to try to keep Whitaker from flipping on him. Then last week a Freedom of Information Act request nailed Whitaker on a second instance of perjury, this time about the investigation that Trump ordered into Hillary Clinton. In what is likely not a coincidence, just before that FIOA request was granted, Whitaker abruptly resigned his new DOJ job.\n\nThe bar for proving perjury is that it has to have been intentional and malicious. If you testify that someone was wearing a blue shirt when they were wearing a purple shirt, that could just be a faulty memory; it\u2019s not perjury unless it can be proven that you purposely got it wrong to try to protect the guy in the purple shirt.\n\nBut now House Democrats can show that Whitaker engaged in a pattern of false statements that conveniently worked to his benefit and Donald Trump\u2019s benefit, meaning they can indeed nail Whitaker on perjury charges if it were to go to trial. Of course the goal isn\u2019t to put Whitaker in prison, even if he is a fraudster. The goal is to force a relative peon like Whitaker to flip on Trump. The Democrats now have that leverage over Whitaker, who appears to be panicking. This is going to be a sight to see."

In the chilling warning in his closing statement before Congress, Michael Cohen said, \u201cGiven my experience working for Mr Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 there will never be a peaceful transition of power.\u201d That may very well be a political reality that we never want to test.\n\nOf course, I am not advocating voting for Trump, obviously, far from it. I think we should contest the 2020 election as though our very lives depended on it. I am, however, advocating for getting the bastard out of office before he has a chance to appear on the ballot again. The most dangerous reality facing America today may be a lame duck Trump presidency. That metaphor of the wounded animal has never before been more potent, nor more hazardous.\n\nI do not know what Trump will do if he survives in office for an additional year and a half as a candidate and loses \u2013 and neither do you. But the options open to him are awful to contemplate. The prospect of a thin-skinned, vindictive, solipsistic, narcissist with delusions and a grudge at the helm of the greatest nuclear arsenal in the history of the world does not fill me with warm fuzzies. The fact that he\u2019s Commander-in-Chief of the mightiest army ever assembled doesn\u2019t help either.\n\nWe\u2019ll have nothing to fear from Trump\u2019s slack-jawed, knuckle-dragging, monotooth base and their pop guns, of course. That bunch couldn\u2019t organize a bowling tournament. But Trump, as he admitted in a rally shortly after the election of 2016, in a rare moment of candor, doesn\u2019t really need them any more. He has the Bully Pulpit and all that entails.\n\nOne bit of good news is Trump\u2019s incompetence. If we\u2019ve learned anything in the last three years it\u2019s that even the trope of his alleged business \u201cgenius\u201d is a complete fraud. Mr \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d has consistently failed at everything he has tried to do. Even so and given the stakes I wouldn\u2019t want to bet the future of the world on Donald Trump\u2019s incompetence under any circumstances, no matter how incompetent he\u2019s shown himself to be. We need him out. The sooner the better."

But sure enough, there she was this afternoon, taking questions and not answering them, or answering them with lies, or just plain going off the deep end.\n\nAt one point Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked a straightforward question: does Donald Trump believe that the Democrats hate the Jews? Her response was that the media should go ask the Democrats if Donald Trump thinks the Democrats hate the Jews. And that was one of her less incoherent answers.\n\nAt another point Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about why Donald Trump kept writing $35,000 checks to Michael Cohen, if they weren\u2019t for a criminal purpose. Her answer was that she didn\u2019t know. Elsewhere she claimed that Trump, who never holds press conferences of his own, and who almost never sends his Press Secretary to do press briefings anymore, is the most accessible president in modern history.\n\nSo yeah, if you didn\u2019t watch it, you didn\u2019t miss anything. In fact, you\u2019d probably have lost fewer brain cells if you\u2019d spent that time hitting yourself over the head with a blunt object instead. But the upshot is this: there\u2019s a reason Sarah Huckabee Sanders never bothers to take questions from the media anymore. There are really no answers to be given about this slop pile of a fake presidency, and no one believes a word she says anyway."

But his tiny lies are disturbing because of what they reveal about the commander-in-chief\u2019s mind and lack of fitness for office. Sure, politicians are known for lying. But Trump\u2019s frivolous acts of deception are what remind us that we have a thin-skinned compulsive liar in the Oval Office. When Trump feels attacked or embarrassed, he will stop at nothing to rewrite history, no matter how petty the issue. Trump shoots from the hip, which means he will typically stumble through multiple versions of a lie before he loses interest and returns to devising new ways to destroy the country.\n\nThe latest example of this nonsense is Trump\u2019s recent bungling of Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s name. Trump called him \u201cTim Apple\u201d while sitting beside Mr. Cook at an American Workforce Policy Advisory Board meeting on Wednesday. This is not the first time Trump has botched prominent individuals\u2019 names nor is Trump the first president to make this type of mistake.\n\nBut after Trump learned that people were chuckling, he could not let it go. Speaking to Republican donors at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, Trump brought up the gaffe, claiming he actually said \u201cCook\u201d but that he did it quietly between \u201cTim\u201d and \u201cApple,\u201d according to a report from Axios. Anyone who watches the video of the meeting knows that this is impossible. Trump spoke those two words so closely together that it sounded like \u201cTimapple.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Trump must have realized that last week\u2019s lie is laughable. So, this morning, he rolled off his Sit \u2018n Spin to take a second stab at rewriting history. This week\u2019s lie comes in the form of a desperate tweet. Trump now claims that he \u201cquickly referred to Tim + Apple as Tim/Apple\u201d but insists that he was simply trying to \u201csave time & words.\u201d For good measure, Trump ended the tweet with a swipe at \u201cThe Fake News,\u201d blaming them for how \u201cit became yet another bad Trump story!\u201d Apparently, this is what \u201cstable genius\u201d looks like."

    "text": "It\u2019s only been about three weeks since William Barr became the official Attorney General under Donald Trump, and effectively took over as Robert Mueller\u2019s new boss. So what could we learn about him in such a short time? Turns out, we can learn quite a bit. When he was sworn in, there was reason to believe that Barr\u2019s confirmation would spell doom for Mueller\u2019s investigation, since Barr had been a vocal critic of the Special Counsel investigation, but there were also glimmers of hope. Barr said under oath that he and Mueller were friends, good friends, ever since they worked together years ago. Also, everyone who knows Barr described him as a man who loved and respected the institution of the DOJ, and he said the reason he was interested in becoming the AG at this very difficult time was to strengthen the institution.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have enough information yet to make a final verdict about Barr, we do know a few things. First, Mueller filed an 800 page court filing after Barr was sworn in. It was heavily redacted, but if Barr came in looking to swiftly and surely shut down the investigation, he could have interfered and prevented such a lengthy filing. He could have made an argument that so much information is unnecessary.\n\nNext, and most importantly, just one week after Barr took office, media outlets reported the Mueller report would be finished and turned in to Barr within a week or two. This reporting that Mueller was going to finish so quickly is widely believed to have been a way to put pressure on Barr and Mueller to finish. Barr stood up to this pressure and the DOJ issued a rare statement, denying the investigation and report would be done that quickly. Surely, Trump was not happy with this statement from the DOJ.\n\nAdditionally, Barr could have easily asked Rod Rosenstein to leave immediately, but he has not pushed Rosenstein out yet. However, one wonders if he may have been involved in the abrupt and unexpected departure of Donald Trump\u2019s unqualified and conflicted choice for Acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, from his new position at the DOJ. Surely, keeping Rod Rosenstein on for nearly a month, with no clear departure date in sight, while Matthew Whitaker makes a hasty and abrupt departure, was not in Trump\u2019s playbook.\n\nIt could be that William Barr is being outplayed. It could be that Robert Mueller is so far along in the investigation, there is little anyone can do to stop him. It could be that FBI Director Chris Wray will protect Donald Trump in small ways when he can legally, but he is unwilling to stick his neck out too far, and risk incriminating himself. It could be that, like Chris Wray before him, once Barr got a good look at all the evidence, he switched teams. Or, it could be that William Barr deliberately and purposefully allowed Trump to believe the two of them had a certain understanding that Barr never had any intention of upholding.\n\nOne thing is for certain, William Barr has not stopped Robert Mueller from turning in a lengthy filing, forced Mueller to finish his investigation in two weeks, or protected Matthew Whitaker. So far, William Barr doesn\u2019t seem to be executing the Trump playbook, and it\u2019s possible that by firing Jeff Sessions and confirming William Barr, Donald Trump has made Robert Mueller\u2019s life easier."

Stone and his legal team filed a response just now, and suffice it to say that they blew it.\n\nThe judge laid out several specific questions about the timing and circumstances of how the book launch came together. In response, Roger Stone\u2019s lawyers are insisting that this is merely a newly released edition of an existing book, and that Stone wasn\u2019t aware it had been re-released until he found out from a friend that it was newly on sale in bookstores. Okay, unlikely, but theoretically plausible. Then they blew it.\n\nHere\u2019s what Roger Stone\u2019s lawyers said in conclusion in the lengthy new filing: \u201cThere was/is no intention to hide anything. The new introduction, post February 21, 2019, presented a question we tried, obviously clumsily, to address. Having been scolded, we seek only to defend Mr. Stone and move ahead without further ado.\u201d Wait, what?\n\nWhen a federal judge is trying to make a decision about whether to throw you in jail through the end of your trial, and she\u2019s already reluctantly given you a few earlier chances, which you also blew, the last thing you want to do is to talk condescendingly to the judge, and belittle her concerns. This court filing sounds like a punk kid trying to look cool after he got in trouble with the teacher. It won\u2019t fly.\n\nRoger Stone may be newly emboldened by the fact that his longtime friend and partner in crime Paul Manafort recently received an overly lenient four year sentence from crackpot Judge TS Ellis. But there is no indication that Judge Jackson sees Stone in any sort of sympathetic light. Stone is playing with fire here, and he just blew it. Now we\u2019ll find out on Thursday how badly he\u2019s blown it, when the judge issues her ruling."

So what\u2019s she doing with this, and why is she doing it?\n\nThe move is largely symbolic. As the sitting Vice President, Mike Pence already has an office on the Senate side of the Capitol building. In fact NPR says that Pence rarely even uses his House office. Pence won\u2019t shed any tears over this. But this particular move isn\u2019t about harming Pence. It\u2019s about sending a message to the public that she\u2019s planning to dismantle this illegitimate administration after all.\n\nThis comes just one day after Pelosi made the strategic move of publicly stating that she\u2019s not going to try to impeach Donald Trump at this particular time. The clear implication was that she\u2019s waiting until she has her hands on the kind of evidence that can ensure that impeachment will result in removal. Sure enough, this put the Resistance in an uproar, just as she was counting on, and now the public is beating the impeachment drum even more loudly, which works in her favor.\n\nBut because Nancy Pelosi knew she would take some heat from the people who can\u2019t figure out how to read between the lines, she\u2019s throwing them a bone today by kicking Mike Pence out of his own office. It\u2019s just one small symbolic sliver of what all she has up her sleeve when it comes to dismantling the Trump regime and taking them down."

The media then tripped over itself in the race to insist that Pelosi had just \u201cruled out impeachment\u201d forever, scaring a lot of observers into thinking that impeachment won\u2019t happen. But now Adam Schiff is hinting at Pelosi\u2019s real strategy for taking Trump down.\n\nAs the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff is deeply involved in the House investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s crimes, and he surely knows what Speaker Pelosi\u2019s overall strategy is. So it\u2019s a big deal that when Schiff spoke with reporters this morning, he signed off on what Pelosi just said about impeachment, even while hinting at a far more devastating strategy instead.\n\nAdam Schiff used the opportunity to make the argument that there is already enough publicly available evidence for Donald Trump be indicted, even before getting that what Special Counsel Robert Mueller is about to expose. Schiff then went on to make the argument that if Michael Cohen belongs in prison for the crimes he committed with Donald Trump, then Trump belongs in prison as well.\n\nIn other words, House Democrats are doing more or less precisely what Palmer Report expected them to. They\u2019re setting up a scenario where Donald Trump knows he\u2019ll be indicted and arrested the second he\u2019s no longer president. Combine that with New York State dropping a big hint yesterday that it\u2019s going to start seizing Trump\u2019s assets while he\u2019s still in office, and it adds up to Trump being in a no-win situation and only having one way out.\n\nThe longer Donald Trump tries to remain in office, the worse it will get for him. His kids will be arrested. His assets will be seized. His ugly crimes and humiliating scandals will continue to be exposed. And he\u2019ll have a lifelong prison sentence waiting for him at the end of his presidency. Rather than try to stick it out and continue to get dismantled, at some point Trump will realize his only way out is to once again declare \u201cbankruptcy\u201d by negotiating a resignation deal in exchange for less time in prison."

If you\u2019ve been waiting to figure out what role New York State would play in the demolition of Donald Trump, beyond serving as a safety net against federal pardons, you\u2019re finally getting your answer. The Attorney General just took Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony and used it to drop the subpoena hammer, in a way that\u2019s going to have Trump howling in agony.\n\nNew York State just issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank for records regarding several specific transactions involving Donald Trump and the Trump Organization, according to a new expose from the New York Times. Why does this matter? Investigators ranging from Special Counsel Robert Mueller to Chairwoman Maxine Waters are already poking around in Trump\u2019s fraudulent relationship with Deutsche Bank. But what makes this different is the specificity.\n\nInstead of trying to seize all of the records and then figure out where the crimes might be hiding in them, New York State already knows precisely what it\u2019s going after. For instance, Cohen publicly testified that Trump falsified his financial situation while attempting to secure a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills football team, and sure enough, that\u2019s one of the transactions New York has just subpoenaed.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering where this is headed, these two sentences from the New York Times article offer a strong hint: \u201cThe inquiry by Ms. James\u2019s office is a civil investigation, not a criminal one, although its focus and scope were unclear. The attorney general has broad authority under state law to investigate fraud and can fine \u2014 or in extreme cases, go to court to try to dissolve \u2014 a business that is found to have engaged in repeated illegality.\u201d That\u2019s right, New York State is looking to take away Donald Trump\u2019s assets while he\u2019s still in office, just as Palmer Report predicted."

This all pales in comparison to his recent budget proposal. After giving massive tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations, he now wants to make up the difference by stealing from hard-working American citizens who have been contributing members to society and who, upon retirement, are counting on the funds that have been involuntarily extracted from their paychecks for many, many years.\n\nTrump proposes to cut $845 billion from Medicare, but that\u2019s not all \u2014 this proposal also includes across the board cuts to both Social Security and Medicaid according to The Washington Post and MSNBC. Trump would have a massive revolt on his hands if he could pass his spending bill, which he claims will balance the budget in 10 years. According to the Washington Post, this bill cannot possibly balance the budget before 2034. Yet another lie from Trump. Taking money from the elderly, poor, and sick is despicable, and I have a suggestion for Trump to balance his budget without stealing from Americans.\n\nTrump needs to keep his useless butt in Washington and do his job. According to the Washington Post, taxpayers paid over $64 million for Trump\u2019s trips to Mar-a-Lago during 2017 and 2018. To see the full range of his travel activities, take a deep breath first and check out this article. Further, NBC News reported that in 781 days in office, Trump spent 229 days at Trump properties and 173 days at his golf properties. In February 2019, the Government Accountability Office estimates that federal agencies incurred approximately $13.6 million for FOUR trips to Mar-a-Lago (from February 3 to March 5, 2017) as published by NPR. These figures do not include the hundreds of thousands spent in secret service protection for Junior and Eric\u2019s travels.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cpresidency\u201d is about him and no one else. He wants to take healthcare from seniors who can no longer fend for themselves to build a wall in his honor that no one else wants. Not only do the vast majority of Americans NOT want a wall, it has been proven time and again that walls don\u2019t work. The vast majority of illegal drugs come through legal entry ports, and the vast majority of illegals are here on overstayed visas. He continues to ignore the facts, all to leave some useless monument to his failed \u201cpresidency.\u201d\n\nFortunately, the Democrats now hold power in the House and will not allow this act of blatant theft from American citizens who have for years paid into the system. Ted Lieu has been vocal about his opposition, and Dan Pfeiffer, former White House Communications Director under President Obama, tells the Washington Post that the proposed cuts are \u201ca huge gift for Democrats.\u201d I agree. Keep pushing it, Donald Trump. Then, we\u2019ll finally have a reason to thank you."

    "text": "When Nancy Pelosi talks about the House\u2019s oversight of President Trump, it is important to understand exactly what she is saying. Last year\u2019s blue wave gave the Democrats a sorely needed majority in the House of Representatives which made oversight possible. In the short time that has elapsed since Pelosi took the gavel for her second time as speaker, we have seen the House\u2019s investigatory wheels shed their rust and start cranking again.\n\nWhen Speaker Pelosi answered questions about impeachment in a recent interview with The Washington Post, one particular phrase about Trump grabbed headlines: \u201cHe\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d It is not surprising that the media chose to feature this phrase because it is indeed catchy. But if you did not get a chance to read past the headlines, you might have the wrong impression of what is going on. Taken out of context, this phrase lends itself to misinterpretation about Pelosi\u2019s impeachment musings in two ways that do not reflect what she actually said.\n\nFirst, \u201cHe\u2019s just not worth it\u201d by itself can come across as an aloof cop-out filled with attitude. In other words, that phrase can imply that Pelosi realizes impeachment will never be possible so she is resorting to making a weird case that somehow Trump is so horrible that they just cannot be bothered. Another misinterpretation of that lone phrase is that Pelosi is simply expressing surrender. \u201cHe\u2019s just not worth it\u201d can be read as a depressing admission that it will never make sense to pursue impeachment because the case will always be weak.\n\nFortunately, none of these interpretations seem realistic if you read Pelosi\u2019s entire quote. Responding to a question about recent calls for impeachment, Pelosi told the interviewer, \u201cImpeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s complete answer gives her catchy phrase some important context, painting a clearer picture. Pelosi simply expressed the idea that impeachment is a potentially harmful process that should never be rushed into. More importantly, she made it clear that if investigations turn up things that people across the aisle consider to be bombshells, then impeachment will be on the table. Finally, in case there was any doubt that her views about Trump\u2019s presidency may be softening, Pelosi swiftly removed them. Later in the interview, she slammed Trump for being \u201cethically,\u201d \u201cintellectually,\u201d and \u201ccuriosity-wise\u201d unfit to be president of the United States."

Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. I sorta kinda get what he\u2019s trying to say here. There are plenty of modern products that are more complicated than they need to be. All you have to do is try to navigate the interface on some of the lesser \u201csmart televisions\u201d out there, in order to be reminded of this. But one would think that airplanes, considering what they do, are one of those products that should be complex. Further, pilots are smart and professionally trained people who know exactly what they\u2019re doing. Airline pilots do in fact lean closer to Albert Einstein than to Homer Simpson.\n\nDonald Trump knows that his base is full of idiots, simpletons, and people who feel like society has passed them by. They\u2019re not all dumb, but they\u2019re all conditioned to long for the \u201cgood old days\u201d of a \u201csimpler time.\u201d Trump knows what he\u2019s doing here. He\u2019s pandering to them by trying to convince them that they could all be pilots, if the airplane manufacturers weren\u2019t conspiring against them. The dig at Albert Einstein is Trump\u2019s way of signaling to them that intellect isn\u2019t a virtue. It just comes off as one of his most bizarre quotes yet."

    "text": "Timing is everything, so why did Nancy Pelosi choose this week to say publicly that she would not move to impeach President Trump unless she discovers new and significant information? And, even more curious, why would Maxine Waters, who has been the most vocal proponent of impeachment, suddenly reverse course and support Pelosi\u2019s statement and echo her sentiments that they need Republican support?\n\nIf reports are to be believed, it is all about timing. As Palmer Report stated yesterday, it is being reported that Mueller turned in his report to William Barr last week, and Mueller wants to indict President Trump. Barr, reportedly said no to indicting the President, but agreed to Mueller\u2019s other indictments, including Trump\u2019s children.\n\nInstead of making a final decision and unleashing the indictments however, Barr held off. Speculation on the Hill is that Barr feels it is up to Congress to impeach, not the DOJ to indict, and that Mueller\u2019s counter argument is that if there has to be more than one check to abuse of power, and if one check fails, another check cannot fail. Cue the message from Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters. The message is not that they will not impeach, but it is that you should indict, and if you don\u2019t, you have to send a report so full-throttled it will convince Republicans.\n\nPelosi\u2019s and Water\u2019s statements are intended for an audience of one and that one is William Barr. Many Democrats on the Hill believe that Barr is focused on limiting the damage the Trump scandal will do to the Republican Party, and the Republicans want Trump out by 2020, but Republicans would prefer to force Democrats into the lead position on impeachment, so they could suffer from the inevitable backlash.\n\nPelosi brilliantly sent a message, to Attorney General Barr. Do your part or own the consequences. You cannot hand off your responsibility to Pelosi and expect her to run with it. Nancy Pelosi will not fall into a political trap."

    "text": "Donald Trump had a predictable Twitter response to his former campaign manager and convicted felon Paul Manafort\u2019s light sentence last week, claiming that somehow the length of the sentence proves the familiar all-caps refrain \u201cNO COLLUSION\u201d while fawning over the disgraced operative, calling him a \u201cbrave man.\u201d\n\nThe apparent misapplication of justice by Judge T.S. Ellis, who surmised that Manafort lived a \u201cblameless\u201d Christ-like life and was but a victim of circumstance who innocently ran afoul of Russian crime bosses before defrauding the government and others of millions of dollars, gave Trump some surface-level cover to telegraph false messages about the unfairness of the growing number of investigations into his criminal behavior before and after November 2016.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s blithe and limp \u201cno collusion\u201d defense doesn\u2019t have much impact anymore, oft repeated and retweeted as it is, his newly announced budget request is sure to land with a booming thud. That\u2019s because it calls for more than $8 billion for \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a wall on the southern border among domestic cuts that weren\u2019t popular when Democrats swept into the House last November and, if anything, have become less popular as newly announced presidential candidates have emerged to credibly eviscerate Trump\u2019s failed policies daily.\n\nFirst, this budget request isn\u2019t happening. It\u2019s Donald Trump providing himself a fig leaf for his total failure to secure wall funding, which has led to a somewhat satisfying Twitter fight between Trump and fellow xenophobic profiteer Ann Coulter, as the country hate-watches. And that\u2019s the second reason Trump shouldn\u2019t have bothered with this nonsensical request: it reminds America of that failure during a week when he\u2019ll need to come up with some response to a second Manafort sentence among other dropping hammers.\n\nTrump certainly isn\u2019t prepared for what may come down the pike with respect to former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who is facing a Wednesday sentencing hearing, though similar status hearings have been delayed in the past as Mueller\u2019s team continues to pump Flynn for more information. Former Trump campaign official Rick Gates, who has been quite verbose in his cooperation with investigators, also has another hearing scheduled Friday. Like Flynn, Gates has had several hearings delayed as he cooperates with ongoing investigations. Big announcements on either front are bad news for Trump now. No news on either front means bad news later, as both men continue to provide information. No winning there.\n\nSo, while Manafort\u2019s very temporary and limited gift from Judge Ellis gave Donald Trump and his base a bit of gristle to chew on, Trump has already blown it by announcing a budget that reminds everyone of his most glaring defeat while continuing to antagonize one of his biggest media supporters, a self-inflicted awful start to what already looks to be a punishing week."

    "text": "The Republicans are already hard at work interfering in the 2020 election and have identified the one they consider their biggest threat: Beto O\u2019Rourke. The Club for Growth (CFG) calls itself \u201ca 501 conservative organization active in the United States, with an agenda focused on cutting taxes and other economic issues.\u201d I see their agenda as interfering in elections for the sole purpose of electing Republican candidates. Let\u2019s be real: Republicans couldn\u2019t care less about \u201ccutting taxes\u201d other than on the rich and corporations. That will never change.\n\nCFG has targeted Iowa as the place to begin their negative ad campaign against Beto O\u2019Rourke. Early Iowa polls show Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders leading the race in that state; however, CFG sees O\u2019Rourke as the biggest threat to Trump for two reasons: His performance against Cruz in the 2018 midterms and his ability to fundraise and bring folks together. Because of the latter and because O\u2019Rourke has been compared to President Obama by some, CFG is attacking O\u2019Rourke by invoking Obama. Seriously. The heart of the CFG ad calls President Obama \u201ca champion of progressive causes who broke racial barriers.\u201d This alone signals that CFG is up to no good. We all know how much they love Obama.\n\nDoubling down on the Obama comparison is the invocation of the race card. They are attempting to show that O\u2019Rourke is \u201cno Obama\u201d because O\u2019Rourke is the recipient of \u201cwhite male privilege\u201d (like they aren\u2019t), and that he was \u201cborn with a blue blood pedigree\u201d (like most of them weren\u2019t). If those things are true, then O\u2019Rourke is not very different from them \u2014 except he seems to have a soul. The very conspirators in the \u201cbirther\u201d claims now want to applaud President Obama? This attack is laughable at best.\n\nThe goal of the republicans is evident: They want the candidate they view as weakest to win the Democratic nomination so that Trump\u2019s 40% will carry him to victory. Good luck with that. They obviously haven\u2019t seen Public Policy Polling\u2019s poll, which shows that \u201cevery potential Democratic candidate in the 2020 presidential election\u2014announced and unannounced\u2014would beat President Trump in a head-to-head contest.\u201d Marinate on that for a few minutes.\n\nWhile CFG (and likely other Republican organizations) are worried about Beto O\u2019Rourke, their time might be best spent on finding a better candidate than Trump. They\u2019re obviously banking on him surviving his myriad scandals, which is unlikely. He doesn\u2019t stand a proverbial snowball\u2019s chance in hell of getting reelected. Trump has done nothing but wreak havoc on our country. From his divisive, hate-filled speech to his poor policy initiatives that continue to drive up the deficit, America is ripe for a real leader.\n\nWe can make that happen if we don\u2019t fall victim to the GOP\u2019s nonsense that merely serves as cover for their true agenda of divisiveness. For them, it\u2019s all about winning even if America loses. I have news for them: WE\u2019RE NOT STUPID! Stop the dirty tricks and try doing something for the people for a change. Then, you might just have a shot."

    "text": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a moral, political, and popular imperative to impeach Donald Trump so he can be ousted and brought to justice for his endless crimes. She knows it too. So why on earth did she just say in an interview that it\u2019s \u201cjust not worth it\u201d to impeach Trump? Because she knows exactly how to play this Trump fool like fiddle.\n\nFor reference, here\u2019s the full quote that Nancy Pelosi just gave to the Washington Post: \u201cImpeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d Wait a minute here. Pelosi knows she has to impeach Trump, or her own voters will never forgive her, and will punish her party accordingly. But that\u2019s the point, of course. Pelosi can\u2019t impeach Trump today.\n\nWell, the House could impeach Trump today if it wanted to. But then the Senate would vote along party lines against removing him, making the entire impeachment process a waste of time, which would only make Trump stronger. Pelosi knows that successfully impeaching Donald Trump requires destroying him first. She, the House Democrats, Robert Mueller, the SDNY, the Attorney General of New York, and everyone else involved must use hearings and subpoenas and court filings to completely shatter Trump to the point that even his own party is afraid of going down with him. That\u2019s when Trump can be ousted.\n\nIn the meantime, Nancy Pelosi would gain nothing by saying she\u2019s going to impeach Donald Trump. In fact she would hurt her chances, because the average nonpartisan American in the middle still isn\u2019t sure if Trump needs to go, and would therefore assume Pelosi is merely playing politics if she does start talking about impeachment right now.\n\nInstead, by answering the question in this manner, Pelosi accomplishes two things. First, she manages to put off the question until she and her allies have managed to carve Donald Trump up. Second, she\u2019s messing with him. She just insulted him by saying he\u2019s not worth the trouble of impeachment. Pelosi is looking to bait Trump into publicly feuding with her over the question of impeachment. That way it\u2019ll be Trump introducing the concept, not her. And that\u2019ll serve to help put the impeachment process on the right track. Just don\u2019t call it \u201cimpeachment\u201d quite yet."

    "text": "Throughout the 2016 campaign, a great deal of media attention was given to Donald Trump\u2019s outright cruelty and blatant bigotry \u2013 neither of which was all that difficult to find. Pundits repeatedly thought Trump was finished \u2013 whether it was after he impersonated a disabled New York Times reporter at one of his rallies or ridiculed John McCain\u2019s military record or bragged about sexual assault on video.\n\nWhat should have been obvious is that many of his supporters liked him because of these things \u2013 that his biggest blunders weren\u2019t all that far off from things they\u2019ve said or thought, and he must be a crusader for them, a strong man who will protect their way of life like nobody else could. This idea was even further cemented by the fact that Donald Trump not only promised that he wouldn\u2019t cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid \u2013 but that he alone could prevent these programs from crashing.\n\nHis budget for 2020 and beyond happens to say otherwise. Cutting nearly twice as much from Medicare as he did from last year, the White House budget proposal would cut $846 billion from Medicare over the next decade, and another $1.5 trillion from Medicaid \u2013 as Trump seeks to prevent the very same Medicaid expansion that a number of states backed overwhelmingly in the last election. When Trump told his base \u201cI don\u2019t need your vote anymore,\u201d during his stupid post-election victory tour, he was actually telling the truth for once \u2013 at least as far as what he thought of his own base.\n\nThe death of Medicaid, as this budget would entail, would be a massive kickback for his donors \u2013 and a means for Donald Trump to finally get his wall, for which he is demanding twice the amount of money that he has in the past. He gets all this winning while seniors have an even harder time finding healthcare and paying for prescriptions. We have now reached a point where Trump has proven who he is to both his detractors and supporters alike. The fight to stop this draconian budget has only begun \u2013 and will be one of the most important."

There is, however, one thing that always confuses me about our side of the ideological fence: why are we always so quick to assume that our own liberal leaders are complete idiots, even when the evidence says otherwise?\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi has spent the past few months running circles around Donald Trump, in such rapid fashion it\u2019s left his head spinning. We don\u2019t know precisely how their ongoing battles will play out. But it\u2019s such a mismatch, the one thing we know for sure is that Pelosi will win, and Trump will suffer at her hands accordingly. So why on earth would Pelosi stupidly decide to take impeachment off the table yesterday? She wouldn\u2019t.\n\nEven if you take Pelosi\u2019s impeachment comments at face value without reading between the lines, she\u2019s simply saying that there\u2019s no point in impeaching Donald Trump right now, today, because it wouldn\u2019t succeed. She\u2019s right. What\u2019s the point of ringing up Trump on impeachment charges right now, when we all know the Senate wouldn\u2019t come anywhere close to removing him right now?\n\nWhen you do read between the lines a bit, it becomes clear that because Nancy Pelosi knows she can\u2019t successfully impeach Trump right now, she\u2019s taking the opportunity to screw with his head. She chooses her words very carefully, and \u201cHe\u2019s just not worth it\u201d is intended to provoke a response from him. Let the narcissist Trump fall into the trap of responding to Pelosi\u2019s insult about his importance. Let him start tweeting about impeachment on a daily basis, so he can be the one to normalize the concept, thus allowing her to impeach him sooner.\n\nReally, though, Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats are putting together a strategy to destroy Donald Trump on every level, costing him his money and his kids and what little might be left of his dignity, to the point that he\u2019ll be begging to be allowed to resign in exchange for reduced criminal charges. That\u2019s so much more effective than the slow grind of impeachment.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is why so many liberals and Democrats don\u2019t understand any of this. Nancy Pelosi isn\u2019t a weakling or an idiot. She isn\u2019t going to simply let Donald Trump off the hook for no reason. That\u2019s now how any of this works. She didn\u2019t even say she won\u2019t impeach him, she simply said she won\u2019t impeach him right this very second. That\u2019s before getting to the fact that she\u2019s a brilliant strategist.\n\nNancy Pelosi is trying to win, against an evil and destructive opponent. And she\u2019s going to pull that off. She isn\u2019t looking to impress you, or put you at ease; there are bigger concerns. In fact, if you\u2019re feeling all riled up at the prospect of Donald Trump somehow not being ousted and brought to justice, that works in Pelosi\u2019s favor, because it means you\u2019ll be out there pounding the impeachment drum \u2013 which will make it easier for her to oust him more quickly."

    "text": "The Democratic Party announced today that its 2020 Democratic National Convention will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is a brilliant move, but it has nothing to do with the fact that Hillary Clinton lost Wisconsin in 2016, and everything to do with the manner in which the media portrayed the 2016 election, and how the media will portray the 2020 election.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to the facts, as opposed to the ongoing media hype, you know that Hillary Clinton had every reason not to campaign in Wisconsin. The internal and external polls told her that it was a safe state, so it would have been stupid to waste time campaigning in a state she knew she would win. Instead she spent that time in the states that she knew could have gone either way.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve truly been paying attention, you know that Donald Trump only \u201cwon\u201d Wisconsin and a few other key swing states because he conspired with the Russians to alter the outcome. The polls ended up being accurate in every state, except for those few swing states. Polls don\u2019t naturally work that way; it\u2019s obvious that the results in those specific states were altered. How was it done? Just ask the Senate Intelligence Committee, which quietly released a bipartisan report a year ago which confirmed that Russian hackers got into swing state voter registration databases just before the election, and were in position to delete voter registrations.\n\nSo yeah, Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t make a mistake by skipping over Wisconsin, unless she was supposed to have had a crystal ball to tell her what the Russian hackers were specifically up to. But that doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Even as the media has spent the past two years very gradually starting to admit that Donald Trump didn\u2019t legitimately win the election, the media is still as obsessed as ever with pushing the narrative that Hillary blew it. This is because the media, which pushed endless phony scandals about Hillary in a blatant grab for ratings, knows it\u2019s partly to blame for Trump being in power, and will never admit it.\n\nBecause the media will forever bang the phony drum about Hillary having blown it by not visiting Wisconsin, the general public now believes it. Even a lot of Democratic voters have fallen for this nonsense. And there\u2019s nothing that can be done to correct this false narrative, because the media will always double down on it. This leaves only one option: play into it.\n\nBecause the Democrats have decided to hold their 2020 convention in Wisconsin, the media can\u2019t push the narrative that the Democrats are \u201cstill ignoring white working class voters.\u201d Instead the media will smugly say something along the lines of \u201cWow, the Democrats are finally learning from the imaginary mistakes they made in 2016.\u201d The media will get to falsely pat itself on the back, but so what? The Democrats will shut down one of the talking points that the media was planning to use against them in 2020.\n\nWill holding the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee cause more people in Wisconsin to vote for the Democrat in the 2020 election? Of course not. That\u2019s not how anything works. There is no historical evidence that holding your convention in a state has resulted in better than expected election results in that state. But because the media will loudly praise the Democrats for holding their convention in Wisconsin, it\u2019ll cause more people to vote Democrat nationwide. That\u2019s how it works. The people in the middle vote for whichever candidate and party the media is beating up the least.\n\nYou can\u2019t earnestly beg the media to stop pushing its ratings-friendly phony narratives. You can only shake up the chess board so the media has no choice but to abandon those phony narratives. The Republicans have long been particularly good at this, even if they\u2019re not good at anything else. It\u2019s refreshing to see the Democrats finally understanding how to play the media at its own game."

The Fake News was disparagingly all over this, & it became yet another bad Trump story!\u201d\n\nDonald Trump lies about his lies.

But this move spells bad news for one of Trump\u2019s biggest pipe dreams.\n\nWhat is Space Force? No one knows. That\u2019s partly because Donald Trump can\u2019t come close to articulating what Space Force is supposed to do, and partly because \u2013 like his imaginary border wall and so many other of his nonsensical ideas \u2013 there is no tangible evidence that the Space Force concept is being advanced in any way. We do know, however, that Heather Wilson was in charge of the imaginary Space Force.\n\nDonald Trump just released an imaginary budget that includes major funding for Space Force, which helps put Secretary Wilson\u2019s abrupt resignation in context. Trump desperately wants to move ahead with Space Force \u2013 or more accurately he wants to allocate billions of dollars for the imaginary project and then shove the money into his friends\u2019 pockets \u2013 and she apparently wanted nothing to do with the scam.\n\nSo yeah, maybe now Donald Trump can find someone more corrupt to be his new Secretary of the Air Force, or his new acting Secretary of the Air Force, since he no longer believes in bothering to get Senate confirmation for these positions. But the reality is that the person in charge of the imaginary Space Force just resigned. That\u2019s never a good sign when it comes to trying to dupe the public into believing that an imaginary project needs to be well funded."

If you\u2019ve been waiting to figure out what role New York State would play in the demolition of Donald Trump, beyond serving as a safety net against federal pardons, you\u2019re finally getting your answer. The Attorney General just took Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony and used it to drop the subpoena hammer, in a way that\u2019s going to have Trump howling in agony.\n\nNew York State just issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank for records regarding several specific transactions involving Donald Trump and the Trump Organization, according to a new expose from the New York Times. Why does this matter? Investigators ranging from Special Counsel Robert Mueller to Chairwoman Maxine Waters are already poking around in Trump\u2019s fraudulent relationship with Deutsche Bank. But what makes this different is the specificity.\n\nInstead of trying to seize all of the records and then figure out where the crimes might be hiding in them, New York State already knows precisely what it\u2019s going after. For instance, Cohen publicly testified that Trump falsified his financial situation while attempting to secure a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills football team, and sure enough, that\u2019s one of the transactions New York has just subpoenaed.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering where this is headed, these two sentences from the New York Times article offer a strong hint: \u201cThe inquiry by Ms. James\u2019s office is a civil investigation, not a criminal one, although its focus and scope were unclear. The attorney general has broad authority under state law to investigate fraud and can fine \u2014 or in extreme cases, go to court to try to dissolve \u2014 a business that is found to have engaged in repeated illegality.\u201d That\u2019s right, New York State is looking to take away Donald Trump\u2019s assets while he\u2019s still in office, just as Palmer Report predicted."

Stone and his legal team filed a response just now, and suffice it to say that they blew it.\n\nThe judge laid out several specific questions about the timing and circumstances of how the book launch came together. In response, Roger Stone\u2019s lawyers are insisting that this is merely a newly released edition of an existing book, and that Stone wasn\u2019t aware it had been re-released until he found out from a friend that it was newly on sale in bookstores. Okay, unlikely, but theoretically plausible. Then they blew it.\n\nHere\u2019s what Roger Stone\u2019s lawyers said in conclusion in the lengthy new filing: \u201cThere was/is no intention to hide anything. The new introduction, post February 21, 2019, presented a question we tried, obviously clumsily, to address. Having been scolded, we seek only to defend Mr. Stone and move ahead without further ado.\u201d Wait, what?\n\nWhen a federal judge is trying to make a decision about whether to throw you in jail through the end of your trial, and she\u2019s already reluctantly given you a few earlier chances, which you also blew, the last thing you want to do is to talk condescendingly to the judge, and belittle her concerns. This court filing sounds like a punk kid trying to look cool after he got in trouble with the teacher. It won\u2019t fly.\n\nRoger Stone may be newly emboldened by the fact that his longtime friend and partner in crime Paul Manafort recently received an overly lenient four year sentence from crackpot Judge TS Ellis. But there is no indication that Judge Jackson sees Stone in any sort of sympathetic light. Stone is playing with fire here, and he just blew it. Now we\u2019ll find out on Thursday how badly he\u2019s blown it, when the judge issues her ruling."

    "text": "Anyone can randomly misspeak. Some people do it far more often than others. Sometimes the smartest and most coherent of people get the most tongue tied. Donald Trump is not among the smartest or most coherent of people. When he referred to Apple CEO Tim Cook as \u201cTim Apple\u201d this week, it was part of a much larger pattern of evidence that his cognitive abilities are failing. But it\u2019s what Trump did next that reveals he\u2019s even further gone than we thought.\n\nAny normal person who accidentally referred to Tim Cook as \u201cTim Apple\u201d would have handled the situation one of two ways: ignore it or make a joke out of it. But Donald Trump is not a normal person. In fact he\u2019s so worried about the fact that he misspoke, he went on to privately tell his own donors that he didn\u2019t actually say \u201cTim Apple\u201d and that he instead said \u201cTim Cook \u2013 Apple.\u201d No, really.\n\nDonald Trump apparently hurt himself by trying this nonsense, because one of his own donors was put off enough by it to go running to Axios and blab about the whole thing. It\u2019s a bad sign when your own allies, who are corrupt enough to fund your traitorous crime spree, are offended enough by your sheer idiocy to alert the media about it. Then Trump went and made it worse.\n\nThis morning Trump tweeted \u201cAt a recent round table meeting of business executives, & long after formally introducing Tim Cook of Apple, I quickly referred to Tim + Apple as Tim/Apple as an easy way to save time & words. The Fake News was disparagingly all over this, & it became yet another bad Trump story!\u201d You\u2019ve got to be kidding.

It\u2019s not that he thinks the CEO of Lockheed is named \u201cMarilyn Lockheed\u201d or that the CEO of Apple is named \u201cTim Apple.\u201d It\u2019s that Trump can\u2019t admit his brain is failing him.

    "text": "Every time we turn around these days, the bar for the Republican Party gets set even lower by a new criminal scandal, a new racism scandal, none of which ever gets cleaned up by the party\u2019s leadership. But if you want the definitive measure of just how far the GOP has fallen, you need to only consider two words: Justin Amash.\n\nWait a minute, you\u2019re saying. Justin Amash? Isn\u2019t he one of the few halfway decent Republicans left in Congress? Yes, and that\u2019s why everyone keeps slobbering all over him. Just today, CNN posted a lengthy puff piece about Amash, revealing just how lonely it is for him to be one of the few non-corrupt, non-deranged House Republicans.\n\nTo be clear, Justin Amash deserves credit for not wanting anything to do with Donald Trump, or Trump\u2019s racist wall, or his Republican Party\u2019s increasingly deranged overall agenda. He seems like a genuinely decent, if nondescript, political moderate. But that\u2019s the problem, because that\u2019s all he is \u2013 and that alone has everyone relieved that he exists.\n\nLet\u2019s say that Congressman Amash became a Democrat. The thing about being in the Democratic Party is you\u2019re expected to be a decent, non-racist, non-crazy, non-criminal, rational human being. The Democrats don\u2019t hand out extra credit for that. As a Democrat, Amash would be obscure, solid if unimpressive, and rarely heard from \u2013 because the House is full of Democrats who have far more to say than this guy does.\n\nBut because Justin Amash is a Republican, he\u2019s considered some kind of folk hero just for not being garbage. That\u2019s how low the bar is set for how the American mainstream views the Republican Party. The trouble with the bar being so high for the Democrats, and so low for the Republicans, is that if each side merely meets expectations, the voters in the middle can trick themselves into believing that both sides are the same."

    "authors": [
      "Bill Palmer"
    ],
    "text": "Here\u2019s the thing about reports that come from unnamed inside sources. In order to believe it, you have to take the reporter\u2019s word on it that the source exists to begin with, and you have to assume that the source is being truthful to the reporter. That can be the tricky part, as insiders only tend to share information with reporters to drive their own agenda, so the information typically is slathered in bias at best. But when a fairly major publication claims to have inside knowledge of something explosive, you have to at least chew on it.\n\nThat brings us to this new report from British publication The Spectator that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has finished his report, and he\u2019s going to use it to push for indictments against four members of Donald Trump\u2019s family. That\u2019s explosive enough, of course, before you get to the additional claim that Mueller also wants to indict Trump himself. Then there\u2019s the kicker: new Attorney General William Barr is cool with indicting Trump\u2019s family, but he\u2019s pushing back on indicting Trump himself. Can any of this be real?\n\nIn a word, maybe. As a first step, I like to try to match up insider claims to what we already know, and see if it makes any logical sense. The Spectator says that Robert Mueller wants indictments against Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump. Let\u2019s see here. Don Jr and Kushner are easy; they each illicitly met with the Russians, and they both appear to have committed perjury, before getting to any financial crimes. Ivanka and Eric both have their fingerprints all over the Trump Organization, which is one big financial fraud outfit. So if Mueller is indeed targeting the Trump family for financial crimes, this all makes sense.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part about Mueller wanting to indict Trump himself. One television pundit after another has spent the past year insisting there\u2019s a Department of Justice \u201cpolicy\u201d or \u201crule\u201d against indicting a sitting president, but as Palmer Report has repeatedly pointed out, there is no such thing. There is only a stray memo from the 1970s that has never been tested and carries no legal weight. So yes, we could buy Mueller seeking to indict Trump. Even if Mueller doesn\u2019t think the indictment would hold up, merely recommending it could be crucial in influencing the general public.\n\nThis leaves us with the question of why William Barr would oppose indicting Donald Trump, but would be fine with indicting Trump\u2019s family. If Barr really is corruptly trying to protect Trump, one would think he would try to protect Trump\u2019s kids as well. So if Barr is okay with Mueller indicting Trump\u2019s kids, then Barr must not be all that interested in protecting Trump. In such case, we would have to assume that Barr is merely opposed to indicting Trump simply because that\u2019s his interpretation of the law.\n\nAll of the above sounds plausible. And we certainly have no reason to believe The Spectator would be making up an inside source, or quoting someone whom it knows isn\u2019t legitimately on the inside. This leads us to the big question, though. Why would anyone involved in this process be motivated to leak it? What would be the point? We could envision a scenario in which Mueller is struggling to convince Barr to indict Trump \u2013 and someone involved in the process, who is on Mueller\u2019s side, is trying to \u201chelp\u201d by leaking this.\n\nBut that in turn would leave questions about why the usually secretive Team Mueller is suddenly resorting to leaks like this. In addition, there\u2019s the question of why they would only leak this to a British publication, without bothering to also leak it to household name news outlets in the U.S., if the goal is to get the American public to believe it. So let\u2019s watch and see if similar leaks appear in additional major news outlets in the coming days. The only thing we logically know for sure is that Mueller doesn\u2019t plan to go small with his endgame; it\u2019s simply not how he operates."

      "Bill Palmer"

    "text": "The Democratic Party announced today that its 2020 Democratic National Convention will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is a brilliant move, but it has nothing to do with the fact that Hillary Clinton lost Wisconsin in 2016, and everything to do with the manner in which the media portrayed the 2016 election, and how the media will portray the 2020 election.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to the facts, as opposed to the ongoing media hype, you know that Hillary Clinton had every reason not to campaign in Wisconsin. The internal and external polls told her that it was a safe state, so it would have been stupid to waste time campaigning in a state she knew she would win. Instead she spent that time in the states that she knew could have gone either way.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve truly been paying attention, you know that Donald Trump only \u201cwon\u201d Wisconsin and a few other key swing states because he conspired with the Russians to alter the outcome. The polls ended up being accurate in every state, except for those few swing states. Polls don\u2019t naturally work that way; it\u2019s obvious that the results in those specific states were altered. How was it done? Just ask the Senate Intelligence Committee, which quietly released a bipartisan report a year ago which confirmed that Russian hackers got into swing state voter registration databases just before the election, and were in position to delete voter registrations.\n\nSo yeah, Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t make a mistake by skipping over Wisconsin, unless she was supposed to have had a crystal ball to tell her what the Russian hackers were specifically up to. But that doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Even as the media has spent the past two years very gradually starting to admit that Donald Trump didn\u2019t legitimately win the election, the media is still as obsessed as ever with pushing the narrative that Hillary blew it. This is because the media, which pushed endless phony scandals about Hillary in a blatant grab for ratings, knows it\u2019s partly to blame for Trump being in power, and will never admit it.\n\nBecause the media will forever bang the phony drum about Hillary having blown it by not visiting Wisconsin, the general public now believes it. Even a lot of Democratic voters have fallen for this nonsense. And there\u2019s nothing that can be done to correct this false narrative, because the media will always double down on it. This leaves only one option: play into it.\n\nBecause the Democrats have decided to hold their 2020 convention in Wisconsin, the media can\u2019t push the narrative that the Democrats are \u201cstill ignoring white working class voters.\u201d Instead the media will smugly say something along the lines of \u201cWow, the Democrats are finally learning from the imaginary mistakes they made in 2016.\u201d The media will get to falsely pat itself on the back, but so what? The Democrats will shut down one of the talking points that the media was planning to use against them in 2020.\n\nWill holding the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee cause more people in Wisconsin to vote for the Democrat in the 2020 election? Of course not. That\u2019s not how anything works. There is no historical evidence that holding your convention in a state has resulted in better than expected election results in that state. But because the media will loudly praise the Democrats for holding their convention in Wisconsin, it\u2019ll cause more people to vote Democrat nationwide. That\u2019s how it works. The people in the middle vote for whichever candidate and party the media is beating up the least.\n\nYou can\u2019t earnestly beg the media to stop pushing its ratings-friendly phony narratives. You can only shake up the chess board so the media has no choice but to abandon those phony narratives. The Republicans have long been particularly good at this, even if they\u2019re not good at anything else. It\u2019s refreshing to see the Democrats finally understanding how to play the media at its own game."

Ellis, who surmised that Manafort lived a \u201cblameless\u201d Christ-like life and was but a victim of circumstance who innocently ran afoul of Russian crime bosses before defrauding the government and others of millions of dollars, gave Trump some surface-level cover to telegraph false messages about the unfairness of the growing number of investigations into his criminal behavior before and after November 2016.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s blithe and limp \u201cno collusion\u201d defense doesn\u2019t have much impact anymore, oft repeated and retweeted as it is, his newly announced budget request is sure to land with a booming thud. That\u2019s because it calls for more than $8 billion for \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a wall on the southern border among domestic cuts that weren\u2019t popular when Democrats swept into the House last November and, if anything, have become less popular as newly announced presidential candidates have emerged to credibly eviscerate Trump\u2019s failed policies daily.\n\nFirst, this budget request isn\u2019t happening. It\u2019s Donald Trump providing himself a fig leaf for his total failure to secure wall funding, which has led to a somewhat satisfying Twitter fight between Trump and fellow xenophobic profiteer Ann Coulter, as the country hate-watches. And that\u2019s the second reason Trump shouldn\u2019t have bothered with this nonsensical request: it reminds America of that failure during a week when he\u2019ll need to come up with some response to a second Manafort sentence among other dropping hammers.\n\nTrump certainly isn\u2019t prepared for what may come down the pike with respect to former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who is facing a Wednesday sentencing hearing, though similar status hearings have been delayed in the past as Mueller\u2019s team continues to pump Flynn for more information. Former Trump campaign official Rick Gates, who has been quite verbose in his cooperation with investigators, also has another hearing scheduled Friday. Like Flynn, Gates has had several hearings delayed as he cooperates with ongoing investigations. Big announcements on either front are bad news for Trump now. No news on either front means bad news later, as both men continue to provide information. No winning there.\n\nSo, while Manafort\u2019s very temporary and limited gift from Judge Ellis gave Donald Trump and his base a bit of gristle to chew on, Trump has already blown it by announcing a budget that reminds everyone of his most glaring defeat while continuing to antagonize one of his biggest media supporters, a self-inflicted awful start to what already looks to be a punishing week."

    "text": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a moral, political, and popular imperative to impeach Donald Trump so he can be ousted and brought to justice for his endless crimes. She knows it too. So why on earth did she just say in an interview that it\u2019s \u201cjust not worth it\u201d to impeach Trump? Because she knows exactly how to play this Trump fool like fiddle.\n\nFor reference, here\u2019s the full quote that Nancy Pelosi just gave to the Washington Post: \u201cImpeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d Wait a minute here. Pelosi knows she has to impeach Trump, or her own voters will never forgive her, and will punish her party accordingly. But that\u2019s the point, of course. Pelosi can\u2019t impeach Trump today.\n\nWell, the House could impeach Trump today if it wanted to. But then the Senate would vote along party lines against removing him, making the entire impeachment process a waste of time, which would only make Trump stronger. Pelosi knows that successfully impeaching Donald Trump requires destroying him first. She, the House Democrats, Robert Mueller, the SDNY, the Attorney General of New York, and everyone else involved must use hearings and subpoenas and court filings to completely shatter Trump to the point that even his own party is afraid of going down with him. That\u2019s when Trump can be ousted.\n\nIn the meantime, Nancy Pelosi would gain nothing by saying she\u2019s going to impeach Donald Trump. In fact she would hurt her chances, because the average nonpartisan American in the middle still isn\u2019t sure if Trump needs to go, and would therefore assume Pelosi is merely playing politics if she does start talking about impeachment right now.\n\nInstead, by answering the question in this manner, Pelosi accomplishes two things. First, she manages to put off the question until she and her allies have managed to carve Donald Trump up. Second, she\u2019s messing with him. She just insulted him by saying he\u2019s not worth the trouble of impeachment. Pelosi is looking to bait Trump into publicly feuding with her over the question of impeachment. That way it\u2019ll be Trump introducing the concept, not her. And that\u2019ll serve to help put the impeachment process on the right track. Just don\u2019t call it \u201cimpeachment\u201d quite yet."

Her response was that the media should go ask the Democrats if Donald Trump thinks the Democrats hate the Jews. And that was one of her less incoherent answers.\n\nAt another point Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about why Donald Trump kept writing $35,000 checks to Michael Cohen, if they weren\u2019t for a criminal purpose. Her answer was that she didn\u2019t know. Elsewhere she claimed that Trump, who never holds press conferences of his own, and who almost never sends his Press Secretary to do press briefings anymore, is the most accessible president in modern history.\n\nSo yeah, if you didn\u2019t watch it, you didn\u2019t miss anything. In fact, you\u2019d probably have lost fewer brain cells if you\u2019d spent that time hitting yourself over the head with a blunt object instead.

There are really no answers to be given about this slop pile of a fake presidency, and no one believes a word she says anyway."

    "text": "It\u2019s only been about three weeks since William Barr became the official Attorney General under Donald Trump, and effectively took over as Robert Mueller\u2019s new boss. So what could we learn about him in such a short time? Turns out, we can learn quite a bit. When he was sworn in, there was reason to believe that Barr\u2019s confirmation would spell doom for Mueller\u2019s investigation, since Barr had been a vocal critic of the Special Counsel investigation, but there were also glimmers of hope. Barr said under oath that he and Mueller were friends, good friends, ever since they worked together years ago. Also, everyone who knows Barr described him as a man who loved and respected the institution of the DOJ, and he said the reason he was interested in becoming the AG at this very difficult time was to strengthen the institution.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have enough information yet to make a final verdict about Barr, we do know a few things. First, Mueller filed an 800 page court filing after Barr was sworn in. It was heavily redacted, but if Barr came in looking to swiftly and surely shut down the investigation, he could have interfered and prevented such a lengthy filing. He could have made an argument that so much information is unnecessary.\n\nNext, and most importantly, just one week after Barr took office, media outlets reported the Mueller report would be finished and turned in to Barr within a week or two. This reporting that Mueller was going to finish so quickly is widely believed to have been a way to put pressure on Barr and Mueller to finish. Barr stood up to this pressure and the DOJ issued a rare statement, denying the investigation and report would be done that quickly. Surely, Trump was not happy with this statement from the DOJ.\n\nAdditionally, Barr could have easily asked Rod Rosenstein to leave immediately, but he has not pushed Rosenstein out yet. However, one wonders if he may have been involved in the abrupt and unexpected departure of Donald Trump\u2019s unqualified and conflicted choice for Acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, from his new position at the DOJ. Surely, keeping Rod Rosenstein on for nearly a month, with no clear departure date in sight, while Matthew Whitaker makes a hasty and abrupt departure, was not in Trump\u2019s playbook.\n\nIt could be that William Barr is being outplayed. It could be that Robert Mueller is so far along in the investigation, there is little anyone can do to stop him. It could be that FBI Director Chris Wray will protect Donald Trump in small ways when he can legally, but he is unwilling to stick his neck out too far, and risk incriminating himself. It could be that, like Chris Wray before him, once Barr got a good look at all the evidence, he switched teams. Or, it could be that William Barr deliberately and purposefully allowed Trump to believe the two of them had a certain understanding that Barr never had any intention of upholding.\n\nOne thing is for certain, William Barr has not stopped Robert Mueller from turning in a lengthy filing, forced Mueller to finish his investigation in two weeks, or protected Matthew Whitaker. So far, William Barr doesn\u2019t seem to be executing the Trump playbook, and it\u2019s possible that by firing Jeff Sessions and confirming William Barr, Donald Trump has made Robert Mueller\u2019s life easier."

But his tiny lies are disturbing because of what they reveal about the commander-in-chief\u2019s mind and lack of fitness for office. Sure, politicians are known for lying. But Trump\u2019s frivolous acts of deception are what remind us that we have a thin-skinned compulsive liar in the Oval Office. When Trump feels attacked or embarrassed, he will stop at nothing to rewrite history, no matter how petty the issue. Trump shoots from the hip, which means he will typically stumble through multiple versions of a lie before he loses interest and returns to devising new ways to destroy the country.\n\nThe latest example of this nonsense is Trump\u2019s recent bungling of Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s name. Trump called him \u201cTim Apple\u201d while sitting beside Mr. Cook at an American Workforce Policy Advisory Board meeting on Wednesday. This is not the first time Trump has botched prominent individuals\u2019 names nor is Trump the first president to make this type of mistake.\n\nBut after Trump learned that people were chuckling, he could not let it go. Speaking to Republican donors at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, Trump brought up the gaffe, claiming he actually said \u201cCook\u201d but that he did it quietly between \u201cTim\u201d and \u201cApple,\u201d according to a report from Axios. Anyone who watches the video of the meeting knows that this is impossible. Trump spoke those two words so closely together that it sounded like \u201cTimapple.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Trump must have realized that last week\u2019s lie is laughable. So, this morning, he rolled off his Sit \u2018n Spin to take a second stab at rewriting history. This week\u2019s lie comes in the form of a desperate tweet. Trump now claims that he \u201cquickly referred to Tim + Apple as Tim/Apple\u201d but insists that he was simply trying to \u201csave time & words.\u201d For good measure, Trump ended the tweet with a swipe at \u201cThe Fake News,\u201d blaming them for how \u201cit became yet another bad Trump story!\u201d Apparently, this is what \u201cstable genius\u201d looks like."

In the chilling warning in his closing statement before Congress, Michael Cohen said, \u201cGiven my experience working for Mr Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 there will never be a peaceful transition of power.\u201d That may very well be a political reality that we never want to test.\n\nOf course, I am not advocating voting for Trump, obviously, far from it. I think we should contest the 2020 election as though our very lives depended on it. I am, however, advocating for getting the bastard out of office before he has a chance to appear on the ballot again. The most dangerous reality facing America today may be a lame duck Trump presidency. That metaphor of the wounded animal has never before been more potent, nor more hazardous.\n\nI do not know what Trump will do if he survives in office for an additional year and a half as a candidate and loses \u2013 and neither do you. But the options open to him are awful to contemplate. The prospect of a thin-skinned, vindictive, solipsistic, narcissist with delusions and a grudge at the helm of the greatest nuclear arsenal in the history of the world does not fill me with warm fuzzies. The fact that he\u2019s Commander-in-Chief of the mightiest army ever assembled doesn\u2019t help either.\n\nWe\u2019ll have nothing to fear from Trump\u2019s slack-jawed, knuckle-dragging, monotooth base and their pop guns, of course. That bunch couldn\u2019t organize a bowling tournament. But Trump, as he admitted in a rally shortly after the election of 2016, in a rare moment of candor, doesn\u2019t really need them any more. He has the Bully Pulpit and all that entails.\n\nOne bit of good news is Trump\u2019s incompetence. If we\u2019ve learned anything in the last three years it\u2019s that even the trope of his alleged business \u201cgenius\u201d is a complete fraud. Mr \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d has consistently failed at everything he has tried to do. Even so and given the stakes I wouldn\u2019t want to bet the future of the world on Donald Trump\u2019s incompetence under any circumstances, no matter how incompetent he\u2019s shown himself to be.

But it\u2019s what Trump did next that reveals he\u2019s even further gone than we thought.\n\nAny normal person who accidentally referred to Tim Cook as \u201cTim Apple\u201d would have handled the situation one of two ways: ignore it or make a joke out of it. But Donald Trump is not a normal person. In fact he\u2019s so worried about the fact that he misspoke, he went on to privately tell his own donors that he didn\u2019t actually say \u201cTim Apple\u201d and that he instead said \u201cTim Cook \u2013 Apple.\u201d No, really.\n\nDonald Trump apparently hurt himself by trying this nonsense, because one of his own donors was put off enough by it to go running to Axios and blab about the whole thing. It\u2019s a bad sign when your own allies, who are corrupt enough to fund your traitorous crime spree, are offended enough by your sheer idiocy to alert the media about it. Then Trump went and made it worse.\n\nThis morning Trump tweeted \u201cAt a recent round table meeting of business executives, & long after formally introducing Tim Cook of Apple, I quickly referred to Tim + Apple as Tim/Apple as an easy way to save time & words. The Fake News was disparagingly all over this, & it became yet another bad Trump story!\u201d You\u2019ve got to be kidding. This sounds like something Kevin Malone \u2013 the cartoonishly unintelligent accountant \u2013 once said on The Office.\n\nThe problem here isn\u2019t merely that Donald Trump increasingly sounds mentally vacant when he speaks. It\u2019s not that he thinks the CEO of Lockheed is named \u201cMarilyn Lockheed\u201d or that the CEO of Apple is named \u201cTim Apple.\u201d It\u2019s that Trump can\u2019t admit his brain is failing him. When he once referred to CJ Martinez as \u201cDJ\u201d in a speech, he then quickly made up a story about how Martinez goes by both CJ and DJ. This is beyond alarming. It\u2019s what happens when malignant narcissism meets some kind of worsening early onset dementia \u2013 and it isn\u2019t pretty."

Everything about the Trump-Russia scandal changed in general when the Democrats took control of the House. Everything about Matt Whitaker\u2019s involvement has changed in particular now that House Democrats have him rung up on two different perjury charges.\n\nMatt Whitaker stands accused of everything from conspiring with Donald Trump to obstruct justice, to running a scam toilet company. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s enough evidence of these alleged crimes to convict him. And if Whitaker thinks he can beat all the charges at any potential trial, he has little motivation to cut a plea deal and flip on Trump. But perjury charges are a different matter.\n\nJust as the House Judiciary Committee was publicly informing Matt Whitaker that it had him nailed for lying under oath about his conversations with Donald Trump, we saw Trump offer Whitaker a cushy new DOJ job, presumably to try to keep Whitaker from flipping on him. Then last week a Freedom of Information Act request nailed Whitaker on a second instance of perjury, this time about the investigation that Trump ordered into Hillary Clinton. In what is likely not a coincidence, just before that FIOA request was granted, Whitaker abruptly resigned his new DOJ job.\n\nThe bar for proving perjury is that it has to have been intentional and malicious. If you testify that someone was wearing a blue shirt when they were wearing a purple shirt, that could just be a faulty memory; it\u2019s not perjury unless it can be proven that you purposely got it wrong to try to protect the guy in the purple shirt.\n\nBut now House Democrats can show that Whitaker engaged in a pattern of false statements that conveniently worked to his benefit and Donald Trump\u2019s benefit, meaning they can indeed nail Whitaker on perjury charges if it were to go to trial. Of course the goal isn\u2019t to put Whitaker in prison, even if he is a fraudster. The goal is to force a relative peon like Whitaker to flip on Trump. The Democrats now have that leverage over Whitaker, who appears to be panicking. This is going to be a sight to see."

But Schiff is also showing that he knows there\u2019s another side to this.\n\nOusting any sitting president, even a corrupt and illegitimate one like Donald Trump, partly involves a battle in the court of public opinion. House Democrats took a necessary first step in that direction by bringing in Trump\u2019s former henchman Michael Cohen to publicly testify about the crimes he committed for Trump. His testimony elicited a visceral reaction from the general public, as it helped confirm what they already instinctively knew about Trump.

It\u2019s also a far more consequential lie than when, say, Donald Trump brags about being considered for TIME\u2019s Person of the Year.\n\nThe Puerto Rican government has made a list of 4,792 projects that need major repairs \u2013 an estimated cost of $371 million. FEMA has only paid out $35 million as of now, and only 67 of these projects are being worked on. By comparison, there were 9,000 projects underway in the two years following Hurricane Katrina, the disaster that permanently tarnished President Bush\u2019s legacy. Many comparisons have been made between the two disasters, but because Katrina occurred in New Orleans, it received frequent media attention \u2013 drying up the president\u2019s support throughout the gulf states.\n\nAs Puerto Rico is an island and has no electoral votes in a presidential election, it\u2019s largely out of sight and mind for Donald Trump and his ignorant base, many of whom don\u2019t even realize its residents are U.S. citizens. Things aren\u2019t likely to get better for the commonwealth anytime soon, as Trump\u2019s FEMA director recently resigned amid scandal.

Isn\u2019t he one of the few halfway decent Republicans left in Congress? Yes, and that\u2019s why everyone keeps slobbering all over him.

He seems like a genuinely decent, if nondescript, political moderate. But that\u2019s the problem, because that\u2019s all he is \u2013 and that alone has everyone relieved that he exists.\n\nLet\u2019s say that Congressman Amash became a Democrat. The thing about being in the Democratic Party is you\u2019re expected to be a decent, non-racist, non-crazy, non-criminal, rational human being. The Democrats don\u2019t hand out extra credit for that. As a Democrat, Amash would be obscure, solid if unimpressive, and rarely heard from \u2013 because the House is full of Democrats who have far more to say than this guy does.\n\nBut because Justin Amash is a Republican, he\u2019s considered some kind of folk hero just for not being garbage. That\u2019s how low the bar is set for how the American mainstream views the Republican Party. The trouble with the bar being so high for the Democrats, and so low for the Republicans, is that if each side merely meets expectations, the voters in the middle can trick themselves into believing that both sides are the same."

Also recently, Trump\u2019s friend Robert Kraft was busted for solicitation at a massage parlor.

However, she is the founder of a chain of spas, Tokyo Day Spas, that she has operated since coming to the United States from China in 2007.\n\nYang has been reportedly selling access to Trump and Mar-A-Lago to Chinese executives.

GY touts itself as an \u201cinternational business consulting firm that provides public relations services to assist businesses in America to establish and expand their brand image in the modern Chinese marketplace,\u201d but appears to be mostly selling access to Trump. What security clearance Yang might have, if any, is unknown.\n\nIn what is perhaps another Trump coincidence, around the time that Yang started GY and gained access to Trump and others in the GOP, including Trump\u2019s children, even as Ivanka Trump received numerous trademark approvals from China in the last two years, including for massage parlors and spas. The House should investigate how those came about and if there is any connection to the Trump administration and the relationship with Yang, who until now had operated out of the spotlight. Yang represents a security threat and like most of this administration, is a sign of the swamp dwelling that Trump and his orbit represents. We will see how Trump massages himself out of this situation."

That\u2019s not how a guy views things when he thinks he\u2019s only halfway through the ride. And yet Trump is more obsessed with framing things this way than ever.\n\nTake, for instance, this tweet from Donald Trump today: \u201cDespite the most hostile and corrupt media in the history of American politics, the Trump Administration has accomplished more in its first two years than any other Administration. Judges, biggest Tax & Regulation Cuts, V.A. Choice, Best Economy, Lowest Unemployment & much more!\u201d Trump keeps hitting on this same \u201cfirst two years\u201d refrain, and I think he\u2019s giving something away in the process.\n\nSure, it\u2019s based on Donald Trump\u2019s usual narcissistic hyperbole. Nevermind that Abraham Lincoln had the Emancipation Proclamation in his first two years, or that FDR had the New Deal, or that Barack Obama had the Affordable Care Act, even as Trump hasn\u2019t done a single thing that\u2019ll be viewed positively by history. It\u2019s that he\u2019s obsessed with the two year benchmark.\n\nThis sounds like a guy who fears that he won\u2019t get his second two years. If Donald Trump were a rational person, we\u2019d say that perhaps he simply doesn\u2019t expect to be able to accomplish anything in his final two years with a hostile Congress. But Trump isn\u2019t rational. His list of accomplishments is just things he\u2019s making up to begin with, so he could easily just make up some more fake accomplishments for the second half of his term.\n\nNo, this is a guy who\u2019s worried that he\u2019s going to be thrown out on his butt long before the end of his term. So he has to convince himself that he\u2019s done more in his two years than anyone else ever has. That way he can pretend that he\u2019s among the greatest of U.S. Presidents, even though he\u2019ll have been the only one to be in prison before his first term would have ended."

Take Trump\u2019s relationship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un for example. Not only has the Trump administration crashed and burned on non-proliferation, Trump himself has managed to pull off the impossible. He has actually come out of this making Kim Jong Un, a man who ordered a hit on his brother, look better than the American president. Such a feat is truly remarkable, but somehow Trump makes it look effortless.\n\nAfter his last visit with North Korea\u2019s leader in Vietnam, Trump returned to the United States with his tail tucked between his legs, having to walk away mid-summit after Kim made clear he wouldn\u2019t give an inch. Still, Trump\u2019s brain cannot comprehend how this works, because he thinks their relationship is a good one. This comes even as North Korea appears to be gearing up for another missile launch.\n\nTrump fails to grasp the fact that no one on earth cares about his relationship with Kim Jong Un, including Kim himself. This isn\u2019t about the relationship between the two men, rather it\u2019s supposed to be about the relationship between the United States and North Korea. Furthermore, Kim\u2019s comments after the summit in Vietnam were spot on regarding Trump. He sounded sane and down-to-earth, while Trump was left looking like the child who wore out the patience and \u201cwill\u201d for Kim to negotiate for peace.\n\nIn summary, Kim Jong Un walked away with a slight increase in stature, which is not a good thing at all, while Donald Trump just reinforced his image as a buffoon. I believe Russian media used the word \u201cclown.\u201d Trump is so sweet on Kim, he\u2019d be shocked if North Korea continued on with their nuclear proliferation. Well, Trump better grab a pint of ice cream and his favorite break-up album, because all signs point to \u201cgo\u201d when it comes to North Korea\u2019s nuclear agenda."

Yet here we are on a comparatively quiet Sunday morning, with so many storylines in play, but most of them not having come all the way to fruition yet, even as we wait for the fireworks to start.\n\nThis week we should get closure on the sentencing of Michael Flynn. Remember back when the judge asked aloud if Flynn had committed treason, and then told Flynn to go find a way to help Robert Mueller even more? That\u2019s back in play now. If the Flynn case really is put to bed this week, we could finally see Mueller unveil some of what he redacted in the Flynn sentencing memo. Keep in mind that for Mueller to have recommended that Flynn get off with a slap on the wrist, Flynn must have sold out Donald Trump and everyone else pretty hardcore. But that\u2019s just the start of what this week brings.\n\nThis week we should also find out whether the judge is going to throw Roger Stone in jail for his multiple recent violations of his gag order. We\u2019ll also see the extent to which a right can be wronged, as Paul Manafort\u2019s second judge will likely hand him an appropriately harsh sentence after his first judge tried to let him off easy. Adding to the intrigue, Manafort\u2019s second judge is also Stone\u2019s judge. It\u2019ll be a busy week for her, to say the least.\n\nAll of these moving pieces are a big deal for Robert Mueller, who is surely focused behind the scenes on winding these disparate threads into a cohesive endgame against Donald Trump. We\u2019ll see where this week gets us. But we know this much: this upcoming week won\u2019t be nearly as quiet as this current Sunday morning."

    "text": "Is John Bolton blind, daft, or what? Just like his boss Donald Trump, he refuses to see what\u2019s right in front of his face. Bolton recently appeared on This Week with Martha Raddatz, who asked him about North Korea rebuilding its long-range rocket launching capabilities. This information has been in the news all week, yet Bolton refused to acknowledge that evidence exists. Seriously, is he just dumb? We best believe something else is afoot, like Bolton trying to play down Trump\u2019s failure in North Korea and being in cahoots with Russian benefactors.\n\nBolton disregarded Raddatz\u2019s questions regarding North Korea by saying, \u201cThe United States government\u2026 expends a lot of resources and effort so we don\u2019t have to rely on commercial satellite imagery.\u201d Well, this is not just \u201ccommercial satellite imagery.\u201d The imagery comes from an outfit called Beyond Parallel.\n\nBeyond Parallel was initiated by the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Its sole purpose is the study of actions in Korea. Beyond Parallel was created to provide \u201cclarity and understanding to policymakers, strategists, and opinion leaders about Korean unification.\u201d Putting it simply, all they do is study Korea, and they are, therefore, very well-versed on activities in both North and South Korea. Just this past Tuesday, Beyond Parallel published photos indicating that the Sohae facility is rapidly being rebuilt. Given that this organization\u2019s very existence is based on observing Korea, wouldn\u2019t you assume that they know what they\u2019re talking about? Apparently, not if you\u2019re John Bolton.\n\nBolton wouldn\u2019t even comment directly on photographs he was presented, responding instead, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot in North Korea. We watch it constantly. There\u2019s a lot of activity all the time in North Korea, but I\u2019m not going to speculate on what that particular commercial satellite picture shows.\u201d Photos and satellite are what they are; they\u2019re showing what they \u201csee.\u201d If a leader refuses to see what\u2019s before his eyes, I\u2019m hard pressed to figure out why unless some ulterior motivation is at play.\n\nJohn Bolton unquestionably has ties to Russia. Elijah Cummings and Stephen Lynch requested records regarding Bolton in August 2018 about Bolton\u2019s connections to the group The Right to Bear Arms, a Russian pro-gun outfit. Because of that connection, Cummings and Lynch voiced concern over Bolton\u2019s security clearance and the Trump administration\u2019s vetting process (or lack thereof). Considering all of the security clearance problems in the Trump administration to date, Cummings and Lynch were right to be concerned. This is before getting to Bolton\u2019s connections to Cambridge Analytica and Russian spy Maria Butina.\n\nNow that the House Democrats are in power, we should see more activity surrounding John Bolton in the coming months. Considering Bolton\u2019s denials of what has been captured in (non-commercial) satellite photographs and his continued attempts to cover for Trump, that may well happen sooner rather than later. Organizations like Beyond Parallel and our intelligence community have kept our nation safe for many years. Only this Administration questions them. This is the most corrupt administration in U.S. history \u2013 and we don\u2019t yet know how far that corruption runs."

So what happens after you\u2019ve lost the support of a cartoonish pundit who\u2019s such a joke that both sides know she\u2019s a joke, and the right just humors her? Trump just gave us that answer, and it isn\u2019t pretty.\n\nIn the past few days Donald Trump has retweeted the likes of Paul Sperry, Charles Payne, Mark Levin, Tim Young, and Hans Von Spakovsky. How obscure are these people? They\u2019re all real, but if I had made them all up, most of you wouldn\u2019t know the difference.\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad if you haven\u2019t heard of these people; you\u2019d have to be pretty well versed in the far-right echo chamber to have any idea who these people are, because none of them exist outside of it. But that\u2019s who Donald Trump has left now. As he circles the drain, even people like Ann Coulter are cutting bait, because they want to retain relative credibility with their far-right base once Trump has been flushed. The people speaking the most loudly and consistently in Trump\u2019s defense are people whom no one has heard of or even cares about.\n\nBut don\u2019t tell that to Donald Trump, who is such a malignant narcissist, he\u2019ll embrace anyone who sings his praises, no matter how laughable that person is. In fact Trump has retweeted Paul Sperry, whoever the heck that might be, nine times in the past two days. This is all that Trump has left to work with. Instead of giving up and resigning, Trump is clinging to what little he has left, no matter how embarrassing it may be."

George Conway\u2019s opposition to Donald Trump just got a bit louder, however, as he attacked the administration in a speech he made at Georgetown Law School. George\u2019s rhetoric has also gotten more dire.\n\n\u201cIf people were to get indicted or not indicted on the basis of whether or not the president likes them, we wouldn\u2019t have a republic,\u201d he warned. \u201cWe\u2019d have a banana republic.\u201d An unsettling array of news has been emanating from the White House now \u2013 that Donald Trump did indeed order an investigation against his political rivals, and saw people investigating him as disloyal.\n\nAs the House investigations ramp up, we\u2019ll likely be seeing more people emboldened by George Conway\u2019s warning and turning against this administration, which is quickly turning radioactive. We still don\u2019t know how Kellyanne Conway feels about this, but it\u2019s not likely that her husband will be backing down anytime soon."

    "text": "Heading into what is already set to be a pivotal week in Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation, Erik Prince just threw us all a curveball by admitting that he participated in the long-alleged second Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr and others during the election. He then comically claimed that this meeting is only missing from the transcript of his sworn House testimony because the transcript is somehow wrong. Even as everyone rightly marvels over the absurdity of this, Prince just gave away something larger.\n\nFrom an optics standpoint, what Erik Prince just said looks absolutely terrible. There is no one in the court of public opinion who is going to believe that he confessed to this meeting during his House Intel Committee testimony two years ago, but no one from either party remembers him saying it, and the transcriber somehow missed it as well, and even though Prince has known all this time that this incriminating transcript was incorrect, he\u2019s never thought to ask anyone to go back and check the tape until now. By claiming this, Prince is making himself look like an idiot.\n\nAs Palmer Report likes to point out, there are only two reasons a person tries to make a scandal go away by floating an excuse that has absolutely terrible optics. The first is if they\u2019re simply an idiot and they simply don\u2019t know how bad it\u2019s going to make them look. The second is if they\u2019re savvy enough to know that they\u2019re facing criminal implications in the scandal, and they\u2019re making the calculated decision to sacrifice the optics in the name of establishing a criminal defense. After all, obtaining a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea only requires carving out a sliver of reasonable doubt, even if the jury thinks you\u2019re very probably guilty.\n\nErik Prince is a steaming pile of crap, but he\u2019s definitely not an idiot. He\u2019s a shadowy figure who\u2019s suddenly decided to come out of the shadows and do an interview with a journalist he knew would be hostile toward him, just so he could admit the second Trump Tower meeting happened, while claiming the meeting was about Iran policy instead of conspiring to rig the election, and laying out a legal defense against perjury charges. The only reason for Prince to do this right now: he expects Mueller to indict him any day, and he\u2019s focused on his own trial defense."

Major sections of Wall are being built and renovated, with MUCH MORE to follow shortly. Tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended (captured) at the Border and NOT allowed into our Country.

I am stopping an invasion as the Wall gets built.\u201d\n\nYes, Ann Coulter is in fact a \u201cwacky nut job.\u201d Everything else extant in Trump\u2019s tweet is a lie. Trump is not \u201cwinning on the border.\u201d It is not the case that \u201cmajor sections of the wall are being built.\u201d No sections of the wall are being built or have been built.

The term \u201cillegals\u201d is a dehumanizing term invented to stigmatize and tarnish.

We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children\u2019s future. And we are all mortal.\u201d Trump wants you to join him in hating them instead.

Based on what Schiff said on NBC this morning, he\u2019s already focused on the endgame.\n\nThis morning Adam Schiff said it\u2019ll be a \u201cmistake\u201d if Robert Mueller doesn\u2019t force Donald Trump to testify in person as part of his Trump-Russia investigation. We don\u2019t know what Mueller will ultimately do on that front; thus far he\u2019s only gotten written answers out of Trump. But we know what Schiff is doing here. He\u2019s laying the groundwork to subpoena Trump to publicly testify before Congress about his scandals. In such a setting, Donald Trump would quickly unravel. His testimony would consist of blatant lies that would get him nailed for felony perjury, and unwitting truthful admissions that would incriminate him for all to see. Bring it on."

One of Donald Trump\u2019s convicted criminal associates, who has already demonstrated his willingness to cooperate with federal investigators, is delaying his public congressional testimony at the last minute \u2013 and the House Democrats in charge don\u2019t seem upset about it in the slightest.\n\nThat\u2019s right, this week\u2019s big public testimony from convicted Russian mafia money launderer Felix Sater, who infamously partnered with the Trump Organization on the Trump Soho real estate project, was supposed to testify in front of the television cameras this Thursday. But now suddenly that\u2019s been pushed back to March 27th. The excuse: \u201cscheduling issues.\u201d Really? He\u2019s about to testify to the entire country about crimes he committed with the President of the United States, but he forgot he has a car wash appointment that day or something?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though. If Felix Sater were trying to pull a fast one on House Democrats, they\u2019d be publicly castigating him and threatening him with a subpoena. Instead they simply said that Sater, who became a government informant the last time he got caught committing felonies, \u201ccontinues to cooperate with the committee.\u201d In other words, he\u2019s holding off for two weeks because there are things that prosecutors don\u2019t want him to publicly reveal for another two weeks.\n\nWe saw the same thing play out with Michael Cohen. He used every excuse in the book to put off his public testimony. Then when he went through with it, he busted out evidence and documents that blew Donald Trump\u2019s fraud scandals wide open. Considering that House Democrats seem just fine with Felix Sater\u2019s own unexplained delay, it\u2019s probably for similar reasons. Buckle up. This sounds like it\u2019ll be worth the wait."

However, she is the founder of a chain of spas, Tokyo Day Spas, that she has operated since coming to the United States from China in 2007.\n\nYang has been reportedly selling access to Trump and Mar-A-Lago to Chinese executives. Mother Jones reported over the weekend on the other business that Yang runs, GY Investments LLC. GY touts itself as an \u201cinternational business consulting firm that provides public relations services to assist businesses in America to establish and expand their brand image in the modern Chinese marketplace,\u201d but appears to be mostly selling access to Trump. What security clearance Yang might have, if any, is unknown.\n\nIn what is perhaps another Trump coincidence, around the time that Yang started GY and gained access to Trump and others in the GOP, including Trump\u2019s children, even as Ivanka Trump received numerous trademark approvals from China in the last two years, including for massage parlors and spas. The House should investigate how those came about and if there is any connection to the Trump administration and the relationship with Yang, who until now had operated out of the spotlight. Yang represents a security threat and like most of this administration, is a sign of the swamp dwelling that Trump and his orbit represents. We will see how Trump massages himself out of this situation."

She\u2019s a buffoon who, based on the sheer idiocy she puts on display at the podium, is far too unintelligent to play any real role in the Trump regime. She\u2019s just sort of there to add insult to injury, right? Based on the events of this week, I\u2019m no longer so sure.\n\nWhen Donald Trump hired former Fox News executive Bill Shine as his new White House Communications Director, major media outlets reported that Shine had specifically told people he was planning to replace Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But eight months later, Shine has been shoved out the back door, and Sanders is still there. In fact she\u2019s now survived working directly under five different Trump White House Communications Directors. She got promoted along the way. She survived when Anthony Scaramucci was brought in specifically to fire everyone else. She also survived the controversial departure of her top deputy Raj Shah earlier this year.\n\nFor that matter, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller interviewed Sarah Huckabee Sanders a few months back about the obstruction of justice she\u2019d been committing from the podium, she simply stopped doing press briefings almost entirely. She\u2019s no longer doing the job, yet she still has the job. It\u2019s enough to make you wonder how this one person, who is terrible at an important and highly visible job, and is no longer even doing her job, keeps surviving \u2013 even as everyone above and below her keeps getting ousted.\n\nDuring the Sean Spicer era we saw just how much Donald Trump cared about how the press briefings went. Now he has someone in the job who doesn\u2019t even bother to do press briefings, yet he keeps her around while chasing off everyone else in the communications department. The whole thing is just weird. Some have theorized that Trump keeps her around because her father is influential evangelical conservative Christian con artist Mike Huckabee, and Trump needs those votes. But does anyone think the conservative evangelicals are sticking with Trump because of Huckabee Sanders? All Trump has to do is keep saying racist and hateful things to keep their votes.\n\nThere is another possibility. Based on everything we\u2019ve seen from her, Sarah Huckabee Sanders is extraordinarily unintelligent and inept. But what if that\u2019s the whole point? What if she\u2019s a secret genius, and she\u2019s smart enough to know that coming off like a non-influential simpleton is the key to prospering in this depraved criminal regime? What if she\u2019s secretly in charge of the whole thing? What if Sarah Huckabee Sanders has been pulling a Keyser Soze on us the whole time? At this point very little would surprise me."

Take Trump\u2019s relationship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un for example. Not only has the Trump administration crashed and burned on non-proliferation, Trump himself has managed to pull off the impossible. He has actually come out of this making Kim Jong Un, a man who ordered a hit on his brother, look better than the American president. Such a feat is truly remarkable, but somehow Trump makes it look effortless.\n\nAfter his last visit with North Korea\u2019s leader in Vietnam, Trump returned to the United States with his tail tucked between his legs, having to walk away mid-summit after Kim made clear he wouldn\u2019t give an inch. Still, Trump\u2019s brain cannot comprehend how this works, because he thinks their relationship is a good one. This comes even as North Korea appears to be gearing up for another missile launch.\n\nTrump fails to grasp the fact that no one on earth cares about his relationship with Kim Jong Un, including Kim himself. This isn\u2019t about the relationship between the two men, rather it\u2019s supposed to be about the relationship between the United States and North Korea. Furthermore, Kim\u2019s comments after the summit in Vietnam were spot on regarding Trump. He sounded sane and down-to-earth, while Trump was left looking like the child who wore out the patience and \u201cwill\u201d for Kim to negotiate for peace.\n\nIn summary, Kim Jong Un walked away with a slight increase in stature, which is not a good thing at all, while Donald Trump just reinforced his image as a buffoon. I believe Russian media used the word \u201cclown.\u201d Trump is so sweet on Kim, he\u2019d be shocked if North Korea continued on with their nuclear proliferation. Well, Trump better grab a pint of ice cream and his favorite break-up album, because all signs point to \u201cgo\u201d when it comes to North Korea\u2019s nuclear agenda."

It\u2019s easy to focus on the poor excuses DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is giving for ruining the lives of thousands of children and their families, but the horrors don\u2019t stop there. Internal government documents reveal that Customs and Border Protection agents have been keeping a list of journalists who traveled to cover news stories about the traveling caravan \u2013 and not just a one-off incident, either. The DHS inspector general found it serious enough to open an inquiry on the matter.\n\nAs we wait for a full report, bear in mind that ICE and CBP have a consistent record of extralegal abuses, some of which predate this administration. Trump\u2019s dislike of journalists who cast him in an unfavorable light is well known, and may have been the green light these organizations have been waiting for to further wield their power and keep us in the dark on a national travesty.

One is being offered by the Washington Post, and the other claims to be from Robert Mueller while boasting of an introduction from Alan Dershowitz. Both books claim a release date of March 26th, 2019. Meanwhile, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has made no indication of when or how his report will be released. So what\u2019s really going on here?\n\nHere are the facts. No one, outside of Robert Mueller and his team, has any specific knowledge about when his report will be issued. These two \u201cbooks\u201d are merely empty templates that have been put up for preorder, with best guesses for release dates. They each plan to take the publicly available version of Mueller\u2019s report that you\u2019ll be able to get anywhere else for free, stuff it into a book, add some custom material, and charge you money.\n\nThe version being offered by the Washington Post says it\u2019ll include \u201crelated materials\u201d from the newspaper. Fair enough; you\u2019re paying to get the Post\u2019s analysis of the Mueller report, once the report surfaces. Considering the solid investigative research that the Post has done into Donald Trump\u2019s various criminal scandals over the past few years, this analysis could prove to be useful.\n\nThe other version misleadingly lists \u201cRobert S. Mueller III\u201d as the author but is actually being offered by Skyhorse publishing, which has previously published pro-Trump books from Alan Dershowitz, including \u201cThe Case Against Impeaching Trump.\u201d For this new book, the \u201cintroduction\u201d from Dershowitz will likely be something more akin to a rebuttal of the Mueller report. Unless you\u2019re a Trump supporter and you want to read Dershowitz defending his ally Trump while attacking Mueller, ordering this version would be a complete waste of money.\n\nIn any case, neither of these books has any actual connection to Robert Mueller. He\u2019s not releasing or participating in these two book releases. He\u2019s simply going to issue his report, which will then go to the Attorney General, who will release some or all of it publicly, ostensibly followed by a battle with House Democrats about how much more of it to publicly release. These two book publishers will then take the publicly available version of Mueller\u2019s report, which will be published for free by every major news outlet out there, and \u201csell\u201d it to you along with added content. One book claims to be 720 pages and the other claims to be 960 pages, but these are both clearly made-up numbers.\n\nIf Robert Mueller\u2019s report doesn\u2019t become public by the March 26th \u201crelease date\u201d that\u2019s arbitrarily been assigned to these two books, you\u2019ll see that release date moved further back, as the publishers take revised guesses about when the report might surface. While these books will technically include the Mueller report, these books are not how Robert Mueller is releasing his report; you\u2019re simply paying to get third party analysis of Mueller\u2019s report once it\u2019s released to the public for free."

She says horrible things that are calculated to bring her free negative publicity from the left, thus endearing her to the right, which drives the very profitable sales of her racist and xenophobic books. But now Donald Trump has gone and dragged Coulter into the picture in a way that, for once, is worth talking about.\n\nAnn Coulter has written a number of books about how Donald Trump\u2019s racist border wall fantasy is going to magically make everything perfect. When Trump initially caved on his wall, Coulter lashed out at him, because she had to, in order to retain credibility with her racist audience. This prompted Trump to double down on his wall after all, shutting down the government. But this was a disaster, so he caved again, and instead launched a \u201cnational emergency\u201d that he knew wouldn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nCoulter is a flaming bag of crap, but she\u2019s not stupid. She knows Trump isn\u2019t building a wall. More importantly, she knows that even Trump\u2019s deluded racist base is starting to figure out there will never be a wall. So she keeps lashing out at him. This has left Trump in the surreal position of attacking Coulter, even though she\u2019s very popular with his base.\n\nTrump posted this deranged fantasy on Twitter this afternoon: \u201cWacky Nut Job Ann Coulter, who still hasn\u2019t figured out that, despite all odds and an entire Democrat Party of Far Left Radicals against me (not to mention certain Republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight), I am winning on the Border. Major sections of Wall are being built and renovated, with MUCH MORE to follow shortly. Tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended (captured) at the Border and NOT allowed into our Country. With another President, millions would be pouring in. I am stopping an invasion as the Wall gets built. #MAGA\u201d\n\nOf course not one word of Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter rant is true, aside from the \u201cWacky Nut Job\u201d part. But what matters here is that, rather than continue to seek Ann Coulter\u2019s approval, he\u2019s now trying to throw her under the bus, even though they have the same base. Some of their shared base will side with Trump, while others will side with Coulter. Either way, Trump will lose at least some supporters over this. But we suppose he\u2019s in too desperate of straits to care anymore."

If the Flynn case really is put to bed this week, we could finally see Mueller unveil some of what he redacted in the Flynn sentencing memo. Keep in mind that for Mueller to have recommended that Flynn get off with a slap on the wrist, Flynn must have sold out Donald Trump and everyone else pretty hardcore. But that\u2019s just the start of what this week brings.\n\nThis week we should also find out whether the judge is going to throw Roger Stone in jail for his multiple recent violations of his gag order. We\u2019ll also see the extent to which a right can be wronged, as Paul Manafort\u2019s second judge will likely hand him an appropriately harsh sentence after his first judge tried to let him off easy. Adding to the intrigue, Manafort\u2019s second judge is also Stone\u2019s judge. It\u2019ll be a busy week for her, to say the least.\n\nAll of these moving pieces are a big deal for Robert Mueller, who is surely focused behind the scenes on winding these disparate threads into a cohesive endgame against Donald Trump.

Whitaker took the job, but then abruptly resigned after just a couple weeks. We knew something didn\u2019t smell right, and now it\u2019s starting to surface.\n\nLegal activist group American Oversight has obtained Department of Justice records which reveal that after Donald Trump ordered then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to launch a sham investigation into Hillary Clinton, Sessions did precisely that. In November of 2017, Sessions instructed U.S. Attorney John Huber to investigate Hillary. At the time, Matt Whitaker was the Chief of Staff for Sessions. These newly exposed records reveal that Whitaker was the one who sent Sessions\u2019 instructions to Huber. Why is this such a big deal?\n\nIn the big picture, it means that Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions really did abuse their power by attempting to open what they knew was a baseless criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton for political reasons. This is impeachable, and perhaps prosecutable, and we\u2019re going to hear a lot more about this story in the coming days. But when it comes to Matt Whitaker, he lied about this whole thing.\n\nSo now we have Matt Whitaker not only having committed perjury during his recent House Judiciary Committee testimony, but also having committed perjury in this Sessions/Clinton matter. Whitaker knew he was going down for at least one count of perjury when he abruptly resigned his brand new DOJ job. Did he know that this Freedom of Information Act request was about to nail him for another count? Now the question is whether Whitaker has resigned because he\u2019s cut a plea deal, or simply because he\u2019s panicking without a plan."

The propaganda included \u201ceverything from veiled white supremacist language to explicitly racist images and words, often features a recruitment element, and frequently targets minority groups, including Jews, Blacks, Muslims, non-white immigrants and the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nTrump likes to pretend he is a great champion of civil rights while he takes shameless action to trample on them. Trump\u2019s transgender military ban is a perfect example. This week ended with a federal court ruling that paves the way for his hateful ban to take effect. When Trump announced the ban in 2017, it was through a series of insulting tweets, complaining that the military \u201ccannot be burdened.\u201d\n\nYet candidate Trump sang a different tune. \u201cThank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs,\u201d he tweeted after the 2016 Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting. When he was considering a presidential run in 2000, Trump even told The Advocate that there is \u201cno reason\u201d why \u201cgay people\u201d cannot serve in the United States military.\n\nPresidents are supposed to lift up Americans and make us feel unified and proud. Trump does the opposite. He is aloof on his best days and divisive on his worst. Under a reign of hatred and hypocrisy, Trump inspires white supremacists to advertise their bigotry and step up their recruitment. Even more disturbing than the new data is where things appear to be headed. There is every reason to believe that this ugly trend will continue as long as our amoral president remains in the Oval Office."

Prince, who has denied any involvement in the Trump 2016 campaign and previously testified that he had \u201cno formal role\u201d in such campaign, apparently did set up a meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr, Stephen Miller and a UAE lobbyist after all. In a stunning interview with Al Jazeera\u2019s Mehdi Hasan, Prince looked like a deer caught in the headlights when Hasan pressed him on why he did not disclose the 2016 meeting to the House Intelligence Committee. What did Prince claim? That \u201cperhaps they got the transcript wrong.\u201d\n\nThis is the same Prince who coincidentally ran into the Russians in the Seychelles for another meeting. Prince stunningly claimed he told Congress about his Trump Tower meeting, even though it is not in the transcript of his testimony. This is the latest of now hundreds of \u201ccoincidences\u201d with people meeting with Russians and others to discuss issues and matters during the campaign, and then lying brazenly to Congress and to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The House committees must immediately bring Prince back before them to probe his lies to Congress, and Junior once again should be hauled before Congress before he is indicted.\n\nIn the meantime, Erik Prince should have no contracts to provide private military forces to the United States or on our behalf. Based on the public docket, we know that there are dozens of sealed indictments in the District of Columbia tied to the Mueller investigation; we just don\u2019t know whose names are on them. Given this confirmation of more coincidental meetings and conduct, one must wonder if at least one of those has a prince on it \u2013 Erik Prince."

Since Democrats took over the House Oversight Committee in January, they have been asking the White House to provide the records related to Kushner\u2019s top secret security clearance. They are particularly interested in records relating to the fact that Kushner was denied the highest levels of clearance until Trump ordered that it be granted. This past week the White House declined to provide those documents. Normally this would have forced the committee to issue a subpoena, which likely would have led to a drawn out legal fight between the committee and the White House.\n\nIn a stunning twist of events however, we learned Friday that documents detailing the year-long security clearance process for both Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump had already been leaked to the committee by someone from inside the White House. Axios reported that the House Oversight Committee had already obtained the documents in question, including the timeline of events and the people involved, into how the top secret security clearances were ultimately granted to both Kushner and Ivanka Trump.\n\nCongressman Ro Khanna, a member of the House Oversight Committee, appeared on the Rachel Maddow show Friday night to speak about some of the information and concerns related to this issue. During the interview with guest host Joy Reid, Khanna noted that both former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House counsel Don McGahn were so opposed to Kushner being granted top secret clearance, they felt it necessary to document their reasoning in contemporaneous memos. Khanna doesn\u2019t believe that the committee has a copy of those memos yet, but it is certainly within the power of the committee to subpoena either McGahn and/or Kelly to testify as to their concerns and the contents of the memo.\n\nKhanna seemed particularly alarmed about Jared Kushner\u2019s relationship with the Saudis in general, and his closeness to Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) in particular. He pointed to the fact that Kushner has access to the president\u2019s daily briefing, which includes lists of Saudi dissidents. He also pointed to reporting that Kushner allegedly provided these lists to MBS.\n\nWhat were the reasons Jared Kushner was originally denied top secret clearance? Why was it necessary for Kushner to modify his disclosures so many times? Why were McGahn and Kelly so opposed to Kushner being granted top secret clearance? Has Kushner been providing the Saudis with American intelligence in return for their financial support of his real estate empire? These are likely only some of the questions the House Oversight committee is interested in. As of Friday we know they are much closer to finding those answers than either Kushner or the White House would like."

As Palmer Report loves to point out, smart investigators rarely ask for documents unless they already have at least some of the documents in question. It turns out Cummings is as smart as we thought.\n\nToday we all learned that Elijah Cummings and his committee have indeed had some of the Jared-Ivanka security clearance documents since early February, because someone in the White House leaked the documents to the committee, according to Axios. Why is this so important? For one thing, it means someone in the White House really seems to resent the Trump crime family. But more importantly, it means Cummings is playing four dimensional chess here.\n\nNow that the White House has definitively refused to turn any of the documents over, Cummings is promptly leaking the fact that he already has some of them, without revealing which ones he has. This leaves the White House with no idea what to do next. Should it just cave and turn over all the documents? Should it gamble that the documents Cummings has aren\u2019t the most incriminating ones? Should it run certain documents through a shredder, and gamble that those aren\u2019t the ones Cummings has?\n\nElijah Cummings can easily win a subpoena fight to get the rest of these documents, simply by showing the judge the documents he does have. He\u2019s clearly playing for keeps here. Keep in mind that he just spent the past month demanding documents he already had. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s hitting him."

Now we\u2019re seeing a much more direct example playing out in real time.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s buddy Erik Prince is a thug, but he\u2019s savvy enough to know how these things work. He knows Special Counsel Robert Mueller can and will indict him for lying to the House last year about his Trump Tower meeting. So yesterday Prince simply admitted the truth about the meeting. Prince comically claimed that the transcript of his testimony is somehow incorrect, and that he\u2019s been up front about the meeting all along. We\u2019ll see how far Prince does or doesn\u2019t get with this surreal legal defense. But the real story here is that Prince just sold out Donald Trump Jr.\n\nErik Prince wasn\u2019t the only one who was in that fateful meeting. Donald Trump Jr was there too. By fessing up about the meeting, which was with a shady Israeli social media firm and the leaders of two Arab nations, Prince has served up Junior on a silver platter. It\u2019s not that Prince wants to take Junior down. It\u2019s just that Prince is doing what he\u2019s got to do to try to save himself, and anyone else is collateral damage.\n\nThis is just one example of a cascading series of events we\u2019re about to see taking place. With document requests placing Donald Trump\u2019s people in a no-win situation, and Robert Mueller\u2019s indictments looming just under the surface, each person involved is about to do whatever he thinks might save himself, without regard for how many other dominoes get taken down in the process. Erik Prince is just trying to get out ahead of the avalanche. It won\u2019t work. They\u2019re all about to take each other down."

It\u2019s easy to focus on the poor excuses DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is giving for ruining the lives of thousands of children and their families, but the horrors don\u2019t stop there. Internal government documents reveal that Customs and Border Protection agents have been keeping a list of journalists who traveled to cover news stories about the traveling caravan \u2013 and not just a one-off incident, either. The DHS inspector general found it serious enough to open an inquiry on the matter.\n\nAs we wait for a full report, bear in mind that ICE and CBP have a consistent record of extralegal abuses, some of which predate this administration. Trump\u2019s dislike of journalists who cast him in an unfavorable light is well known, and may have been the green light these organizations have been waiting for to further wield their power and keep us in the dark on a national travesty.

Whitaker took the job, but then abruptly resigned after just a couple weeks. We knew something didn\u2019t smell right, and now it\u2019s starting to surface.\n\nLegal activist group American Oversight has obtained Department of Justice records which reveal that after Donald Trump ordered then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to launch a sham investigation into Hillary Clinton, Sessions did precisely that. In November of 2017, Sessions instructed U.S. Attorney John Huber to investigate Hillary. At the time, Matt Whitaker was the Chief of Staff for Sessions. These newly exposed records reveal that Whitaker was the one who sent Sessions\u2019 instructions to Huber. Why is this such a big deal?\n\nIn the big picture, it means that Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions really did abuse their power by attempting to open what they knew was a baseless criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton for political reasons. This is impeachable, and perhaps prosecutable, and we\u2019re going to hear a lot more about this story in the coming days. But when it comes to Matt Whitaker, he lied about this whole thing.\n\nSo now we have Matt Whitaker not only having committed perjury during his recent House Judiciary Committee testimony, but also having committed perjury in this Sessions/Clinton matter. Whitaker knew he was going down for at least one count of perjury when he abruptly resigned his brand new DOJ job. Did he know that this Freedom of Information Act request was about to nail him for another count? Now the question is whether Whitaker has resigned because he\u2019s cut a plea deal, or simply because he\u2019s panicking without a plan."

When Trump initially caved on his wall, Coulter lashed out at him, because she had to, in order to retain credibility with her racist audience. This prompted Trump to double down on his wall after all, shutting down the government.

She knows Trump isn\u2019t building a wall. More importantly, she knows that even Trump\u2019s deluded racist base is starting to figure out there will never be a wall. So she keeps lashing out at him.

I am stopping an invasion as the Wall gets built. #MAGA\u201d\n\nOf course not one word of Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter rant is true, aside from the \u201cWacky Nut Job\u201d part. But what matters here is that, rather than continue to seek Ann Coulter\u2019s approval, he\u2019s now trying to throw her under the bus, even though they have the same base.

Most often we see this when he rants about \u201cfake news,\u201d which we\u2019ve all come to know means any news that Trump doesn\u2019t like, including opinion pieces that don\u2019t gush about his brilliance, business success, or large hands, or factual articles where Trump isn\u2019t presented as the clearly defined \u201cwinner.\u201d\n\nWe also see Trump\u2019s anti-First Amendment tendencies when he claims that journalists are \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d when he threatens to take away broadcasting licenses from certain media outlets, or when he prohibits specific journalists from covering a given event, such as he recently did in Vietnam during his meeting with Kim Jong Un.\n\nDuring his now infamous CPAC speech this past weekend, however, Trump decided to change things up a bit and went in a different direction. Rather than trying to force those on the left to sit down and shut up, he proposed an executive order that would guarantee free speech at colleges and universities, therefore guaranteeing conservatives the right to freely state offensive views. This lines up with right-wing fears that institutions of higher learning are indoctrinating the children of good Christian Americans into the evils of progressivism and liberalism. Without an executive order from Trump, conservatives would be helpless to do anything other than nervously wring their hands and pray their own children don\u2019t succumb to the temptations of evil.\n\nDonald Trump appears unable to comprehend that any order he implements \u2013 whether it\u2019s an order against \u201cfake news\u201d or an order bolstering free speech \u2013 would apply equally to all people and all groups. Anything designed to silence what Trump sees as \u201cfake news\u201d would apply equally (for example) to Fox & Friends, or Sean Hannity. Any executive order designed to guarantee conservatives the right to auditorium space and time at a local college would guarantee the same right to every other group as well. The system established by our founding fathers was designed to ensure balance; that\u2019s why Trump has to work so hard to tilt the odds in his favor."

Chicken feed is defined by the Spy Museum as, \u201cGenuine, but not seriously damaging, intelligence knowingly provided to an enemy intelligence agency through an agent or a double agent to establish his bona fides.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence community suspected Trump\u2019s traitorous ties before he was elected. FISA warrants and our real friends abroad have been supplying intelligence since way before he became a serious candidate. Once the election was over and the Russian influence became crystal clear, there was only one thing to do. Put gold dust in the chicken feed.\n\nWe\u2019re all getting impatient. The daily horror show just gets worse and worse till we\u2019re almost numb to outrage anymore. I don\u2019t know how much gold chickens***t we\u2019ll ever be privy to, but I absolutely know it\u2019s been put into the line. There\u2019s a lot of talk of deza these days, the shortened Russian term for disinformation. This is essentially what the CIA does. It has departments and departments of chicken feed operations, and no, Mike Pompeo didn\u2019t have the time to stop them all. If the FBI started looking into Trump before the election, I think it\u2019s safe to conclude they had the CIA point out all their glittering \u201cdeposits.\u201d This is the reason we don\u2019t have action yet. Mueller is too busy with the gold rush."

    "text": "This month two different books called \u201cThe Mueller Report\u201d have become available for preorder on the Amazon.com website. One is being offered by the Washington Post, and the other claims to be from Robert Mueller while boasting of an introduction from Alan Dershowitz. Both books claim a release date of March 26th, 2019. Meanwhile, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has made no indication of when or how his report will be released. So what\u2019s really going on here?\n\nHere are the facts. No one, outside of Robert Mueller and his team, has any specific knowledge about when his report will be issued. These two \u201cbooks\u201d are merely empty templates that have been put up for preorder, with best guesses for release dates. They each plan to take the publicly available version of Mueller\u2019s report that you\u2019ll be able to get anywhere else for free, stuff it into a book, add some custom material, and charge you money.\n\nThe version being offered by the Washington Post says it\u2019ll include \u201crelated materials\u201d from the newspaper. Fair enough; you\u2019re paying to get the Post\u2019s analysis of the Mueller report, once the report surfaces. Considering the solid investigative research that the Post has done into Donald Trump\u2019s various criminal scandals over the past few years, this analysis could prove to be useful.\n\nThe other version misleadingly lists \u201cRobert S. Mueller III\u201d as the author but is actually being offered by Skyhorse publishing, which has previously published pro-Trump books from Alan Dershowitz, including \u201cThe Case Against Impeaching Trump.\u201d For this new book, the \u201cintroduction\u201d from Dershowitz will likely be something more akin to a rebuttal of the Mueller report. Unless you\u2019re a Trump supporter and you want to read Dershowitz defending his ally Trump while attacking Mueller, ordering this version would be a complete waste of money.\n\nIn any case, neither of these books has any actual connection to Robert Mueller. He\u2019s not releasing or participating in these two book releases. He\u2019s simply going to issue his report, which will then go to the Attorney General, who will release some or all of it publicly, ostensibly followed by a battle with House Democrats about how much more of it to publicly release. These two book publishers will then take the publicly available version of Mueller\u2019s report, which will be published for free by every major news outlet out there, and \u201csell\u201d it to you along with added content. One book claims to be 720 pages and the other claims to be 960 pages, but these are both clearly made-up numbers.\n\nIf Robert Mueller\u2019s report doesn\u2019t become public by the March 26th \u201crelease date\u201d that\u2019s arbitrarily been assigned to these two books, you\u2019ll see that release date moved further back, as the publishers take revised guesses about when the report might surface. While these books will technically include the Mueller report, these books are not how Robert Mueller is releasing his report; you\u2019re simply paying to get third party analysis of Mueller\u2019s report once it\u2019s released to the public for free."

Prince, who has denied any involvement in the Trump 2016 campaign and previously testified that he had \u201cno formal role\u201d in such campaign, apparently did set up a meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr, Stephen Miller and a UAE lobbyist after all. In a stunning interview with Al Jazeera\u2019s Mehdi Hasan, Prince looked like a deer caught in the headlights when Hasan pressed him on why he did not disclose the 2016 meeting to the House Intelligence Committee. What did Prince claim? That \u201cperhaps they got the transcript wrong.\u201d\n\nThis is the same Prince who coincidentally ran into the Russians in the Seychelles for another meeting. Prince stunningly claimed he told Congress about his Trump Tower meeting, even though it is not in the transcript of his testimony. This is the latest of now hundreds of \u201ccoincidences\u201d with people meeting with Russians and others to discuss issues and matters during the campaign, and then lying brazenly to Congress and to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The House committees must immediately bring Prince back before them to probe his lies to Congress, and Junior once again should be hauled before Congress before he is indicted.\n\nIn the meantime, Erik Prince should have no contracts to provide private military forces to the United States or on our behalf. Based on the public docket, we know that there are dozens of sealed indictments in the District of Columbia tied to the Mueller investigation; we just don\u2019t know whose names are on them. Given this confirmation of more coincidental meetings and conduct, one must wonder if at least one of those has a prince on it \u2013 Erik Prince."

    "text": "For Jared Kushner, the more we learn about details related to his top secret security clearance, the worse things seem to get. Since Democrats took over the House Oversight Committee in January, they have been asking the White House to provide the records related to Kushner\u2019s top secret security clearance. They are particularly interested in records relating to the fact that Kushner was denied the highest levels of clearance until Trump ordered that it be granted. This past week the White House declined to provide those documents. Normally this would have forced the committee to issue a subpoena, which likely would have led to a drawn out legal fight between the committee and the White House.\n\nIn a stunning twist of events however, we learned Friday that documents detailing the year-long security clearance process for both Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump had already been leaked to the committee by someone from inside the White House. Axios reported that the House Oversight Committee had already obtained the documents in question, including the timeline of events and the people involved, into how the top secret security clearances were ultimately granted to both Kushner and Ivanka Trump.\n\nCongressman Ro Khanna, a member of the House Oversight Committee, appeared on the Rachel Maddow show Friday night to speak about some of the information and concerns related to this issue. During the interview with guest host Joy Reid, Khanna noted that both former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House counsel Don McGahn were so opposed to Kushner being granted top secret clearance, they felt it necessary to document their reasoning in contemporaneous memos. Khanna doesn\u2019t believe that the committee has a copy of those memos yet, but it is certainly within the power of the committee to subpoena either McGahn and/or Kelly to testify as to their concerns and the contents of the memo.\n\nKhanna seemed particularly alarmed about Jared Kushner\u2019s relationship with the Saudis in general, and his closeness to Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) in particular. He pointed to the fact that Kushner has access to the president\u2019s daily briefing, which includes lists of Saudi dissidents. He also pointed to reporting that Kushner allegedly provided these lists to MBS.\n\nWhat were the reasons Jared Kushner was originally denied top secret clearance? Why was it necessary for Kushner to modify his disclosures so many times? Why were McGahn and Kelly so opposed to Kushner being granted top secret clearance? Has Kushner been providing the Saudis with American intelligence in return for their financial support of his real estate empire? These are likely only some of the questions the House Oversight committee is interested in. As of Friday we know they are much closer to finding those answers than either Kushner or the White House would like."

This is a reminder that Cummings is playing chess while Donald Trump is playing checkers \u2013 but it also tells us something else.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that someone in the White House leaked the Jared Kushner security clearance documents to Elijah Cummings a month ago. It\u2019s that this same person also leaked documents about Ivanka Trump\u2019s security clearance to Cummings, according to Axios. Until it surfaced in the media a few days ago, no one even knew there was an Ivanka Trump security clearance scandal.\n\nThis means that the White House leaker made a point of bringing the existence of Ivanka\u2019s security clearance scandal to the attention of House Democrats. This is something that might well never have surfaced, if not for this leaker.\n\nIn other words, there is someone in Donald Trump\u2019s White House who really wants to take Ivanka Trump down. Maybe this leaker has a personal beef with Ivanka. Maybe the leaker is merely using Ivanka as a way of trying to get to Donald. Or maybe the leaker thinks that Ivanka is the real threat to American democracy. One way or the other, the Trump White House is now eating itself alive."

More than half of Americans believe he committed crimes before he took office, and for good reason. Public testimony alleges that Trump is guilty of bank fraud, insurance fraud and tax evasion.\n\nBut, a curious report today raises questions about the worst of the worst rumors about Donald Trump. The Miami Herald is reporting today that Donald Trump watched the Super Bowl with the founder of the spa that has been alleged to hold young Asian women against their will and force them to perform sexual acts. Yes, Donald Trump apparently watched the Super Bowl with the founder of the spa where Robert Kraft, who owns one of the teams that played in the game, allegedly paid for sex.\n\nAs a keen Palmer Report reader observed last week, Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump\u2019s favorite winter destination, is very close to the spa in question. In fact, Mar-a-Lago is only about twenty miles away. So, when news about this Florida spa that is allegedly a front for sex trafficking first broke, we knew that another one of Donald Trump\u2019s friends was charged with sex crimes. Then, we curiously discovered that Trump\u2019s favorite vacation spot is surprisingly close to the location his friend allegedly frequented to solicit illegal sex. Now we are learning that Trump knows and socializes with the founder of the spa.\n\nAre these things all coincidences? Or could all of the rumors be true \u2013 the Trump modeling agency, the Russian pee-pee tape, the allegations of rape and sex parties hosted by Jeffery Epstein? The Miami Herald is simply reporting that Donald Trump watched the Super Bowl with the founder of a day spa alleged to be a front for human sex-trafficking, but it\u2019s enough to make me rethink all of the allegations levied against Trump over the years, and his penchant for socializing with sex offenders. As Rod Rosenstein said in a speech he delivered yesterday, \u201cto know a person\u2019s character, consider his friends.\u201d"

He loves that it gives conservatives, Republicans, and people who think like him the freedom to voice their views. He hates that it does the same for Democrats, progressives, and anyone else who has opinions that differ from his.\n\nHe voices these contradictory beliefs on a fairly regular basis, when in typical Trumpian fashion he also proves to be completely oblivious to his own hypocrisy. Most often we see this when he rants about \u201cfake news,\u201d which we\u2019ve all come to know means any news that Trump doesn\u2019t like, including opinion pieces that don\u2019t gush about his brilliance, business success, or large hands, or factual articles where Trump isn\u2019t presented as the clearly defined \u201cwinner.\u201d\n\nWe also see Trump\u2019s anti-First Amendment tendencies when he claims that journalists are \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d when he threatens to take away broadcasting licenses from certain media outlets, or when he prohibits specific journalists from covering a given event, such as he recently did in Vietnam during his meeting with Kim Jong Un.\n\nDuring his now infamous CPAC speech this past weekend, however, Trump decided to change things up a bit and went in a different direction. Rather than trying to force those on the left to sit down and shut up, he proposed an executive order that would guarantee free speech at colleges and universities, therefore guaranteeing conservatives the right to freely state offensive views. This lines up with right-wing fears that institutions of higher learning are indoctrinating the children of good Christian Americans into the evils of progressivism and liberalism. Without an executive order from Trump, conservatives would be helpless to do anything other than nervously wring their hands and pray their own children don\u2019t succumb to the temptations of evil.\n\nDonald Trump appears unable to comprehend that any order he implements \u2013 whether it\u2019s an order against \u201cfake news\u201d or an order bolstering free speech \u2013 would apply equally to all people and all groups. Anything designed to silence what Trump sees as \u201cfake news\u201d would apply equally (for example) to Fox & Friends, or Sean Hannity. Any executive order designed to guarantee conservatives the right to auditorium space and time at a local college would guarantee the same right to every other group as well. The system established by our founding fathers was designed to ensure balance; that\u2019s why Trump has to work so hard to tilt the odds in his favor."

He knows Special Counsel Robert Mueller can and will indict him for lying to the House last year about his Trump Tower meeting. So yesterday Prince simply admitted the truth about the meeting. Prince comically claimed that the transcript of his testimony is somehow incorrect, and that he\u2019s been up front about the meeting all along. We\u2019ll see how far Prince does or doesn\u2019t get with this surreal legal defense. But the real story here is that Prince just sold out Donald Trump Jr.\n\nErik Prince wasn\u2019t the only one who was in that fateful meeting. Donald Trump Jr was there too. By fessing up about the meeting, which was with a shady Israeli social media firm and the leaders of two Arab nations, Prince has served up Junior on a silver platter. It\u2019s not that Prince wants to take Junior down. It\u2019s just that Prince is doing what he\u2019s got to do to try to save himself, and anyone else is collateral damage.\n\nThis is just one example of a cascading series of events we\u2019re about to see taking place. With document requests placing Donald Trump\u2019s people in a no-win situation, and Robert Mueller\u2019s indictments looming just under the surface, each person involved is about to do whatever he thinks might save himself, without regard for how many other dominoes get taken down in the process. Erik Prince is just trying to get out ahead of the avalanche. It won\u2019t work. They\u2019re all about to take each other down."

I get up early every Friday, turn on the news and expect to be greeted with images of pre-dawn raids and explosive headlines about Jared Kushner, and Don Jr. indictments along with at least a handful of others. This Friday was no different.\n\nInstead of pre-dawn raids, what we got this Friday is another tiny indication that even if the Special Counsel does issue some kind of report soon, the investigation is far from over. The US District Court out of the Eastern District of Virginia has a secret Mueller-related grand jury, and that grand jury is not expected to wrap up its work for up to eighteen months.\n\nThat\u2019s right, we could be wondering if this is \u201cthe Friday,\u201d for seventy-eight more Fridays. Along with this still-secret grand jury, we have the secret foreign government-owned financial institution fighting a subpoena, along with hundreds and hundreds of redacted pages of court filings. All these secrets only stay secret because of ongoing active investigations.\n\nThere are more pages redacted and investigations that are ongoing than there are things un-redacted and wrapped up.

This week an image began widely circulating on social media which appeared to be Donald Trump\u2019s report card from Fordham University. But is it real?\n\nOn first blush, the \u201creport card\u201d seems to fall in line with the kinds of embarrassing grades that one might expect from someone who, fifty years later, is still trying to have them suppressed. Donald Trump purportedly received a D-plus, an F, and three C-minuses in his five classes. But questions immediately surfaced about the report card\u2019s legitimacy.\n\n\n\nVarious eagle eyes on social media noted that the home address listed for Donald Trump was actually from when Trump was a toddler, not college age, and that the font used on the report card doesn\u2019t appear to have even existed back then. But the biggest concern was that no one could seem to figure out what the original source was for the report card. Our attempts at tracing its origin proved fruitless.\n\nNow Fordham University itself has released a statement on Twitter, saying \u201cThe image is a forgery, not an actual Fordham University transcript. Fordham University respects the privacy of its students and alumni, and follows federal law regarding the handling and release of academic records.\u201d The University would have no realistic reason to lie about this. Considering that the report card was already highly suspect, this statement should put the entire thing to bed. Donald Trump\u2019s grades may indeed be this bad or worse, but this particular \u201creport card\u201d is a fake."

The trouble: the transcript of his 2017 testimony reveals that he lied to the House Intelligence Committee about this meeting. Now that the committee is in Democratic Party hands, it\u2019s recently turned over this and other transcripts to Robert Mueller, who is now in a position to ring up Prince for perjury.

It sounds like Prince is going with the legal defense that he told the truth, and the transcriber was merely asleep or something. It won\u2019t work. No jury will buy this. Instead he just made it worse for himself."

It doesn\u2019t take a supercomputer to connect the three dots from the founder of Orchids of Asia to Donald Trump to Robert Kraft. It perhaps does require incredible analytical powers to figure how a multi-billionaire like Kraft would otherwise know of a sleazy strip mall tug shop like the one he was busted at without a tip-off from the president.

But reporters and perhaps a House Democrat or two should ask Trump if he\u2019d be amenable to giving back the $16,000 Yang donated to his presidential campaign before gifting $42,000 to a PAC called Trump Victory in 2017.\n\nIn fact, both Rick Scott and the brazen Trump lackey Ron DeSantis have a whole lot of explaining to do/ Both their constituents and their wives are surely all ears. Maybe it\u2019s all a big coincidence and these pictures just look really, really bad in light of the big Orchids of Asia human trafficking bust? Perhaps Cindy Yang just sold a legitimate strip mall parlor chain to the wrong kind of person and was completely oblivious to what happened after. If it\u2019s not all just mad happenstance, Donald Trump, his grown sons, and his Florida flunkies should prepare to answer a lot of tough questions about their disturbing connections to human traffickers. Why does this keep happening?"

    "text": "The United States hasn\u2019t had a Secretary of Defense since last year. As of today it no longer has a Secretary of the Air Force, FEMA Director, or White House Communications Director. And that\u2019s only the half of it. Donald Trump\u2019s regime is falling to pieces, and he either can\u2019t or won\u2019t plug the holes. So now what?\n\nIn addition to the other vacancies, there is currently no White House Chief of Staff, Secretary of the Interior, or U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Trump has repeatedly tried and failed to keep some of these positions staffed. For instance, depending on how you want to count it, Trump just lost his fifth or sixth White House Communications Director with today\u2019s resignation of Bill Shine. This is the same job that Anthony Scaramucci once held for eleven days. We\u2019re not even sure whether to count Jason Miller, who quit before he could even take the job.\n\nThen we have the revolving cast of characters surrounding the UN Ambassador job, with each new candidate being even less qualified than the last. And we all know that Mick Mulvaney is only the acting White House Chief of Staff because literally no one wanted the job; even Chris Christie famously turned it down. It\u2019s clear that Trump simply can\u2019t fill many of these positions, because he\u2019s become far too radioactive for anyone legitimate to want to stand anywhere near him.\n\nBut there are other positions that Donald Trump is seemingly leaving vacant on purpose. The longer he goes with an \u201cActing\u201d Secretary of Defense instead of a real one, the harder it is for Congress to do any oversight over Trump\u2019s corrupt military antics. We just watched Trump go four months with an Acting Attorney General, in the failed hope it would allow him to shut down the investigations into his criminal scandals.\n\nFrom the start, Donald Trump\u2019s personnel decisions have consisted of putting a whole lot of corrupt and incompetent people in place to do his bidding, along with trying to install just a handful of legitimate people for the sake of appearances. The few legitimate folks are all now long gone. Many of the ringers have flamed out as well.\n\nDonald Trump wasn\u2019t legitimately elected President of the United States, and at this point he\u2019s merely holding the presidency hostage as a way of trying to fend off his inevitable indictment and arrest. No legitimate person would want to work for Trump under these terms, nor would he want any legitimate person working for him. What stands out here is that, as Trump circles the drain, he seems to be even less worried about appearances than ever."

I get up early every Friday, turn on the news and expect to be greeted with images of pre-dawn raids and explosive headlines about Jared Kushner, and Don Jr. indictments along with at least a handful of others. This Friday was no different.\n\nInstead of pre-dawn raids, what we got this Friday is another tiny indication that even if the Special Counsel does issue some kind of report soon, the investigation is far from over. The US District Court out of the Eastern District of Virginia has a secret Mueller-related grand jury, and that grand jury is not expected to wrap up its work for up to eighteen months.\n\nThat\u2019s right, we could be wondering if this is \u201cthe Friday,\u201d for seventy-eight more Fridays. Along with this still-secret grand jury, we have the secret foreign government-owned financial institution fighting a subpoena, along with hundreds and hundreds of redacted pages of court filings. All these secrets only stay secret because of ongoing active investigations.\n\nThere are more pages redacted and investigations that are ongoing than there are things un-redacted and wrapped up. Next Friday, I\u2019ll be waiting again, along with hundreds of other people, expecting the Mueller investigation to end with a big bang, but I suspect the next big bang will still be just the beginning."

Cohen may be guilty of having over-parsed his words, but certainly not perjury. And by pushing the issue, Trump\u2019s allies were merely pushing an ugly Trump scandal to the forefront. Now Trump himself has gone and blown it entirely.\n\nIn the days since Michael Cohen\u2019s public testimony, we\u2019ve learned that Donald Trump\u2019s criminal defense attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow both allegedly dangled pardons at Cohen in an attempt at convincing him not to cooperate with prosecutors. If this evidence holds up, Giuliani and Sekulow are both going to prison for obstruction of justice. The larger question has been whether it can be proven that Trump was involved in the illegal pardon offer. Now we have something of an answer, from Trump\u2019s own mouth.\n\nTrump posted this tweet today: \u201cBad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!\u201d Oops.\n\nDonald Trump just claimed that he had a conversation directly with Michael Cohen about a pardon. This probably means Trump can be subpoenaed to testify about this supposed conversation, both by the SDNY, and by the House. Trump will surely lie about the nature of the conversation. But for all we know, Cohen secretly recorded it, as he\u2019s so often one with these matters. Trump just overplayed a bad hand and screwed himself."

The timing speaks volumes \u2013 and he\u2019s not the only key Trump person to jump ship today.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s FEMA Director Brock Long is exiting the building today, after resigning amid scandal. We\u2019re expecting another shoe to drop on this front, because Long\u2019s one known scandal merely involves misuse of a government car, and pales in comparison to some of the corruption scandals that Trump\u2019s other people haven\u2019t resigned for. There is also another big exit today.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, who was leading the charge on Trump\u2019s imaginary Space Force, is also abruptly resigning. People come and go in an administration, but when you add Wilson\u2019s departure to Shine\u2019s departure and Long\u2019s departure, particularly within the context of other recent departures and embarrassing longstanding vacancies, it\u2019s clear Trump is having trouble finding and keeping people who want to work for his sinking ship.\n\nIt\u2019s the Bill Shine resignation that stands out the most today. He\u2019s a former Fox News executive who was infamously involved in trying to cover up Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sexual harassment scandal. Just days after the New Yorker expose on the corrupt relationship between Fox News and Donald Trump, suddenly Shine is bailing. This doesn\u2019t feel like a coincidence.

This low is arrived at by the apparent routine normalization of the most appalling misdeeds from a regime of such supererogatory evil as to amount practically to a coup against the United States Constitution. Behaviors we would not countenance from our village librarian or our postman are routinely countenanced and even encouraged and applauded when committed by the president of the United States.\n\nSo when Judge T S Ellis referred to Paul Manafort\u2019s \u201cotherwise blameless life,\u201d and then sentenced him to a term an entire year less than what someone caught with a weekend\u2019s worth of crack cocaine would receive, such language is hardly shocking any longer. Manafort received half the sentence as other defendants with the same offense level (38) in the same criminal history category. Calling a life like Paul Manafort\u2019s \u201cblameless\u201d is easy to do if you\u2019re a Republican and the man in question is white and rich. It\u2019s like calling a white, Ivy League rapist a \u201cyouth.\u201d You only call him a thug when it\u2019s merited, e.g., when he is guilty of being brown and/or poor \u2014 and then the rapist bit becomes merely optional.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not like Manafort spent ten years as an advisor to a bunch of Ukrainian gangsters. Or it\u2019s not like when he was a lobbyist he inflated his expenses and cut his partners out of deals before getting caught and fired. It\u2019s not like he lobbied for scumbags like Ferdinand Marcos or evil entities like big tobacco or anything. It\u2019s not like he showed no remorse for the evil things he did while working for Donald Trump. Yeah, \u201cblameless.\u201d\n\nThe late Vincent Bugliosi once said that, above all, and not without good reason, society despises politicians and lawyers, so it\u2019s a crowning irony that society too often honors and respects judges, who are both. Judge Ellis gave Manafort a pass because the judge is corrupt, and he invites us to be corrupt with him, all for the low, low price of the surrender of our critical faculties and our sense of fair play. Well no thank you, judge. I, for one, intend keeping my moral bar in the high and rarefied atmosphere where it has always lived, where bigotry, white privilege and hypocrisy cannot touch it.

But for now, Trump\u2019s behavior at the moment is rather bizarre, even by his usual nonexistent standards.\n\nFor instance, Donald Trump just quoted some idiot named Paul Sperry six different times in the span of less than an hour. Who is this guy? His bio says he\u2019s the \u201cFormer D.C. bureau chief for Investor\u2019s Business Daily\u201d \u2013 and suffice it to say that \u201cformer\u201d is the key word there. In any case, those retweets may have just gotten Trump in some new legal trouble.\n\nPaul Sperry posted a tweet making criminal accusations against Michael Cohen\u2019s family, which is not a crime on Sperry\u2019s part, even if the accusations are unfounded. But when Donald Trump retweeted Sperry\u2019s tweet, Trump committed felony witness tampering. Cohen is an active witness in a criminal investigation into Trump, and so Trump can\u2019t do that.\n\nStrangely, Donald Trump then went on to announce that \u201cSessions didn\u2019t have a clue\u201d after Sperry posted an article revealing that former Acting Attorney General Andrew McCabe launched an investigation into his then-boss Jeff Sessions. McCabe was clearly acting properly, as Sessions recused himself from the Trump-Russia probe after getting caught committing perjury. It\u2019s unclear what Trump thinks he\u2019s proving by retweeting this, but in reality he\u2019s merely reminding everyone that Sessions, a yet-to-be-charged felon, was one of his criminal co-conspirators.\n\nIn any case here, the real upshot here is that Donald Trump is suddenly in a very, very bad mood this afternoon. Is it because of today\u2019s Miami Herald story indirectly connecting him to the infamous Florida massage parlor sex trafficking ring? Or is there some other bombshell yet to come that we don\u2019t yet know about? Stay tuned."

It has the whiff of betrayal, or at least weakness, considering that what Americans voted for in large part last November is oversight into everyone involved with Trump\u2019s prolific lawbreaking. Doesn\u2019t that prove that investigating Trump and his family is exactly what we voted for, and thus your job?\n\nThe thing to consider is what effect a public statement like this might have, along with its timing. On the Mueller investigation or state-level pursuits in New York, where prosecutors are hot on the heels of the Trump Organization? This has no bearing at all. On the majority of us who are impatient for justice? Well, it\u2019s certainly frustrating on its surface, but does anyone really think this will have a material effect on the outcome of any investigation? It makes no sense that it would, especially considering that Connolly acknowledged that the House may have no choice but to haul in a few tainted Trump offspring sometime down the line, depending on what comes to light. Considering the warp speed at which damning evidence is dropping from several angles, that schedule should accelerate in turn.\n\nHouse Dems are best viewed as the political apparatus in this wide-ranging investigative operation. Their own investigative function is also crucial, but managing potential fallout from aggressive maneuvering against the president\u2019s children, taking pressure off Mueller, is equally important. The most likely strategic reason for bothering with a public statement like this \u2013 besides the point that it\u2019s still a legislator\u2019s responsibility, in theory, to truthfully inform the republic about what they\u2019re doing and why \u2013 is that it could lull a dope like Junior into a false sense of security, enabling him to tweet away that the libs stand in awe of his powers and his killer neckbeard, while possibly incriminating himself among the lolz.\n\nLet him get comfy. One person who has no compunction about going after the family is Mueller, who did just that when he led the Enron investigation and busted Enron CFO Andrew Fastow\u2019s wife for tax evasion on the way to a felony conviction of the CEO. With House Dems managing the politics, Mueller is in a much better position to take down another CEO, a.k.a. Individual-1, by leveraging Individual-2 ruthlessly."

Trump has always been obsessed with winning, but the bigger picture reveals something about his recent wins that he and his allies should find foreboding. Trump\u2019s presidency has reached a point where his wins are looking more like lipstick on a pig.\n\nJudge T.S. Ellis\u2019s sentencing of Paul Manafort to only 47 months in prison, including time served, is an upset. Four years is an insanely far cry from the 19-24 years recommended under the guidelines. Plus, the judge\u2019s praise for Manafort\u2019s \u201cotherwise blameless life\u201d makes you wonder if he was confusing him with some other defendant. Donald Trump wants us to think that this prosecutorial setback is a sign that he is winning bigly, but reasonable minds know better.\n\nPaul Manafort was no less important a person to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign than its manager. Already, Manafort has been tried and convicted of multiple criminal charges, and he has spent the last nine months in solitary confinement. He still faces another sentencing with Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who could tack on a decade more of prison time. Even a presidential pardon is not likely to help him. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office is preparing state charges that could keep Manafort behind bars no matter what Trump does, according to reporting from The New York Times.\n\nWithout true victories, Trump is resorting to picking through scraps in a growing garbage heap of bad news, then clumsily repackaging them as tremendous wins. Trump\u2019s failed second summit with Kim Jong Un? A win in his mind because he had the wisdom to walk away. Trump\u2019s shutdown over a failed border wall? A win in his mind because he drew attention to an important issue. This first Manafort sentencing is a disappointing development, no doubt. But the fact that it is the sort of thing that passes for a Trump \u201cwin\u201d these days is a sign that truth, justice, and decency may be starting to get the upper hand."

As the committees continue to sift through an incredible amount of evidence, freshman Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib has become weary of the process according to NBC News, and wants to introduce a resolution this month calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. I believe this move is a bit premature. Hear me out: I would love to see Trump removed from office sooner rather than later. However, we must all take a deep breath and look at the bigger picture. We must first, allow the process to work, and second, ensure that we get a Democratic president in 2020.\n\nAs Mitch McConnell reminds us, impeachment of President Bill Clinton backfired on them. \u201cWe impeached President Clinton and his numbers went up, ours went down and we underperformed in the national election,\u201d he shared with The Washington Post late last year. As much as it pains me, I agree with him. Even though President Clinton\u2019s impeachment was based on a moral issue rather than actual crimes (and he never left office), impeachment can still sour the public on a party. We need the Democrats in power.\n\nThe best way for Democrats to move forward to a majority is to spend at least some of their time focusing on legislation. We have been hammered by anti-middle class legislation from Trump \u2013 tax cuts for the wealthy, ill-advised trade tariffs, and corporate welfare \u2013 and we need a break. Republicans are apparently okay with the middle class paying the lion\u2019s share so that the rich can get richer and corporations that make millions in profit don\u2019t have to pay taxes. I for one am sick of it.\n\nImpeachment would be great, but it\u2019s going to be an uphill climb. First, the committees need to prove Trump\u2019s crimes. Michael Cohen has helped, but they are going to need more, if for no other reason than to convince the American public that impeachment is the best route for the wellbeing of the country. Second, they\u2019re going to need a minimum of 20 Republican senators to join them, which is its own uphill battle. Republicans have been reluctant to go against Trump, with one \u2014 Mike Rounds of South Dakota \u2014 proclaiming on CNN that he \u201csees nothing wrong\u201d with Trump paying out hush money because it shows \u201che loves his family\u201d (what a crock). This is the type of nonsense Democrats must quash to realize success. Besides, Trump is crazily tweeting that the Democrats are harassing him, and the biggest part of that tweet is \u201cThey won\u2019t get ANYTHING done for our Country!\u201d Prove him wrong.\n\nMy advice to Congresswoman Tlaib is: patience. Learn from your more experienced colleagues, who have been fighting this battle for more than two years. As the clich\u00e9 goes, anything worth having is worth waiting for. Impeachment will be a final battle for everything we stand for, for our very lives as we know them. That alone is worth the wait."

Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, who was already in jail for conspiring with a Russian spy while he was out on bail, was just sent to prison. The sentence was criminally short, and that\u2019s a whole other story, but the bottom line as far as Trump is concerned is that this whole thing exposed just how weak and vulnerable he\u2019s truly become.\n\nThis time a year ago, the average American didn\u2019t even know who Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen were. Six months ago, the average American knew that these were two of Trump\u2019s top guys, but didn\u2019t know if they were guilty of anything. Now everyone knows that Manafort and Cohen are career criminals. And in the case of Cohen, at least, they know that he was committing many of those crimes at Trump\u2019s instruction.\n\nFor Donald Trump to survive this, he would need to either come across as innocent, or come across as strong enough to overcome being guilty. Recent polling reveals that the former is impossible, as a majority of Americans now believe Trump is indeed a criminal. Trump\u2019s own actions reveal that the latter isn\u2019t going to work either. He tried every feeble and corrupt tactic in the book to try to stop this day from happening, and yet it happened anyway.\n\nOf course this is all just getting started. We\u2019re days away from people like Allen Weisselberg and Felix Sater publicly testifying about their roles in Donald Trump\u2019s crimes. They\u2019ve both previously given up their associates in order to save themselves, and they\u2019ll likely do it again. Trump couldn\u2019t stop Manafort from making him look bad by going to prison, and Trump couldn\u2019t stop Cohen from making him look bad by exposing the crimes they committed together. Trump keeps showing us that he\u2019s simply too weak to survive this."

Until it surfaced in the media a few days ago, no one even knew there was an Ivanka Trump security clearance scandal.\n\nThis means that the White House leaker made a point of bringing the existence of Ivanka\u2019s security clearance scandal to the attention of House Democrats. This is something that might well never have surfaced, if not for this leaker.\n\nIn other words, there is someone in Donald Trump\u2019s White House who really wants to take Ivanka Trump down. Maybe this leaker has a personal beef with Ivanka. Maybe the leaker is merely using Ivanka as a way of trying to get to Donald. Or maybe the leaker thinks that Ivanka is the real threat to American democracy. One way or the other, the Trump White House is now eating itself alive."

More than half of Americans believe he committed crimes before he took office, and for good reason. Public testimony alleges that Trump is guilty of bank fraud, insurance fraud and tax evasion.\n\nBut, a curious report today raises questions about the worst of the worst rumors about Donald Trump. The Miami Herald is reporting today that Donald Trump watched the Super Bowl with the founder of the spa that has been alleged to hold young Asian women against their will and force them to perform sexual acts. Yes, Donald Trump apparently watched the Super Bowl with the founder of the spa where Robert Kraft, who owns one of the teams that played in the game, allegedly paid for sex.\n\nAs a keen Palmer Report reader observed last week, Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump\u2019s favorite winter destination, is very close to the spa in question. In fact, Mar-a-Lago is only about twenty miles away. So, when news about this Florida spa that is allegedly a front for sex trafficking first broke, we knew that another one of Donald Trump\u2019s friends was charged with sex crimes. Then, we curiously discovered that Trump\u2019s favorite vacation spot is surprisingly close to the location his friend allegedly frequented to solicit illegal sex. Now we are learning that Trump knows and socializes with the founder of the spa.\n\nAre these things all coincidences? Or could all of the rumors be true \u2013 the Trump modeling agency, the Russian pee-pee tape, the allegations of rape and sex parties hosted by Jeffery Epstein? The Miami Herald is simply reporting that Donald Trump watched the Super Bowl with the founder of a day spa alleged to be a front for human sex-trafficking, but it\u2019s enough to make me rethink all of the allegations levied against Trump over the years, and his penchant for socializing with sex offenders. As Rod Rosenstein said in a speech he delivered yesterday, \u201cto know a person\u2019s character, consider his friends.\u201d"

Even as we wait to see whether or not there\u2019s evidence to prove Prince guilty of conspiring against the United States, it looks like he just nailed himself for felony perjury.\n\nIt\u2019s long been widely reported that, during the 2016 election, Erik Prince held a meeting with Arab and Israeli officials at Trump Tower. The trouble: the transcript of his 2017 testimony reveals that he lied to the House Intelligence Committee about this meeting. Now that the committee is in Democratic Party hands, it\u2019s recently turned over this and other transcripts to Robert Mueller, who is now in a position to ring up Prince for perjury. The thing is Prince basically just confessed.\n\nErik Prince just gave an interview to Al Jazeera\u2019s Mehdi Hasan, and he\u2019s now admitting that he did in fact hold the meeting. When he was asked why he lied about it to Congress, he claimed that he did tell Congress about the meeting, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if they got the transcript wrong.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t think this is a slip-up.

It sounds like Prince is going with the legal defense that he told the truth, and the transcriber was merely asleep or something. It won\u2019t work. No jury will buy this.

Donald Trump\u2019s regime is falling to pieces, and he either can\u2019t or won\u2019t plug the holes. So now what?\n\nIn addition to the other vacancies, there is currently no White House Chief of Staff, Secretary of the Interior, or U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Trump has repeatedly tried and failed to keep some of these positions staffed. For instance, depending on how you want to count it, Trump just lost his fifth or sixth White House Communications Director with today\u2019s resignation of Bill Shine. This is the same job that Anthony Scaramucci once held for eleven days. We\u2019re not even sure whether to count Jason Miller, who quit before he could even take the job.\n\nThen we have the revolving cast of characters surrounding the UN Ambassador job, with each new candidate being even less qualified than the last. And we all know that Mick Mulvaney is only the acting White House Chief of Staff because literally no one wanted the job; even Chris Christie famously turned it down. It\u2019s clear that Trump simply can\u2019t fill many of these positions, because he\u2019s become far too radioactive for anyone legitimate to want to stand anywhere near him.\n\nBut there are other positions that Donald Trump is seemingly leaving vacant on purpose. The longer he goes with an \u201cActing\u201d Secretary of Defense instead of a real one, the harder it is for Congress to do any oversight over Trump\u2019s corrupt military antics. We just watched Trump go four months with an Acting Attorney General, in the failed hope it would allow him to shut down the investigations into his criminal scandals.\n\nFrom the start, Donald Trump\u2019s personnel decisions have consisted of putting a whole lot of corrupt and incompetent people in place to do his bidding, along with trying to install just a handful of legitimate people for the sake of appearances. The few legitimate folks are all now long gone. Many of the ringers have flamed out as well.\n\nDonald Trump wasn\u2019t legitimately elected President of the United States, and at this point he\u2019s merely holding the presidency hostage as a way of trying to fend off his inevitable indictment and arrest. No legitimate person would want to work for Trump under these terms, nor would he want any legitimate person working for him. What stands out here is that, as Trump circles the drain, he seems to be even less worried about appearances than ever."

Cohen may be guilty of having over-parsed his words, but certainly not perjury. And by pushing the issue, Trump\u2019s allies were merely pushing an ugly Trump scandal to the forefront. Now Trump himself has gone and blown it entirely.\n\nIn the days since Michael Cohen\u2019s public testimony, we\u2019ve learned that Donald Trump\u2019s criminal defense attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow both allegedly dangled pardons at Cohen in an attempt at convincing him not to cooperate with prosecutors. If this evidence holds up, Giuliani and Sekulow are both going to prison for obstruction of justice. The larger question has been whether it can be proven that Trump was involved in the illegal pardon offer. Now we have something of an answer, from Trump\u2019s own mouth.\n\nTrump posted this tweet today: \u201cBad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!\u201d Oops.\n\nDonald Trump just claimed that he had a conversation directly with Michael Cohen about a pardon. This probably means Trump can be subpoenaed to testify about this supposed conversation, both by the SDNY, and by the House. Trump will surely lie about the nature of the conversation. But for all we know, Cohen secretly recorded it, as he\u2019s so often one with these matters. Trump just overplayed a bad hand and screwed himself."

This week an image began widely circulating on social media which appeared to be Donald Trump\u2019s report card from Fordham University. But is it real?\n\nOn first blush, the \u201creport card\u201d seems to fall in line with the kinds of embarrassing grades that one might expect from someone who, fifty years later, is still trying to have them suppressed. Donald Trump purportedly received a D-plus, an F, and three C-minuses in his five classes. But questions immediately surfaced about the report card\u2019s legitimacy.\n\n\n\nVarious eagle eyes on social media noted that the home address listed for Donald Trump was actually from when Trump was a toddler, not college age, and that the font used on the report card doesn\u2019t appear to have even existed back then. But the biggest concern was that no one could seem to figure out what the original source was for the report card. Our attempts at tracing its origin proved fruitless.\n\nNow Fordham University itself has released a statement on Twitter, saying \u201cThe image is a forgery, not an actual Fordham University transcript. Fordham University respects the privacy of its students and alumni, and follows federal law regarding the handling and release of academic records.\u201d The University would have no realistic reason to lie about this. Considering that the report card was already highly suspect, this statement should put the entire thing to bed. Donald Trump\u2019s grades may indeed be this bad or worse, but this particular \u201creport card\u201d is a fake."

Calling a life like Paul Manafort\u2019s \u201cblameless\u201d is easy to do if you\u2019re a Republican and the man in question is white and rich. It\u2019s like calling a white, Ivy League rapist a \u201cyouth.\u201d You only call him a thug when it\u2019s merited, e.g., when he is guilty of being brown and/or poor \u2014 and then the rapist bit becomes merely optional.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not like Manafort spent ten years as an advisor to a bunch of Ukrainian gangsters. Or it\u2019s not like when he was a lobbyist he inflated his expenses and cut his partners out of deals before getting caught and fired. It\u2019s not like he lobbied for scumbags like Ferdinand Marcos or evil entities like big tobacco or anything. It\u2019s not like he showed no remorse for the evil things he did while working for Donald Trump. Yeah, \u201cblameless.\u201d\n\nThe late Vincent Bugliosi once said that, above all, and not without good reason, society despises politicians and lawyers, so it\u2019s a crowning irony that society too often honors and respects judges, who are both. Judge Ellis gave Manafort a pass because the judge is corrupt, and he invites us to be corrupt with him, all for the low, low price of the surrender of our critical faculties and our sense of fair play. Well no thank you, judge. I, for one, intend keeping my moral bar in the high and rarefied atmosphere where it has always lived, where bigotry, white privilege and hypocrisy cannot touch it. But don\u2019t worry, judge, somebody soon is going to fix your biggest mistake."

    "text": "Donald Trump seems unusually agitated right now during his Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. His frantic Twitter explosion is usually a sign that he expects really bad news to break for him before the day is over. We\u2019ll see what ends up happening on that front. But for now, Trump\u2019s behavior at the moment is rather bizarre, even by his usual nonexistent standards.\n\nFor instance, Donald Trump just quoted some idiot named Paul Sperry six different times in the span of less than an hour. Who is this guy? His bio says he\u2019s the \u201cFormer D.C. bureau chief for Investor\u2019s Business Daily\u201d \u2013 and suffice it to say that \u201cformer\u201d is the key word there. In any case, those retweets may have just gotten Trump in some new legal trouble.\n\nPaul Sperry posted a tweet making criminal accusations against Michael Cohen\u2019s family, which is not a crime on Sperry\u2019s part, even if the accusations are unfounded. But when Donald Trump retweeted Sperry\u2019s tweet, Trump committed felony witness tampering. Cohen is an active witness in a criminal investigation into Trump, and so Trump can\u2019t do that.\n\nStrangely, Donald Trump then went on to announce that \u201cSessions didn\u2019t have a clue\u201d after Sperry posted an article revealing that former Acting Attorney General Andrew McCabe launched an investigation into his then-boss Jeff Sessions. McCabe was clearly acting properly, as Sessions recused himself from the Trump-Russia probe after getting caught committing perjury. It\u2019s unclear what Trump thinks he\u2019s proving by retweeting this, but in reality he\u2019s merely reminding everyone that Sessions, a yet-to-be-charged felon, was one of his criminal co-conspirators.\n\nIn any case here, the real upshot here is that Donald Trump is suddenly in a very, very bad mood this afternoon. Is it because of today\u2019s Miami Herald story indirectly connecting him to the infamous Florida massage parlor sex trafficking ring? Or is there some other bombshell yet to come that we don\u2019t yet know about? Stay tuned."

    "text": "After exposing Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s egregiously light 2008 sentence for trafficking in underaged girls, along with current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta\u2019s role in those plea negotiations, the Miami Herald is now reporting that Donald Trump was photographed at his Super Bowl party last month with the founder of the massage parlor chain that includes Orchids of Asia in Jupiter, FL, made famous after a human trafficking sting ensnared New England Patriots owner and Trump wingman Robert Kraft last month.\n\nThough founder Cindy Yang reportedly sold the chain in 2013, she has clearly stayed in touch with the Trump clan, as Donald Jr, Eric Trump, along with former Florida Governor and current senator Rick Scott and current Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, all posed with Yang at the West Palm Beach shindig.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Yang is no longer the owner of the business, her continued influence on its operations is unknown, and the optics are clearly awful for a president who was already attached to convicted child rapist Jeffrey Epstein via his public declaration of friendship, before apparently rewarding Acosta for going easy on Epstein by appointing Acosta to run the Labor Department. It doesn\u2019t take a supercomputer to connect the three dots from the founder of Orchids of Asia to Donald Trump to Robert Kraft. It perhaps does require incredible analytical powers to figure how a multi-billionaire like Kraft would otherwise know of a sleazy strip mall tug shop like the one he was busted at without a tip-off from the president. Did he stumble upon it on a jaunt to Buffalo Wild Wings? Or did his billionaire boys club buddy Donald \u201cknow a tremendous joint\u201d based on his relationship with Cindy Yang? What makes the most sense\u2026by a long shot?\n\nWe\u2019ll probably never know the dirty details, and neither the nihilist GOP nor Trump\u2019s self-lobotomized base cares about anything but attaching themselves to whatever Trump and Sean Hannity inform them that \u201cwinning\u201d is, thus the cheerful overreaction to Paul Manafort\u2019s pathetically soft sentence from the \u201ctough on crime\u201d set. They\u2019ll blow this off. But reporters and perhaps a House Democrat or two should ask Trump if he\u2019d be amenable to giving back the $16,000 Yang donated to his presidential campaign before gifting $42,000 to a PAC called Trump Victory in 2017.\n\nIn fact, both Rick Scott and the brazen Trump lackey Ron DeSantis have a whole lot of explaining to do/ Both their constituents and their wives are surely all ears. Maybe it\u2019s all a big coincidence and these pictures just look really, really bad in light of the big Orchids of Asia human trafficking bust? Perhaps Cindy Yang just sold a legitimate strip mall parlor chain to the wrong kind of person and was completely oblivious to what happened after. If it\u2019s not all just mad happenstance, Donald Trump, his grown sons, and his Florida flunkies should prepare to answer a lot of tough questions about their disturbing connections to human traffickers. Why does this keep happening?"

    ],
    "text": "Elizabeth Holtzman was the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives when she served on the Judiciary Committee and voted to impeach Richard Nixon. Not only that, prior to the vote she was the Committee member who was the most cogent in explaining to her colleagues why Nixon's crimes warranted impeachment. (Think about it. It's as if Alexandria Ocasio Cortez successfully brought her colleagues around to impeaching Trump!).\n\n\n\nAnd that--plus her credentials as a Harvard trained lawyer and prosecutor (Brooklyn DA)--makes this book essential to anyone who wonders if President Trump should be impeached. Essential because both the media and most Democrats (let alone Republicans) are virtually unanimous in saying that although Trump probably committed \"high crimes and misdemeanors, impeachment is the wrong way to go.\n\n\n\nHoltzman proves the opposite. Under our system it is precisely the way to go. In fact the impeachment provision in the Constitution was drafted and ratified in order to deal with eventualities like Trump. Holtzman examines everything we already know about Trump's dealings, one by one, and demonstrates that if they don't warrant impeachment nothing does. She also delves into the history of Trump's crimes (including the oft-overlooked violations of the emolument clause) and shows that not impeaching is tantamount to violating the Constitution. As for eschewing impeachment because a Senate conviction is unlikely, that is a bogus argument. Although prosecutors often pass on indicting (which is what impeachment is) because they know conviction is impossible, clear crimes against the American people and violations of the Constitution cannot be ignored because of politics (i.e. the Senate is Republican).\n\n\n\nThe book is also a good read. As a history buff, I loved the excursions back into early American history when impeachment was treated as a remedy to an elected or appointed official's overreach, not as something that should only be employed in the most extreme of cases. Of course, as Holtzman shows, Trump's crimes are the most extreme of any presidents, by far. If he isn't impeached for them, we might as well remove impeachment from the Constitution because if Trump doesn't warrant it, who could?\n\n\n\nBottom line for me: Holtzman moved me from impeachment skeptic to someone who believes that NOT impeaching this man would be a crime against the Constitution, with terrible ramifications for the future when, hard as it is to imagine, we may be faced with other Trumps or even worse.\n\n\n\nFor the record, Alexander Hamilton (and almost surely Lin Manuel Miranda!) agrees with Holtzman. He could have been writing about Trump when he said that impeachment is necessary for those offences which proceed from \"the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe society itself! And Hamilton's own Constitution.\n\n\n\nThis book is a must."

    "text": "Given the number of criminal investigations swirling around Donald Trump, talk of impeachment is inevitable. The committees charged with investigating these crimes aren\u2019t saying that \u2014 the media is. As the committees continue to sift through an incredible amount of evidence, freshman Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib has become weary of the process according to NBC News, and wants to introduce a resolution this month calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. I believe this move is a bit premature. Hear me out: I would love to see Trump removed from office sooner rather than later. However, we must all take a deep breath and look at the bigger picture. We must first, allow the process to work, and second, ensure that we get a Democratic president in 2020.\n\nAs Mitch McConnell reminds us, impeachment of President Bill Clinton backfired on them. \u201cWe impeached President Clinton and his numbers went up, ours went down and we underperformed in the national election,\u201d he shared with The Washington Post late last year. As much as it pains me, I agree with him. Even though President Clinton\u2019s impeachment was based on a moral issue rather than actual crimes (and he never left office), impeachment can still sour the public on a party. We need the Democrats in power.\n\nThe best way for Democrats to move forward to a majority is to spend at least some of their time focusing on legislation. We have been hammered by anti-middle class legislation from Trump \u2013 tax cuts for the wealthy, ill-advised trade tariffs, and corporate welfare \u2013 and we need a break. Republicans are apparently okay with the middle class paying the lion\u2019s share so that the rich can get richer and corporations that make millions in profit don\u2019t have to pay taxes. I for one am sick of it.\n\nImpeachment would be great, but it\u2019s going to be an uphill climb. First, the committees need to prove Trump\u2019s crimes. Michael Cohen has helped, but they are going to need more, if for no other reason than to convince the American public that impeachment is the best route for the wellbeing of the country. Second, they\u2019re going to need a minimum of 20 Republican senators to join them, which is its own uphill battle. Republicans have been reluctant to go against Trump, with one \u2014 Mike Rounds of South Dakota \u2014 proclaiming on CNN that he \u201csees nothing wrong\u201d with Trump paying out hush money because it shows \u201che loves his family\u201d (what a crock). This is the type of nonsense Democrats must quash to realize success. Besides, Trump is crazily tweeting that the Democrats are harassing him, and the biggest part of that tweet is \u201cThey won\u2019t get ANYTHING done for our Country!\u201d Prove him wrong.\n\nMy advice to Congresswoman Tlaib is: patience. Learn from your more experienced colleagues, who have been fighting this battle for more than two years. As the clich\u00e9 goes, anything worth having is worth waiting for. Impeachment will be a final battle for everything we stand for, for our very lives as we know them. That alone is worth the wait."

He\u2019s taking a new job with Trump\u2019s phantom \u201c2020 reelection campaign\u201d which only really exists as a fundraising embezzlement front; the bottom line is that Shine is out. The timing speaks volumes \u2013 and he\u2019s not the only key Trump person to jump ship today.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s FEMA Director Brock Long is exiting the building today, after resigning amid scandal. We\u2019re expecting another shoe to drop on this front, because Long\u2019s one known scandal merely involves misuse of a government car, and pales in comparison to some of the corruption scandals that Trump\u2019s other people haven\u2019t resigned for. There is also another big exit today.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, who was leading the charge on Trump\u2019s imaginary Space Force, is also abruptly resigning. People come and go in an administration, but when you add Wilson\u2019s departure to Shine\u2019s departure and Long\u2019s departure, particularly within the context of other recent departures and embarrassing longstanding vacancies, it\u2019s clear Trump is having trouble finding and keeping people who want to work for his sinking ship.\n\nIt\u2019s the Bill Shine resignation that stands out the most today. He\u2019s a former Fox News executive who was infamously involved in trying to cover up Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sexual harassment scandal. Just days after the New Yorker expose on the corrupt relationship between Fox News and Donald Trump, suddenly Shine is bailing. This doesn\u2019t feel like a coincidence. It makes us wonder if there\u2019s another shoe to drop on this front as well."

As he tweeted this morning, it \u201cloudly\u201d shows the world that there was \u201cNO COLLUSION with Russia.\u201d Who is he fooling? Trump has always been obsessed with winning, but the bigger picture reveals something about his recent wins that he and his allies should find foreboding. Trump\u2019s presidency has reached a point where his wins are looking more like lipstick on a pig.\n\nJudge T.S. Ellis\u2019s sentencing of Paul Manafort to only 47 months in prison, including time served, is an upset. Four years is an insanely far cry from the 19-24 years recommended under the guidelines. Plus, the judge\u2019s praise for Manafort\u2019s \u201cotherwise blameless life\u201d makes you wonder if he was confusing him with some other defendant. Donald Trump wants us to think that this prosecutorial setback is a sign that he is winning bigly, but reasonable minds know better.\n\nPaul Manafort was no less important a person to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign than its manager. Already, Manafort has been tried and convicted of multiple criminal charges, and he has spent the last nine months in solitary confinement. He still faces another sentencing with Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who could tack on a decade more of prison time. Even a presidential pardon is not likely to help him. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office is preparing state charges that could keep Manafort behind bars no matter what Trump does, according to reporting from The New York Times.\n\nWithout true victories, Trump is resorting to picking through scraps in a growing garbage heap of bad news, then clumsily repackaging them as tremendous wins. Trump\u2019s failed second summit with Kim Jong Un? A win in his mind because he had the wisdom to walk away. Trump\u2019s shutdown over a failed border wall? A win in his mind because he drew attention to an important issue. This first Manafort sentencing is a disappointing development, no doubt. But the fact that it is the sort of thing that passes for a Trump \u201cwin\u201d these days is a sign that truth, justice, and decency may be starting to get the upper hand."

Manafort still has yet to be sentenced in his other federal trial next week, where another decade or more will be tacked on. New York State will tack on even more years. That\u2019s before getting to whether Mueller re-files the ten deadlocked federal charges. Manafort is 69 years old. He\u2019s almost certainly going to die in prison. That makes Manafort the first criminal co-conspirator in the Trump-Russia election rigging scandal to be handed this particularly dark fate. But he won\u2019t be the only one.\n\nMichael Cohen is only going to prison for three years. He got lucky. He\u2019s led a life of crime, but he managed to steer clear of the election rigging plot that\u2019s going to effectively end a number of lives. Michael Flynn got lucky as well. He committed treason or its statutory equivalent, yet because he happened to have evidence to take everyone else down, and he was the very first to flip, he\u2019s getting off with a slap on the wrist. But that\u2019s where the leniency ends.\n\nDonald Trump Jr, who committed espionage, and who appears to have his hand in an endless number of money laundering, insurance fraud, and bank fraud schemes, could easily end up with an even longer prison sentence than Paul Manafort. Junior is 41 years old. Maybe he\u2019ll get out someday. Jared Kushner\u2019s entire real estate empire is one alleged criminal scheme, and he stands accused of selling U.S. classified secrets to foreign governments. If he\u2019s convicted on all of it, he could conceivably go to prison for the rest of his life. But these aren\u2019t the people who have to worry the most.\n\nRoger Stone is 66 years old. He\u2019s been hit with seven felony charges thus far, with seemingly dozens more coming. The evidence against him is overwhelming. If he doesn\u2019t cut a plea deal, he\u2019ll likely die in prison. Jeff Sessions is 72 years old. If he sees any prison time at all for his perjury and his conspiracy with the Russians, he\u2019ll probably never get out. The same goes for 74 year old Rudy Giuliani. This is all rather morbid, but the reality is that these people participated in a treason plot, stole the election, and hijacked the United States government. They\u2019re no different than any other terrorists who have attacked the United States.\n\nBy the way, if you haven\u2019t figured it out by now, there are no magic pardons. There\u2019s a reason Donald Trump has disingenuously dangled pardons at his underlings, but never intended to go through with it. State level charges alone ensure that federal pardons won\u2019t get anyone off the hook. And that\u2019s before getting to questions of whether an attempted federal pardon of an alleged co-conspirator would be struck down by the courts.\n\nReally, there\u2019s one person who has to worry the most: Donald Trump himself. He\u2019s committed roughly all the same crimes that Paul Manafort has committed, along with all the crimes that Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner stand accused of committing, and then some. The minute Trump is no longer in office, he\u2019ll be arrested and charged with dozens if not hundreds of felonies. The evidence is beyond overwhelming. Unless he cuts a resignation deal soon in exchange for reduced criminal charges, Donald Trump will die in prison."

It has the whiff of betrayal, or at least weakness, considering that what Americans voted for in large part last November is oversight into everyone involved with Trump\u2019s prolific lawbreaking. Doesn\u2019t that prove that investigating Trump and his family is exactly what we voted for, and thus your job?\n\nThe thing to consider is what effect a public statement like this might have, along with its timing. On the Mueller investigation or state-level pursuits in New York, where prosecutors are hot on the heels of the Trump Organization? This has no bearing at all. On the majority of us who are impatient for justice? Well, it\u2019s certainly frustrating on its surface, but does anyone really think this will have a material effect on the outcome of any investigation? It makes no sense that it would, especially considering that Connolly acknowledged that the House may have no choice but to haul in a few tainted Trump offspring sometime down the line, depending on what comes to light. Considering the warp speed at which damning evidence is dropping from several angles, that schedule should accelerate in turn.\n\nHouse Dems are best viewed as the political apparatus in this wide-ranging investigative operation. Their own investigative function is also crucial, but managing potential fallout from aggressive maneuvering against the president\u2019s children, taking pressure off Mueller, is equally important. The most likely strategic reason for bothering with a public statement like this \u2013 besides the point that it\u2019s still a legislator\u2019s responsibility, in theory, to truthfully inform the republic about what they\u2019re doing and why \u2013 is that it could lull a dope like Junior into a false sense of security, enabling him to tweet away that the libs stand in awe of his powers and his killer neckbeard, while possibly incriminating himself among the lolz.\n\nLet him get comfy. One person who has no compunction about going after the family is Mueller, who did just that when he led the Enron investigation and busted Enron CFO Andrew Fastow\u2019s wife for tax evasion on the way to a felony conviction of the CEO. With House Dems managing the politics, Mueller is in a much better position to take down another CEO, a.k.a. Individual-1, by leveraging Individual-2 ruthlessly."

    "text": "Some judges make sentences larger than the sentencing guidelines, and one judge in particular makes them smaller \u2013 Senior U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis. Ellis, an extremely conservative judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan, is an erratic sentencer, often not following the guidelines at all.\n\nOn Thursday, he sentenced Paul Manafort to a forty-seven-month sentence, asserting that the defendant, someone who has been engaged in all kinds of crimes for most of his adult life, \u201chas lived an otherwise blameless life.\u201d The guidelines suggested a sentence in the 19 to 24 year range, and many are surprised by the extremely low sentence. Reportedly, Manafort\u2019s attorneys argued for the low end of the spectrum, 5.5 to 6.5 years.\n\nMake no mistake, Ellis knows how to throw kitchen sinks at defendants. One need only ask former Democratic Congressman William J. Jefferson about how harshly Ellis can sentence people. Jefferson, a black man, was convicted of bribery after a corruption investigation. Ellis was the sentencing judge, and sentenced Jefferson to 13 years in prison for his crimes.\n\nIn the Manafort case, Ellis found the guidelines excessive, and as many have noted, dropping so severely below them is highly unusual and questionable. In addition, Ellis, despite having a defendant before him who had pleaded guilty or was found guilty of tons of charges, noted that Manafort was \u201cnot before this court for anything having to do with collusion with the Russian government to influence this election.\u201d\n\nManafort is not finished yet. He faces sentencing for conspiracy charges by Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who will decide if the sentences run consecutively or concurrently. We shall see what Judge Jackson does with this and how her sentence comes out.\n\nAn excellent book written in 2017 by Jesse Eisinger, \u201cThe Chickenshit Club: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosecute Executives,\u201d describes why prosecutors are too \u201cchickenshit\u201d to try to bring white collar executives to justice. This latest sentence supports the notion: prosecutors have trouble obtaining convictions of these executives with courts and judges often considering the crimes committed to have been victimless and don\u2019t see the defendants as dangerous or true criminals, and look not to the content of their character but to the color of their skin and wallets. Today\u2019s sentence is an open invite for white collar criminals to continue fleecing the public with impunity."

    "text": "Some judges make sentences larger than the sentencing guidelines, and one judge in particular makes them smaller \u2013 Senior U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis. Ellis, an extremely conservative judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan, is an erratic sentencer, often not following the guidelines at all.\n\nOn Thursday, he sentenced Paul Manafort to a forty-seven-month sentence, asserting that the defendant, someone who has been engaged in all kinds of crimes for most of his adult life, \u201chas lived an otherwise blameless life.\u201d The guidelines suggested a sentence in the 19 to 24 year range, and many are surprised by the extremely low sentence. Reportedly, Manafort\u2019s attorneys argued for the low end of the spectrum, 5.5 to 6.5 years.\n\nMake no mistake, Ellis knows how to throw kitchen sinks at defendants. One need only ask former Democratic Congressman William J. Jefferson about how harshly Ellis can sentence people. Jefferson, a black man, was convicted of bribery after a corruption investigation. Ellis was the sentencing judge, and sentenced Jefferson to 13 years in prison for his crimes.\n\nIn the Manafort case, Ellis found the guidelines excessive, and as many have noted, dropping so severely below them is highly unusual and questionable. In addition, Ellis, despite having a defendant before him who had pleaded guilty or was found guilty of tons of charges, noted that Manafort was \u201cnot before this court for anything having to do with collusion with the Russian government to influence this election.\u201d\n\nManafort is not finished yet. He faces sentencing for conspiracy charges by Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who will decide if the sentences run consecutively or concurrently. We shall see what Judge Jackson does with this and how her sentence comes out.\n\nAn excellent book written in 2017 by Jesse Eisinger, \u201cThe Chickenshit Club: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosecute Executives,\u201d describes why prosecutors are too \u201cchickenshit\u201d to try to bring white collar executives to justice. This latest sentence supports the notion: prosecutors have trouble obtaining convictions of these executives with courts and judges often considering the crimes committed to have been victimless and don\u2019t see the defendants as dangerous or true criminals, and look not to the content of their character but to the color of their skin and wallets. Today\u2019s sentence is an open invite for white collar criminals to continue fleecing the public with impunity."

    "title": "The Asian spa founder who joined Trump\u2019s MAGA movement",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Seated at a round table littered with party favors and the paper-cutout footballs that have become tradition at his annual Super Bowl Watch Party, President Donald Trump cheered the New England Patriots and his longtime friend, team owner Robert Kraft, to victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Feb. 3.\n\nSometime during the party at Trump\u2019s West Palm Beach country club, the president turned in his chair to look over his right shoulder, smiling for a photo with two women at a table behind him.\n\nThe woman who snapped the blurry Super Bowl selfie with the president was Li Yang, 45, a self-made entrepreneur from China who started a chain of Asian day spas in South Florida. Over the years, these establishments \u2014 many of which operate under the name Tokyo Day Spas \u2014 have gained a reputation for offering sexual services.\n\nNineteen days after Trump and Yang posed together while rooting for the Patriots, authorities would charge Kraft with soliciting prostitution at a spa in Jupiter that Yang had founded more than a decade earlier.\n\nYang says she had long since sold Orchids of Asia Day Spa, the massage parlor where authorities say they caught Kraft on camera paying for oral sex the morning of the Jan. 20 AFC Championship game \u2014 his second visit in 24 hours. (Kraft has denied breaking the law.) Yang, who goes by Cindy, was not charged in the multi-agency anti-human-trafficking operation last month that shut down 10 Asian day spas in Florida, none of which are registered to her or her family.\n\nThe Kraft bust brought global attention to the proliferation of Asian day spas across the country, some of which are thinly disguised houses of prostitution \u2014 and experts say could be engaged in human trafficking to fill demand.\n\nYang\u2019s family still owns several South Florida spas. The family\u2019s Tokyo Day Spa branches have attracted the attention of at least two local police agencies over allegations of prostitution, and are discussed online as places where men can pay for sexual extras.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just wanting to get a \u2018rub and tug,\u2019 this might be one of the best places in West Palm Beach,\u201d one Internet commenter wrote about a Tokyo Day Spas\u2019 parlor. A massage therapist at a different location informed police in late 2016 that some employees at the parlor were selling sex and said management encouraged the behavior.\n\nCindy Yang poses with President Donald Trump at a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago on March 2, 2018. She received a signed photograph. A flier for the event advertised a \u201creception, photo and two seats for a dinner with President Trump\u201d for a donation of $50,000.\n\nIn a brief phone interview, Yang said she and her family have never broken the law, but did not answer questions about whether she knew of the allegations that therapists in her spas were offering sex. She added that she was out of the business, would soon be moving to Washington, D.C., and didn\u2019t want any negative press.\n\nBefore the 2016 general election, Yang offered no evidence of political engagement. She hadn\u2019t voted in 10 years, records showed. But she has now become a fixture at Republican political events up and down the East Coast. Her Facebook is covered in photos of herself standing with President Trump, his two sons, Eric and Donald Jr., Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Sen. Rick Scott, Sarah Palin, the president\u2019s campaign manager and an assortment of other high-level Republican operators she has met at charity events, political fundraisers and galas, many of which require hefty donations to attend. She sometimes carries a rhinestone encrusted MAGA clutch purse.\n\nFuture Florida governor Ron DeSantis, center, attended a pro-Israel gala at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 25, 2018. The event was also attended by Cindy Yang, far left. Tickets cost $1,000 per person, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.\n\nYang has shown considerable political largesse. Since 2017, she and her close relatives have contributed more than $42,000 to Trump Victory, a political action committee, and more than $16,000 to the president\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn February 2018, Yang was invited by the White House to participate in an event hosted by the Asian American and Pacific Islander Initiative, an advisory commission Trump established by executive order the year before. Later in the year, she attended at least two more AAPI events in Washington, D.C., according to her Facebook page.\n\nThe White House, the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHangers-on\n\nAs some established political elites have distanced themselves from the president, a new group of people is filling open seats at political events.\n\nSome are businessmen like Kraft who have always been influential because of their wealth but under Trump have gained added political status. (Months before the bust, Trump thanked Kraft for his role in a major international success: Clinching the 2026 World Cup for North America.)\n\nOthers in the Trump orbit are political novices like Yang, who came to the United States roughly 20 years ago.\n\nIn 2007, Yang started what would become a large chain of Tokyo Day Spas.\n\nCindy Yang and her family members operate the Tokyo Day Spa & Massages parlor, as well as a nail salon, at a strip mall in Palm Beach Gardens. It is part of a chain of spas the family controls. Sarah Blaskey sblaskey@MiamiHerald.com\n\nThe first to open was her flagship, which is still in business and run by her husband, Zubin Gong, in Palm Beach Gardens.\n\nThe next was a Tokyo Day Spa in Jupiter that would later become Orchids of Asia after Yang sold it to another businesswoman, Hua Zhang, around 2013. Zhang, who was charged in February with racketeering and running a house of prostitution and has pleaded not guilty, declined to comment when contacted at her Martin County home.\n\nOnline reviews from prior to 2013 suggest sex was for sale at the Tokyo Day Spa Jupiter location even before it became Orchids of Asia. Although the name and ownership of the location have changed, the decor has not. A photo from a Tokyo Day Spa Yelp review shows the same couch, the same wall hanging and the same faux plant as now.\n\n\u201cUsed to be known as Tokyo Day Spa and Massage \u2014 most of the same girls still work there,\u201d a Yelp reviewer wrote of Orchids of Asia in 2013.\n\nOver the past decade, Yang and her family members have opened at least six locations across Palm Beach and Broward counties, including a massage school established in 2011 and several nail salons. In at least three cases, online classifieds written in Chinese indicate Yang opened the spas and then flipped them, advertising sale prices ranging from $55,000 to $88,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganized networks of massage parlors offering sex are common, according to Bradley Myles, CEO of Polaris Project, a nonprofit dedicated to ending human trafficking in the sex work industry. The parlors have licenses, allowing them to operate the illicit part of their businesses behind a smokescreen of legitimacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving a school associated with several locations that are engaged in illicit massage business \u2014 It\u2019s one more way of appearing legitimate,\u201d Myles said, commenting generally rather than specifically on Tokyo Day Spas. He said the owners of such chains often use schools to recruit and groom women to work in their parlors, even giving them the answers to the licensing exams ahead of time if they are good candidates for sex work.\n\nNationally, the illicit massage industry is worth over $2.5 billion, according to Polaris.\n\nYang also owns several residential properties around South Florida, including a tiny $240,000 condo on Miami\u2019s waterfront. She built her success on hard work and long hours, according to an online profile of Yang that was posted on dondonsex.com. The site also features classified ads for erotic massage services. It\u2019s unclear who posted Yang\u2019s profile there or why.\n\nSex for sale\n\nWhen a female massage therapist started finding used condoms in the trash at one of Yang\u2019s Tokyo Day Spas, she became concerned that the parlor was not what it seemed.\n\nThe woman, who spoke only Mandarin, asked an English-speaking relative to call police after she heard the sounds of sex coming from several private massage rooms. Her tip led a police vice squad to begin surveilling the parlor from a van parked outside, the woman told the Miami Herald in an interview. Cops hidden in the vehicle took photographs of the people coming and going. The woman said she went undercover, snapping pictures of receipts when no one was looking. After the trash was taken outside, she would call her relative, who would then ring up the cops.\n\n\u201cThere should be some condoms out back,\u201d the relative would report.\n\nThe woman, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, slept on a massage bed in a back room during her time at the spa. She cooked on a hotplate.\n\nCindy Yang poses with Sarah Palin.\n\nOn one occasion, the former therapist was giving a customer a massage when he exposed himself and demanded oral sex. She said she ran from the room crying. A manager was angry that the customer had been treated \u201cbadly,\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot hurt the customers\u2019 feelings,\u201d the manager later said at a staff meeting, according to the woman.\n\nNo charges appear to have been brought as a result of the investigation. The Herald reviewed documents related to the case but is not naming the police department in order to preserve the woman\u2019s anonymity.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only Tokyo Day Spa location where sex was allegedly available.\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2014, a man called the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office. He had gone to Tokyo Day Spas branch in Royal Palm Beach, where a therapist touched him in an \u201cinappropriate genital area\u201d and continued to do so even after he said no, according to a police report.\n\nSix spas within the Tokyo Day Spas chain show up on online forums like rubmaps.com and adultsearch.com, which are crowd-sourced review sites where users point each other to spas where sex is offered.\n\nFalse positives on those sites are unlikely, according to the Polaris Project.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the guys have any interest in claiming a place was something it\u2019s not,\u201d Myles from Polaris said. \u201cThe guys have an interest in [identifying] where you really can buy sex.\u201d\n\nOnline ads on obscure websites also raise flags about Yang\u2019s businesses. In an ad written in Chinese recruiting masseuses, Yang stated that anyone over the age of 45 need not apply. Phone numbers associated with members of the Yang family are connected to various apparently old online advertisements for more explicit sex services. One advertises a masseuse who makes hotel visits.\n\nIn a 2016 Yelp review of the Tokyo Day Spa in Palm Beach Gardens, a woman wrote that her husband went in for a 15-minute, $40 massage, but was offered unwanted sexual favors instead.\n\n\u201cStay far away unless you\u2019re into that kind of thing,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn a reply to the review, the business posted an apology from someone identified as \u201cCindy Y.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are very sorry to hear what happened to your husband,\u201d Cindy Y. wrote. \u201cWe do not offer those kinds of service[s] and we will do everything necessary to make sure this does not happen again.\u201d\n\nCindy Yang appears with Donald Trump Jr. at a Mar-a-Lago gala in late 2018.\n\nOn rubmaps.com, one comment warns that \u201cyour mileage may vary\u201d at Tokyo Day Spas, meaning sex may not be available depending on the therapist.\n\n\u201cBeen here many times, some play, some don\u2019t,\u201d a man wrote in 2016.\n\nBut others raved.\n\n\u201cI had one of those toe curling experiences,\u201d a reviewer said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical awakening\n\nAround three years ago, Yang announced that she was pursuing a \u201cnew life\u201d in a series of Facebook posts.\n\nHer portfolio broadened to include an investment consulting business, a travel agency and a charity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charity, founded in 2015 under the name Overseas International Female Organization, was originally intended to promote cultural exchanges for women, according to its mission statement. A few months later, the name was changed to Women\u2019s Charity Foundation. The foundation once hosted a beauty pageant at the luxury Biltmore Hotel featuring young women brought in by \u201centertainment companies,\u201d according to one of the event\u2019s co-sponsors, Li Yun, who told the Miami Herald the event was \u201cembarrassing,\u201d \u201cunsuccessful\u201d and \u201cdisorganized.\u201d The nonprofit doesn\u2019t appear in a database of active Florida charities.\n\nAt the very end of 2015, Yang began donating small amounts of money to Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign. In 2016, Yang posted Facebook photos from a Republican women\u2019s event in South Florida with the caption: \u201cThe new life will start.\u201d\n\nAround that time, she appears to have pulled her name from the official business records related to Tokyo Day Spas, though her husband still manages at least one of the spas and other companies are now under her parents\u2019 names. Recently, one of her businesses, now listed in her mother\u2019s name, declared bankruptcy, listing more than $150,000 of debt.\n\nCindy Yang posted a photo of herself with U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz at an event at President Donald Trump\u2019s golf club in Jupiter during the summer of 2018.\n\nWhen Donald Trump became a serious candidate for president, politics began to dominate her social media presence.\n\nIn January 2017, she was in the crowd at Trump\u2019s inauguration in Washington, D.C. Later that year, she snapped a photo with Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway. In December, she attended her first elite event at President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago, a poolside steak lunch.\n\nIn September 2018, Yang received a personalized note from the president and first lady. It read: \u201cThank you for your friendship and dedication to our cause. Leaders like you in Florida are the key to fulfilling our bold agenda to Make America Great Again!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYang told the Miami Herald she doesn\u2019t know the president personally, and that she doesn\u2019t work for him, other than to volunteer for campaign events.\n\n\u201cI just come to some events. There\u2019s nothing special,\u201d Yang said. Although she has claimed online to be a member of Trump clubs, she told the Herald she does not in fact belong to any.\n\nYang opened an investment consulting firm in 2017 targeting Chinese businesses hoping to expand to U.S. markets. The website advertises her new political connections, and promises her clients pictures with the president and other high-level members of his administration. Much of its website showcases photographs of her own encounters with the Trump family and other high-profile conservatives.\n\nCindy Yang posed with Eric Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2019.\n\nOver the past two years, Yang has racked up a who\u2019s who of photos with politicians at more than a dozen political events. She has enough pictures of the president\u2019s private clubs to fill an album.\n\nIn 2018, she attended a Safari Night at Mar-a-Lago hosted by the president\u2019s sister, Elizabeth Trump Grau, as well as the White House\u2019s celebration of the Lunar New Year at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She took photos with Florida\u2019s soon-to-be-governor, Ron DeSantis, at a pro-Israel gala held at Mar-a-Lago, met U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao in Washington, D.C., and posed with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, U.S. Rep Matt Gaetz and former Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. She also posted a photograph of herself with DeSantis at a restaurant, saying she was having \u201cbrunch this morning with Florida\u2019s next Governor.\u201d\n\nShe was photographed with Donald Trump Jr. at a winter Mar-a-Lago gala for Turning Points USA, the conservative college organization, and met Eric Trump last month.\n\nIn January, she attended the Sunshine Ball in Washington, D.C., hosted by Rick Scott, snagging a photo with the newly elected senator.\n\nShe has also posted photos of herself meeting conservative celebrities, including former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, onetime Trump administration adviser Sebastian Gorka, Fox News host Jesse Watters, commentator Dan Bongino and actor Jon Voight.\n\nCindy Yang attended Sen. Rick Scott\u2019s Sunshine Ball in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 8. The event asked $25,000 for a photo opportunity with Scott.\n\nHer Super Bowl selfie with Trump was captioned: \u201cWe love our president.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what level of scrutiny she was subjected to in order to get that close to Trump.\n\nAnyone \u201cexpected to be within close proximity to the president for a planned purpose\u201d at Mar-a-Lago must go through an \u201cenhanced background check\u201d by the Secret Service and other federal agencies, according to a January report by the Government Accountability Office.\n\nNo one contacted by the Herald said they recognized Yang.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Stewart, deputy chief of staff for Mast, said the Republican congressman \u201cdoesn\u2019t know Yang or remember meeting her\u201d at the Palm Beach GOP Lincoln Day Dinner at Mar-a-Lago on March 16, 2018.\n\nChris Hartline, Rick Scott\u2019s communications director, said the senator had \u201cmet literally hundreds of thousands of people over his eight years as governor. He doesn\u2019t know this woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a strong advocate for the Jewish people and the state of Israel, then Congressman Ron DeSantis and now Governor DeSantis attended many pro-Israeli events,\u201d Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, DeSantis\u2019 communications director, said. \u201cThe Governor frequently appears in photos with many guests at these events. Governor DeSantis does not know or have any connection to Cindy Yang.\u201d\n\nGaetz was photographed with Yang at a DeSantis campaign rally in the summer of 2018, according to spokeswoman Jillian Lane Wyant. The event was open to the public.\n\n\u201cCongressman Gaetz took hundreds of selfies at this event and takes thousands through the year without vetting people,\u201d Wyant said. \u201cHe has never set foot in any of Ms. Yang\u2019s day spas or properties.\u201d"

    "text": "In the end, not only was Donald Trump unable to save Paul Manafort, he was unable to save face for himself. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, who was already in jail for conspiring with a Russian spy while he was out on bail, was just sent to prison. The sentence was criminally short, and that\u2019s a whole other story, but the bottom line as far as Trump is concerned is that this whole thing exposed just how weak and vulnerable he\u2019s truly become.\n\nThis time a year ago, the average American didn\u2019t even know who Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen were. Six months ago, the average American knew that these were two of Trump\u2019s top guys, but didn\u2019t know if they were guilty of anything. Now everyone knows that Manafort and Cohen are career criminals. And in the case of Cohen, at least, they know that he was committing many of those crimes at Trump\u2019s instruction.\n\nFor Donald Trump to survive this, he would need to either come across as innocent, or come across as strong enough to overcome being guilty. Recent polling reveals that the former is impossible, as a majority of Americans now believe Trump is indeed a criminal. Trump\u2019s own actions reveal that the latter isn\u2019t going to work either. He tried every feeble and corrupt tactic in the book to try to stop this day from happening, and yet it happened anyway.\n\nOf course this is all just getting started. We\u2019re days away from people like Allen Weisselberg and Felix Sater publicly testifying about their roles in Donald Trump\u2019s crimes. They\u2019ve both previously given up their associates in order to save themselves, and they\u2019ll likely do it again. Trump couldn\u2019t stop Manafort from making him look bad by going to prison, and Trump couldn\u2019t stop Cohen from making him look bad by exposing the crimes they committed together. Trump keeps showing us that he\u2019s simply too weak to survive this."

The junior Senator from North Carolina made headlines last week when he said he would vote for legislation to block Trump\u2019s national emergency. Though he hails from a purple state that Donald Trump only won by four points in 2016, he has been a staunch Trumper over the past two years, so he\u2019s not of the same category as Sen. Susan Collins of Maine who has to show she can flip flop on Trump when it suits her, if she wants to appeal to any voters back home.\n\nHowever, Tillis hasn\u2019t gotten a great reception at home for his decision, which he defends as entrusting too much power to the executive branch. North Carolina Republican activists have called for a primary challenger to replace him in 2020. So far, no Republicans have shown any interest \u2013 not necessarily because they agree with Tillis, but possibly because incumbents are difficult to primary, and they don\u2019t know what the political battleground will look like in a year, particularly after Republicans lost their supermajority in the state legislature in 2018.\n\nThis is noteworthy because while the vote to revoke the national emergency is set for next week, it is expected to pass in the Senate. The only question now is how many Republicans will join and vote with the Democrats. Sen. Rand Paul, who has a reputation for being a Trump sycophant, has come out against it and predicts that as many as ten Republican Senators could vote against it. We know that at least seven of them are holding out for sure. The other notorious Trump sycophant in the Senate, Lindsey Graham, has cautioned fellow senators from voting against it, saying that Donald Trump will back their primary challengers \u2013 but few, if any of them, are listening.\n\nThe GOP Congress fell lockstep behind Donald Trump rather quickly \u2013 seeing that if nothing else, he\u2019d autograph whatever unpopular legislation they wanted to pass and nominate conservative federal judges. Now, the honeymoon seems to be ending, as the party unravels."

The prodigal son has seen the error of his ways and returned to the embrace of the human family for redemption and forgiveness.\n\nNot so fast, General. We have the right to remember certain things. For example, we have the right to recall your disgraceful treatment of Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, who was present in the car when your idiot, hamfisted boss phoned the grieving widow of a slain US soldier and made hideously inappropriate remarks of misfired \u201ccondolences.\u201d\n\nWe have the right to recall the lie you invented about a perfectly innocent speech made by the Congresswoman \u2013 an African American woman whom you characterized as \u201cthe empty barrel that makes the most noise\u201d \u2013 in which you lied and said she inappropriately claimed credit for securing federal funding for an FBI building in her district, a lie that is directly and immediately contradicted by a video of that event.\n\nWe have the right to remember when you said the American Civil War was caused by \u201cthe lack of ability to compromise,\u201d and when you described Robert E Lee as an \u201chonorable man.\u201d We have the right to remember when you disparaged potential DACA signatories, some of whom were too frightened to sign up, as \u201ctoo lazy to get off their asses.\u201d\n\nWe have the right to remember when you promoted serial wife abuser Rob Porter despite knowing full well Porter had a protection orders from both ex-wives for domestic abuse.

Had he lost the 2016 election, he was prepared to drag the American people through a long and tedious demand for a recount.

Trump will have the full power of the Presidency in a lame duck period, and, as Michael Cohen ominously warned, \u201c\u2026 given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power.\u201d\n\nGiven the apparent plans of the Trump criminal gang, the need to eject the \u201cpresident\u201d from office before the 2020 election concludes is an urgent priority. If Trump\u2019s history as a \u201cbusinessman\u201d has taught us anything, it has demonstrated time and time again that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t merely dislike losing, he refuses even to acknowledge it."

But here\u2019s the thing: this doesn\u2019t mean that Donald Trump and his gang of criminals are now somehow winning.

    "text": "Michael Cohen has spent the past week dishing on Donald Trump\u2019s crimes to various congressional committees, producing evidence to support much of his claims, and in the process setting off everything from massive document requests to an insurance scam investigation. Now Cohen has just stuck yet another dagger in Trump, though it\u2019s of a different kind.\n\nMichael Cohen just filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump in New York court. Cohen is alleging that he and Trump had an agreement in which Trump would pay the entirety of Cohen\u2019s legal fees, but that Trump stopped paying the minute he heard Cohen might flip. Cohen appears to be taking the position that Trump was legally required to continue paying Cohen\u2019s legal fees right up until the moment when Cohen severed their joint defense agreement and cut a deal. This could be a bigger deal for all involved than one might think.\n\nSure, on the surface, it\u2019s a cash grab on Cohen\u2019s part. The legal fees in question probably add up to a few million dollars, and since Trump does appear to be legally liable, Cohen figures he might as well lay his claim to it. But this lawsuit will go through a discovery process that could force even more incriminating evidence against Trump to come to the surface. In fact this is roughly the same strategy that Stormy Daniels used against Cohen, and her lawsuit indirectly led to Cohen going to prison.\n\nIf Donald Trump were smart, he\u2019d just pay Michael Cohen to go away, before this saga can do any more legal damage to him. But as we keep seeing, Trump isn\u2019t dealing with any of this in a smart way. He\u2019ll likely try to fight Cohen to the bitter end, even if the civil litigation ends up putting Trump in increased criminal jeopardy."

Trump\u2019s FDA Commissioner just announced he\u2019s leaving. Matthew Whitaker just quit the brand new job Trump gave him at the DOJ. Now Ben Carson is in on the action, but true to form, he\u2019s doing it in a way that no one even understands.\n\nBen Carson now says that he\u2019s resigning as Donald Trump\u2019s HUD Secretary, effective at the end of the current term. That\u2019s right, Carson announced his resignation nearly two years in advance. Why? No one knows, really. Does Carson really think Trump needs twenty-two months advance notice to find a new HUD Secretary who\u2019s equally unqualified for the job? Does Carson think this gets him off the hook for Trump\u2019s crimes?\n\nBen Carson is a guy who once falsely claimed that he stabbed his friend with a knife, and who once asserted that Joseph from the Bible built the Egyptian Pyramids to store grain. This is not a man whose words or actions make sense. But even Carson, in his own weird and incomprehensible way, seems to be trying to join the rats who are fleeing Trump\u2019s ship.\n\nThere\u2019s still one big unanswered question. Back when Donald Trump was first illegitimately named the winner of the election, he publicly and repeatedly insisted that Ben Carson become his HUD Secretary. Carson kept saying \u201cno\u201d for obvious reasons: it would have been far easier for Carson to continue his grifting ways out on the book and lecture circuit if he didn\u2019t have the restraints of holding a cabinet position. But in the end, Carson took the job. Just how did Trump \u201cconvince\u201d him to do it? Perhaps Carson will fess up one day about whatever blackmail material Trump must be holding over him."

Brennan appeared on MSNBC this week and said that while he doesn\u2019t have inside knowledge, he thinks there\u2019s a good chance indictments are coming tomorrow.\n\nJohn Brennan\u2019s reasoning: even the more conservative of projections have suggested that Robert Mueller may be looking to file his final report by mid-March. Brennan thinks that Mueller will unseal a slew of indictments, and arrest a horde of people accordingly, just as he\u2019s filing his report. Mueller usually likes to bust people on Fridays. He might only have tomorrow and next Friday to choose from, and Brennan doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll be the latter, because busting a bunch of people on the Ides of March would be too on the nose.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming or when. But at the least, John Brennan\u2019s logic is sound, and he\u2019s consistently proven that he has an instinct for how these things work. If he\u2019s right, tomorrow will be full of Robert Mueller fireworks. And if he\u2019s not right, those fireworks are coming soon enough. Whenever Mueller is done, he won\u2019t be ending quietly."

While there\u2019s still a lot to investigate and prosecute, the reasons why this may be the case are building.\n\nFirst of all, there are indictments waiting for Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner. There can be no doubt of this because as Don Jr. would say in his illiterate and since-deleted Tweet, \u201cpurjury\u201d ain\u2019t purdy. And they have certainly committed perjury, for starters.\n\nThe reasons why Mueller could release at least a partial report tomorrow, is because Don and Jared\u2019s crime wave has to be stopped. Jared has just recently met with Mohammad bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and refused to allow any monitoring by our own diplomatic corps. Because, of course.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t do to have people around if you\u2019re selling state secrets. It\u2019s obvious Kushner may be jeopardizing sources in our intelligence community. He may have caused a murder already. Perhaps even multiple ones. Mueller knows what the stakes are. He won\u2019t take his time unsealing indictments if the safety of the United States is at risk.\n\nAnother reason to drop a report tomorrow is the fact that when Don Jr. receives his indictment, Mueller will certainly be fired, so he does have to have all his ducks in a row if that should occur. If it\u2019s time to take Treason Tot down, then it\u2019s time to issue the report while he still can.\n\nI\u2019ve predicted Mueller\u2019s report will be a bombshell. If Mueller chooses to drag it out further, he, no doubt, has good reason. But if Trump Jr.\u2019s indictment is ready to roll, then I suspect Mueller will get out as much as is prudent before the fit hits the shan. Either way, Don should either learn to spell, or become resigned to looking \u201cpurdy\u201d in prison."

The evidence was overwhelming, but inexplicably, one Trump-loving juror held out to secure a hung jury on ten of the eighteen charges against him. And, after securing guilty verdicts for eight felony charges, now a judge gives him a tiny sentence and refers to Manafort, a man who repeatedly sold out his country for personal gain, as \u201cotherwise blameless.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make me ask, when will justice be done? But some information I remembered (with a little help from Rachel Maddow) has renewed my faith in our justice system. First, as I mentioned, Manafort faces sentencing for another case next week and he is expected to receive as much as another ten years in prison for those crimes.\n\nAlso, Mueller still retains the right to try Manafort on the ten felony counts that resulted in a hung jury, and now, thanks to his phony cooperation scheme, Mueller has Manafort\u2019s confession to those crimes to add to the mountain of evidence he already had against him. Mueller retained the right to retry Manafort for those charges, and if he ends up with a prison sentence that could result in him ever being released from prison, Mueller is likely to retry Manafort for the ten remaining felonies. Finally, it is possible that Manafort could face charges from not-yet-charged crimes of espionage and conspiracy. With everything still to come, it is unlikely Manafort will ever get out of prison."

Ellis clearly belongs in a rubber room. But Manafort\u2019s life is about to end next week anyway.\n\nThis was just one of two trials in which Paul Manafort is facing sentencing. Next week he\u2019ll be sentenced by highly competent federal judge Amy Berman Jackson on a separate batch of guilty counts, where he\u2019ll likely pick up another decade in prison. That\u2019ll add up to fourteen years, meaning the sixty-nine year old Manafort will almost certainly die in prison.\n\nYou have to figure impeachment proceedings will now begin against Judge Ellis, who has spent this entire trial revealing himself to be too mentally incompetent to so much as shop for groceries without adult supervision, let alone oversee criminal trials. This insanely lenient sentence is literally a crime.\n\nIn any case, we can\u2019t stress enough that Paul Manafort\u2019s life is over anyway. Not only will the other judge sentence Manafort properly, the timing opens the door for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to seek the most harsh sentence possible next week, if only to rectify the crime committed by mentally defective Judge Ellis today."

She clearly has no intention of doing anything to try to stop it, which makes her criminally liable for every one of these child kidnappings. She\u2019ll go to hell for it in the end, of course. But in order to make sure no one in the U.S. government ever tries to commit these kinds of atrocities again, Nielsen needs to go to prison first."

    "text": "Paul Manafort has just been sentenced to four years in prison, which is ridiculous, but still devastating for him. Manafort still has yet to be sentenced in his other federal trial next week, where another decade or more will be tacked on. New York State will tack on even more years. That\u2019s before getting to whether Mueller re-files the ten deadlocked federal charges. Manafort is 69 years old. He\u2019s almost certainly going to die in prison. That makes Manafort the first criminal co-conspirator in the Trump-Russia election rigging scandal to be handed this particularly dark fate. But he won\u2019t be the only one.\n\nMichael Cohen is only going to prison for three years. He got lucky. He\u2019s led a life of crime, but he managed to steer clear of the election rigging plot that\u2019s going to effectively end a number of lives. Michael Flynn got lucky as well. He committed treason or its statutory equivalent, yet because he happened to have evidence to take everyone else down, and he was the very first to flip, he\u2019s getting off with a slap on the wrist. But that\u2019s where the leniency ends.\n\nDonald Trump Jr, who committed espionage, and who appears to have his hand in an endless number of money laundering, insurance fraud, and bank fraud schemes, could easily end up with an even longer prison sentence than Paul Manafort. Junior is 41 years old. Maybe he\u2019ll get out someday. Jared Kushner\u2019s entire real estate empire is one alleged criminal scheme, and he stands accused of selling U.S. classified secrets to foreign governments. If he\u2019s convicted on all of it, he could conceivably go to prison for the rest of his life. But these aren\u2019t the people who have to worry the most.\n\nRoger Stone is 66 years old. He\u2019s been hit with seven felony charges thus far, with seemingly dozens more coming. The evidence against him is overwhelming. If he doesn\u2019t cut a plea deal, he\u2019ll likely die in prison. Jeff Sessions is 72 years old. If he sees any prison time at all for his perjury and his conspiracy with the Russians, he\u2019ll probably never get out. The same goes for 74 year old Rudy Giuliani. This is all rather morbid, but the reality is that these people participated in a treason plot, stole the election, and hijacked the United States government. They\u2019re no different than any other terrorists who have attacked the United States.\n\nBy the way, if you haven\u2019t figured it out by now, there are no magic pardons. There\u2019s a reason Donald Trump has disingenuously dangled pardons at his underlings, but never intended to go through with it. State level charges alone ensure that federal pardons won\u2019t get anyone off the hook. And that\u2019s before getting to questions of whether an attempted federal pardon of an alleged co-conspirator would be struck down by the courts.\n\nReally, there\u2019s one person who has to worry the most: Donald Trump himself. He\u2019s committed roughly all the same crimes that Paul Manafort has committed, along with all the crimes that Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner stand accused of committing, and then some. The minute Trump is no longer in office, he\u2019ll be arrested and charged with dozens if not hundreds of felonies. The evidence is beyond overwhelming. Unless he cuts a resignation deal soon in exchange for reduced criminal charges, Donald Trump will die in prison."

    "text": "There\u2019s a lot of chatter out there about the possibility of Special Counsel Robert Mueller releasing his report about Donald Trump tomorrow. While there\u2019s still a lot to investigate and prosecute, the reasons why this may be the case are building.\n\nFirst of all, there are indictments waiting for Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner. There can be no doubt of this because as Don Jr. would say in his illiterate and since-deleted Tweet, \u201cpurjury\u201d ain\u2019t purdy. And they have certainly committed perjury, for starters.\n\nThe reasons why Mueller could release at least a partial report tomorrow, is because Don and Jared\u2019s crime wave has to be stopped. Jared has just recently met with Mohammad bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and refused to allow any monitoring by our own diplomatic corps. Because, of course.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t do to have people around if you\u2019re selling state secrets. It\u2019s obvious Kushner may be jeopardizing sources in our intelligence community. He may have caused a murder already. Perhaps even multiple ones. Mueller knows what the stakes are. He won\u2019t take his time unsealing indictments if the safety of the United States is at risk.\n\nAnother reason to drop a report tomorrow is the fact that when Don Jr. receives his indictment, Mueller will certainly be fired, so he does have to have all his ducks in a row if that should occur. If it\u2019s time to take Treason Tot down, then it\u2019s time to issue the report while he still can.\n\nI\u2019ve predicted Mueller\u2019s report will be a bombshell. If Mueller chooses to drag it out further, he, no doubt, has good reason. But if Trump Jr.\u2019s indictment is ready to roll, then I suspect Mueller will get out as much as is prudent before the fit hits the shan. Either way, Don should either learn to spell, or become resigned to looking \u201cpurdy\u201d in prison."

Ellis has virtually committed treason in his own right. The deranged judge has defied sentencing guidelines of 19 to 24 years, and has given Manafort just four years instead. Ellis clearly belongs in a rubber room. But Manafort\u2019s life is about to end next week anyway.\n\nThis was just one of two trials in which Paul Manafort is facing sentencing. Next week he\u2019ll be sentenced by highly competent federal judge Amy Berman Jackson on a separate batch of guilty counts, where he\u2019ll likely pick up another decade in prison. That\u2019ll add up to fourteen years, meaning the sixty-nine year old Manafort will almost certainly die in prison.\n\nYou have to figure impeachment proceedings will now begin against Judge Ellis, who has spent this entire trial revealing himself to be too mentally incompetent to so much as shop for groceries without adult supervision, let alone oversee criminal trials. This insanely lenient sentence is literally a crime.\n\nIn any case, we can\u2019t stress enough that Paul Manafort\u2019s life is over anyway. Not only will the other judge sentence Manafort properly, the timing opens the door for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to seek the most harsh sentence possible next week, if only to rectify the crime committed by mentally defective Judge Ellis today."

    "text": "Rachel Maddow reported tonight about the additional evidence Michael Cohen provided to the House Intelligence Committee. The most detailed known evidence Cohen offered was evidence of the edits he made to his congressional testimony based on advice he received from Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers.\n\nLet\u2019s just say the physical evidence, along with Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony, sounds like a slam dunk. It sounds like someone is going to jail, and that someone will be Trump\u2019s lawyers, or Trump himself, or both. First, lets talk about the physical evidence. Cohen apparently has a copy of the original testimony he prepared that he provided to Trump\u2019s lawyers. He also has copies of communications he had with the lawyers after they received a copy of his testimony. The communications include the lawyers\u2019 recommended edits that would help Cohen stay on message with Trump. Finally, Cohen has his final testimony that he changed in order to comply with the advice of Trump\u2019s lawyers.\n\nThis could be enough to prove the lawyers were acting in concert with Trump to commit a crime, in which case attorney-client privilege would be out the window. In order to avoid jail time the lawyers would have to say that Trump lied to them, and that they believed the edits they were suggesting were true, and that they were directed by Trump to make the edits. This would most likely result in an obstruction of justice charge being directed at Trump instead of his lawyers.\n\nEither way it\u2019s very bad news for the Donald Trump criminal defense team, and potentially good news for Michael Cohen. All the documentation he is prone to keeping is paying off for him, and this is just one small piece of what was contained in the brief cases full of information he turned over today."

But one U.S. intel expert thinks he\u2019s managed to deduce what Mueller is going to do next, and if he\u2019s right, let\u2019s just say that you might want to block out some time on your calendar tomorrow.\n\nBy now you\u2019re probably familiar with former CIA Director John Brennan, who fearlessly speaks his mind during interviews, and who has therefore been frequently attacked by Donald Trump. Brennan appeared on MSNBC this week and said that while he doesn\u2019t have inside knowledge, he thinks there\u2019s a good chance indictments are coming tomorrow.\n\nJohn Brennan\u2019s reasoning: even the more conservative of projections have suggested that Robert Mueller may be looking to file his final report by mid-March. Brennan thinks that Mueller will unseal a slew of indictments, and arrest a horde of people accordingly, just as he\u2019s filing his report. Mueller usually likes to bust people on Fridays. He might only have tomorrow and next Friday to choose from, and Brennan doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll be the latter, because busting a bunch of people on the Ides of March would be too on the nose.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming or when. But at the least, John Brennan\u2019s logic is sound, and he\u2019s consistently proven that he has an instinct for how these things work. If he\u2019s right, tomorrow will be full of Robert Mueller fireworks. And if he\u2019s not right, those fireworks are coming soon enough. Whenever Mueller is done, he won\u2019t be ending quietly."

    "text": "Michael Cohen has spent the past week dishing on Donald Trump\u2019s crimes to various congressional committees, producing evidence to support much of his claims, and in the process setting off everything from massive document requests to an insurance scam investigation. Now Cohen has just stuck yet another dagger in Trump, though it\u2019s of a different kind.\n\nMichael Cohen just filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump in New York court. Cohen is alleging that he and Trump had an agreement in which Trump would pay the entirety of Cohen\u2019s legal fees, but that Trump stopped paying the minute he heard Cohen might flip. Cohen appears to be taking the position that Trump was legally required to continue paying Cohen\u2019s legal fees right up until the moment when Cohen severed their joint defense agreement and cut a deal. This could be a bigger deal for all involved than one might think.\n\nSure, on the surface, it\u2019s a cash grab on Cohen\u2019s part. The legal fees in question probably add up to a few million dollars, and since Trump does appear to be legally liable, Cohen figures he might as well lay his claim to it. But this lawsuit will go through a discovery process that could force even more incriminating evidence against Trump to come to the surface. In fact this is roughly the same strategy that Stormy Daniels used against Cohen, and her lawsuit indirectly led to Cohen going to prison.\n\nIf Donald Trump were smart, he\u2019d just pay Michael Cohen to go away, before this saga can do any more legal damage to him. But as we keep seeing, Trump isn\u2019t dealing with any of this in a smart way. He\u2019ll likely try to fight Cohen to the bitter end, even if the civil litigation ends up putting Trump in increased criminal jeopardy."

Susan Collins of Maine who has to show she can flip flop on Trump when it suits her, if she wants to appeal to any voters back home.\n\nHowever, Tillis hasn\u2019t gotten a great reception at home for his decision, which he defends as entrusting too much power to the executive branch. North Carolina Republican activists have called for a primary challenger to replace him in 2020. So far, no Republicans have shown any interest \u2013 not necessarily because they agree with Tillis, but possibly because incumbents are difficult to primary, and they don\u2019t know what the political battleground will look like in a year, particularly after Republicans lost their supermajority in the state legislature in 2018.\n\nThis is noteworthy because while the vote to revoke the national emergency is set for next week, it is expected to pass in the Senate. The only question now is how many Republicans will join and vote with the Democrats. Sen. Rand Paul, who has a reputation for being a Trump sycophant, has come out against it and predicts that as many as ten Republican Senators could vote against it. We know that at least seven of them are holding out for sure. The other notorious Trump sycophant in the Senate, Lindsey Graham, has cautioned fellow senators from voting against it, saying that Donald Trump will back their primary challengers \u2013 but few, if any of them, are listening.\n\nThe GOP Congress fell lockstep behind Donald Trump rather quickly \u2013 seeing that if nothing else, he\u2019d autograph whatever unpopular legislation they wanted to pass and nominate conservative federal judges.

We all know conservatives have turned being \u201cpro-Israel\u201d into a partisan issue, as well as weaponizing antisemitism so they can use it to demonize Democrats.\n\nConservatives also insist that Islam is an ideology of hate. I have learned in my journey that this is not true, and also have accepted the fact that the Israeli government is a government made up by people, and human beings do make mistakes. After relearning everything all over, I see that Islam is a religion of peace, a religion that consists of wonderful exceptional people. In my journey I saw the hypocritical and vile hatred from people of all faiths, Judaism and Christianity. So in a nutshell there is good and bad in all religions. Conservatives need to end Islamophobia, and allow criticism of foreign governments and their lobbies.\n\nWhat Congresswoman Ilan Omar said about AIPAC was the truth. It is a lobby that influences American politicians with money. Whether you support the Jewish State or not, Israel has its own agenda, just like any other country, and it should not be able to use the anti-Semitic card to get away with anything it wants.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was recently criminally indicted. As an American Congresswoman, Ilhan Omar has every right to ask questions to protect American interests. The fact that she is a Muslim woman did not give anyone the right to attack her for her comments. She continues being targeted with anti-Muslim rhetoric to this day.\n\nAntisemitism should definitely be condemned, but it needs to be actual antisemitism, not criticism of policies of a foreign government. When I was a conservative, I voted in the 2016 presidential election for what I thought was good for Israel because I thought as a Jew; it was our obligation. I can assure you that there are many other right wing Jews who have done the same. I now realize how wrong I was, especially how that affected Jews in America and many other minorities.\n\nBack in the 2018 elections, I made a vow to American Jews, which I now extend to American Muslims, immigrants, LGBT, and anyone who faces bigotry and oppression: I no longer focus or even care about Israel\u2019s agenda or interests, I cut myself off from Israeli politics, and retook the oath I once swore when I enlisted in the United States Army, to uphold the United States Constitution, and defend the American people. Now I feel I am doing that by being part of the Democratic Party who cares for all Americans.\n\nI am glad to hear the resolution aimed at Ilan Omar was put off. I am proud to be a part of the Democratic Party, which does acknowledge that racism of all kinds exists, and knows how to appropriately handle the situation. Thank you Speaker Pelosi."

Sater knows the answer, of course. How much will he be willing to reveal during his testimony? The last time he got busted, he didn\u2019t go to prison, and he\u2019s since claimed that it\u2019s because he became a government informant. The thing about that kind of arrangement is that it tends not to end.\n\nIf Felix Sater doesn\u2019t want to go to prison for the crimes he committed with Donald Trump, he\u2019ll have to give Trump up. Considering Sater\u2019s history of giving up his co-conspirators, there\u2019s reason to expect Sater will indeed sell Trump out during his public testimony on March 14th. The bigger question may be how much Sater has already given to Robert Mueller and the SDNY."

Two words come into play: asset seizures.\n\nFor some time now, Palmer Report has expected the Feds and/or the State of New York to begin hitting Donald Trump with financial penalties for his financial crimes. When Trump doesn\u2019t pay up because he\u2019s too cash-poor, his assets will begin to be seized.

This means Deutsch is in position to know about just how criminally ugly things are in general inside the Trump Organization and Trump real estate empire. Deutsche appeared on Hardball with Chris Matthews on Wednesday evening and predicted that Trump\u2019s assets will indeed be seized while he\u2019s still in office.\n\nThere are a few different ways this can happen. New York State just launched a criminal investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s insurance fraud.

Ivanka recently denied that her father had anything whatsoever to do with her husband Jared\u2019s security clearance. As information continues to come to light, not only did Trump demand clearance for Jared, but he did the same for Ivanka. Et tu, Ivanka?\n\nIvanka was adamant in her denials during an interview with Abby Huntsman of The View. \u201cThere were anonymous leaks about there being issues. But the president had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband\u2019s clearance\u2014zero.\u201d Ivanka took things one step further, claiming that there were no problems with either of their clearances \u201cother than a backlog.\u201d Sure, Ivanka. Memos from both John Kelly and Don McGahn paint a different picture: red flags were found by intelligence personnel on both of them.\n\nAccording to CNN, while Trump can grant clearances, that task is usually left to those who better know the process. Despite this, after Kelly and McGahn declined to grant the clearances, Trump apparently took things into his own (little) hands and granted the clearances, despite the misgivings of the intelligence community. Of course, we all know how Trump feels about our intelligence community. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s much smarter than all of them combined.\n\nInterestingly, even though Ivanka\u2019s rejection could have been triggered by issues from her husband Jared\u2019s rejection, a source tells CNN that officials \u201chad concerns about granting Trump a clearance that were separate from those raised about her husband.\u201d This family is looking more and more like some type of crime syndicate, and John Kelly apparently knew it. The couple allegedly told others that Kelly \u201cwas blocking them\u201d because \u201che did not feel like they belonged in the West Wing,\u201d according to CNN. John Kelly has been doing this for a very long time. I daresay his experience tells him what constitutes a danger to the U.S. as opposed to some petty reason put forth by Kushner and Trump. But, I keep forgetting that the Trumps believe themselves to be above reproach and the law.\n\nAnderson Cooper spoke with Kristen Powers of USA Today and former RNC Chief of Staff Mike Shields. Cooper is correct that Ivanka has no expertise in anything even remotely related to governance, and Kushner likewise has no expertise in peace negotiations. Shields\u2019 contention that because Kushner is a businessman, he is savvy in negotiations, is ridiculous. No, he\u2019s not. He is, for the most part, a failed businessperson. This is a clear case of nepotism that holds absolutely no value to the American people. Indeed, Trumps actions invariably do much more harm than good. It needs to end now."

Michael Cohen gave three suitcases of evidence to Congress, two of Trump\u2019s current lawyers have already been incriminated as a result, and we don\u2019t even know what else is in those magic suitcases. Trump appears to be pretty darn scared of it all.\n\nShortly after Michael Cohen finished testifying for the day, by which time Trump attorneys Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani were left contemplating life behind bars, Donald Trump had nothing left to do but run his mouth. Unfortunately for Trump, he couldn\u2019t come up with anything remotely coherent to say.\n\nDonald Trump posted this bizarre tweet, quoting one of his remaining allies: \u201cCongressman Chris Stewart: \u2018No one is accusing the President of a crime and yet they (the Democrats) are issuing hundreds of subpoenas. This is unprecedented.\u2019 They are desperately trying to find anything they can, even a punctuation mistake in a document!\u201d Wait, what? Where do we even start with this?\n\nFirst of all, everyone is accusing Donald Trump of a crime. Second, if we were locking people up for punctuation errors, Trump would already be in solitary confinement. In reality these crimes include insurance fraud, money laundering, bribery, bank fraud, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy against the United States. Finally, it\u2019s notable that Trump is quoting one of his shrinking number of congressional allies; thirteen GOP Congressmen and as many as fifteen GOP Senators are voting against Trump\u2019s national emergency."

That means Rudy committed felony obstruction of justice, which means if he wasn\u2019t already going to prison for his past antics, he\u2019s definitely going to prison now. In response, suffice it to say that Giuliani isn\u2019t taking the news well.\n\nIt started when Donald Trump quoted his own ally Hans Von Spakovsky in accusing Adam Schiff of engaging in McCarthyism, initially spelling it as \u201cMcCathyism.\u201d After Rudy Giuliani got the news yesterday that he\u2019d been busted, he referenced Trump\u2019s quote and added this sheer nonsense: \u201cThis includes the payments Cohen has lied about which are not campaign contributions if they had any personal purpose. Cohen may not remember it but he slipped in his perjury laden testimony and supplied ample evidence that they had a personal purpose. So do his tapes.\u201d\n\nFrom there it was all quickly downhill. Former prosecutor Renato Mariotti responded by saying that \u201cThat is an inaccurate statement of the law.\u201d Congressman Ted Lieu, a former prosecutor himself, said this to Rudy: \u201cMaybe you missed it, but Cohen is going to PRISON in part because the hush money payments were illegal. That means if @realDonaldTrump wrote the checks, he became part of the conspiracy. You were a former prosecutor. You know the law. Stop lying to us.\u201d\n\nFor some time it\u2019s been fairly clear that something isn\u2019t right with Rudy Giuliani. He routinely sounds like he has a small fraction of the cognitive ability he once had. He\u2019s also apparently lost every bit of legal knowledge he ever had. Now he just sounds like a guy who knows he\u2019s going to prison, and has no idea how to respond to it."

In fact he\u2019s allegedly committed two different kinds of felonies, and there appears to be hard and fast evidence to nail him on at least one of them.\n\nWhen Michael Cohen showed up to Congress for his fourth round of testimony today, he brought several suitcases full of evidence with him. We still don\u2019t know the full extent of what was in those suitcases, but two separate storylines have surfaced. One is that Jay Sekulow instructed Cohen in writing to lie to Congress in 2017 about Trump Tower Moscow. The other is that Sekulow tried to dangle a pardon in Cohen\u2019s face. So why is this so devastating?\n\nAssuming Cohen\u2019s evidence really does support this, Jay Sekulow is going down for suborning perjury and obstruction of justice on the testimony issue, and he\u2019s going down for obstruction of justice on the pardon issue. That means Sekulow is going to prison for a long time, unless he cuts a plea deal against Donald Trump. Sekulow can testify about any crimes he and Trump plotted together, as attorney-client privilege doesn\u2019t apply to such situations.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what Jay Sekulow does. But if he\u2019s not planning to cut a plea deal, then his life is over, and he might as well just report to prison right now. Sure, Sekulow is the kind of person who\u2019s dumb enough to hold out for an imaginary Trump pardon. But considering he was in on the original attempt at conning Michael Cohen into believing he would be pardoned, perhaps Sekulow won\u2019t fall for the pardon scam himself."

We all know conservatives have turned being \u201cpro-Israel\u201d into a partisan issue, as well as weaponizing antisemitism so they can use it to demonize Democrats.\n\nConservatives also insist that Islam is an ideology of hate. I have learned in my journey that this is not true, and also have accepted the fact that the Israeli government is a government made up by people, and human beings do make mistakes. After relearning everything all over, I see that Islam is a religion of peace, a religion that consists of wonderful exceptional people. In my journey I saw the hypocritical and vile hatred from people of all faiths, Judaism and Christianity. So in a nutshell there is good and bad in all religions. Conservatives need to end Islamophobia, and allow criticism of foreign governments and their lobbies.\n\nWhat Congresswoman Ilan Omar said about AIPAC was the truth. It is a lobby that influences American politicians with money. Whether you support the Jewish State or not, Israel has its own agenda, just like any other country, and it should not be able to use the anti-Semitic card to get away with anything it wants.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was recently criminally indicted. As an American Congresswoman, Ilhan Omar has every right to ask questions to protect American interests. The fact that she is a Muslim woman did not give anyone the right to attack her for her comments. She continues being targeted with anti-Muslim rhetoric to this day.\n\nAntisemitism should definitely be condemned, but it needs to be actual antisemitism, not criticism of policies of a foreign government. When I was a conservative, I voted in the 2016 presidential election for what I thought was good for Israel because I thought as a Jew; it was our obligation. I can assure you that there are many other right wing Jews who have done the same. I now realize how wrong I was, especially how that affected Jews in America and many other minorities.\n\nBack in the 2018 elections, I made a vow to American Jews, which I now extend to American Muslims, immigrants, LGBT, and anyone who faces bigotry and oppression: I no longer focus or even care about Israel\u2019s agenda or interests, I cut myself off from Israeli politics, and retook the oath I once swore when I enlisted in the United States Army, to uphold the United States Constitution, and defend the American people. Now I feel I am doing that by being part of the Democratic Party who cares for all Americans.\n\nI am glad to hear the resolution aimed at Ilan Omar was put off. I am proud to be a part of the Democratic Party, which does acknowledge that racism of all kinds exists, and knows how to appropriately handle the situation. Thank you Speaker Pelosi."

That\u2019s right, Carson announced his resignation nearly two years in advance. Why? No one knows, really. Does Carson really think Trump needs twenty-two months advance notice to find a new HUD Secretary who\u2019s equally unqualified for the job? Does Carson think this gets him off the hook for Trump\u2019s crimes?\n\nBen Carson is a guy who once falsely claimed that he stabbed his friend with a knife, and who once asserted that Joseph from the Bible built the Egyptian Pyramids to store grain. This is not a man whose words or actions make sense. But even Carson, in his own weird and incomprehensible way, seems to be trying to join the rats who are fleeing Trump\u2019s ship.\n\nThere\u2019s still one big unanswered question. Back when Donald Trump was first illegitimately named the winner of the election, he publicly and repeatedly insisted that Ben Carson become his HUD Secretary. Carson kept saying \u201cno\u201d for obvious reasons: it would have been far easier for Carson to continue his grifting ways out on the book and lecture circuit if he didn\u2019t have the restraints of holding a cabinet position. But in the end, Carson took the job. Just how did Trump \u201cconvince\u201d him to do it? Perhaps Carson will fess up one day about whatever blackmail material Trump must be holding over him."

Cohen underlined this point today when he showed up to Congress with a few suitcases full of evidence in hand, making for a stunning visual in front of the television cameras. So what was inside the suitcases?\n\nThe only thing we know so far is that Michael Cohen brought documents proving that Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers instructed him to lie to Congress in 2017. That\u2019s suborning perjury and obstruction of justice, so assuming the evidence holds up, Trump\u2019s lawyers will have to cut a plea deal against him or go to prison. But that\u2019s just the start of what today brought.\n\nFor all we know, Cohen\u2019s three suitcases could have been mostly empty. Maybe it was mostly for show. Or maybe he brought his own copies of the documents that the House Judiciary Committee just requested from eighty-one Trump related people and entities. That, of course, is the whole point. These people all now have to worry that if they simply destroy incriminating documents, they might get nailed for it, because House Democrats may now have the documents anyway.\n\nConsidering that Michael Cohen apparently sent Jay Sekulow to prison today, the rest of Donald Trump\u2019s people have to very much worry that Cohen\u2019s suitcases might have been full of evidence against them as well. They\u2019re now in a no-win situation. Do they turn over the documents? Do they refuse to cooperate and cross their fingers? Do they just cut plea deals now? Any innocent people have nothing to worry about, but any guilty people are now screwed."

The most detailed known evidence Cohen offered was evidence of the edits he made to his congressional testimony based on advice he received from Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers.\n\nLet\u2019s just say the physical evidence, along with Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony, sounds like a slam dunk. It sounds like someone is going to jail, and that someone will be Trump\u2019s lawyers, or Trump himself, or both. First, lets talk about the physical evidence. Cohen apparently has a copy of the original testimony he prepared that he provided to Trump\u2019s lawyers. He also has copies of communications he had with the lawyers after they received a copy of his testimony. The communications include the lawyers\u2019 recommended edits that would help Cohen stay on message with Trump. Finally, Cohen has his final testimony that he changed in order to comply with the advice of Trump\u2019s lawyers.\n\nThis could be enough to prove the lawyers were acting in concert with Trump to commit a crime, in which case attorney-client privilege would be out the window. In order to avoid jail time the lawyers would have to say that Trump lied to them, and that they believed the edits they were suggesting were true, and that they were directed by Trump to make the edits. This would most likely result in an obstruction of justice charge being directed at Trump instead of his lawyers.\n\nEither way it\u2019s very bad news for the Donald Trump criminal defense team, and potentially good news for Michael Cohen. All the documentation he is prone to keeping is paying off for him, and this is just one small piece of what was contained in the brief cases full of information he turned over today."

As Palmer Report has pointed out, a House Oversight Committee document request has sent scores of Trump allies and toadies into a frenzy that is sure to lead to further legal issues as some jump ship, while others sink with it, maneuvering and backstabbing along the way.\n\nAllen Weisselberg appears to have stopped participating in Trump\u2019s illegal Cohen payoffs as early as 2017, and Congress is likely targeting him for a public hearing. And everyone saw how affected Trump was by Cohen\u2019s testimony, leading to his disastrous early exit from the already pointless Kim Jong Un summit. Americans generally don\u2019t respond well in the polls to clear diplomatic losses to dictators, especially when the president admits that he lost because he was rattled by congressional oversight.\n\nThis is how Trump\u2019s ouster is going to happen: death by 1,000 cuts rather than one or two major bombshells. While Trump may very well be forced out of office before next year\u2019s election, he\u2019s reportedly looking at reelection as the only way to save himself. That\u2019s why this poll matters, along with serving as a somewhat useful, yet rough, way to track the public\u2019s feelings about Trump as multiple investigations continue.\n\nBut it\u2019s a new Quinnipiac poll that really stands out, as it demonstrates that most Americans believe that Trump has committed crimes at some point in his life. Those polled were not as willing to say that they believe Trump has committed crimes while in office, but it indicates that Americans won\u2019t be surprised if it comes to light that he has.\n\nNot only does such polling provide a small bit of relief for frustrated Americans on the 2020 front, it makes investigators\u2019 jobs easier, whether they\u2019re working for Robert Mueller, the State of New York, or House Democrats. Taking down a president, even one so obviously corrupt and damaging as Donald Trump, is a heavy political lift. The more public support for Trump\u2019s removal, the lighter it gets, and if Americans already believe that Trump committed past crimes, they\u2019re much more likely to be compelled by evidence of new ones. And if he survives to run again next year, a lot of Democrats in the running now are favored to send him home so he can face justice as a private citizen."

Now, in a separate but similar storyline, it looks like Cohen has also just sent Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani to prison.\n\nRudy Giuliani apparently sent two other unnamed lawyers to approach Michael Cohen after his office was raided by the FBI, in an effort at preventing Cohen from cooperating with prosecutors, according to a new report from ABC News. The report doesn\u2019t explicitly say as much, but it\u2019s fairly clear that this story is a result of Cohen having sold Giuliani out for it. This comes one day after the Wall Street Journal separately reported that Giuliani dangled a pardon at Cohen after the raid. Why is this such a big deal?\n\nIn short, Rudy Giuliani committed felony obstruction of justice by telling Michael Cohen that he would end up being pardoned if he refused to cooperate with the investigation. Perhaps more importantly, Rudy dragged these other two unnamed attorneys into his conspiracy to obstruct justice, and the odds are good that they\u2019ll cut plea deals against Rudy in order to avoid going to prison. This is on top of whatever evidence and testimony Cohen has provided about this incident.\n\nThis means Rudy Giuliani is definitely going to prison, unless he cuts a plea deal of his own against Donald Trump. One thing to keep in mind: there is no attorney-client privilege when an attorney and client conspire to commit crimes together, so Rudy can easily testify against Trump on this and other similar matters."

This left us wondering aloud if it was possible that Mueller isn\u2019t even investigating Ivanka. But now it turns out he very much is targeting her.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is now weighing whether to go ahead and add Ivanka Trump to their document request list, after having targeted just about everyone in her family but her. Some of the Democrats on the committee are openly acknowledging that targeting Ivanka could trigger Donald Trump into retaliatory action, in a way that targeting Don Jr or Eric Trump might not. But the kicker is the tidbit down in paragraph seven of the article.\n\nRobert Mueller is apparently \u201cscrutinizing Ivanka Trump\u2019s role in the Trump Tower Moscow deal, including who she communicated with about the plans to build the luxury real estate project in Russia\u2019s capital city.\u201d This isn\u2019t necessarily surprising, as Ivanka has reportedly played key roles in a number of Trump Organization real estate deals, including Trump Soho.\n\nSo we\u2019ll see what the House Judiciary Committee ends up doing. We\u2019re starting to suspect that they\u2019re holding back on Ivanka Trump, and openly discussing when and if they might target her, as a way of trying to get under Donald Trump\u2019s skin. After all, each time he overreaches in an attempt at retaliation, he inches himself closer to ouster. But for now the upshot is that Robert Mueller is targeting Ivanka, which may be more important in the long run."

That\u2019s why it\u2019s so fundamentally important that Homeland Security Director Kirstjen Nielsen go to prison for putting kids in cages.\n\nKirstjen Nielsen is way past the point of being able to claim any deniability for what the agents under her are doing to these immigrant kids, and for that matter she\u2019s past the point of being able to claim she\u2019s not legally culpable.

She clearly has no intention of doing anything to try to stop it, which makes her criminally liable for every one of these child kidnappings. She\u2019ll go to hell for it in the end, of course.

Considering that Cohen is headed to prison for lying under oath to Congress, it seems a given that Sekulow will now head to prison with him.\n\nThen came the apparently related news that Rudy Giuliani sent two unnamed attorneys to dangle a pardon in front of Michael Cohen after his office was raided by the FBI. That\u2019s conspiracy to commit felony obstruction of justice, and it means Rudy should also be packing his toothbrush for prison.

The false reports about Mueller\u2019s probe \u201cwinding down\u201d haven\u2019t helped either. But Mueller is sitting on a ton of indictments, and I can prove it with just two words.\n\nBear with me here, because those two words are \u201cJerome Corsi.\u201d Yes he\u2019s a whack job, and no, I don\u2019t believe a word he says. But here\u2019s the kicker. Robert Mueller threatened to indict Corsi for perjury, and even went so far as to give Corsi a copy of the draft indictment. We know this happened because Corsi ended up publicly releasing the draft \u2013 and if it had been some kind of fake, Mueller would have said as much.\n\nThis draft indictment was an obvious attempt at scaring Corsi into cutting a plea deal and flipping on Roger Stone. It didn\u2019t work, as Corsi decided he\u2019d rather go about things the stupid way. But Mueller has shown that he has no tolerance for this kind of crap, so he will indict Corsi for perjury. The question is why he hasn\u2019t done it yet.\n\nAt the time, some observers speculated that perhaps Robert Mueller has lost his ability to indict anyone, because Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker had somehow magically put a stop to it all. But then Mueller turned around and indicted Roger Stone, proving that he still has the ability to indict anyone he wants. So again, why didn\u2019t he indict Corsi?\n\nThe logical explanation is that Robert Mueller didn\u2019t see a point in indicting Jerome Corsi yet, because Corsi is a small fish and he\u2019s not going to flip anyway. This tells us that Corsi\u2019s indictment is sitting in a pile somewhere of sealed indictments that Mueller is going to unleash at the end of the game, and Mueller is going to let the relevant U.S. Attorneys take on the burden of carrying out these prosecutions after he\u2019s finished his report. If Mueller is saving Corsi for the end, then he\u2019s saving a whole boatload of indictments for the end. We just don\u2019t know when the \u201cend\u201d is."

Jay Sekulow is denying that he or Donald Trump altered Michael Cohen\u2019s original sworn congressional testimony in order to disguise the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations. But apparently there is written proof in Cohen\u2019s newly produced suitcases full of evidence that his testimony was altered by Sekulow and Trump, and Cohen has just submitted it to the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nNow I know edits. Sometimes they\u2019re in red pencil; sometimes you get a depressingly long letter from your editor. Or as in this case, perhaps, your lawyer. But the one thing about them \u2013 they\u2019re made to be clear. Crystal clear. No guessing needed! No discussion, no arguments. If they have to explain it, they wouldn\u2019t bother to write it down.\n\nTrump and his laughably crappy lawyers never got the mantra espoused by Earl Long. The Former Louisiana Governor, Earl Long, once said, \u201cDon\u2019t write anything you can phone. Don\u2019t phone anything you can talk. Don\u2019t talk anything you can whisper.

    "text": "The story of Donald Trump\u2019s school grades is blossoming into a full-blown scandal. New revelations are showing that when it comes to his academic record, the sitting president is both a liar and a hypocrite. For years, Trump has bragged about his \u201cvery, very large brain\u201d and \u201cgood marks,\u201d but he has yet to prove any of it. Now it turns out that Trump\u2019s efforts to hide his grades is an even bigger coverup than we thought just last week.\n\nLast week, Michael Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee that he threatened Trump\u2019s schools not to release any grades to any person for any reason. Cohen revealed a copy of the 2015 letter he sent to Fordham, which Trump attended for a couple of years before transferring to Wharton. The letter itself is so weird it is almost laughable. After a page of over-the-top belligerence, Cohen switched to playing good cop in a single-line postscript, lavishing praise on Fordham and declaring his client\u2019s love for the school.\n\nNow we are learning that Trump\u2019s obsession with hiding his grades actually started years earlier. Even crazier, these efforts came at the same time the hypocrite-in-chief attacked a potential opponent for having and hiding bad grades. Back in April 2011, Trump called then-candidate Barack Obama a \u201cterrible student.\u201d He wondered aloud how Obama could have gotten accepted into Columbia and Harvard Law School, and he demanded that Obama release his academic records.\n\nAccording to new reporting by the Washington Post, the superintendent of the New York Military Academy that Trump attended as a teenager was \u201caccosted by prominent, wealthy alumni who were Mr. Trump\u2019s friends.\u201d It appears these Trump cronies tried to bully the school into handing over his files while taking advantage of the fact that their alma mater was facing financial troubles. But the superintendent, Jeffrey Coverdale, instead moved all of Trump\u2019s embarrassing files to a secret, secure location. Unlike our \u201cstable genius\u201d president, that superintendent was no dunce."

    "text": "Donald Trump has a lot of problems right now, to say the least. He\u2019s fending off too many congressional and criminal investigations to count. His foreign policy agenda has failed. His domestic policy agenda no longer exists. His kids are being targeted by prosecutors. You name it, everything is going wrong for Trump. But now he has a larger problem, which speaks directly to how much longer he can hold off before he\u2019s ousted.\n\nI always caution Palmer Report readers never to treat one new poll as if it were the only poll. For instance the media keeps focusing on Donald Trump\u2019s top outlier approval rating poll one week, then his bottom outlier approval rating poll the next week, dishonestly getting people worked up over it all, even as his approval rating has largely remained steady for the past year. But last night we got a very different kind of poll, and it tells us where this is headed.\n\nThe new Quinnipiac poll tells us that fifty percent of Americans believe Michael Cohen over Donald Trump, while only thirty-five percent of Americans believe Trump over Cohen, with the rest the people unsure. Again, this is just one poll, but it\u2019s the first of its kind, so it\u2019s all we have to work with. Because the margin here is so large, unless this poll is off by a whopping fifteen points, we now know that more Americans believe Cohen than Trump. That\u2019s remarkable, considering that everyone knows Cohen is a liar and a criminal.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this is based solely on first impressions of Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony, and the smattering of physical evidence he brought with him. This is before more influential Trump people like Allen Weisselberg take the stand, and bring far more evidence. This is before Robert Mueller reveals the incriminating evidence that Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, Don McGahn, Steve Bannon, and other cooperators have provided against Trump.\n\nDonald Trump is already down to just one-third of the country holding him in higher esteem than liar and criminal Michael Cohen. That number will keep dropping as more and better witnesses publicly testify in the coming days and weeks. Trump\u2019s base is perhaps 15% to 20% of the country. They may never give up on him, but that doesn\u2019t matter. He can\u2019t sustain his presidency with just his base. He needs those people in the middle who make up the rest of his approval rating.\n\nForget about Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating for now, as that\u2019s the kind of poll where the people in the middle are still trying to give a sitting president the benefit of the doubt until Trump\u2019s crimes are comprehensively proven to them. Instead, pay attention to this new poll that says Trump is already in sub-Cohen territory when it comes to trustworthiness. That tells us the people in the middle think Trump is guilty, and it\u2019s a predictor of what they\u2019re likely to say in approval rating polls once all the evidence of Trump\u2019s crimes has been laid out for them in the coming weeks."

    "text": "Donald Trump continues to see the presidency as the greatest marketing tool of all time. He even uses negative outcomes as an opportunity to tout his brand. The U.K. Supreme Court has ordered Trump to pay the Scottish government\u2019s legal fees stemming from a multi-year lawsuit that he filed. History seems to eerily repeat itself where Trump is concerned.\n\nAfter Trump purchased land in Scotland in 2006 to build \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest golf course\u201d on the Aberdeenshire Coast (BBC), he became entangled with neighbors to his property, Moira and David Milne. Trump erected fencing along the Milnes\u2019 property to separate them from the course, and pouring salt in the wound, sent the Milnes a bill for part of the fencing. Sound familiar? The Milnes now have a Mexican flag next to their Scottish flag \u201cin solidarity with [Mexico]\u201d according to the BBC, because of Trump\u2019s promise to build the wall and make Mexico pay for it. No wonder he was so bold with that promise. Little did we know that he has done this in the past.\n\nTrump was further stymied in his endeavors by the introduction of a wind farm, which he claimed ruined the view from his golf course and hotel. He sued. As the suit worked its way through the courts, the Scottish government won at every level, ultimately prevailing in the U.K. Supreme Court, which has ordered Trump to reimburse the government. How did Trump react to his loss? By tweeting, of course: \u201cVery proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Also, furthers U.K. relationship!\u201d Really?\n\nWalter Shaub, former head of U.S. Office of Government Ethics, who almost immediately resigned when Trump took office, points out that Trump continues to violate the Emoluments Clause. Shaub now advises Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which has sued Trump, and responded to his tweet: \u201cThere it is. The president is using an official statement as an ad for his business and making sure everyone knows he ties his business to US relationships with foreign countries.\u201d Shaub adds: \u201cThis is Trump\u2019s most explicit commingling of personal interests and public office to date.\u201d\n\nSo, is Donald Trump stupid or is he just arrogant enough to believe he will continue to get away with his inappropriate actions? I vote for the latter, though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very bright either. Even though Trump allegedly turned over control of his businesses to his sons, Trump still owns the businesses and as a result is profiting from them, which seemingly violates the clause. His repeated \u201cvictory tweets\u201d about his businesses certainly don\u2019t help. Trump thinks he\u2019s untouchable. Perhaps a more apropos nickname for him is \u201cThe Don\u201d as opposed to his much-loved \u201cThe Donald.\u201d Let\u2019s just hope he\u2019s not a Teflon Don. Wait \u2013 on second thought\u2026 who was it that took down the original Teflon Don? Oh right, Robert Mueller."

Trump attended, or just after. There was a photo that was an overhead satellite image showing such developments in the story.\n\nHowever, Trump, who has told his Cult 45 followers not to believe what they see or hear, but trust him only, has now stated that he does not believe such reports. According to Kaitlin Collins on Twitter, citing pool reporter Peter Baker, we have a president who is once again denying that one of his BDFF (Best Dictator Friends Forever) is doing something that is wrong:\n\nAsked about the report of North Korea rebuilding missile test facilities, President Trump said he would \u201cbe very disappointed if that is happening,\u201d but added, \u201cIt\u2019s a very early report.\u201d Per pooler @peterbakernyt Trump: \u201cI would be very disappointed in Chairman Kim but I don\u2019t think I will be.\u201d\n\nWhy Trump refers to it as \u201ca very early report\u201d is beyond comprehension. Not only is the Washington Post reporting from sources who have reviewed the activities, but they literally have a satellite photo showing there has been activity. For example, Jeffrey Lewis, a scholar quoted in the referenced article, noted that some imagery that was \u201clow-resolution imagery\u201d showed some activity in the period between February 18 and February 22, but that the satellite images make clear what was happening. Lewis stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not great news. They may have known the summit was not going to go well.\u201d\n\nAgain, we have Donald Trump arguing that what we see is not what is happening, presumably because his BDFF Kim Jong-Un told him so and what reason would he have to lie? We continue to be under the leadership of a dangerous man who apparently will not believe calamity is about to hit until too late to address."

I\u2019ve never subscribed to this particular notion, because for all his numerous psychoses, Trump always cuts a deal and walks away when he knows he\u2019s lost (see his six bankruptcies). But Trump just made clear that he has something up his sleeve when it comes to not wanting to leave office.\n\nStuffed into the tenth paragraph of a largely unrelated New York Times article last night, we find this randomly inserted sentence: \u201cSome people close to Mr. Trump have privately predicted that he will ultimately choose to seek a second term in part because of his legal exposure if he is not president.\u201d There it is. Trump is under the impression that as long as he\u2019s the president, he won\u2019t face any criminal consequences.\n\nThis means that Donald Trump will be willing to cheat as brazenly and treasonously as possible during the 2020 election, under the premise that if he doesn\u2019t find a way to win, he\u2019ll go straight to prison. He\u2019s right. The very minute that Trump is no longer president, he\u2019ll be arrested and arranged on criminal charges. In fact various state and federal prosecutorial entities will be fighting over who gets to cuff the bastard first.\n\nFor that reason, Donald Trump cannot be allowed to be a participant in the 2020 election. That means he must be ousted from office before the election. The House Democrats, Robert Mueller, the SDNY, and every other involved entity therefore have no choice but to force Trump out of office by any and all legal means necessary. That means impeachment, indictment, asset seizures, arresting his kids, all of it. The continued existence of the American democracy now rests upon it."

Hearing Michael Cohen\u2019s depiction of Donald Trump\u2019s behavior vis-\u00e0-vis his role as head of the Trump Organization was in no way surprising. Actually, there was a single element of Trump\u2019s behavior that I found surprising, and it was that he \u201cspeaks in a code,\u201d which is something that I generally presume to require at least a faint understanding of subtlety, which is not something I intuitively associate with him.\n\nTo the greater point: speaking in code does not mean Trump didn\u2019t order Cohen and others to act illegally. Indeed, the whole point of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, yes RICO, was to close a loophole in which crime bosses were immune from prosecution simply because they instructed underlings to do things like \u201cshow our friend a toasty evening in\u201d (read: torch his house), or \u201che scratched my back, now it\u2019s time we scratched his\u201d (read: make an illegal payoff), but not actually commit these crimes themselves. With RICO, crime bosses are the target, and it doesn\u2019t matter if they speak in code, or didn\u2019t commit the crimes directly.\n\n\u201cRICO\u201d accusations are, unfortunately, popularly hurled at people in a way not dissimilar to how a chimpanzee hurls its feces at the zookeeper, which is to say, to make a stink. No matter how hard you try, RICO doesn\u2019t apply to your rival business owner who told his son to go bash in the windshield of your new truck. People try to use it often and, as a consequence, it\u2019s not always taken seriously.\n\nBut it really seems like RICO applies to Trump regarding his conduct at the Trump Organization. Take a look at this article from the Daily Beast and get a feel for it yourself. The question that remains then, is what does this mean for the Trump clan? Given the traditionally aggressive nature of the Southern District of New York, where it appears they\u2019re mounting a RICO case against the Trump Organization, it might mean the end. The Trumpocalypse. Don Jr., Eric, Ivanka, Weisselberg, and other top Organization officials could be charged by prosecutors citing the statutory requirements for RICO given the galaxy of crimes they\u2019ve committed over the years.\n\nBuilding a RICO case against Trump is virtually certain, but herein lies the big problem. Is SDNY able to charge Trump while in office? I think so, and not only because of the shaky and borderline misinterpreted grounds upon which we have a Justice Department policy of not indicting a sitting president. Think of it this way, from the perspective of the government servants at SDNY whose job it is to protect the people from criminals: do you knowingly let an active crime boss lead a nation of 325 million? Are we serving the people by letting this continue? Let\u2019s see if SDNY can get something to stick to this Teflon Don. I\u2019m hopeful."

He\u2019s removing a key Trump-Russia scandal prosecutor by offering her a major, and perhaps not optional, promotion. Here\u2019s the thing: it\u2019s going to flop.\n\nDonald Trump is nominating Jessie Liu to be the new number three person at the Department of Justice. The good news is that Liu appears to be on the up-and-up. The trouble is that she\u2019s currently the U.S. Attorney for Washington DC, and by promoting her, Trump is creating an opening that he\u2019ll then get to fill. In theory, Trump could pick a corrupt loyalist to replace her, and suddenly that loyalist would be overseeing the criminal cases against Roger Stone and Samuel Patten, among others.\n\nSounds scary, right? But we\u2019ve heard this story before, just with different names. Back when Donald Trump fired Preet Bharara as the U.S. Attorney for the SDNY, he replaced Bharara with his own buddy Geoffrey Berman. But then Berman recused himself, and the SDNY went on to bust Michael Cohen, and is still targeting Trump and his henchmen. Back when Trump appointed Matt Whitaker as Acting Attorney General, that was supposed to magically get Trump off the hook, but that also went nowhere. For that matter, Trump appointed Rod Rosenstein back in the day, with the expectation that Rosenstein would magically get him off the hook, and we all know how that one played out.\n\nIn fact, assuming Jessie Liu accepts this promotion, she\u2019ll be taking the place of Rachel Brand. Back when Brand resigned last year, everyone thought that was somehow going to magically get Trump off the hook. But it just never happens. Trump keeps tepidly shuffling the DOJ deck, and it keeps doing nothing to stop the criminal investigations into his scandals, or even slow those investigations down. There\u2019s no reason to expect this latest move to be any different."

In the last election season, it was fashionable for the GOP-led Congress to say Democrats were about anarchy and open borders, but with each passing day, it\u2019s clear the Republicans don\u2019t have any alternate plans of their own.\n\nIf Donald Trump just had a bad day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can\u2019t be having one that\u2019s a whole lot better. Nearly two weeks ago, he announced his support for Trump\u2019s blatant subversion of democracy, and his own surrender of power just so this administration could seize the funds for a steel monument to racism and ignorance. More than a dozen House Republicans voted to overrule the national emergency, and now there are far more than enough votes to overrule this bout of insanity in the Senate.\n\nIt is now required that McConnell hold a vote to kill the national emergency \u2013 the first time a Congress has done so in history. Donald Trump will probably veto it, leaving the decision up to the courts, but his party has no plans to go down with the ship. Aside from his veto, he has nothing left. It\u2019s also hardly the moderates who are voting against the national emergency. Far right Republican Senator Rand Paul officially came out against it, worried about the precedent it would set for a future administration \u2013 and he actually went so far as to speculate that even Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would rule against it were SCOTUS to decide the outcome.\n\nThe wall has become a thorn in the side for the GOP. First they thought Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t win the election on the idea, then they thought that he would simply walk away from the promise \u2013 or keep delaying it, as they helped him to do while running both houses. At each step of the way, they thought the problem would somehow take care of itself. Now the message is clear: it\u2019s all on Trump\u2019s shoulders, and the Republicans have no desire to prop it up, particularly heading into a tough 2020 election where twenty-two of them \u2013 McConnell included \u2013 are facing potentially close races."

In response, suffice it to say that Giuliani isn\u2019t taking the news well.\n\nIt started when Donald Trump quoted his own ally Hans Von Spakovsky in accusing Adam Schiff of engaging in McCarthyism, initially spelling it as \u201cMcCathyism.\u201d After Rudy Giuliani got the news yesterday that he\u2019d been busted, he referenced Trump\u2019s quote and added this sheer nonsense: \u201cThis includes the payments Cohen has lied about which are not campaign contributions if they had any personal purpose. Cohen may not remember it but he slipped in his perjury laden testimony and supplied ample evidence that they had a personal purpose. So do his tapes.\u201d\n\nFrom there it was all quickly downhill. Former prosecutor Renato Mariotti responded by saying that \u201cThat is an inaccurate statement of the law.\u201d Congressman Ted Lieu, a former prosecutor himself, said this to Rudy: \u201cMaybe you missed it, but Cohen is going to PRISON in part because the hush money payments were illegal. That means if @realDonaldTrump wrote the checks, he became part of the conspiracy. You were a former prosecutor. You know the law. Stop lying to us.\u201d\n\nFor some time it\u2019s been fairly clear that something isn\u2019t right with Rudy Giuliani. He routinely sounds like he has a small fraction of the cognitive ability he once had. He\u2019s also apparently lost every bit of legal knowledge he ever had.

    "text": "Stop us if you\u2019ve heard this one before, because it\u2019s becoming a more frequent refrain by the day, but Donald Trump just had a rather horrible day. Michael Cohen gave three suitcases of evidence to Congress, two of Trump\u2019s current lawyers have already been incriminated as a result, and we don\u2019t even know what else is in those magic suitcases. Trump appears to be pretty darn scared of it all.\n\nShortly after Michael Cohen finished testifying for the day, by which time Trump attorneys Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani were left contemplating life behind bars, Donald Trump had nothing left to do but run his mouth. Unfortunately for Trump, he couldn\u2019t come up with anything remotely coherent to say.\n\nDonald Trump posted this bizarre tweet, quoting one of his remaining allies: \u201cCongressman Chris Stewart: \u2018No one is accusing the President of a crime and yet they (the Democrats) are issuing hundreds of subpoenas. This is unprecedented.\u2019 They are desperately trying to find anything they can, even a punctuation mistake in a document!\u201d Wait, what? Where do we even start with this?\n\nFirst of all, everyone is accusing Donald Trump of a crime. Second, if we were locking people up for punctuation errors, Trump would already be in solitary confinement. In reality these crimes include insurance fraud, money laundering, bribery, bank fraud, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy against the United States. Finally, it\u2019s notable that Trump is quoting one of his shrinking number of congressional allies; thirteen GOP Congressmen and as many as fifteen GOP Senators are voting against Trump\u2019s national emergency."

It was also surreal, considering Cohen had already been convicted of lying to Congress. But the upcoming testimony from Felix Sater is set to be even more damaging to Trump, and far more surreal.\n\nFelix Sater is a convicted Russian mafia money launderer who once went to prison for stabbing a guy in the face. So we\u2019re already reaching a historic new low just by having to bring this guy in to testify about his business relationship with the sitting President of the United States. But while Sater isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s idea of an ideal witness, he\u2019s going to be able to bust out a whole lot of ugly stuff about Donald Trump, because he once partnered with the Trump Organization on the shady Trump Soho real estate project.\n\nThe widespread suspicion is that Trump Soho was nothing more than a front for Russian money laundering. Sater knows the answer, of course. How much will he be willing to reveal during his testimony? The last time he got busted, he didn\u2019t go to prison, and he\u2019s since claimed that it\u2019s because he became a government informant. The thing about that kind of arrangement is that it tends not to end.\n\nIf Felix Sater doesn\u2019t want to go to prison for the crimes he committed with Donald Trump, he\u2019ll have to give Trump up. Considering Sater\u2019s history of giving up his co-conspirators, there\u2019s reason to expect Sater will indeed sell Trump out during his public testimony on March 14th. The bigger question may be how much Sater has already given to Robert Mueller and the SDNY."

In fact he\u2019s allegedly committed two different kinds of felonies, and there appears to be hard and fast evidence to nail him on at least one of them.\n\nWhen Michael Cohen showed up to Congress for his fourth round of testimony today, he brought several suitcases full of evidence with him. We still don\u2019t know the full extent of what was in those suitcases, but two separate storylines have surfaced. One is that Jay Sekulow instructed Cohen in writing to lie to Congress in 2017 about Trump Tower Moscow. The other is that Sekulow tried to dangle a pardon in Cohen\u2019s face. So why is this so devastating?\n\nAssuming Cohen\u2019s evidence really does support this, Jay Sekulow is going down for suborning perjury and obstruction of justice on the testimony issue, and he\u2019s going down for obstruction of justice on the pardon issue. That means Sekulow is going to prison for a long time, unless he cuts a plea deal against Donald Trump. Sekulow can testify about any crimes he and Trump plotted together, as attorney-client privilege doesn\u2019t apply to such situations.\n\nWe\u2019ll see what Jay Sekulow does. But if he\u2019s not planning to cut a plea deal, then his life is over, and he might as well just report to prison right now. Sure, Sekulow is the kind of person who\u2019s dumb enough to hold out for an imaginary Trump pardon. But considering he was in on the original attempt at conning Michael Cohen into believing he would be pardoned, perhaps Sekulow won\u2019t fall for the pardon scam himself."

This left us wondering aloud if it was possible that Mueller isn\u2019t even investigating Ivanka. But now it turns out he very much is targeting her.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is now weighing whether to go ahead and add Ivanka Trump to their document request list, after having targeted just about everyone in her family but her. Some of the Democrats on the committee are openly acknowledging that targeting Ivanka could trigger Donald Trump into retaliatory action, in a way that targeting Don Jr or Eric Trump might not. But the kicker is the tidbit down in paragraph seven of the article.\n\nRobert Mueller is apparently \u201cscrutinizing Ivanka Trump\u2019s role in the Trump Tower Moscow deal, including who she communicated with about the plans to build the luxury real estate project in Russia\u2019s capital city.\u201d This isn\u2019t necessarily surprising, as Ivanka has reportedly played key roles in a number of Trump Organization real estate deals, including Trump Soho.\n\nSo we\u2019ll see what the House Judiciary Committee ends up doing. We\u2019re starting to suspect that they\u2019re holding back on Ivanka Trump, and openly discussing when and if they might target her, as a way of trying to get under Donald Trump\u2019s skin. After all, each time he overreaches in an attempt at retaliation, he inches himself closer to ouster. But for now the upshot is that Robert Mueller is targeting Ivanka, which may be more important in the long run."

This increasingly raises the question of just how legal justice will be served to a guy who is illegally occupying the office of President of the United States after having treasonously rigged the election. Two words come into play: asset seizures.\n\nFor some time now, Palmer Report has expected the Feds and/or the State of New York to begin hitting Donald Trump with financial penalties for his financial crimes. When Trump doesn\u2019t pay up because he\u2019s too cash-poor, his assets will begin to be seized. It turns out we\u2019re not the only ones who are thinking in these terms.\n\nDonny Deutsch has known Donald Trump for twenty years, though not particularly amicably. Deutsch is also a longtime friend of Michael Cohen. This means Deutsch is in position to know about just how criminally ugly things are in general inside the Trump Organization and Trump real estate empire. Deutsche appeared on Hardball with Chris Matthews on Wednesday evening and predicted that Trump\u2019s assets will indeed be seized while he\u2019s still in office.\n\nThere are a few different ways this can happen. New York State just launched a criminal investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s insurance fraud. It can hit him with huge fines and then begin seizing his bank accounts or real estate properties in the state. New York State is also likely to hit Trump for state income tax fraud. That\u2019s before getting to the question of whether the DOJ can seize Trump\u2019s assets while he\u2019s in office. In any case, the longer Trump holds the White House hostage, the more of his properties he\u2019s likely to lose."

Ivanka recently denied that her father had anything whatsoever to do with her husband Jared\u2019s security clearance. As information continues to come to light, not only did Trump demand clearance for Jared, but he did the same for Ivanka. Et tu, Ivanka?\n\nIvanka was adamant in her denials during an interview with Abby Huntsman of The View. \u201cThere were anonymous leaks about there being issues. But the president had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband\u2019s clearance\u2014zero.\u201d Ivanka took things one step further, claiming that there were no problems with either of their clearances \u201cother than a backlog.\u201d Sure, Ivanka. Memos from both John Kelly and Don McGahn paint a different picture: red flags were found by intelligence personnel on both of them.\n\nAccording to CNN, while Trump can grant clearances, that task is usually left to those who better know the process. Despite this, after Kelly and McGahn declined to grant the clearances, Trump apparently took things into his own (little) hands and granted the clearances, despite the misgivings of the intelligence community. Of course, we all know how Trump feels about our intelligence community. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s much smarter than all of them combined.\n\nInterestingly, even though Ivanka\u2019s rejection could have been triggered by issues from her husband Jared\u2019s rejection, a source tells CNN that officials \u201chad concerns about granting Trump a clearance that were separate from those raised about her husband.\u201d This family is looking more and more like some type of crime syndicate, and John Kelly apparently knew it. The couple allegedly told others that Kelly \u201cwas blocking them\u201d because \u201che did not feel like they belonged in the West Wing,\u201d according to CNN. John Kelly has been doing this for a very long time. I daresay his experience tells him what constitutes a danger to the U.S. as opposed to some petty reason put forth by Kushner and Trump. But, I keep forgetting that the Trumps believe themselves to be above reproach and the law.\n\nAnderson Cooper spoke with Kristen Powers of USA Today and former RNC Chief of Staff Mike Shields. Cooper is correct that Ivanka has no expertise in anything even remotely related to governance, and Kushner likewise has no expertise in peace negotiations. Shields\u2019 contention that because Kushner is a businessman, he is savvy in negotiations, is ridiculous. No, he\u2019s not. He is, for the most part, a failed businessperson. This is a clear case of nepotism that holds absolutely no value to the American people. Indeed, Trumps actions invariably do much more harm than good. It needs to end now."

We\u2019re assuming that portions of it will be redacted, at least for now, due to the nature of the ongoing criminal investigations. But we already know one key piece of what transpired today, and apparently two, and let\u2019s just say that two of Trump\u2019s people are likely headed to prison as a result of it.\n\nFirst came the news that Michael Cohen provided the committee with documents today proving that Donald Trump\u2019s criminal defense attorney Jay Sekulow instructed him to lie under oath to Congress in 2017 about Trump Tower Moscow. Considering that Cohen is headed to prison for lying under oath to Congress, it seems a given that Sekulow will now head to prison with him.\n\nThen came the apparently related news that Rudy Giuliani sent two unnamed attorneys to dangle a pardon in front of Michael Cohen after his office was raided by the FBI. That\u2019s conspiracy to commit felony obstruction of justice, and it means Rudy should also be packing his toothbrush for prison. So two of Trump\u2019s lawyers are facing prison, and those are just the two scandals that have surfaced so far in relation to Cohen\u2019s testimony today. Just wait until the transcript gets published."

New revelations are showing that when it comes to his academic record, the sitting president is both a liar and a hypocrite. For years, Trump has bragged about his \u201cvery, very large brain\u201d and \u201cgood marks,\u201d but he has yet to prove any of it. Now it turns out that Trump\u2019s efforts to hide his grades is an even bigger coverup than we thought just last week.\n\nLast week, Michael Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee that he threatened Trump\u2019s schools not to release any grades to any person for any reason. Cohen revealed a copy of the 2015 letter he sent to Fordham, which Trump attended for a couple of years before transferring to Wharton. The letter itself is so weird it is almost laughable. After a page of over-the-top belligerence, Cohen switched to playing good cop in a single-line postscript, lavishing praise on Fordham and declaring his client\u2019s love for the school.\n\nNow we are learning that Trump\u2019s obsession with hiding his grades actually started years earlier. Even crazier, these efforts came at the same time the hypocrite-in-chief attacked a potential opponent for having and hiding bad grades. Back in April 2011, Trump called then-candidate Barack Obama a \u201cterrible student.\u201d He wondered aloud how Obama could have gotten accepted into Columbia and Harvard Law School, and he demanded that Obama release his academic records.\n\nAccording to new reporting by the Washington Post, the superintendent of the New York Military Academy that Trump attended as a teenager was \u201caccosted by prominent, wealthy alumni who were Mr. Trump\u2019s friends.\u201d It appears these Trump cronies tried to bully the school into handing over his files while taking advantage of the fact that their alma mater was facing financial troubles. But the superintendent, Jeffrey Coverdale, instead moved all of Trump\u2019s embarrassing files to a secret, secure location. Unlike our \u201cstable genius\u201d president, that superintendent was no dunce."

Cohen underlined this point today when he showed up to Congress with a few suitcases full of evidence in hand, making for a stunning visual in front of the television cameras. So what was inside the suitcases?\n\nThe only thing we know so far is that Michael Cohen brought documents proving that Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers instructed him to lie to Congress in 2017. That\u2019s suborning perjury and obstruction of justice, so assuming the evidence holds up, Trump\u2019s lawyers will have to cut a plea deal against him or go to prison. But that\u2019s just the start of what today brought.\n\nFor all we know, Cohen\u2019s three suitcases could have been mostly empty. Maybe it was mostly for show. Or maybe he brought his own copies of the documents that the House Judiciary Committee just requested from eighty-one Trump related people and entities. That, of course, is the whole point. These people all now have to worry that if they simply destroy incriminating documents, they might get nailed for it, because House Democrats may now have the documents anyway.\n\nConsidering that Michael Cohen apparently sent Jay Sekulow to prison today, the rest of Donald Trump\u2019s people have to very much worry that Cohen\u2019s suitcases might have been full of evidence against them as well. They\u2019re now in a no-win situation. Do they turn over the documents? Do they refuse to cooperate and cross their fingers? Do they just cut plea deals now? Any innocent people have nothing to worry about, but any guilty people are now screwed."

Now, in a separate but similar storyline, it looks like Cohen has also just sent Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani to prison.\n\nRudy Giuliani apparently sent two other unnamed lawyers to approach Michael Cohen after his office was raided by the FBI, in an effort at preventing Cohen from cooperating with prosecutors, according to a new report from ABC News. The report doesn\u2019t explicitly say as much, but it\u2019s fairly clear that this story is a result of Cohen having sold Giuliani out for it. This comes one day after the Wall Street Journal separately reported that Giuliani dangled a pardon at Cohen after the raid. Why is this such a big deal?\n\nIn short, Rudy Giuliani committed felony obstruction of justice by telling Michael Cohen that he would end up being pardoned if he refused to cooperate with the investigation. Perhaps more importantly, Rudy dragged these other two unnamed attorneys into his conspiracy to obstruct justice, and the odds are good that they\u2019ll cut plea deals against Rudy in order to avoid going to prison. This is on top of whatever evidence and testimony Cohen has provided about this incident.\n\nThis means Rudy Giuliani is definitely going to prison, unless he cuts a plea deal of his own against Donald Trump. One thing to keep in mind: there is no attorney-client privilege when an attorney and client conspire to commit crimes together, so Rudy can easily testify against Trump on this and other similar matters."

As Palmer Report has pointed out, a House Oversight Committee document request has sent scores of Trump allies and toadies into a frenzy that is sure to lead to further legal issues as some jump ship, while others sink with it, maneuvering and backstabbing along the way.\n\nAllen Weisselberg appears to have stopped participating in Trump\u2019s illegal Cohen payoffs as early as 2017, and Congress is likely targeting him for a public hearing. And everyone saw how affected Trump was by Cohen\u2019s testimony, leading to his disastrous early exit from the already pointless Kim Jong Un summit. Americans generally don\u2019t respond well in the polls to clear diplomatic losses to dictators, especially when the president admits that he lost because he was rattled by congressional oversight.\n\nThis is how Trump\u2019s ouster is going to happen: death by 1,000 cuts rather than one or two major bombshells. While Trump may very well be forced out of office before next year\u2019s election, he\u2019s reportedly looking at reelection as the only way to save himself. That\u2019s why this poll matters, along with serving as a somewhat useful, yet rough, way to track the public\u2019s feelings about Trump as multiple investigations continue.\n\nBut it\u2019s a new Quinnipiac poll that really stands out, as it demonstrates that most Americans believe that Trump has committed crimes at some point in his life. Those polled were not as willing to say that they believe Trump has committed crimes while in office, but it indicates that Americans won\u2019t be surprised if it comes to light that he has.\n\nNot only does such polling provide a small bit of relief for frustrated Americans on the 2020 front, it makes investigators\u2019 jobs easier, whether they\u2019re working for Robert Mueller, the State of New York, or House Democrats. Taking down a president, even one so obviously corrupt and damaging as Donald Trump, is a heavy political lift. The more public support for Trump\u2019s removal, the lighter it gets, and if Americans already believe that Trump committed past crimes, they\u2019re much more likely to be compelled by evidence of new ones. And if he survives to run again next year, a lot of Democrats in the running now are favored to send him home so he can face justice as a private citizen."

Trump attended, or just after. There was a photo that was an overhead satellite image showing such developments in the story.\n\nHowever, Trump, who has told his Cult 45 followers not to believe what they see or hear, but trust him only, has now stated that he does not believe such reports. According to Kaitlin Collins on Twitter, citing pool reporter Peter Baker, we have a president who is once again denying that one of his BDFF (Best Dictator Friends Forever) is doing something that is wrong:\n\nAsked about the report of North Korea rebuilding missile test facilities, President Trump said he would \u201cbe very disappointed if that is happening,\u201d but added, \u201cIt\u2019s a very early report.\u201d Per pooler @peterbakernyt Trump: \u201cI would be very disappointed in Chairman Kim but I don\u2019t think I will be.\u201d\n\nWhy Trump refers to it as \u201ca very early report\u201d is beyond comprehension. Not only is the Washington Post reporting from sources who have reviewed the activities, but they literally have a satellite photo showing there has been activity. For example, Jeffrey Lewis, a scholar quoted in the referenced article, noted that some imagery that was \u201clow-resolution imagery\u201d showed some activity in the period between February 18 and February 22, but that the satellite images make clear what was happening. Lewis stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not great news. They may have known the summit was not going to go well.\u201d\n\nAgain, we have Donald Trump arguing that what we see is not what is happening, presumably because his BDFF Kim Jong-Un told him so and what reason would he have to lie? We continue to be under the leadership of a dangerous man who apparently will not believe calamity is about to hit until too late to address."

    "text": "The newly explosive investigations into Donald Trump\u2019s scandals by the House Judiciary, Intelligence, and Oversight Committees have largely pushed Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the background, at least when it comes to the attention span of the media and the public. The false reports about Mueller\u2019s probe \u201cwinding down\u201d haven\u2019t helped either. But Mueller is sitting on a ton of indictments, and I can prove it with just two words.\n\nBear with me here, because those two words are \u201cJerome Corsi.\u201d Yes he\u2019s a whack job, and no, I don\u2019t believe a word he says. But here\u2019s the kicker. Robert Mueller threatened to indict Corsi for perjury, and even went so far as to give Corsi a copy of the draft indictment. We know this happened because Corsi ended up publicly releasing the draft \u2013 and if it had been some kind of fake, Mueller would have said as much.\n\nThis draft indictment was an obvious attempt at scaring Corsi into cutting a plea deal and flipping on Roger Stone. It didn\u2019t work, as Corsi decided he\u2019d rather go about things the stupid way. But Mueller has shown that he has no tolerance for this kind of crap, so he will indict Corsi for perjury. The question is why he hasn\u2019t done it yet.\n\nAt the time, some observers speculated that perhaps Robert Mueller has lost his ability to indict anyone, because Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker had somehow magically put a stop to it all. But then Mueller turned around and indicted Roger Stone, proving that he still has the ability to indict anyone he wants. So again, why didn\u2019t he indict Corsi?\n\nThe logical explanation is that Robert Mueller didn\u2019t see a point in indicting Jerome Corsi yet, because Corsi is a small fish and he\u2019s not going to flip anyway. This tells us that Corsi\u2019s indictment is sitting in a pile somewhere of sealed indictments that Mueller is going to unleash at the end of the game, and Mueller is going to let the relevant U.S. Attorneys take on the burden of carrying out these prosecutions after he\u2019s finished his report. If Mueller is saving Corsi for the end, then he\u2019s saving a whole boatload of indictments for the end. We just don\u2019t know when the \u201cend\u201d is."

    "text": "Donald Trump has a lot of problems right now, to say the least. He\u2019s fending off too many congressional and criminal investigations to count. His foreign policy agenda has failed. His domestic policy agenda no longer exists. His kids are being targeted by prosecutors. You name it, everything is going wrong for Trump. But now he has a larger problem, which speaks directly to how much longer he can hold off before he\u2019s ousted.\n\nI always caution Palmer Report readers never to treat one new poll as if it were the only poll. For instance the media keeps focusing on Donald Trump\u2019s top outlier approval rating poll one week, then his bottom outlier approval rating poll the next week, dishonestly getting people worked up over it all, even as his approval rating has largely remained steady for the past year. But last night we got a very different kind of poll, and it tells us where this is headed.\n\nThe new Quinnipiac poll tells us that fifty percent of Americans believe Michael Cohen over Donald Trump, while only thirty-five percent of Americans believe Trump over Cohen, with the rest the people unsure. Again, this is just one poll, but it\u2019s the first of its kind, so it\u2019s all we have to work with. Because the margin here is so large, unless this poll is off by a whopping fifteen points, we now know that more Americans believe Cohen than Trump. That\u2019s remarkable, considering that everyone knows Cohen is a liar and a criminal.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this is based solely on first impressions of Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony, and the smattering of physical evidence he brought with him. This is before more influential Trump people like Allen Weisselberg take the stand, and bring far more evidence. This is before Robert Mueller reveals the incriminating evidence that Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, Don McGahn, Steve Bannon, and other cooperators have provided against Trump.\n\nDonald Trump is already down to just one-third of the country holding him in higher esteem than liar and criminal Michael Cohen. That number will keep dropping as more and better witnesses publicly testify in the coming days and weeks. Trump\u2019s base is perhaps 15% to 20% of the country. They may never give up on him, but that doesn\u2019t matter. He can\u2019t sustain his presidency with just his base. He needs those people in the middle who make up the rest of his approval rating.\n\nForget about Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating for now, as that\u2019s the kind of poll where the people in the middle are still trying to give a sitting president the benefit of the doubt until Trump\u2019s crimes are comprehensively proven to them. Instead, pay attention to this new poll that says Trump is already in sub-Cohen territory when it comes to trustworthiness. That tells us the people in the middle think Trump is guilty, and it\u2019s a predictor of what they\u2019re likely to say in approval rating polls once all the evidence of Trump\u2019s crimes has been laid out for them in the coming weeks."

One was signed by Donald Trump, while the other was signed by Donald Trump Jr and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. This stood out as potentially odd; why would the payment method change like that? Now more checks have been revealed, and suffice it to say that something went terribly wrong during the payment process.\n\nSeveral of the reimbursement checks sent to Michael Cohen have now been obtained by the New York Times, and they reveal a clear pattern. The checks were initially being cut by the Trump Organization, which was consistent with the phony cover story that they were mere employee paychecks to Cohen. These were the checks were signed by Trump Jr and Weisselberg. Then partway through, Cohen started receiving checks signed by Donald Trump, from what appear to be his personal bank account.\n\nThis means that at some point during the repayment process, the Trump Organization decided to stop cutting these checks to Michael Cohen, forcing Donald Trump to start paying Cohen directly. Trump certainly wouldn\u2019t have wanted to do it this way, as it was more work for him, and more legal exposure for him. This almost certainly means that someone in the Trump Organization refused to keep participating in the criminal payments.\n\nThe only known adult in the Trump Organization is Allen Weisselberg, so the most logical conclusion is that partway through the payments, Weisselberg concluded that they were all going to get busted for it, and he tried to put a stop to it. Considering that this occurred in late 2017, you have to wonder just how long Weisselberg has been cooperating with prosecutors. Looks like this whole thing went terribly wrong for Trump a long time ago."

Tom Barrack, Trump inaugural chairman, has decided to cooperate with the House Judiciary Committee and fork over the requested documents, according to CNBC. This is significant.\n\nBarrack is part of the billionaire real estate bunch. His dealings with Trump have resulted in Trump buying from him a stake in Alexander\u2019s Department Store and the Plaza Hotel, both of which Trump lost. He\u2019s also got his fingers in the Jared Kushner sinking ship of 666 Fifth Avenue. The one thing to know about Barrack is that he\u2019s been around the block. He\u2019s worked in government before and seems to have made his own money legitimately. It is doubtful he suffers fools unless he wants to. In Michael Wolff\u2019s book, FIRE AND FURY, Barrack allegedly describes Trump as, \u201cnot only crazy,\u201d but, \u201cstupid.\u201d Barrack denies having said these these, but he\u2019s taken no action against Wolff.\n\nRobert Mueller already interviewed Tom Barrack a year ago. So Barrack already knows the gist of the investigation. He\u2019s not the kind of guy who\u2019s willing to do time to protect Trump. And by all accounts, he keeps his books clean.\n\nBarrack seems to hang with the Saudis enough to know how to keep himself just on the side of legal activity (moral activity will have to be discussed at another time). But the big gauge of Barrack\u2019s future behavior centers on Paul Manafort. Barrack has been friends with Manafort since the 70s, and he reportedly recommended Manafort for the job of campaign manager. So Tom Barrack has got to be scared out of his mind.\n\nTom Barrack knows he can\u2019t pull a fast one. He knows he can\u2019t lie. And he knows he can\u2019t refuse to cooperate. He is jumping to stay out of prison, and, deliciously, his only question to any investigation, is, \u201chow high?\u201d The other iceberg is the investigation into the insurance broker for the Trump Organization. That\u2019s gonna leave a mark, not just on Trump, but his kids. As we\u2019ve said before, the Trumptanic is going down and now isn\u2019t the time for Trump\u2019s people to whine on Twitter. No, folks, now is the time to hire every lawyer you can afford, cooperate, and beg for mercy."

The U.K. Supreme Court has ordered Trump to pay the Scottish government\u2019s legal fees stemming from a multi-year lawsuit that he filed. History seems to eerily repeat itself where Trump is concerned.\n\nAfter Trump purchased land in Scotland in 2006 to build \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest golf course\u201d on the Aberdeenshire Coast (BBC), he became entangled with neighbors to his property, Moira and David Milne. Trump erected fencing along the Milnes\u2019 property to separate them from the course, and pouring salt in the wound, sent the Milnes a bill for part of the fencing. Sound familiar? The Milnes now have a Mexican flag next to their Scottish flag \u201cin solidarity with [Mexico]\u201d according to the BBC, because of Trump\u2019s promise to build the wall and make Mexico pay for it. No wonder he was so bold with that promise. Little did we know that he has done this in the past.\n\nTrump was further stymied in his endeavors by the introduction of a wind farm, which he claimed ruined the view from his golf course and hotel. He sued. As the suit worked its way through the courts, the Scottish government won at every level, ultimately prevailing in the U.K. Supreme Court, which has ordered Trump to reimburse the government. How did Trump react to his loss? By tweeting, of course: \u201cVery proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Also, furthers U.K. relationship!\u201d Really?\n\nWalter Shaub, former head of U.S. Office of Government Ethics, who almost immediately resigned when Trump took office, points out that Trump continues to violate the Emoluments Clause. Shaub now advises Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which has sued Trump, and responded to his tweet: \u201cThere it is. The president is using an official statement as an ad for his business and making sure everyone knows he ties his business to US relationships with foreign countries.\u201d Shaub adds: \u201cThis is Trump\u2019s most explicit commingling of personal interests and public office to date.\u201d\n\nSo, is Donald Trump stupid or is he just arrogant enough to believe he will continue to get away with his inappropriate actions? I vote for the latter, though I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very bright either. Even though Trump allegedly turned over control of his businesses to his sons, Trump still owns the businesses and as a result is profiting from them, which seemingly violates the clause. His repeated \u201cvictory tweets\u201d about his businesses certainly don\u2019t help. Trump thinks he\u2019s untouchable. Perhaps a more apropos nickname for him is \u201cThe Don\u201d as opposed to his much-loved \u201cThe Donald.\u201d Let\u2019s just hope he\u2019s not a Teflon Don. Wait \u2013 on second thought\u2026 who was it that took down the original Teflon Don? Oh right, Robert Mueller."

I\u2019ve never subscribed to this particular notion, because for all his numerous psychoses, Trump always cuts a deal and walks away when he knows he\u2019s lost (see his six bankruptcies). But Trump just made clear that he has something up his sleeve when it comes to not wanting to leave office.\n\nStuffed into the tenth paragraph of a largely unrelated New York Times article last night, we find this randomly inserted sentence: \u201cSome people close to Mr. Trump have privately predicted that he will ultimately choose to seek a second term in part because of his legal exposure if he is not president.\u201d There it is. Trump is under the impression that as long as he\u2019s the president, he won\u2019t face any criminal consequences.\n\nThis means that Donald Trump will be willing to cheat as brazenly and treasonously as possible during the 2020 election, under the premise that if he doesn\u2019t find a way to win, he\u2019ll go straight to prison. He\u2019s right. The very minute that Trump is no longer president, he\u2019ll be arrested and arranged on criminal charges. In fact various state and federal prosecutorial entities will be fighting over who gets to cuff the bastard first.\n\nFor that reason, Donald Trump cannot be allowed to be a participant in the 2020 election. That means he must be ousted from office before the election. The House Democrats, Robert Mueller, the SDNY, and every other involved entity therefore have no choice but to force Trump out of office by any and all legal means necessary. That means impeachment, indictment, asset seizures, arresting his kids, all of it. The continued existence of the American democracy now rests upon it."

But that\u2019s not the point. The fate of the national emergency was always going to be decided by the courts, not via legislation. The whole point of this Democratic Party-sponsored bill was to weaken Trump by getting the Republicans to start formally distancing themselves from him, and sure enough, it\u2019s done precisely that.\n\nFor his part, Mitch McConnell has decided that this is now entirely Donald Trump\u2019s problem. Trump will have to veto a bill that was passed by members of both parties, in both houses of Congress. He\u2019ll have to take sole ownership of his idiotic shutdown and his even more idiotic national emergency declaration.

Hearing Michael Cohen\u2019s depiction of Donald Trump\u2019s behavior vis-\u00e0-vis his role as head of the Trump Organization was in no way surprising. Actually, there was a single element of Trump\u2019s behavior that I found surprising, and it was that he \u201cspeaks in a code,\u201d which is something that I generally presume to require at least a faint understanding of subtlety, which is not something I intuitively associate with him.\n\nTo the greater point: speaking in code does not mean Trump didn\u2019t order Cohen and others to act illegally. Indeed, the whole point of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, yes RICO, was to close a loophole in which crime bosses were immune from prosecution simply because they instructed underlings to do things like \u201cshow our friend a toasty evening in\u201d (read: torch his house), or \u201che scratched my back, now it\u2019s time we scratched his\u201d (read: make an illegal payoff), but not actually commit these crimes themselves. With RICO, crime bosses are the target, and it doesn\u2019t matter if they speak in code, or didn\u2019t commit the crimes directly.\n\n\u201cRICO\u201d accusations are, unfortunately, popularly hurled at people in a way not dissimilar to how a chimpanzee hurls its feces at the zookeeper, which is to say, to make a stink. No matter how hard you try, RICO doesn\u2019t apply to your rival business owner who told his son to go bash in the windshield of your new truck. People try to use it often and, as a consequence, it\u2019s not always taken seriously.\n\nBut it really seems like RICO applies to Trump regarding his conduct at the Trump Organization. Take a look at this article from the Daily Beast and get a feel for it yourself. The question that remains then, is what does this mean for the Trump clan? Given the traditionally aggressive nature of the Southern District of New York, where it appears they\u2019re mounting a RICO case against the Trump Organization, it might mean the end. The Trumpocalypse. Don Jr., Eric, Ivanka, Weisselberg, and other top Organization officials could be charged by prosecutors citing the statutory requirements for RICO given the galaxy of crimes they\u2019ve committed over the years.\n\nBuilding a RICO case against Trump is virtually certain, but herein lies the big problem. Is SDNY able to charge Trump while in office? I think so, and not only because of the shaky and borderline misinterpreted grounds upon which we have a Justice Department policy of not indicting a sitting president. Think of it this way, from the perspective of the government servants at SDNY whose job it is to protect the people from criminals: do you knowingly let an active crime boss lead a nation of 325 million? Are we serving the people by letting this continue? Let\u2019s see if SDNY can get something to stick to this Teflon Don. I\u2019m hopeful."

He\u2019s removing a key Trump-Russia scandal prosecutor by offering her a major, and perhaps not optional, promotion. Here\u2019s the thing: it\u2019s going to flop.\n\nDonald Trump is nominating Jessie Liu to be the new number three person at the Department of Justice. The good news is that Liu appears to be on the up-and-up. The trouble is that she\u2019s currently the U.S. Attorney for Washington DC, and by promoting her, Trump is creating an opening that he\u2019ll then get to fill. In theory, Trump could pick a corrupt loyalist to replace her, and suddenly that loyalist would be overseeing the criminal cases against Roger Stone and Samuel Patten, among others.\n\nSounds scary, right? But we\u2019ve heard this story before, just with different names. Back when Donald Trump fired Preet Bharara as the U.S. Attorney for the SDNY, he replaced Bharara with his own buddy Geoffrey Berman. But then Berman recused himself, and the SDNY went on to bust Michael Cohen, and is still targeting Trump and his henchmen. Back when Trump appointed Matt Whitaker as Acting Attorney General, that was supposed to magically get Trump off the hook, but that also went nowhere. For that matter, Trump appointed Rod Rosenstein back in the day, with the expectation that Rosenstein would magically get him off the hook, and we all know how that one played out.\n\nIn fact, assuming Jessie Liu accepts this promotion, she\u2019ll be taking the place of Rachel Brand. Back when Brand resigned last year, everyone thought that was somehow going to magically get Trump off the hook. But it just never happens. Trump keeps tepidly shuffling the DOJ deck, and it keeps doing nothing to stop the criminal investigations into his scandals, or even slow those investigations down. There\u2019s no reason to expect this latest move to be any different."

Sure enough, the Washington Post is reporting this afternoon that Trump and his White House are indeed refusing to turn over the requested documents. That\u2019s the entire point, of course.\n\nNow the media is going to seize on the narrative that Donald Trump and the House Democrats are fighting over documents that expose Jared Kushner. The media loves nothing more than covering a political fight of this kind. The more they cover it, the more people will hear about why Kushner\u2019s security clearance was denied. It\u2019s not a coincidence that House Democrats just made a criminal referral against Kushner at the same time they demanded these documents about Kushner: they\u2019re pushing him front and center.\n\nThe kicker is that if John Kelly and Don McGahn were so worried about Donald Trump\u2019s abuses with regard to Jared Kushner that they wrote memos distancing themselves from it, you can bet they didn\u2019t merely hand in the memos to the White House. They surely kept copies of their own, in order to protect themselves. By all accounts, Kelly and McGahn are both cooperating with investigators.\n\nSo it\u2019s likely that Elijah Cummings already has their Kushner memos. He sent the document request to the Trump White House specifically to bait Donald Trump into refusing to cooperate. Now it\u2019s a much bigger scandal. House Democrats are playing Trump like a fiddle."

In the last election season, it was fashionable for the GOP-led Congress to say Democrats were about anarchy and open borders, but with each passing day, it\u2019s clear the Republicans don\u2019t have any alternate plans of their own.\n\nIf Donald Trump just had a bad day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can\u2019t be having one that\u2019s a whole lot better. Nearly two weeks ago, he announced his support for Trump\u2019s blatant subversion of democracy, and his own surrender of power just so this administration could seize the funds for a steel monument to racism and ignorance. More than a dozen House Republicans voted to overrule the national emergency, and now there are far more than enough votes to overrule this bout of insanity in the Senate.\n\nIt is now required that McConnell hold a vote to kill the national emergency \u2013 the first time a Congress has done so in history. Donald Trump will probably veto it, leaving the decision up to the courts, but his party has no plans to go down with the ship. Aside from his veto, he has nothing left. It\u2019s also hardly the moderates who are voting against the national emergency. Far right Republican Senator Rand Paul officially came out against it, worried about the precedent it would set for a future administration \u2013 and he actually went so far as to speculate that even Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would rule against it were SCOTUS to decide the outcome.\n\nThe wall has become a thorn in the side for the GOP. First they thought Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t win the election on the idea, then they thought that he would simply walk away from the promise \u2013 or keep delaying it, as they helped him to do while running both houses. At each step of the way, they thought the problem would somehow take care of itself. Now the message is clear: it\u2019s all on Trump\u2019s shoulders, and the Republicans have no desire to prop it up, particularly heading into a tough 2020 election where twenty-two of them \u2013 McConnell included \u2013 are facing potentially close races."

Trump\u2019s theft of the presidency has resulted in most of his henchmen and friends being on their way to prison, his kids being targeted for criminal prosecution, and his entire real estate crime syndicate in danger of being exposed and dismantled.\n\nIt turns out the \u201cdumbest\u201d member of the Trump family is the first one to figure out that it was all a mistake, or at least he\u2019s the first to publicly admit it. That\u2019s right, Eric Trump is the most prescient one of the bunch. He appeared on Fox & Friends and he was asked if it was \u201cworth it\u201d for the Trump \u201cfamily dynamics be put on this type of pressure\u201d (translation: everyone in the family in danger of going to prison). Eric coughed up an interesting answer.\n\nEric Trump said this response to whether \u201cwinning\u201d the presidency was worth it: \u201cHave I thought it in my mind? Have I said it casually at dinner with my wife? A hundred percent \u2026 I mean, this was a billionaire who gave up an unbelievable life to go get punched on the chin every single day, to get abused, and quite frankly, as a family we\u2019ve done that as well.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Eric Trump clearly does not think any of this was worth it. That\u2019s remarkable when you consider that he might be the least likely to end up in prison of any Trump family member, if only because Donald Trump thought Eric was too stupid to be trusted with the adult crime stuff. The rest of the Trump family is going to end up being far more regretful than Eric Trump sounds right now."

At the time, Palmer Report said that Trump had just unwittingly taken the bait, because he was opening the door for it to become a much bigger scandal that would get a lot more media attention. But even we didn\u2019t see something this big coming this soon: it turns out it\u2019s all about Ivanka.\n\nDonald Trump also pressured former top White House officials John Kelly and Don McGahn to grant Ivanka Trump a security clearance, after they recommended against giving her such a clearance, according to new reporting from CNN. This means that, by definition, Kelly and McGahn thought Ivanka was some kind of security risk to the United States. No, really.\n\nSo now we know that the Jared Kushner security clearance scandal is also an Ivanka Trump security clearance scandal. No wonder Donald Trump is trying to fight so hard against the details of this scandal surfacing. It\u2019s not just that Trump improperly ordered that Jared and Ivanka be given security clearances. It\u2019s that there are unknown specific reasons why Kelly and McGahn thought Jared and Ivanka were security risks. If investigators get their way, we\u2019re going to find out precisely what those reasons were.\n\nThe kicker is that even if Donald Trump\u2019s White House illegally ran the John Kelly and Don McGahn memos through a shredder a long time ago, it\u2019s nearly a given that Kelly and McGahn still have copies of their own memos. They\u2019re both widely reported to already be cooperating with Robert Mueller. The House Judiciary Committee just asked them both to turn over all relevant documents. Our guess is this Ivanka-Jared security risk scandal is going to surface very soon."

    "text": "When the House Judiciary Committee requested documents from eighty-one Trump related people and entities yesterday, one name stood out conspicuously by its absence: Ivanka Trump. After all, her husband Jared Kushner, and her siblings Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, were both on the list. Now the Ivanka story has taken a rather strange \u2013 and confusing \u2013 turn.\n\nWhen House Judiciary Committee staffers were asked yesterday specifically about Ivanka Trump\u2019s absence from the list, they simply responded that more names were coming \u201csoon.\u201d So we know that the committee does plan to include Ivanka, just not quite yet. Then House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler confirmed last night that all of the requests sent yesterday are for documents that have already been requested by Robert Mueller or prosecutors. Apparently the committee has decided to do a massive catch-up operation first, before deciding what new evidence to seek out.\n\nBut if Ivanka Trump wasn\u2019t included in Monday\u2019s document requests, and those requests were all about obtaining all of the documents that prosecutors have already sought out, then by definition, that would mean Mueller hasn\u2019t yet sought any documents from Ivanka. This is really strange, considering that the inclusion of Don Jr, Eric, and Kushner yesterday means that Mueller has requested documents from all of them. So what\u2019s going on here?\n\nThere are only a few hypothetical possibilities here, and each seems stranger than the last. The first would be that Robert Mueller is not even bothering to investigate Ivanka Trump, even though he\u2019s investigating so many other Trump family members. This is possible, but it would fly in the face of previous reporting that Mueller is probing the Trump Soho real estate deal, which has long been a suspected money laundering front, and previous reporting that Ivanka helped take the lead on the Trump Soho deal.\n\nIs it really possible that Robert Mueller isn\u2019t bothering to investigate Ivanka Trump? Even if Mueller has determined that she is innocent, how could he know that without at least asking for her relevant documents first? There is a second potential explanation, which would be that Mueller hasn\u2019t bothered to interact with Ivanka because she\u2019s the primary target in all of this, as prosecutors sometimes build cases against the kingpin based entirely on evidence provided by other people. But all of the available evidence points to Donald Trump Jr, and not Ivanka, having played a key role in the Trump-Russia election scandal. There is no known evidence that Ivanka is the kingpin of this scandal.\n\nThere is yet another hypothetical possibility, but it might be the strangest one of all: Ivanka Trump secretly cut a plea deal with Robert Mueller against her entire family a long time ago, and that\u2019s why he never had to send her a document request. Does that make sense to anyone? Really, none of these explanations make any instinctive sense. But there has to be some reason Mueller hasn\u2019t asked Ivanka for documents, even while hitting up her husband, her brothers, and her father. In any case, the House Judiciary Committee is indicating that it plans to include her eventually, so take it all for whatever it\u2019s worth."

I don\u2019t recall much about the speech \u2013 I was nervously contemplating what would turn out to be four hours and seventeen minutes of private discomfort \u2013 but I do recall bits of it. He congratulated us on our coming tour of the five boroughs of that wonderful city. He received a respectful smattering of applause at the end of it, together with a bit of good-natured jeering \u2013 there were many New Yorkers among us, after all.\n\nFor my part I had a grudging respect for the man. He was a Republican, true, but he had been significant, if not instrumental, in transforming a city I loved from an unsafe one to one of the safest, for its size, in the world. His finest hour, in the aftermath of September 11, was yet to come.\n\nI can only imagine what reception that same speech would garner Rudy today. A wall of hate. A cacophony of rage. New Yorkers have never held back about voicing their disdain, and Rudy Giuliani is now justly disdained by the world.\n\nNow the probability is that he\u2019s being investigated by the Southern District of New York for offering Michael Cohen a justice-obstructing presidential pardon in exchange for refusing to testify to Congress. That\u2019s the very district for which Rudy was once United States Attorney. Back in that era Rudy was a man to respect. While Donald Trump was busy being what he always was, a clown, a punchline, a rube, Rudy\u2019s was a name that carried a discernible weight and gravitas.\n\nUnfortunately for many, telling a lie and getting away with it is the same as telling the truth, committing a crime and getting away with it is the same as being law abiding. The overriding miscalculation of many people crowded around Donald Trump was that they could lie, commit crimes and get away with it. Rudy Giuliani\u2019s miscalculation was trusting and believing in Donald Trump. And for that he\u2019s traded, not a great name, but certainly a good one, for a name that has earned him a place on the ash heap of history. A name that will never be mourned save by the disgruntled ignorant, the moral leprechauns, the people who, let\u2019s face it, ultimately amount to nothing and contribute less."

After Michael Cohen\u2019s devastating testimony, Trump was in such a foul mood, he packed up and left without even going through the motions of finishing his sham summit. Now it turns out to have been far more of a disaster than we knew.\n\nJust forty-eight hours after Donald Trump bailed on the summit, Kim Jong-Un and North Korea immediately began rebuilding a long range missile site, according to an ugly new report tonight from NBC News. In other words, not only is Kim flouting the restrictions that the United States has tried to place on him, he\u2019s flaunting the fact that he\u2019s flouting it.\n\nIn other words, Kim Jong-Un is rubbing it all in Donald Trump\u2019s face. Our educated guess has always been that Kim was only willing to participate in this sham of a summit as a courtesy to his boss Vladimir Putin, and that Donald Trump went along with it for the same reason.\n\nKim Jong-Un was clearly never willing to even consider giving anything away to Donald Trump, and now we can see that Kim is intent on flexing his muscles on the world stage. Trump is just that weak and impotent, and everyone knows it. Now Kim is racing to try to complete his long range nuclear program, and there will be nothing the U.S. can do to stop it until after Trump has been ousted."

Instead, Cohen\u2019s testimony broke down the doors that Trump had been hiding his criminal enterprise behind, and allowed everyone \u2013 including the media, the public, and prosecutors \u2013 to see what was on the other side. Sure enough, New York State just seized on it.\n\nNew York State just revealed a criminal investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s history of insurance fraud, and it\u2019s going about it in a novel way. Instead of trying to get the incriminating records by subpoenaing the Trump Organization, which might not work, New York is instead subpoenaing the Trump Organization\u2019s longtime insurance broker. The broker is surely willing to cooperate in order to remain in good standing with the state.\n\nNot surprisingly, Michael Cohen is mentioned four different times in today\u2019s New York Times article revealing the insurance fraud investigation. Cohen publicly accused Trump of multiple specific instances of insurance fraud during his testimony, and that\u2019s given New York State a legal basis for pursuing it. New York State may not be able to indict or arrest Donald Trump while he\u2019s in office (the Feds at SDNY have a better shot at pulling that off), the state can hit Trump with massive financial penalties for insurance fraud right now. And if Trump is too broke to pay those fines, the state can begin seizing his assets accordingly.\n\nThis is far from the only instance in which Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony has opened the door for prosecutors to target what\u2019s on the other side. Several of this week\u2019s House Judiciary Committee document requests appear to have been based on names that Cohen dropped during his testimony. In the end it won\u2019t matter so much whether the public believes Cohen. Instead it\u2019s about what his testimony has quickly led to."

    "text": "Based on everything that\u2019s been reported, Jared Kushner is almost certainly already under federal criminal investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the SDNY, the EDNY, and probably others as well. Kushner\u2019s alleged crimes range from financial fraud to conspiracy against the United States, and if he\u2019s convicted, he\u2019ll probably go to prison for the rest of his life. So if these criminal prosecutions are already well underway, why did the House Democrats decide to refer Kushner for criminal prosecution today?\n\nIn their criminal referral today, Congressmen Ted Lieu and Don Beyer have chosen to focus on one of the least severe, yet easily proven, criminal allegations against Jared Kushner: that he lied on his SF-86 security clearance form. It\u2019s nearly a given that Mueller and others in the DOJ are already criminally pursuing Kushner over this particular bit of perjury, as part of their broader cases against him. But this referral matters for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, even when someone is potentially facing life in prison for more severe charges, it\u2019s a common tactic to zero in on a process crime like perjury. Kushner may think he can go to trial and get off the hook on the more serious stuff, but juries nearly always convict on perjury when the evidence is there. If Kushner knows he\u2019s going to prison for perjury anyway, he may be more inclined to cut a plea deal on all of the charges.\n\nSecond, this prompts the media to focus on the fact that Jared Kushner is an alleged criminal who is seen as a security risk by the FBI, the CIA, and Trump\u2019s own former White House officials. The more the media talks about the criminality of the Trump family, the more it convinces the people in the middle that Donald Trump is running a crime racket.\n\nThird, this may bait Donald Trump into trying to meddle in the criminal case against Jared Kushner. Trump can\u2019t actually save Kushner from going to prison, thanks to the wide array of prosecutors targeting him, including New York State. But if Trump were to try to pardon Kushner on the security clearance perjury matter, it could significantly speed up Trump\u2019s downfall and ouster."

When he was the Chairman of the House Oversight Committee in 2015, he interviewed Hillary Clinton for 11 hours regarding Benghazi. Gowdy had the audacity to state this yesterday: \u201cWhat we learned this past week is how utterly useless public congressional hearings are. I think two closed-door sessions this past week on the Senate and House side with the intelligence committees were very helpful. That is why they\u2019re bringing Cohen back.\u201d\n\nHe also noted: \u201cLet me ask you this: What serious finder of fact can you name that identifies information in five-minute increments and does it on television and flips from one side to the other? Grand jury doesn\u2019t do it. Your local sheriff doesn\u2019t do it. The United States attorney doesn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nTrey Gowdy is correct about that. However, for him and other past and present GOP members of Congress to be complaining about the nature of House investigations, which involve names and matters that have been determined in the eyes of grand juries and trial juries and judges to be real crimes, is preposterous. The Republican Congress held four years of Benghazi hearings with eight different investigations, and found nothing. In fact, Gowdy later quietly admitted the investigations were politically motivated. In this instance, we have many criminal charges, many guilty pleas, and more to come in the near future. Trey and other GOP folks should sit tight and shut their \u201cGowdy damn\u201d mouths."

Even as that process plays out, the Democrats have already succeeded in pushing the media to focus heavily today on Kushner\u2019s status as an alleged criminal.\n\nTo be clear, a criminal referral is not a criminal indictment. Jared Kushner will not be magically arrested tomorrow as a result of this referral. Nothing moves that quickly. That said, we\u2019ve already seen in this investigation that congressional criminal referrals do result in indictments when the referrals are valid in nature. For instance the Senate Intelligence Committee made such a referral against Republican operative Samuel Patten, and he ended up a convicted felon for it. So this could result in Kushner\u2019s arrest, just not his immediate arrest.\n\nBy rule, the Department of Justice will examine the criminal referral and make a decision about whether a criminal investigation and criminal charges are warranted. Congressman Ted Lieu, one of the people who made the referral, reminded everyone this morning that \u201cMaking false statements or omitting material info on SF-86 security form is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.\u201d So yeah, the DOJ will surely conclude that Kushner committed a felony and move forward accordingly, unless Trump tries to sabotage it.\n\nThat may be the whole point, of course. If Donald Trump wants to meddle in this very public criminal investigation into Jared Kushner over his SF-86, he\u2019ll have to do it in plain sight. That\u2019ll give House Democrats a more compelling case in convincing the American people that Trump is indeed a criminal. Meanwhile, Robert Mueller, the SDNY, and the EDNY are all believed to be building far larger and broader criminal cases against Kushner. House Democrats are merely taking the most straightforward of Kushner\u2019s alleged crimes and pushing it into the public arena."

    "text": "The House Judiciary Committee has created quite a stir by publishing a list of Trump-related people to whom it has sent requests for documents. This list is basically a who\u2019s who of the Trump world, and it crosses all the lines that Donald Trump drew in the sand at the beginning of the Robert Mueller investigation.\n\nSomewhat puzzlingly, the people on the list are arranged in alphabetical order by first names instead of last names, which gives the dubious honor of being number one to Allan Garten, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer at the Trump Organization. Garten hasn\u2019t been in this position for very long. His predecessor was Jason Greenblatt, who left the Trump Organization in January 2017 when he was appointed as an Assistant to the President and Special Representative for International Negotiations. Greenblatt\u2019s name is not on the list but it doesn\u2019t really need to be, because this is not a list of people who are going to be questioned by the Committee. It\u2019s a list of document requests, and all the documents related to business conducted by the Trump Organization can be obtained from its current legal counsel, Alan Garten.\n\nThe second name on the committee\u2019s list of document requests is also quite noteworthy: Alexander Nix, former CEO of Cambridge Analytica and a former director of the Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) Group. Cambridge Analytica, the now defunct data company, was enlisted to work on Trump\u2019s 2016 digital campaign by Steve Bannon. Bannon\u2019s name \u2013 quite unsurprisingly \u2013 is also on the list.\n\nThe fact that Nix is a British citizen raises some interesting legal issues regarding the involvement of foreign nationals in an American election campaign. The person most likely to shed some light on the question of Alexander Nix\u2019s involvement is a woman named Brittany Kaiser. She is a former business development director for Cambridge Analytica and she has become a cooperating witness for the Mueller investigation. And, yes, her name shows up on the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s list as well.\n\nAnother good person to ask about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s involvement would of course be Jared Kushner, who according to a Forbes article from November 22, 2016, effectively managed the campaign\u2019s online efforts at getting Donald Trump elected to the highest office in the United States. It is quite possible that Trump was also thinking of his son-in-law when he declared his family to be off-limits in the investigation. However, there is no need to speculate about how close the head of the Trump crime family feels to the man who became part of his clan through marriage \u2013 his two sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., have been awarded their own places on the list.\n\nWe can only hope that the man with the short fuse who has access to the nuclear codes will somehow find a non-destructive way to deal with this crossing of the lines he arbitrarily drew once upon a time. It seems that back then, quite astonishingly, Donald Trump was indeed unaware of the fact that \u2013 even as president \u2013 he was never in a position to draw these lines since he failed to divest himself of his businesses even after he was elected, and since any immunity a sitting president may have clearly does not extend to any or all of his family members."
