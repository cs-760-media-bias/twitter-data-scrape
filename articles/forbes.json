    "title": "4 Crypto Assets Break Above Key Moving Average, Leaving Bitcoin Behind",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Several well-known cryptocurrencies are trading above their 200-day moving averages, a development typically considered a sign of a healthy market.\n\nA moving average (MA) is simply an ongoing calculation of the closing prices of an asset over a specified period of time, but is also a tool traders use to gauge the asset\u2019s trend direction as well as support and resistance levels.\n\nWhile a moving average of any length can be used, the 200-day moving average is a standard in financial analysis. Put simply, an asset trading above the 200-day MA is considered bullish (likely to move higher), while one trading below it is considered bearish (likely to move lower).\n\nSince the long-time market leader bitcoin is not currently trading above its 200-day moving average, one could be forgiven for assuming all other cryptocurrencies are following its footsteps.\n\nHowever, that is not the case.\n\nSigns of life emerge\n\n\n\nOf the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization as per CoinMarketCap, both the BTC and USD pairs of litecoin (LTC), binance coin (BNB), Tron (TRX) and Maker (MKR) are currently trading above their respective 200-day moving averages.\n\nBoth pairs trading above the moving average indicates the markets for LTC, BNB, TRX, and MKR are much stronger than those with acceptance above just one trading pair moving average or those with acceptance above neither \u2013 most of which fall under the latter category.\n\nIndeed, the four cryptocurrencies have the most bullish markets, but as can be seen above, their performance is not yet the norm. Twelve of the top 20 cryptocurrencies have neither their BTC or USD trading pairs above the 200-day MA, and as the data below shows, several are still very far away.\n\nDistances to the 200-day MA\n\nOf the remaining top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap that are not trading above their USD-denominated 200-day MA, bitcoin cash (BCH) is by a large margin the farthest away from achieving a healthy market while EOS is the closest.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of BCH/USD would need to increase 124 percent in order to reach its 200-day moving average while EOS/USD would need to increase just 8 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork in November resulting in the creation of two new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin SV. Bitcoin Cash ABC retained the BCH/USD ticker on most exchanges so its longtime price history may not be the best reflection of the current state of the Bitcoin Cash ABC market, given the fork has existed less than 200 days.\n\nWhile it does express a weak market, an asset trading excessively far below its 200-day moving average is not always a negative indication. It can also be a sign of extreme oversold market conditions, similar to how the Mayer Multiple is used to gauge bitcoin\u2019s market conditions based on its relation to the 200-day MA.\n\nWith that in mind, the assets that are farthest from their respect 200-day moving averages like bitcoin cash and Zcash, which needs to increase 71 percent to reach its 200 day MA, could be seen as the most overdue for a positive correction.\n\nDisclosure: The author holds BTC, LTC, ETH, ZEC, AST, REQ, OMG, FUEL, ZIL, 1st and AMP at the time of writing.\n\nMarket image via Shutterstock; Charts by TradingView"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Cryptocurrency lending startup BlockFi has launched a crypto deposit account that provides compound interest.\n\nAnnouncing the news on Tuesday, the firm said that the BlockFi Interest Account (BIA) is now live and offers customers an annual interest rate of 6 percent, paid on a monthly basis in cryptocurrency. That monthly interest is then compounded to produce a 6.2 percent annual percentage yield or APY.\n\n\u201cIt helps crypto investors grow their wealth with one of the most powerful tools in finance \u2013 compound interest,\u201d Brad Michelson, director of marketing at BlockFi told CoinDesk.\n\nUsers from across the globe can deposit either bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) to earn interest from the offering and can withdraw their funds at any time, BlockFi said.\n\nAccount holdings are custodied at the Gemini Trust Company, co-founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to the announcement. Gemini Trust is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services and also offers insurance coverage for the digital assets it holds in custody.\n\nWhile the BIA looks rather like the crypto version of a traditional savings account, Michelson told CoinDesk that the product \u201cdoesn\u2019t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.\u201d\n\nThe executive further said that, as BlockFi\u2019s business also includes providing crypto loans to institutions, it can still afford the interest paid out, even if the prices of bitcoin and ether fall. \u201cWe charge more to the institutions borrowing the crypto from BlockFi then we pay to depositors,\u201d Michelson explained.\n\nThe BIA was first launched in beta version at the start of this year and already holds over $10 million in assets from retail and institutional investors, according to the firm\u2019s figures.\n\nBack in December, BlockFi raised $4 million in a round that was led by Akuna Capital, with participation from Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital Ventures and Anthony Pompliano\u2019s Morgan Creek Digital, among others.\n\nIt also raised $52.5 million last July, in a round led by Galaxy Digital, and further secured $1.55 million early in 2018 with backing from ConsenSys Ventures, SoFi, Kenetic Capital and others.\n\nDeposit box image via Shutterstock"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Blockchain device manufacturer startup Pundi X unveiled new specifications for its blockchain phone, which it plans to release to the public later this year.\n\nRevealed at the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona this week, the XPhone will let users switch between a traditional mode that supports Android apps and a \u201cblockchain mode,\u201d which will grant users access to decentralized apps (dapps) loaded on the device.\n\nCustomers will be able to make the switch with the push of a button, a blog post by Pundi X explained, adding that this feature is made possible by loading both an Android 9.0 operating system (OS) as well as Pundi\u2019s Android-based Function X OS.\n\n\u201cBlockchain-based calling and messaging can be toggled on and off on the phone operating system, which builds upon Android 9.0,\u201d Pundi X said Monday.\n\nFirst announced last year, the XPhone also claims to support carrier-free calling through its peer-to-peer network. The startup demonstrated that feature at the time.\n\nThough a working prototype was demonstrated in October, Pundi X\u2019s most recent blog post explained that the specifications have been upgraded, aiming to launch with a mid-range processor, 6 gigabytes of RAM and a number of other features. (A note on the specifications list states that its design is still subject to change).\n\nAt launch, the phone will retail for $599, meaning it is cheaper than other blockchain phones like the HTC EXODUS 1, the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the Sirin Labs Finney. However, according to the device\u2019s website, only 5,000 XPhones will be built. The company is currently targeting \u201clate 2019\u201d for release, though a specific date has not been announced.\n\nPundi X\u2019s demonstration is only the latest blockchain-related announcement at Mobile World Congress this week, following HTC, Samsung and Electroneum, which unveiled a crypto-mining smartphone this week \u2013 though that was a low-cost device targeting developing countries.\n\nXPhone images via Pundi X YouTube; Pundi X blog"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "UPDATE (12th February 2019 16:15 UTC): Ripple originally declined to comment on bonus packages, including whether they are still being offered in 2019. Following the publication of this article, a Ripple spokesperson offered the following statement:\n\n\u201cRipple does not offer engineering compensation packages that include XRP bonuses. In late 2018, we found out that a contracted recruiter was incorrectly suggesting to prospective employees that such packages were available. That individual has not worked on our behalf in months.\u201d\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSilicon Valley fintech startup Ripple goes out of its way to say it didn\u2019t create the cryptocurrency XRP. But that doesn\u2019t mean the company doesn\u2019t rely on its vast reserves of the token when courting prospective hires.\n\nOne engineer who asked to remain anonymous showed CoinDesk a recruiting email from late 2018 that promised an XRP package from Ripple of worth up to $3 million, in addition to a generous salary offer.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s LinkedIn, Ripple is looking to hire more than a dozen engineers and technical experts, including a new head of engineering for its xCurrent project, which aims to rival the legacy messaging network SWIFT at the center of the current global payments infrastructure.\n\nSalaries may vary according to seniority, but based on conversations with two prospective recruits, XRP bonuses for engineers generally range in value from $1 million to $6 million, according to the company\u2019s own evaluation. As of press time, XRP is trading at roughly $0.30 per token.\n\n(Ripple declined to comment on bonus packages, including whether they are still being offered in 2019.)\n\nOne former Ripple employee, who asked to stay anonymous for fear of legal retribution, told CoinDesk he never heard of such XRP bonus packages before 2017. However, he also noted generous equity deals are standard in Silicon Valley.\n\nIn September 2018, one prospective engineering recruit, who asked to remain anonymous because he works at a company that might someday collaborate with Ripple, told CoinDesk that he also received an email from a recruiter working on Ripple\u2019s behalf that stood out because it offered lucrative XRP packages, supposedly worth $3 million to $6 million. Both engineers currently work at top-tier tech companies in Silicon Valley, albeit the second programmer at a crypto company (thus the higher offer).\n\nAdditionally, the email claimed the global market cap of \u201cits [Ripple\u2019s] coin\u201d was worth $48 billion. According to CoinMarketCap, on the day the email was sent XRP\u2019s global market cap was closer to $13.3 billion. The prospective engineer recruit told CoinDesk he found this discrepancy alarming.\n\nSpeaking to the unusual bonus offering that caught his eye, the anonymous engineer said Ripple is \u201ca very unpopular entity in the crypto sphere among technologists,\u201d so he believes the company is \u201cforced to go above and beyond to attract engineers\u201d during the bear market.\n\nBear recruiting\n\nA Ripple representative told CoinDesk the company currently employs roughly 90 engineers and technology experts, with plans to hire \u201caggressively\u201d in order to expand its software as a service offering plus support RippleNet mobile wallets and payout processes.\n\nThis is part of an ongoing hiring spree. The company representative said that Ripple added 100 new employees across the company in 2018, adding:\n\n\u201cWe move fast to acquire the best talent out there \u2013 especially considering the highly competitive nature of other startups who want to hire similar candidates.\u201d\n\nFormer Ripple community liaison Jon Holmquist told CoinDesk that developer salaries and compensation are ballooning across Silicon Valley. As such, Holmquist said any hiring challenges might be related to the broader market downturn, not Ripple in particular.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to join crypto for the first time during a bear market. I think that\u2019s more of an industry-wide problem,\u201d Holmquist said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a shortage of talent.\u201d\n\nThe anonymous engineer disagreed, considering the other types of recruiting emails he routinely receives.\n\n\u201cThis is for a devops role, which is generally harder to find, but these are really big numbers,\u201d the anonymous engineer said, referring to both the salary and XRP bonus package. \u201cIt comes across a little bit desperate.\u201d\n\nSerial entrepreneur Dave Schukin tweeted last June that the company offered him more than $175,000 as a base salary, which appears consistent with the other offer shared with CoinDesk.\n\nIn terms of what Ripple is looking for, the company representative said they are recruiting software experts with Java or C++ language expertise and an ample dose of teachability.\n\n\u201cWe are not necessarily looking for blockchain experts \u2013 we can always teach domain-specific expertise,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also think it\u2019s important that our engineers carry themselves with humility and are able to think creatively about how to solve hard problems.\u201d\n\nRipple image via Shutterstock\n\nUpdate (Feb. 11, 21:00 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that the recruiting emails came from an external recruiter working on Ripple\u2019s behalf."
