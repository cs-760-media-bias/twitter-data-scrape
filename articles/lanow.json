She said VapoRub often brought up flashbacks that were positive, \u201cnot of feeling sick, but of being cared for and being soothed.\u201d\n\nDaniel Olivas made sure that when he left for college back in the 1970s, he took his VapoRub with him.\n\nBut when he rubbed the cream on his chest just as his mother always had done, it didn\u2019t feel the same.\n\nWith her, he said, it had been \u201calmost a religious ritual.\u201d\n\nWithout her, that magic was gone.\n\nPara leer esta nota en espa\u00f1ol, haga clic aqu\u00ed."

    "text": "The stories, spread in front of him in hot metal type, told of families stranded at sea, of sturdy ships rescuing rickety boats, of the hundreds drowned \u2014 all in the desperate struggle to get to America.\n\nThe articles brought news of people driven from Indochina by decades of war, and as he read them, his hands began to ink in accent marks over the words that needed them, so that their emotions burst forth, forming the narrative for the pages of his refugee newspaper.\n\nThe year was 1978, when typewriters offered only English-language fonts. Yen Ngoc Do, sporting thick glasses, pored over each line, wanting to make sure the Vietnamese printed correctly. Nguoi Viet Daily News appeared once a week, those early issues splashed in red and black ink and selling for $6 for a three-month subscription.\n\nIn the tradition of community journalism, Do served as founding editor, publisher and circulation manager. Going door to door, he distributed 2,000 copies of what would become the largest Vietnamese-language publication in the United States.\n\nNguoi Viet, meaning \u201cthe Vietnamese people,\u201d grew up with Little Saigon, the Orange County enclave that\u2019s the biggest Vietnamese business and cultural district outside the motherland. In January a birthday party to celebrate its 40th anniversary drew nearly 800 people to its unpretentious building at the end of a Westminster cul-de-sac. An online readership joined the festivities, logging in from Australia, Canada, France and China, along with Facebook Live viewers from Vietnam.\n\nIn the tributes, and in the old photos lining the walls, beat the gentle, curious spirit of its founder, my father.\n\nYen Ngoc Do, publisher and founder of Nguoi Viet Daily News, with bound copies and a framed first edition of his paper at the publication's Westminster office in January 1997. Craig Y. Fujii / Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cDo you have much homework? Are you ready to help us?\u201d\n\nIn sixth grade, I\u2019d rush home every Friday after school, squeezing myself into a corner of the garage to begin bundling newspapers. I relished the sight of my ink-stained hands, refusing to wash them until dinner.\n\nBo, or \u201cdad\u201d in my parents\u2019 native tongue, was born in 1941 in Saigon, the middle of five children. His family earned a living selling \u201ccouronne,\u201d French-style funeral wreaths made from beaded flowers, thriving at a time Vietnam was under French colonial rule.\n\nMy father studied philosophy in college, but since high school he had never been a devoted student. Politics inspired him and he skipped class to organize rallies for social justice or to raise money for flood victims and the poor. One summer, he met my mother in the coastal city of Nha Trang; they were introduced by his cousin and in 1964, after they married, she continued her work as a schoolteacher.\n\nBo entered the newspaper business through an unconventional route. During the Vietnam War, he served as a combat correspondent for many publications, including Dai Dan Toc, an anti-establishment daily. His reporting helped him meet foreigners, among them an American professor who secured seats for him and his family on one of the last planes to the U.S., in April 1975, in the harrowing hours before Saigon fell. The Dos flew to Guam when I was 6, then on to Camp Pendleton, where the Marines welcomed the refugees.\n\nSome three years later, Bo launched Nguoi Viet to try to connect the day-to-day happenings of the home country to the Vietnamese starting over in their adopted country. Seed money came from pinching pennies and wages from his job as a social worker and a wallpaper hanger in Texas. He wrote the first few issues in tiny lodgings in San Diego, quickly relocating to Orange County to be near the nascent community of newcomers. He had helpers but no employees, toiling on, spurred by a population of displaced people seeking its voice and emerging identity.\n\nTai Do, center, and Steven Mai look over a cake featuring the front page of the first issue of Nguoi Viet Daily News during the 40th anniversary celebration of the paper in Westminster.

Bottom left, newsstands carry Nguoi Viet Daily News. Bottom right, retired Associated Press photographer Nick Ut speaks with Nho Nguyen, right, during the celebration. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBo always would ask if I was hungry before we started bundling the issues.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that my friends bustled off to math or music lessons. There we were, I a mousy child among a cluster of rumpled men, racing deadline to drop off mailings before the post office in Santa Ana closed. Because we didn\u2019t have enough money to buy sticker labels, I\u2019d dip a toothpick into glue, dot the back of a strip of paper printed with an address and pat it down near the bulk rate stamp.\n\nI\u2019d do this a few hundred times before dinner, when our group would stream into the kitchen to scrub our grimy hands. My mom, cooking after a full shift at her electronics assembly plant, dished up and we, the roped-in volunteers, along with my younger brother and sisters, sat down to soup spooned over steamed rice.\n\nBo worried about how readers could maintain connections to distant friends and family, or how they could navigate the rules governing their new lives.\n\nHe decided to run more stories on the mechanics needed to balance living in both worlds \u2014 write-ups about the price of a kilo of rice so refugees would know how much money to send back to relatives in Vietnam. He spoke English \u2014 along with French, German and Chinese \u2014 and wrote stories explaining how the U.S. government system works. Back in Vietnam, the communist regime blacklisted the paper, which was smuggled in, while clandestine sources continued to feed Nguoi Viet news and information.\n\nWhen the boat people began fleeing Vietnam in droves, the paper stayed true to documenting their sagas, sprinkled with excerpts of letters from Vietnam and personal reflections from those languishing in refugee camps in the Philippines and Malaysia.\n\n\u201cWe may need to take in some very, very needy families,\u201d Bo told our family.\n\nOne weekend, the door of our house, now in Garden Grove, opened to reveal unknown faces: Strangers had come to live with us, one of Bo\u2019s buddies with a nursemaid and his five kids, our temporary roommates bedding down on our Goodwill furniture until they could strike out on their own.\n\nNo matter, more hands meant more help for behind-the-scenes newspaper work.\n\nNguoi Viet could always use another news source.\n\nLoan Do, center, stands underneath the memorial for her husband, Yen Ngoc Do. Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cThe thing with your dad, he could never say no.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Jeffrey Brody, my father\u2019s biographer, who captured his publishing years in an oral history released in 2003. Yen Do \u201cwas Little Saigon\u2019s leading intellectual,\u201d said the Cal State Fullerton communications professor and former Orange County Register reporter. For years, he met with my dad once a month and recorded their talks. \u201cSince his death there has been a vacuum with no one taking his place. No one with the depth and scope of his knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1980s, the paper transformed from a weekly to publishing twice a week, then three times, then five. A few miles away, fellow immigrants had opened the first Vietnamese-owned pharmacy, the first doctor\u2019s practice, the first restaurant in conservative Westminster, where strawberry fields were still plentiful and the population solidly white.\n\nPeople tapped Bo for favors around the clock. He spent weeks translating government forms and contracts. By the 1990s, California had become the first state to provide the written test for a driver\u2019s license in Vietnamese, and a study guide to accompany it, but long before that, the newspaper had dissected the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts behind the wheel for immigrant first-time car owners.\n\nSoon, strip malls surfaced along Bolsa Avenue, the main artery of Little Saigon, introducing herbal shops, dental clinics and bakeries. Myths swirled outside the community that all the Vietnamese lived off welfare. The refugees knew that they needed to \u201cclarify the situation,\u201d according to Bo\u2019s recordings. \u201cWe needed to educate our activists in the community about long-term solutions, and we needed to build up a responsible image of the refugees.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know it for its truth, and more often we know it as a bridge between the homeland and the new land.\u201d Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, on Nguoi Viet Daily News\n\nAnd so an activities room was added to the newspaper office at a new building the paper bought and moved to in 2002. Outside, the South Vietnamese flag flew next to the U.S. and California flags. Inside, Nguoi Viet could host events for the community and immediately report on them. And since Little Saigon lacks a social center, the space \u2014 where guests recently gathered for the 40th celebration \u2014 is a lively backdrop for poets, politicians, singers and photographers showcasing talks and exhibits.\n\nThe newspaper founded to chronicle a community helped create one.\n\n\u201cReally, that community room served as witness to all the meaningful reunions and challenges facing the Vietnamese,\u201d Brody recalled. \u201cA press conference followed every crisis. The most important activists and leaders among the Vietnamese appeared there. People could meet, talk and launch ideas to unify their goals. Yen Do always knew how to get people to the table.\u201d\n\nThe community Bo eagerly covered has matured, both in size and sophistication, dominated by emigre politics. In 2008, dozens of people demonstrated for days when the paper ran a personal essay with a photo of a foot spa, splashed with the colors and stripes of the anti-communist South Vietnamese flag, calling it a desecration.\n\nToday, huge swaths of the second generation speak and read English, leaving the publication \u2014 with a print circulation of about 10,000, a YouTube channel and 250,000 page views online daily \u2014 to struggle with how to reach them. Also, Nguoi Viet, housing a staff of 50, now competes with two other Vietnamese dailies, along with an assortment of magazines and radio and television stations.\n\n(My dad gave away the majority of his company shares to co-workers as a reward decades ago, long before his death. My mother, who worked in classified advertising, retired in 2007. Disclosure, I now serve on the board of directors, helping with strategic planning on the business side.)\n\nMy father\u2019s portrait hangs in the hallway leading to the design and layout department. At the anniversary party, blogger Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, a dissident released by Hanoi\u2019s Communist government last October, strolled past it.\n\n\u201cWe hear of Nguoi Viet newspaper in Vietnam,\u201d said Nguyen, a leading critic of Vietnam\u2019s one-party state, better known by her nickname \u201cMe Nam\u201d (Mother Mushroom). \u201cWe know it for its truth, and more often we know it as a bridge between the homeland and the new land. And we hear of Little Saigon, for Little Saigon is a symbol of the nation of Vietnam.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that when tourists from Vietnam and overseas communities around the world visit Little Saigon, they often want to take a tour of the newspaper.\n\nReporter Anh Do, center, daughter of Yen Ngoc Do, celebrates with community members during the 40th anniversary event for Nguoi Viet Daily News. Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times\n\nOne spring morning in 2006, before my dad turned 65 and a few months ahead of his passing from kidney disease, a journalist called from Radio France Internationale to ask about press freedom and its abuses in Asia. Pushing for such freedoms was Bo\u2019s passion and the lobby of Nguoi Viet\u2019s building reflects it. When newcomers walk in, they encounter a mural of the signing of the 1st Amendment, which he commissioned after translating it into Vietnamese to share with his readers.\n\nA newspaper life, Bo told the radio interviewer, is never \u201csolitary.\u201d It\u2019s a life \u201cworth the risking for the learning and living.\u201d\n\nI embrace his essence, just as much as his words."

Hours later, he accompanied his mother as she falsely told sheriff\u2019s officials that she had been behind the wheel, the records show.\n\nSan Francisco-based KQED and the Bay Area News Group reported that a Rio Vista police officer entered a home in 2017 and immediately put a man in a chokehold for 20 seconds, which was captured in body camera images. That officer was fired. The radio station also found that two officers in Watsonville in Santa Cruz County had been fired in recent years for repeatedly having sex with civilians while on duty.\n\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune found a San Diego County sheriff\u2019s lieutenant had embezzled more than $100,000 in donations from her church, according to an internal affairs investigation. She agreed to pay back the missing funds and was not prosecuted. She retired from the department in 2013.

    "text": "A yearlong investigation found three of Orange County\u2019s emergency homeless shelters riddled with problems including reports of physical and sexual abuse, neglect of residents with disabilities and mental illnesses, and filthy conditions, according to a report released Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe report is based on first-person visits and more than 70 interviews with residents, staff members and shelter volunteers at three emergency shelters: the Courtyard Transitional Center in Santa Ana, opened in October 2016; Bridges at Kraemer Place in Anaheim that opened in May 2017; and SAFEPlace in Santa Ana, which opened last April.\n\nThey say they found dangerously unclean conditions in each of the shelters; facilities that lacked temperature control and in some cases, flooded during rainstorms; and reports of staff threatening residents with eviction for minor infractions, or if they spoke out about conditions at the shelter.\n\nDOCUMENT: Read the ACLU\u2019s scathing report on Orange County\u2019s homeless shelters \u00bb\n\n\u201cPeople who have been to jail have said jail is better than this shelter,\u201d one homeless resident, Roberta Filicko, wrote in her diary, according to the ACLU report. \u201cWe are so scared that we will be living on the streets, and the staff make sure to remind you of this every minute of every day. It\u2019s true we have no one to help us, so we go along with it.\u201d\n\nAn employee at one of the Santa Ana emergency homeless shelters found that bedbugs would crawl on you if you sat down long enough.\n\n\u201cI got three bites (during my last shift),\u201d the employee told an interviewer. \u201cSome [people] are getting a lot more. You can see the bedbugs when they get on you. They are big. They\u2019ve been around for a while.\u201d\n\nAt another Orange County emergency shelter in Anaheim, residents and staff faced similar problems.\n\n\u201cCritters all around,\u201d a resident told an interviewer. \u201cMosquitos, cockroaches. I saw a couple of people with head lice. Staff would say, \u2018Hide the bugs, don\u2019t let [the supervisor] see that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt is one of the filthiest shelters I have been in.\u201d\n\nDocument \u201cMany residents told us that unsanitary conditions in the showers and restrooms are a particular source of concern. \u2018The showers got bad,\u2019 recalls a former resident. \u2018Dirty, trash. It builds up. I saw personal body fluids on the sinks. Either blood or snot. It was so bad that I wouldn\u2019t want to go in them.\u2019 A resident observes, \u2018Feces on the walls and the showers. They don\u2019t clean it properly.\u2019 Says another resident, \u2018I went nine days without taking a shower, because I don\u2019t want to get sick.\u2019\u201d see the document\n\nOrange County spokeswoman Molly Nichelson said in a statement that the county will take time to review the report and respond accordingly. She declined a request from The Times for an interview.\n\n\u201cThe County of Orange is committed to ensuring our emergency shelters are safe for all our clients,\u201d Nichelson said. \u201cEach emergency shelter has its own provider and complaint process. We work to ensure valid complaints are addressed by our service providers in a timely fashion.\u201d\n\nIn an email to The Times, the state attorney general\u2019s office said it was \u201creviewing the contents of the report.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU, which launched a Dignity for All project in 2013 to address homelessness in Orange County, said staffers cross-verified their interviews with multiple sources, including public records and data, according to the report.\n\nThe ACLU argues that the shelters are ineffective in ending homelessness; in its report, the civil rights organization advocates for an expansion of affordable housing and permanent supportive housing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a special sort of cruel irony that this is such a wealthy county, and the homeless community is relatively small compared to a county like Los Angeles,\u201d said Julia Devanthery, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California and one of the authors of the report. \u201cAnd yet, there is no meaningful movement toward expanding access to affordable housing and supportive housing, which everyone who works on this issue agrees is a solution.\u201d\n\nMore temporary shelters are set to open in the coming months across Orange County, prompting the ACLU to release its report, Devanthery said.\n\nIn 2017, almost 4,800 people in Orange County were found in the annual Point in Time count to be experiencing homelessness. Orange County officials felt it was an undercount.\n\nLaura Kasten was one of hundreds of homeless residents who lived along the banks of the Santa Ana River until they were removed and sent to live in motels and shelters across Orange County. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times\n\nHundreds of homeless residents lived along the banks of the Santa Ana River until they were removed and sent to live in motels and shelters across the county. Many have been removed from a large encampment at the Santa Ana Civic Center.\n\nOver the last few years, Orange County officials have grappled with how to implement solutions to help homeless residents \u2014 often to large protests about proposed shelters from residents in the county\u2019s wealthier communities.\n\nA series of lawsuits have attempted to force solutions, including a lawsuit filed in February against five Orange County cities \u2014 Aliso Viejo, Dana Point, Irvine, San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano \u2014 and the county for failure to provide housing for homeless people.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s Devanthery said the organization has examined what legal remedies exist to address the conditions they found at the temporary shelters.\n\nDocument \u201cOn July 7, 2018, for example, a record-breaking heat wave baked the sidewalks around the Courtyard as the outdoor temperature rose to 107 degrees. Inside, a volunteer measured the temperature with a thermometer purchased especially to record the temperature that day. It registered 96 degrees, as scores of residents sat listlessly on their cots or dragged themselves into line for bottled water.\u201d see the document\n\nBrooke Weitzman, an attorney who has represented homeless residents in multiple lawsuits against the county, said conditions vary widely among shelters in Orange County, as each shelter is run by different organizations with their own staff training protocols and rules for residents.\n\nIn recent years, local officials have discussed homelessness in Orange County much more frequently, but haven\u2019t made significant progress in approving and building housing, said Weitzman, an attorney and co-founder of the Elder Law and Disability Rights Center.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where most of them recognize it is necessary and needs to be done,\u201d said Weitzman, who wasn\u2019t involved in the ACLU investigation. \u201cBut knowing that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re willing to do it in the face of residents opposing any type of development or affordable housing or permanent supportive housing.\u201d\n\nThe report provides a scathing review of the shelters, which officials have lauded as progress in combating homelessness in Orange County, and includes graphic details from witnesses.\n\nDocument \u201cA woman with an inoperable brain aneurism gets headaches when the aneurism bleeds. \u2018Two or three times when I had the pain,\u2019 she says, \u2018I wanted to go to the hospital. The last time it was 7:00 or 8:00 in the evening. The staff wouldn\u2019t give me ice packs, wouldn\u2019t call 911, and wouldn\u2019t give me a ride [to the hospital] because they said the shuttle drivers were off until 11:00 p.m. I sat there and suffered. I was terrified. I wasn\u2019t allowed to walk out the gate. They will exit you.\u2019\u201d see the document\n\nAt SAFEPlace, a gymnasium housing about 70 people, a resident at the shelter recalled an 82-year-old resident who had dementia and was frequently tricked by scam artists calling her cellphone. To \u201cteach her a lesson\u201d after she was scammed yet again, a staff member forced her to spend at least a day outside the shelter\u2019s fence, according to the report.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t understand what was going on, and it was getting dark and cold,\u201d a resident told the ACLU. \u201cWe were begging the security guard to open the gate and let her back in, but they said they had to follow orders.\u201d\n\nAt the Courtyard, a former bus terminal that houses more than 450 people, an employee told the ACLU about when staff refused to take in a man who transferred from a psychiatric facility to the Courtyard in his hospital pajamas because \u201cthey said he can\u2019t take care of himself.\u201d The man slept on the sidewalk that night, according to the report.\n\nAnother resident at the Courtyard noticed a small hole, about the diameter of a pen, in the shower wall at torso level. She told the ACLU that she suspected it was a peephole and shoved the wrapper of her soap bar into the hole.\n\n\u201cI started to take a shower,\u201d she told the ACLU. \u201cAnd the wrapper gets sucked into the peephole.

    "authors": [
      "Benjamin Oreskes"
    ],
    "text": "Typically, only the very best teen athletes make their way into the sports programs at elite universities.\n\nBut federal prosecutors alleged this week that, when it came to the kids of dozens of very rich parents, those rules didn\u2019t apply.\n\nThe charges filed by the Justice Department in the college admissions case lay out a stunningly audacious scheme: Wealthy, often famous people getting their kids into top-tier universities though fraud, bribery and deceit.\n\nFULL COVERAGE: Dozens charged \u2014 including Hollywood actresses \u2014 in connection with college admissions scheme \u00bb\n\nThe 200-plus pages of prosecution documents are littered with details of the parents\u2019 alleged efforts to game the system. Here are some examples:\n\n1) Rowing could apparently get you into USC \u2014 no experience necessary. Prosecutors allege that actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, renowned fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli , saw being a coxswain the activity as their daughter Olivia Jade\u2019s ticket into USC, even though she had never competed in the sport. According to the affidavit, USC associate athletic director Donna Heinel, who was also charged in the scheme , asked them to submit photos of her in a \u201cboat\u201d where it is \u201ctough to see the face.\u201d The couple also submitted a photo of their daughter rowing \u2014 on a machine.\n\nDocument \u201cI wanted to provide you with an update on the status of [your younger daughter\u2019s] admission offer to USC. First and foremost, they have no intention of rescinding [her] admission and were surprised to hear that was even a concern for you and your family. You can verify that with [the USC senior assistant director of admissions] ... if you would like. I also shared with [the USC senior assistant director of admission] that you had visited this morning and affirmed for me that [your younger daughter] is truly a coxswain.\u201d see the document\n\n2) Prosecutors say L.A.-based entrepreneur Jane Buckingham\u2019s son was all set to travel to Houston to take the ACT college admissions test with a proctor who was in on the scheme. But when the youth had to have his tonsils removed, travel was ruled out. So William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, the admitted mastermind of the scheme, found a workaround: Buckingham could pay $50,000 to have someone take the test for her son while he took a practice ACT at home so \u201che would believe he had taken the test,\u201d the affidavit says. To make it work, Singer said the boy would need to submit a handwriting sample. \u201cJust want to make sure we\u2019re close in our writing,\u201d Singer said, according to the affidavit.\n\n3) Part of the scheme allegedly involved students falsely being classified as having a learning disability so they could take the test under the supervision of a proctor who would make sure they got a high score. A psychologist on Singer\u2019s payroll would classify the student as having learning disabilities, prosecutors said. In a phone call, Singer allegedly told Gordon R. Caplan, co-chairman of the New York law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, to instruct his daughter when she got tested \u201cto be stupid, not to be as smart as she is. The goal is to be slow, to be not as bright, all that, so we show discrepancies.\u201d This allegedly cost Caplan $75,000.\n\nDocument \u201cOh yeah, there\u2019s times when we have to appeal because, you know, for whatever reason. You have to understand that College Board and ACT both outsource their decisions to a committee, \u2018cause they\u2019re tired of being sued. For, you know, so they do the outsourcing. So, sometimes you have to re-appeal so that psychologist that\u2019ll do the testing, will actually write up an appeal. So we\u2019ll do that, and I also need to tell [your daughter] when she gets tested, to be as, to be stupid, not to be as smart as she is. The goal is to be slow, to be not as bright, all that, so we show discrepancies. And she knows that she\u2019s getting all this extra time, everywhere that she is right now. At the Academy kids are getting extra time all the time\u201d. see the document\n\n4) Manuel Henriquez, chairman and CEO of Hercules Technology Growth Capital, a venture debt firm, saw tennis as his daughter\u2019s entree into Georgetown University , prosecutors alleged. Even though she had ranked just 207th among girls in Northern California as an under-12 player and never played in a U.S. Tennis Assn. tournament in high school, she claimed a top-50 USTA ranking. \u201c[B]eing a part of Georgetown women\u2019s tennis team has always been a dream of mine. For years I have spent three, four hours a day grinding out on and off court workouts with the hopes of becoming successful enough to play college tennis especially at Georgetown,\u201d she wrote in her application essay, according to the affidavit. Georgetown\u2019s tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, was among those charged.\n\nDocument \u201cThe HENRIQUEZES\u2019 daughter\u2019s application was submitted to Georgetown on or about October 25, 2015. In addition to the falsified essay, the application falsely indicated that she played \u2018club tennis\u2019 all through high school for 20 hours per week and 52 weeks per year, and listed her as having a \u2018Top 50 ranking\u2019 in the United States Tennis Association (\u2018USTA\u2019) Junior Girls Tennis for her sophomore through senior years of high school, and as being on the USTA All-Academic Team for tennis for her junior and senior years. In fact, records obtained from the USTA do not show that she played at any USTA tournaments in high school.\u201d see the document\n\n5) Rick Singer was going to get private equity firm founder Bill McGlashan\u2019s son into USC on the strength of his football credentials \u2014 the only problem was his son\u2019s high school didn\u2019t have a football team. So Singer told McGlashan, managing partner of TPG Growth, they would make him into a kicker by doctoring photos using PhotoShop. \u201cYou could inspire him, [Rick]. You may actually turn him into something. I love it,\u201d McGlashan tells Singer in a wiretapped phone call detailed in the affidavit.\n\nDocument \u201cHey Bill, so we\u2019re gonna-- met with [USC], because the [high school your son attends] does not have a football team, I\u2019m gonna make him a kicker/punter and they\u2019re gonna walk him through with football, and I\u2019ll get a picture and figure out how to Photoshop and stuff, so it looks like it and the guy who runs the biggest kicking camp is a good friend, so we\u2019ll put a bunch of stuff about that on his profile, and we should be in pretty good shape to get that done. It\u2019s just a matter of, when I get the profile done, get it to them and figure out when they\u2019re gonna have a subcommittee meeting, so I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d see the document\n\n6) In 2012, philanthropist David Sidoo allegedly paid Singer $200,000 to have someone take the SAT for his two sons. One was accepted into Chapman University. Years later, as Sidoo\u2019s son was applying to business school, Sidoo allegedly told an unnamed person related to the case: \u201cI thought you were gonna call me and say I got a 2100 on my GMAT.\u201d The unnamed person had to clarify that the highest possible score on the graduate business school admissions test is 800. \u201cThey don\u2019t have 2100 for the GMAT. But I would do my best to get it for yah.\u201d Sidoo, apparently joking, replied, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nDocument \u201cOn or about October 25, 2018, called SIDOO from Boston, Massachusetts. In the call, SIDOO noted that his older son was applying to business school, adding, \u2018I thought you were gonna call me and say I got a 2100 on my GMAT\u2019\u2014a reference to a standardized test that is widely used as part of the business school admissions process, which is scored on a scale of 200 to 800. responded, \u2018They don\u2019t have a 2100 for the GMAT. But I would do my best to get it for ya.\u2019 SIDOO replied, \u2018I know.\u2019\u201d see the document\n\n7) Loughlin and Giannulli allegedly shelled out $500,000 to get their daughters into USC, but Giannulli apparently was concerned that their older daughter might end up at a less prestigious school. In an email, Giannulli emphasized to Singer that he wanted to \u201cmake sure we have a roadmap for \u2026 getting her into a school other than ASU!\u201d\n\nDocument \u201cWe just met with [our older daughter\u2019s] college counselor this am. I\u2019d like to maybe sit with you after your session with the girls as I have some concerns and want to fully understand the game plan and make sure we have a roadmap for success as it relates to [our daughter] and getting her into a school other than ASU!\u201d see the document\n\n8) In summer 2014, USC\u2019s new women\u2019s soccer coach was confused about one name on her roster. The daughter of Del Mar insurance executive Toby MacFarlane was on the list, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know who she is and [she] is not counted in my numbers,\u201d the coach emailed to a member of the athletic department. The coach had also emailed MacFarlane\u2019s daughter directly, asking her to \u201ccontact me asap please.\u201d Singer\u2019s recommendation to MacFarlane? Tell the program she had \u201cplantar fasciitis and will not be practicing or playing for a while.\u201d\n\nDocument \u201cOn or about August 15, 2014, the newly appointed head coach of women\u2019s soccer at USC responded to the e-mail from the academic counselor, noting, \u2018[MACFARLANE\u2019s daughter] doesn\u2019t play for us.\u2019 The coach then e-mailed MACFARLANE\u2019s daughter directly: \u2018I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t have you on my list of players. Could you contact me asap please.\u2019 The coach also e-mailed a member of the USC athletics department that \u2018[MACFARLANE\u2019s daughter] was on the list from the coaches, but I don\u2019t know who she is and [she] is not counted in my numbers.\u2019\u201d see the document\n\n9) Before she showed up at school, MacFarlane\u2019s daughter had to submit an application essay. Her application already falsely stated that she had been a \u201cU.S. Club Soccer All American\u201d for three years in high school and, since she was ostensibly going to be on the soccer team, her essay had to be about soccer. So Singer wrote an essay for her, claiming she \u201cplays without a care for her body or anyone else\u2019s on the field.\u201d\n\nDocument \u201cOn the soccer or lacrosse field I am the one who looks like a boy amongst girls with my hair tied up, arms sleeveless, and blood and bruises from head to toe. My parents have a hard time attending my soccer matches because our opponent\u2019s parents are always making rude remarks about that number 8 player who plays without a care for her body or anyone else\u2019s on the field. It is true that I can be a bit intense out there on the field.\u201d see the document\n\n10) At one point, Caplan, the New York law firm co-chairman, expressed some concern that the scheme could unravel. \u201cIt\u2019s just, to be honest, I\u2019m not worried about the moral issue here. I\u2019m worried about the, if she\u2019s caught doing that, you know, she\u2019s finished,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of a wiretapped conversation included in the affidavit. That concern, though, was apparently slightly overshadowed by a different worry \u2014 that his daughter would find out her SAT score and realize that her acceptance into school wasn\u2019t on the up-and-up. Singer attempted to assuage that concern.\n\nDocument \u201cShe\u2019ll, she\u2019ll think, right, she\u2019ll think she took it. She\u2019ll feel good about herself. She\u2019ll get a great score and she\u2019ll be like, \u2018Mom and dad, can I\u2026\u2019 You know what\u2019s going to happen? She\u2019s going to say, \u2018Dad, can I re-take the test again? \u2018Cause I think I can do better.\u2019 And that happens all the time, right? She\u2019ll get whatever, and we will say no, just so you know that.\u201d see the document\n\n11) Devin Sloane really wanted his son to get into USC via water polo, but he had never played the sport. So Sloane purchased some water polo gear on Amazon, and later emailed Singer photos of his son \u201cpurporting to play water polo, with his right arm and upper torso exposed above the water line,\u201d according to the affidavit. Singer said Sloane\u2019s son would be presented as a member of the Italian junior national team.\n\nDocument \u201cOn or about July 16, 2017, CW-1 e-mailed SLOANE to request biographical details for the profile. CW-1 indicated that the profile would falsely present SLOANE\u2019s son as a \u2018Perimeter Player\u2019 who played for the \u2018Italian Junior National Team\u2019 and the \u2018LA Water Polo\u2019 team. The following day, SLOANE replied with the personal information for the profile.\u201d see the document\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

    "text": "A yearlong investigation found three of Orange County\u2019s emergency homeless shelters riddled with problems including reports of physical and sexual abuse, neglect of residents with disabilities and mental illnesses, and filthy conditions, according to a report released Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe report is based on first-person visits and more than 70 interviews with residents, staff members and shelter volunteers at three emergency shelters: the Courtyard Transitional Center in Santa Ana, opened in October 2016; Bridges at Kraemer Place in Anaheim that opened in May 2017; and SAFEPlace in Santa Ana, which opened last April.\n\nThey say they found dangerously unclean conditions in each of the shelters; facilities that lacked temperature control and in some cases, flooded during rainstorms; and reports of staff threatening residents with eviction for minor infractions, or if they spoke out about conditions at the shelter.\n\nDOCUMENT: Read the ACLU\u2019s scathing report on Orange County\u2019s homeless shelters \u00bb\n\n\u201cPeople who have been to jail have said jail is better than this shelter,\u201d one homeless resident, Roberta Filicko, wrote in her diary, according to the ACLU report. \u201cWe are so scared that we will be living on the streets, and the staff make sure to remind you of this every minute of every day. It\u2019s true we have no one to help us, so we go along with it.\u201d\n\nAn employee at one of the Santa Ana emergency homeless shelters found that bedbugs would crawl on you if you sat down long enough.\n\n\u201cI got three bites (during my last shift),\u201d the employee told an interviewer. \u201cSome [people] are getting a lot more. You can see the bedbugs when they get on you. They are big. They\u2019ve been around for a while.\u201d\n\nAt another Orange County emergency shelter in Anaheim, residents and staff faced similar problems.\n\n\u201cCritters all around,\u201d a resident told an interviewer. \u201cMosquitos, cockroaches. I saw a couple of people with head lice. Staff would say, \u2018Hide the bugs, don\u2019t let [the supervisor] see that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt is one of the filthiest shelters I have been in.\u201d\n\nDocument \u201cMany residents told us that unsanitary conditions in the showers and restrooms are a particular source of concern. \u2018The showers got bad,\u2019 recalls a former resident. \u2018Dirty, trash. It builds up. I saw personal body fluids on the sinks. Either blood or snot. It was so bad that I wouldn\u2019t want to go in them.\u2019 A resident observes, \u2018Feces on the walls and the showers. They don\u2019t clean it properly.\u2019 Says another resident, \u2018I went nine days without taking a shower, because I don\u2019t want to get sick.\u2019\u201d see the document\n\nOrange County spokeswoman Molly Nichelson said in a statement that the county will take time to review the report and respond accordingly. She declined a request from The Times for an interview.\n\n\u201cThe County of Orange is committed to ensuring our emergency shelters are safe for all our clients,\u201d Nichelson said. \u201cEach emergency shelter has its own provider and complaint process. We work to ensure valid complaints are addressed by our service providers in a timely fashion.\u201d\n\nIn an email to The Times, the state attorney general\u2019s office said it was \u201creviewing the contents of the report.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU, which launched a Dignity for All project in 2013 to address homelessness in Orange County, said staffers cross-verified their interviews with multiple sources, including public records and data, according to the report.\n\nThe ACLU argues that the shelters are ineffective in ending homelessness; in its report, the civil rights organization advocates for an expansion of affordable housing and permanent supportive housing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a special sort of cruel irony that this is such a wealthy county, and the homeless community is relatively small compared to a county like Los Angeles,\u201d said Julia Devanthery, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California and one of the authors of the report. \u201cAnd yet, there is no meaningful movement toward expanding access to affordable housing and supportive housing, which everyone who works on this issue agrees is a solution.\u201d\n\nMore temporary shelters are set to open in the coming months across Orange County, prompting the ACLU to release its report, Devanthery said.\n\nIn 2017, almost 4,800 people in Orange County were found in the annual Point in Time count to be experiencing homelessness. Orange County officials felt it was an undercount.\n\nLaura Kasten was one of hundreds of homeless residents who lived along the banks of the Santa Ana River until they were removed and sent to live in motels and shelters across Orange County. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times\n\nHundreds of homeless residents lived along the banks of the Santa Ana River until they were removed and sent to live in motels and shelters across the county. Many have been removed from a large encampment at the Santa Ana Civic Center.\n\nOver the last few years, Orange County officials have grappled with how to implement solutions to help homeless residents \u2014 often to large protests about proposed shelters from residents in the county\u2019s wealthier communities.\n\nA series of lawsuits have attempted to force solutions, including a lawsuit filed in February against five Orange County cities \u2014 Aliso Viejo, Dana Point, Irvine, San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano \u2014 and the county for failure to provide housing for homeless people.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s Devanthery said the organization has examined what legal remedies exist to address the conditions they found at the temporary shelters.\n\nDocument \u201cOn July 7, 2018, for example, a record-breaking heat wave baked the sidewalks around the Courtyard as the outdoor temperature rose to 107 degrees. Inside, a volunteer measured the temperature with a thermometer purchased especially to record the temperature that day. It registered 96 degrees, as scores of residents sat listlessly on their cots or dragged themselves into line for bottled water.\u201d see the document\n\nBrooke Weitzman, an attorney who has represented homeless residents in multiple lawsuits against the county, said conditions vary widely among shelters in Orange County, as each shelter is run by different organizations with their own staff training protocols and rules for residents.\n\nIn recent years, local officials have discussed homelessness in Orange County much more frequently, but haven\u2019t made significant progress in approving and building housing, said Weitzman, an attorney and co-founder of the Elder Law and Disability Rights Center.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where most of them recognize it is necessary and needs to be done,\u201d said Weitzman, who wasn\u2019t involved in the ACLU investigation. \u201cBut knowing that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re willing to do it in the face of residents opposing any type of development or affordable housing or permanent supportive housing.\u201d\n\nThe report provides a scathing review of the shelters, which officials have lauded as progress in combating homelessness in Orange County, and includes graphic details from witnesses.\n\nDocument \u201cA woman with an inoperable brain aneurism gets headaches when the aneurism bleeds. \u2018Two or three times when I had the pain,\u2019 she says, \u2018I wanted to go to the hospital. The last time it was 7:00 or 8:00 in the evening. The staff wouldn\u2019t give me ice packs, wouldn\u2019t call 911, and wouldn\u2019t give me a ride [to the hospital] because they said the shuttle drivers were off until 11:00 p.m. I sat there and suffered. I was terrified. I wasn\u2019t allowed to walk out the gate.

To \u201cteach her a lesson\u201d after she was scammed yet again, a staff member forced her to spend at least a day outside the shelter\u2019s fence, according to the report.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t understand what was going on, and it was getting dark and cold,\u201d a resident told the ACLU. \u201cWe were begging the security guard to open the gate and let her back in, but they said they had to follow orders.\u201d\n\nAt the Courtyard, a former bus terminal that houses more than 450 people, an employee told the ACLU about when staff refused to take in a man who transferred from a psychiatric facility to the Courtyard in his hospital pajamas because \u201cthey said he can\u2019t take care of himself.\u201d The man slept on the sidewalk that night, according to the report.\n\nAnother resident at the Courtyard noticed a small hole, about the diameter of a pen, in the shower wall at torso level. She told the ACLU that she suspected it was a peephole and shoved the wrapper of her soap bar into the hole.\n\n\u201cI started to take a shower,\u201d she told the ACLU. \u201cAnd the wrapper gets sucked into the peephole.

    "authors": [
      "Video",
      "Graphics"
    ],
    "text": "The morning swell off the Santa Barbara coast is running high as the crew boat churns away from the pier west of Haskell\u2019s Beach toward Platform Holly.\n\nNearly a dozen lawyers and engineers, dressed in fire-retardant coveralls, hard hats and fat, orange life jackets, crowd the aft deck. Almost two years ago, Holly \u2014 one of 27 oil platforms along the California coast from Huntington Beach to Point Arguello \u2014 became property of the state after its owner, Venoco, filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe future of the platform is in question, but all drilling has ceased and the wells will be sealed. The work, estimated to cost around $350 million, is expected to be completed no sooner than 2021.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOut on the water, the air is cool. Fog drifts up against the Santa Ynez Mountains, and filtered sunlight sparkles off the ocean. The Channel Islands begin to emerge from the haze.\n\nHolly joins six other oil platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel scheduled to be permanently shut down and possibly removed, the result of aging oil fields and a changing political and economic environment that once supported the highest concentration of platforms in the state.\n\nFor nearly five decades, these ungainly structures have earned a nearly iconic, inescapable status in the California landscape. Legend has it that Holly, seen at night from the beach at Isla Vista, inspired Doors singer Jim Morrison to write \u201cThe Crystal Ship,\u201d and drivers following the coast from Gaviota to La Conchita might understand why.\n\nAt twilight, the platforms brighten the horizon with their lights. They seem mysterious, even pretty, but up close, the hulking forms and the clatter of machinery illuminate harder truths.\n\nTwo miles \u2014 and a 20-minute boat ride \u2014 from Isla Vista, Platform Holly is managed by the State Lands Commission and sits in state waters.\n\nAs California pushes ahead in the fight against climate change, drilling seems an anachronism, a throwback to when oil fields \u2014 like the rivers and forests \u2014 were there for the taking and the coast bristled with derricks. Building a platform offshore seemed a brave endeavor.\n\nPlatform Holly From the top of the drilling derrick to the caissons anchored in the seafloor, the offshore oil platform is more than 400 feet tall. 235\u2019 Vent stack (Burn-off flare) Drilling derrick Galley and lockers Heliport Drill deck 60\u2019 Production deck 38\u2019 25\u2019 East boat landing Waterline - 0\u20190 -26\u2019 -65\u2019 -113\u2019 -162\u2019 Seafloor -211\u2019\n\nThat romance came to an abrupt end not long after it began. On Jan. 28, 1969, workers lost control of a well they were drilling on a platform 17 miles east of Holly, and 80,000 barrels of oil poured into the ocean, inspiring the state, then Congress, to take steps to stop the development of new platforms in local and federal waters.\n\nFifty years later, memories of that spill still ache, and the platforms offshore gleam even less, models of dirty technology and of an archaic dependency on fossil fuels. Holly\u2019s decommissioning is celebrated by environmentalists, activists and residents of the Santa Barbara coast. Just two miles offshore, the platform is a conspicuous reminder of the threat drilling poses to this treasured shoreline.\n\nToday the Trump administration wants to reopen the coast to exploration and drilling, and the state is fighting back. In September, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation banning construction of new pipelines and piers connecting federal waters to state land.\n\nAs the crew boat approaches Holly, the visitors crane their necks toward the spindly superstructure overhead.\n\nAfter three years of dormancy, the platform is a rusty ghost ship. Corrosion cakes switches and pressure gauges, their needles long parked at zero. The drone of air compressors echoes from inside, where a skeleton crew keeps the most basic systems operational.\n\nFor almost 50 years, environmental politics has been the backdrop for the hundreds of workers who climb aboard these platforms every day, and the loss of Holly is a stinging reminder of the state\u2019s conflicted relationship with this crucial resource.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf"

    "authors": [

    ],
    "text": "When Dahn Van Laarz, a bearded 59-year-old in Levi\u2019s and a motorcycle jacket, walks the streets of San Francisco\u2019s official leather district, he finds it hard to avoid the ghosts.\n\nThe Club Baths, a once-busy gay bath house, has morphed into an even busier homeless shelter. The Bootcamp, a bar whose clientele favored leather, bondage, domination and sadomasochism, is now an acupuncture clinic.\n\nAnd SF Catalyst, a leather community center and dungeon just outside the district boundaries, must vacate its home by year\u2019s end. The brick dungeon \u2014 with ceilings high enough to swing a whip and a calendar filled with \u201cBDSM sampler parties\u201d and Leathermen\u2019s Discussion Group meetings \u2014 is scheduled to give way to apartments.\n\nIf Catalyst can\u2019t find a new home in this era of high property values and even higher rents, San Francisco will be left with only one commercial dungeon space.\n\nSo what\u2019s a big-hearted city to do when its standing as one of the leather capitals of the world is under siege? When its identity is shifting faster than you can demolish a historic building and plan a pricey condo tower in its stead? When its freak flag, once proudly flying, has faded?\n\nLast spring, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District in the South of Market neighborhood once known as the Valley of the Kings, a nod to its hyper-masculine gay clientele. And shortly after Valentine\u2019s Day, Mayor London Breed signed legislation to create what is believed to be the world\u2019s first public plaza celebrating the \u201cstrong cultural influence\u201d of the fetish set.\n\nA man makes his way into Powerhouse, a San Francisco leather bar on Folsom Street in the city-sanctioned Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District.

Three men, at right, hold an instructional lab for rope bondage at Catalyst, a dungeon on Folsom Street. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe question is whether these and other efforts will be enough to save the subversive soul of the leather neighborhood, which has been under duress since the 1970s.\n\nVan Laarz, founding president of the San Francisco Bay Area Leather Alliance and the cultural district\u2019s head of land use, hopes so.\n\nBecause future leathermen and leatherwomen need to know \u201cthat this culture has existed,\u201d he said, \u201cto know that they have mentors that they can look up to, to understand that they can feel good about themselves as they come out into their kink.\u201d\n\nWhen leather life was at its peak, the SoMa neighborhood supported about 30 businesses catering to aficionados of oh-so-not-vanilla sex. In the early 1980s, there were bath houses and bars, sex clubs and leather stores, publishing companies and restaurants.\n\nToday, that number has shrunk to less than a dozen.\n\nVan Laarz recently held forth on leather history and sexuality from a tree stump on the edge of tiny Ringold Alley. Ringold runs from 8th to 9th streets, bisecting the block between Harrison and Folsom streets, leather San Francisco\u2019s main drag.\n\n\u201cThe market died because people died.\u201d Dahn Van Laarz, founding president of the San Francisco Bay Leather Alliance\n\nBefore the huge construction cranes came to roost, changing the San Francisco skyline for good, Ringold was a prime cruising destination, hidden and dark. Men would prowl the alley after the bars closed, Van Laarz said, to \u201cfind that partner that they hadn\u2019t found at the bar and have a sexual experience in the great outdoors.\u201d\n\nBut the bus yard that bordered the alley\u2019s south side is gone, replaced by gated condominiums. The small houses and businesses on the north have bright porch lights. Today, Van Laarz said, \u201cthere is no place to stand, no shadow to hide in to be that mysterious stranger, that mysterious, sexual, attractive stranger.\u201d\n\nA plaque in San Francisco's Ringold Alley pays tribute to gay men. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) A mural decorates the exterior of the Stud in the Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District.

A mural, at left, decorates the exterior of the Stud in the Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District, which encompasses (at right) the intersection of Isis and 12th streets. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAlthough redevelopment has been a constant theme in South of Market\u2019s dramatic evolution, the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s also ravaged the neighborhood. Then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein pushed for the bath houses to close. Van Laarz recalled a \u201csex panic\u201d that kept healthy gay men away.\n\n\u201cThe market died because people died,\u201d he said.\n\nRingold is now the site of the city\u2019s Leather History Walk, a pint-sized memorial. Brass boot prints are embedded in the sidewalk, inscribed with the names of the leather dead. There are engraved granite plinths made of repurposed curbstones. The pillars remember lost businesses and celebrate operations that have managed to last 20 years or more, such as Mr. S Leather \u2014 a purveyor of fine fetish gear, still going strong after 39 years.\n\nPerhaps most striking are the bulb-outs, sidewalk extensions designed to calm traffic along the narrow lane. They are painted to resemble the leather pride flag: black and blue stripes bisected by a white stripe and a big red heart.\n\nThe black stripes represent BDSM, Van Laarz said. Blue stands for Levi\u2019s, a leatherman\u2019s wardrobe staple. The heart symbolizes \u201cthe heart and soul of leather people around the world.\u201d\n\nAnd the white? He wracks his brain. In \u201chankie code,\u201d he says, white means a certain solo sex act. It could also mean consent, he said.\n\nOr inclusion.\n\nFive contestants and a local leather columnist, center, at a leather competition sponsored by Drummer magazine in the early 1980s. (Robert Pruzan Papers / GLBT Historical Society)\n\nIn an essay, anthropologist Gayle S. Rubin pegs the beginning of modern leather to the late 1940s, when \u201cbutch gay men interested, sexually and socially, in other butch gay men\u201d donned motorcycle gear and started bike clubs.\n\nToday \u201cleather\u201d is a complicated umbrella covering straight and gay practitioners of kinky sex, people who are into motorcycles and hyper-masculine gay men.\n\nLeather-themed businesses, musicians and artists were drawn to industrial, working-class South of Market by low rents and the fact that it largely emptied out at night. But it also drew the attention of city planners and developers. Large swaths were razed to build the original Moscone Convention Center, which opened in 1981, office towers and high-rise hotels.\n\nDevelopment has only increased in recent years.\n\n\u201cEach time a new wave of this happens, people who aren\u2019t familiar with the history think it\u2019s the first time,\u201d said Rubin, an associate professor of anthropology and women\u2019s studies at the University of Michigan who worked on the Ringold Alley memorial.\n\nBut the pace of change here has jumped dramatically, said Gerard Koskovich of the GLBT Historical Society, which runs a museum in the Castro with a small corner devoted to local leather history.\n\nCurrent-day San Francisco is like Paris in the mid-19th century, Koskovich said, recalling a line from Charles Baudelaire\u2019s poem \u201cThe Swan\u201d that memorialized the gutting of a working-class medieval quarter of that great capital: \u201cThe form of a city changes faster, alas! than the human heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think of that constantly,\u201d Koskovich said, \u201cas I walk around the streets of San Francisco.\u201d\n\nScott Hulsey walks his dogs, Velouria, left, and Duma, on 9th Street.

(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAt a San Francisco Board of Supervisors land use and transportation committee hearing last spring, urban planning took a back seat to discrimination, poverty and the sense that the city seemed to have turned its back on some of those who made it special.\n\nItem 2 on the agenda was, \u201cEstablishment of the LGBTQ and Leather Cultural District,\u201d about two square miles in the heart of formerly industrial South of Market.\n\nThere were declarations of caution, like then-Supervisor Jane Kim\u2019s: \u201cWe don\u2019t want San Francisco to be a city of just the rich and the very rich and to look monolithic.\u201d\n\nDeclarations of pride, like David Hyman\u2019s: \u201cMany of us believe that our exposure to leather culture has made us better, stronger, safer and more ethical and more interconnected.\u201d\n\nAnd of hurt, like Rand Hunt\u2019s: \u201cI went to high school in west Texas. \u2026Everyone in my town was a Southern Baptist and I feared for my life every day. \u2026I wanted to come to San Francisco because I knew I would be safe there and it was our capital city. \u2026 And my [leather] culture is vanishing quickly.\u201d\n\nTwo speakers later, it was Jonathan Schroder\u2019s turn. He stated his name. And occupation, general manager of Mr. S Leather. And started to thank Kim for her remarks.\n\nBut she interrupted him: \u201cI shop at your store.\u201d\n\nEight days later, the supervisors voted to create the leather district."

    "authors": [
      "Frank Shyong"
    ],
    "text": "After more than a year together in our East Hollywood home, I discovered that my mother, a Taiwanese immigrant, had never had avocado toast.\n\nThere are probably millions of people in Los Angeles who have never tried avocado toast, but still, I was surprised. At the time we lived just three blocks north of Sqirl, a cafe considered the cradle of toast culture in Los Angeles. And avocado toast, I kept reading, is Los Angeles in a dish, the hallmark of all things Californian.\n\nAs I struggled to explain in Mandarin how it was prepared (and why she should stop refrigerating my avocados), my mother just shrugged and went back to chopping garlic.\n\nIt was the moment I realized that we lived in the same house, but different cities. I liked House of Pies, took visiting friends to Sqirl and shopped at Trader Joe\u2019s. My mom shopped at Zion Market in Koreatown and ate at Pine and Crane or Yoshinoya Beef Bowl. I read the L.A. Times and LA Weekly, and she read World Journal or watched LA 18.\n\nI guess Los Angeles has always been like this. We live our lives in parallel with few intersections, each of us experiencing a different city with its own culinary hallmarks.\n\nBut I was troubled that my mom and I didn\u2019t seem to be living in the same city. And as a journalist, I worried about all the other versions of Los Angeles I couldn\u2019t see. How many were just outside our front door?\n\nEast Hollywood is a neighborhood of 78,000 people, two-thirds of whom were born outside the United States.\n\nFilipino restaurants serve up chicken adobo and pig blood stew over steam trays all around us. On weekends, backyard quincea\u00f1eras blast mariachi and bachata music across gently rolling hills, the drumbeats tapping on our windows.\n\nThe Korean church has uniform-height bushes and neatly spread gravel. At the Salvadoran Catholic church next door, a parking crew crams the clergy\u2019s cars into a stamp-sized parking lot, a weekly display of incredible spatial reasoning and patience.\n\nAcross the street from our house, there\u2019s a low concrete staircase where kids skateboard, lounge, or sit with dates.\n\nJimmy Recinos, 28, used to be one of them.\n\nJimmy Recinos tries to shop at businesses like Virgil Farmers Market that remind him of what his neighborhood used to be like. Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times\n\nBorn in East Hollywood, Recinos hails from the Los Angeles where a lot of people feel forgotten; where kids grow up loving art but fall into graffiti because there are no art programs; where you might take dates to a low concrete staircase because there\u2019s no park nearby.\n\nHis Oaxaca-born mother, who runs a local newsstand, chose the neighborhood in the 1980s because it was affordable and seemed hospitable to immigrants.\n\nSometimes he rides his bike around the neighborhood and thinks about how it\u2019s all changing. Schoolchildren now share the sidewalk with professional dog walkers. Down the street there\u2019s a new wine bar, but it used to be Amalia\u2019s, one of the most popular Guatemalan restaurants in the city. Next to it is a newly renovated million-dollar home hidden by thick wood slats. Fences aren\u2019t new in this neighborhood, but at least you could wave hello through the wrought-iron bars of the old ones.\n\nConstruction noise is everywhere. Shiny residential developments tower over the streets Recinos biked down as a kid. High-priced restaurants keep opening while the older, affordable places are struggling.\n\nHis version of the city fades a little every day. He tries to shop at the places that keep his memories alive: hamburger meat for barbecues at Carniceria 21, pan at Virgil Farmers Market, haircuts at Quality Barber Shop. His transactions are less like lifelines and more like offerings left at an altar.\n\nHe used to stop for coffee at Super Pan Bakery, the last panaderia on Virgil Avenue.\n\nElvia Perez, 58, ran this bakery with her two sons and daughter for the last two decades.\n\nShe lives in the Los Angeles where churches locate in strip mall storefronts because there is nowhere else to go; where 25 cents for pan is all most can afford; where people do business with handshakes because they are family friends, or because they emigrated from the same region in Guatemala or Mexico or El Salvador.\n\nSuper Pan sold discounted pastries to the many churches that line Virgil Avenue and supplied bread to area street vendors. On Thanksgiving, locals without ovens brought turkeys over for Perez to bake for a small fee.\n\nMiguel Herrera smiles toward 1-year-old Melody Martinez as she peeks through the front door of California Grill, where she was having lunch with her mother Marisol Garcia.

Bottom right: Pedestrians walk past the former location of Super Pan Bakery on Virgil Avenue in East Hollywood. The bakery relocated to South Los Angeles in December. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nFor decades, Perez\u2019s landlords were mostly religious nonprofits and churches, and she never had a contract or faced eviction. But Super Pan\u2019s new landlords were investors and real estate firms.\n\nOne offered a contract if Perez renovated the space. Her sons, husband and nephews retiled, installed brick laminate on the walls and erected a new ceiling. It cost more than $2,000, and half of Perez\u2019s husband\u2019s index finger. He severed it slicing the brick laminate. Still, no contract.\n\nThe next owner, a real estate investment firm, didn\u2019t offer them a contract either, and raised their rent by more than 200%.\n\nActivists and locals like Recinos circulated petitions and contacted attorneys and politicians. Capstone agreed to give Super Pan until December to vacate the property, forestalling an immediate eviction. But in December, Perez relocated to a place in South Los Angeles.\n\nOne block south of Super Pan\u2019s former location, Jessica Koslow, a native of Long Beach, opened Sqirl in 2011 because it was the only place she could afford the rent.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the Los Angeles you may have heard about, the East Coaster\u2019s fantasy, the one where celebrities act like normal people and normal people act like celebrities; where everyone has time to wait in line for brunch.\n\nThe restaurant quickly got popular after a Jonathan Gold review. Then it got huge. TV shows put Sqirl\u2019s jam in their farmers market scenes. Magazines put Koslow\u2019s picture on their covers. Restaurants everywhere started putting avocados on toast, garnishing breakfast bowls with watermelon radishes and selling high-end jam.\n\nMany reveled in the apparent anonymity of the neighborhood around Sqirl \u2014 it made their meals feel more adventurous. It was as if the restaurant got so big that the rest of the world couldn\u2019t see East Hollywood around it.\n\nHousing prices rose. Up the street, a whole building of families was evicted. One day, spray paint on the restaurant compared Sqirl to Trump, blaming it for displacing longtime residents.\n\nGwenn Wedmond, left, a food runner at Sqirl, delivers food to a table during the lunch hour. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) Jimmy Recinos, right, greets friend Eduardo Gonzalez, 60, near Recinos\u2019 home, where he's lived his entire life.

At right: Jimmy Recinos, right, greets friend Eduardo Gonzalez, 60, near Recinos\u2019 home, where he's lived his entire life. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBreakfast restaurants don\u2019t evict people, but the complaints keep Koslow up at night. She understands that venture capitalists and real estate investors have come to East Hollywood, and avocado toast had something do with that.\n\nShe wishes she could talk with her critics. She patronizes local businesses and tries to treat her neighbors with respect. Sqirl staff meals are often pupusas from Salvadoran restaurants just up the street or takeout from Wah\u2019s Golden Hen across the street.\n\nWah\u2019s owner Lena Louie lives in the Los Angeles where it\u2019s common for old-school Cantonese restaurants to have largely Latino clienteles, where the celebrity regular is comedian George Lopez, where the crowds lining up outside her restaurant dress more casually.\n\nHer family opened Wah\u2019s in 1972 after fleeing the Cultural Revolution. They settled in East Hollywood because they heard it was affordable and friendly to immigrants. Louie and her husband, a Chinatown cook, took over the restaurant in 1991.\n\nWork is Louie\u2019s way of life. At 63, she has narrowed her path through the city to a small triangle consisting of the restaurant, her home and Costco, where she buys supplies. She hasn\u2019t visited her homeland for three decades because she felt they couldn\u2019t afford to close.\n\nLouie\u2019s stepmother, 88, walks to the restaurant every day and folds thousands of wontons. A dozen go into each wor wonton soup, along with sauteed chicken, shrimp, napa cabbage, chashu pork and snow peas \u2014 the kind of affordable, generous meal that inspires intense loyalty among customers. When the business was targeted during the L.A. riots, customers and their families stood guard out front to deter looters.\n\nLouie has befriended nearly everyone in the neighborhood, including Koslow, whom she calls \u201cher favorite.\u201d But Louie had never tried the food at Sqirl.\n\nA few weeks ago, I asked if she\u2019d have brunch with me there.\n\nI arrived at Wah\u2019s at around 10 a.m. to find Louie fielding lunch orders and setting tables. It took four tries to leave the restaurant with her \u2014 the phone kept ringing her back until a customer took mercy upon us and offered to take orders.\n\nWe headed across the street, a short walk from Louie\u2019s Los Angeles to Koslow\u2019s.\n\nLouie kept glancing back at her restaurant. She\u2019s too frugal to eat out \u2014 she lived in America for a decade before she even saw the inside of a McDonald\u2019s. Sometimes she treats herself to noodles at the Yoshinoya down the street, but she always feels guilty.\n\nShe asked me what Sqirl\u2019s food is like. I tried to describe it, but I have no idea how to say \u201csorrel pesto\u201d in Mandarin. I\u2019m not totally clear myself on what lacto-fermented hot sauce is.\n\nAt Sqirl, Koslow and Louie greeted each other with nervous, excessive kindness. Louie assured Koslow that the food would be delicious, and Koslow laughed in a slightly terrified way.\n\nLena Louie, left, owner of Wah\u2019s Golden Hen, hugs Jessica Koslow, owner of Sqirl, at Sqirl, which is located across the street from Wah's on Virgil Avenue. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nKoslow presented Louie with a crispy rice salad, a rice porridge and a bright orange turmeric latte.\n\nLouie sipped the latte, set it down and left it there. She regarded the salad, head cocked as if it might start talking, then ate half a spoonful.\n\nHer eyebrows jumped. \u201cOh, this is crunchy! How did you do that?\u201d\n\nKoslow looked relieved. They launched into an animated conversation about how the rice is prepared and the struggles of running a restaurant. Louie even got up and started busing dishes at one point, before Koslow stopped her, laughing and tearing up a bit. By the end, Louie was trying to persuade Koslow to start a restaurant together.\n\nWatching them, I thought about how things might be different if we spent more time in the same Los Angeles, the one where we try to understand our neighbors, where the parallel lives we lead intersect every once in a while.\n\nA few months ago, I took my mom to Sqirl for the first time.\n\nShe said the avocado toast was OK, and she was impressed with the crispy rice salad. But she probably won\u2019t be back.\n\nMostly, she was just glad that I had tried to show her my side of the city, even if it would never be hers.\n\nProduced by Brian Park.\n\nAdditional credits: Video edited by J.R.

    "text": "Every month in the town of Nicolas Romero, the family of Eduardo Hernandez gathers at his grave and, with his guitars, sings to him.\n\nThe sun had set on a cold winter day when two men from Mexico\u2019s civil protection agency knocked on Cecilia Rebeca Chavez\u2019s door.\n\nThey brought news about her husband, Eduardo Hernandez, whom she hadn\u2019t heard from in 10 years. He was in California \u2014 and he was dying. The men left a phone number for her to call.\n\nShe learned that her husband had colon cancer; agonizing pain had driven Hernandez, a 60-year-old day laborer, to Huntington Hospital in Pasadena. He had days to live.\n\nThe agents\u2019 unexpected visit had unraveled at least part of a mystery for Chavez. Her husband was not dead, as she had long imagined. He had not found a new wife, as people in this village of concrete homes and leaky tin roofs had speculated. He had not become a drug trafficker, flush with riches.\n\nNow, as his life slipped away in a country where he had no family, he had a final wish \u2014 to reunite with his wife and children. On the other end of the phone line, a friend of his asked Chavez: Would they come?\n\nChavez, 54, couldn\u2019t dwell on how she felt about Hernandez after so many years of silence, let alone what had caused it. She needed to reach him first.\n\nHernandez always seemed to have a wandering spirit, leaving his rural village in central Mexico for the first time at just 13 to find work and pursue music, his real passion. He ended up staying with an aunt in Nicolas Romero, where Chavez heard of him before they met. He was handsome, she was told, and rode a motorcycle.\n\nThey were married in 1982. Sometimes he would serenade her with his guitar \u2014 especially on her birthday, Nov. 22, the feast day of the patron saint of music, St. Cecilia. One of his favorite songs to sing to her was \u201cMary Es Mi Amor\u201d \u2014 \u201cMary Is My Love\u201d \u2014 with the lyric, \u201cIf one day I am without you, may God help me to die.\u201d\n\nIn Nicolas Romero, a town northwest of Mexico City, they built a humble three-room brick house with a corrugated metal roof. They had three children: a girl named Ivonne and two boys, Hugo and Alfredo.\n\nKeepsakes hanging in Cecilia Rebeca Chavez\u2019s home in Nicolas Romero, Mexico, include a photo, top center, of herself with husband Eduardo Hernandez when they were young. Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times\n\nHernandez played soccer with his boys near a small canal. After coming home late at night from a show with his band, he would break out his guitar and sing the kids to sleep.\n\nIn other ways, though, he wasn\u2019t a good father. He drank too much beer, usually Corona, sometimes getting so sloppy that he could barely get through band practice.\n\nHernandez was struggling to make ends meet working at a car dealership and was increasingly drinking away what little money they had, making it hard to buy groceries, clothes or school supplies. Around this time, a co-worker filled him with stories about making it rich in the United States.\n\nWith money tight, Chavez took on her first job cleaning houses.\n\nThen one day in 1989, Chavez got a call from her sister saying Hernandez had left a letter for her at the sister\u2019s house. In retrospect, the family believes he was too scared to deliver the news in person: He had left for the U.S.\n\nCecilia Rebeca Chavez had last seen husband Eduardo Hernandez in 2008, when he showed up unannounced at the family home in Nicolas Romero. Meghan Dhaliwal for The Los Angeles Times\n\nEverything will be different, he wrote. He promised to send money so she and the children could build themselves a nicer house.\n\nBut Hernandez also wrote that his wife didn\u2019t understand him \u2014 that they fought too much. He said he was leaving to do something more with his life.\n\nWhen he left, Ivonne was 10, Hugo was 6 and Alfredo 4. But the children never lacked a father figure. Some 100 members of their mother\u2019s extended family live on a hilltop they jokingly call the Chavez Colony on the outskirts of Nicolas Romero. Their grandfather Braulio taught them respect and discipline. Their favorite uncle, To\u00f1o, showed them generosity and showered them with affection.\n\nSurrounded by family, Chavez and the kids often lived happily. But Hernandez\u2019s calls home were infrequent, as were the checks he promised.\n\nWhen Ivonne turned 15, Chavez asked him to pay for the quincea\u00f1era celebration. Find the money somehow, he told her, and I\u2019ll send some later. He never did.\n\nWhen a hailstorm caved in their roof and flooded the house, Hernandez promised to send money soon. Chavez and the kids stayed with her parents for almost two months until they could save enough for the repairs. They didn\u2019t hear back from him for a year.\n\nHernandez returned to Mexico for a few months in 1995 and, for the last time, in 2008. He showed up unannounced and lingered at the threshold of the door. The first time, he asked Chavez whether she was going to kick him out. The second time, he walked in behind his sister as if hiding.\n\nDuring these visits, the children tried to rebuild a relationship with their father. They\u2019d play music together or catch movies at the local theater. But it felt mostly superficial. They barely knew him.\n\nDuring his last visit, he stayed just eight months before deciding again that he was fed up with life in Mexico. He couldn\u2019t stand the house, its lack of insulation, primitive flush toilets and unreliable electricity. But a few months after he crossed the border in 2008, he stopped calling.\n\nRumors circulated their small community: Maybe he had become a narco and ended up in prison. Or maybe he had made a new family and forgotten about his old one.\n\nIn reality, Hernandez toiled for years in Los Angeles clothing factories. When those jobs dried up, he found work as a handyman.\n\nEduardo Hernandez\u2019s family visits the local cemetery on the one-year anniversary of his death.

At right: Edgar hands flowers to his brother, Hugo, to place on their father\u2019s grave. (Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAs Hernandez lay dying in Pasadena, he had gone a decade without speaking to his family.\n\nHe was in the U.S. without legal status, and the tightening of border security in recent years had made it harder for immigrants to cross illegally between the two countries. There\u2019s no indication he ever tried to return to his family, though Hernandez spoke vaguely to friends about searching for them on Facebook.\n\nLuis Valentan got to know Hernandez as director of the Pasadena Community Job Center, run by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. He said Hernandez suffered from depression and that he was ashamed to face his family penniless and defeated.\n\nHernandez\u2019s health problems started with stomach pain. Shortly before Christmas in 2017, he complained to friends that he was having trouble eating. He had resisted going to the doctor, not only because he didn\u2019t have medical insurance, but because he feared immigration authorities would find him and deport him.\n\nWhen Valentan visited Hernandez at his apartment a week later, his eyes looked yellowish and he had lost significant weight. He told Valentan he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d live to see the new year.\n\nThree thousand miles away, Hernandez\u2019s daughter was having repeated dreams about him. She can\u2019t recall exactly what happened in these dreams, but she told her mother that they felt like a premonition. \u201cThe day my dad turns up,\u201d Ivonne said, \u201cit\u2019ll be because we find out that he\u2019s dead or sick.\u201d\n\nRaulio Hernandez, 86, and his son Tomas Hernandez Sanchez, 51, spend time in the room that Eduardo Hernandez, their son and brother, once slept in. The family says Eduardo had an adventurous soul, and they don't hold anything against him. Meghan Dhaliwal / For the Los Angeles Times\n\nThat same December, Hernandez\u2019s mother died. For years, his sister Maria had lied and told their mother that he had moved to Chicago and was doing fine. But after more time passed and he still hadn\u2019t called, the lie became too difficult to keep up. Maria finally admitted to their ailing mother she hadn\u2019t heard from her brother since before he crossed the border into the U.S. The old woman died never knowing what had happened to her son.\n\nBy the end of January 2018, Hernandez was in the hospital, his only visitors other day laborers. They played guitar for him, sometimes with 15 of them squeezed into the room. The final song he had enough strength to sing, a duet with his nurse on vocals, was the famous Mexican bolero, \u201cB\u00e9same Mucho.\u201d\n\nKiss me Kiss me a lot As if tonight were the last time\n\nWhen doctors told Hernandez the cancer was terminal \u2014 it had spread to his intestines, lungs and kidneys \u2014 he asked Valentan for help finding his family. They spent days scrolling through thousands of Hugo and Alfredo Hernandezes on Facebook.\n\nBut as Hernandez\u2019s condition worsened, he started losing his eyesight. Valentan needed a new plan. He put out a Facebook blast, asking friends to share Hernandez\u2019s story in hopes that it would reach his children. Nothing.\n\n\u201cWe started to give up,\u201d Valentan said.\n\nThen Valentan\u2019s cousin, a police officer in Mexico City, saw the post. He asked Valentan for the names of Hernandez\u2019s wife and children, their birth dates and hometown. He found their address, but no phone number, using a police database.\n\nThe cousin persuaded the civil protection agency to deliver the news to Hernandez\u2019s family that day. Four days later, Hernandez\u2019s wife and two sons flew to Tijuana with tickets purchased with about $2,000 of borrowed money.\n\nMexican citizens in the U.S. often ask the Mexican Consulate for help reuniting with family, said Felipe Carrera, who oversees the consulate\u2019s department of protection in Los Angeles.\n\nFor those with advanced illnesses, such as Hernandez, the consulate can help family members in Mexico secure visas quickly for a final reunion.\n\n\u201cWe do what we can to find people,\u201d Carrera said.\n\nAfter Hernandez reconnected by phone with Chavez and the children, word quickly spread to the rest of his family. In a phone conversation, his sister Maria, whom he had lived with in Tijuana before making his last trek into California, asked why he never contacted them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he told her. \u201cI lost my address book.\u201d\n\nHernandez was the oldest of nine children, and his siblings were devastated that they hadn\u2019t been able to reconnect sooner. But an uncle, whose brother had gone to the U.S. in the 1960s and never come back, gave them perspective. \u201cAt least you know where your brother is,\u201d he told them. \u201cI looked for many years and was never able to find mine.\u201d\n\nChavez, Hugo and Alfredo arrived at the border in Mexicali at 3 p.m. on Feb. 10 with letters from the hospital and the Pasadena job center, as well as their birth certificates. Ivonne, 39, couldn\u2019t get the time off work and was devastated that she didn\u2019t get to go. Edgar, 18, Chavez\u2019s youngest son from a different relationship but who considered Hernandez his father, also stayed behind.\n\nClose to 1 a.m. the next day, an agent granted them humanitarian parole to enter the U.S. for one week.\n\nMeanwhile, Valentan remained with Hernandez, who appeared to be in more pain every hour. Valentan told him his family was driving up from the border. Wait for them, he said.\n\nBy the time they reached Hernandez, it was 5 a.m. and he could barely speak. His wife and sons circled his hospital bed, patting his arm and stroking his cheek.\n\nHis last word was a weak request. \u201cPerd\u00f3name,\u201d he begged them. Forgive me.\n\nAfter 10 years apart, Eduardo Hernandez\u2019s wife, Cecilia Rebeca Chavez, and sons Alfredo, left, and Hugo arrived in Pasadena to see him the day before he died. Luis Valentan / For the Los Angeles Times\n\nThey hadn\u2019t come to judge him. Chavez, despite the resentment she\u2019d harbored against him for leaving her a single mother, had always told her children to focus on the good.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here now, Pa. We arrived,\u201d said his youngest son, 33-year-old Alfredo.\n\n\u201cLet God rid you of this pain, this anguish,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cYou will be fine now. Relax, Eduardo.\u201d\n\nHernandez could barely open his eyes, but he weakly lifted his arms to hug his wife and sons.\n\nHugo, 35, and Alfredo spent the day playing guitar and singing Mexican ballads to their father, just as he sang them to sleep when they were boys.\n\nClose to 10:30 p.m., they video-called Chavez\u2019s brother Alvaro in Mexico. Hernandez had taught him to play guitar as a teenager, and Alvaro had in turn taught Hernandez\u2019s children. Alvaro began playing one of the first songs Hernandez ever showed him.\n\nHernandez weakly lifted his head and opened his eyes. Unable to speak, he mouthed along as Alvaro sang \u201cTu Inolvidable Sonrisa\u201d \u2014 \u201cYour Unforgettable Smile.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll forget all the good. The bad I\u2019ll forget quickly. I\u2019ll forget so many things But never your smile.\n\nAlfredo was the last one awake shortly after midnight when he heard his father gasp. He called for a nurse, then rubbed his father\u2019s chest. He had stopped breathing.\n\nThe following day, the family visited the dilapidated two-bedroom apartment Hernandez had shared with two other men. Its walls were faded and yellow, with tar-like grease stains behind an old stove top and a ceiling riddled with holes and exposed electrical wires. He had slept on a discolored mattress in the corner of a cramped living room.\n\nCecilia Rebeca Chavez goes through Eduardo Hernandez\u2019s belongings after his death with son Alfredo, center, and Luis Valentan, director of the Pasadena Community Job Center.

(Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThey finally understood why Hernandez hadn\u2019t offered more details about his life, why he\u2019d made so many promises he never kept.\n\n\u201cMy home is ugly,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like this.\u201d\n\nIt was their first real insight into his years in the U.S. He was just a man without much to show for his life.\n\nAlfredo smiled at his father\u2019s paint-stained brown leather work boots. Hugo laughed reading the title of a book, \u201cEnglish in 20 lessons.\u201d\n\nThey sifted through what they\u2019d keep and toss. A near-full box of Amway business cards. A detox and healthy living plan. A pocket-sized copy of the New Testament. A toy car \u2014 \u201cFor your son,\u201d Chavez told Alfredo. A pendant with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.\n\nChavez picked up a plastic bag of medications near his bed: Pepto-Bismol, dietary supplements, digestive enzymes, heartburn relief.\n\n\u201cHe was self-medicating,\u201d Valentan said.\n\nFrom a small wheeled clothes rack, Hugo picked out a light-blue button-up shirt, a black pinstripe jacket and black slacks. After all those years apart, his final resting place would be back in Mexico, at last with his family.\n\nBehind the story: A dying immigrant\u2019s quest to reunite with his estranged family \u00bb\n\nAfter church on an overcast late Sunday morning in May, a dozen family members drove to the cemetery in Nicolas Romero. Stopping at a flower shop across the street, Chavez bought two large bouquets of roses and lilies for 350 pesos, about $20.\n\nThey walked past rows of graves before stopping at a small plot crammed tightly between ornate tombs and a mausoleum. It was bordered by a black metal gate, the dirt packed into a rounded mound. The family had dug it themselves.\n\nThe grave marker, with loopy white script on a metal cross, said Hernandez was \u201cremembered by his wife, children, family and friends.\u201d\n\nForming a semicircle with aunts, uncles and cousins, Hugo sang lead while his siblings played their father\u2019s two plain Fender guitars that they had brought back from Pasadena.\n\nEduardo Hernandez\u2019s family marks the anniversary of his death with music, his passion.

(Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn the year since, the family has continued to gather at his grave every month to sing for him. A large group assembled in early February, around the first anniversary of his death. They serenaded the man they\u2019d come to know better in death than in life with a ballad that could have been written for him. It\u2019s called \u201cEl Andariego\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Wanderer.\u201d\n\nThere are absences that triumph And ours triumphed. Let us love now with the peace That we had previously missed. And when I die, let there be neither light nor crying, No mourning or anything else. There by my cross, I only want peace."

    "text": "\u201cYou don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to be a person\u2019s last day,\u201d said Jaleyah, a senior at the Community Health Advocates School, one of three small schools on the Hawkins campus. \u201c[Kevin] woke up not knowing.\u201d\n\nIn the early hours of Mother\u2019s Day 2018, two other teens Jaleyah was close to, Monyae Jackson and La\u2019marrion Upchurch , were walking home with friends, when they were fatally shot near Dymally High School.\n\nJaleyah, then a high school sophomore, barely had time to grieve when a month later, her best friend, Alex Lomeli, 18, was shot and killed when someone tried to rob a market about a mile from the same high school, located at 60th and Hoover streets.\n\nMinutes later someone drove into an alley nearby, got out of the car and asked Kevin, 17, and two others about their gang affiliation. The gunman then sprayed them with at least 10 rounds, killing Kevin and injuring the others.\n\nJaleyah Collier had just said goodbye to Kevin Cleveland outside a doughnut shop a few blocks from Hawkins High School on a spring afternoon in 2017. Get home safe, she told him before walking away.\n\nMany of the schools are clustered along the 110 Freeway in South L.A., an area with a historically high rate of violence.\n\nDymally and Hawkins aren\u2019t alone. Thirteen other campuses in the county saw at least 50 homicides within a one-mile radius.\n\nThere were 105 people killed within a mile over the last five years, the highest number surrounding any public high school in the county.\n\nWhile much of the recent national conversation on campus violence has focused on mass shootings, schools also are dealing with other physical and psychological harms that thousands of students experience directly or indirectly near campuses.\n\nPolice respond to a crime scene near Hawkins High School. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe impact of that violence can be devastating and costly. Campuses have begun incorporating the inevitability of trauma into their curricula, addressing stress reduction and how to settle differences without resorting to violence. Students suffer symptoms resembling post-traumatic stress disorder and psychiatric social workers are now a staple at many campuses. Because there is too little mental health funding to meet the need, teachers and staff are often on the front lines in identifying the warning signs of emotionally needy students.\n\nSupport our journalism This series is a product of The Homicide Report, The Times\u2019 effort to tell the story of every homicide victim in Los Angeles County.

With limited district busing, some students opt for public transportation or other ride-sharing options. On their journeys, they sometimes pass candle- and flower-filled memorials to fallen friends.\n\nSixteen-year-old Carl Hull, a sophomore at Dymally High School, starts his walk to school each morning by turning into an alley to avoid gang members who live on his street. Once, when he was wearing a gray sweatshirt with the blue L.A. Dodgers logo, they stopped him and asked about his affiliation \u2014 he\u2019s not involved in gangs, he told them. Another morning, a few days after hearing gunfire near his house, he found a 9-millimeter bullet shell. Each day, he said, is \u201clike a guessing game.\u201d\n\nCarl Hull, a 10th-grader at Dymally High School, follows a route he feels is safest to get to school. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)\n\nEvery day I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. \u2014 Carl Hull, sophomore at Dymally High School.\n\nDecades of research suggest that the effects of exposure to violence on teenagers are wide-ranging, and can result in anxiety, depression, anger, absences and an inability to concentrate in class.\n\nEven if students didn\u2019t know the victims, they see reminders on social media, memorial posts and the T-shirts friends and family wear in trying to raise funds for a funeral.\n\nJaleyah woke up on Mother\u2019s Day to find her Instagram feed filled with posts about the shooting of Monyae and La\u2019marrion, she said.\n\nChildren in high-crime areas are \u201closing more people in their youth than most of us have lost when we get to 30 or 40,\u201d said Ferroll Robins, executive director of the nonprofit organization Loved Ones Victims Services, which provides counseling for victims of violence and their families.\n\n\u201cI do worry about what is going to happen to them emotionally, mentally, how bad are they really being scarred?\u201d Robins said. \u201cAnd how much of those scars are going to play into their life later?\u201d\n\nJaleyah Collier hugs her friend Shelsea Reyes, 17, as they spend time together after school at Hawkins High School.

Right, Collier jokes with her friends after school hours at Hawkins High School. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)\n\nJaleyah, a bubbly and energetic 17-year-old, prides herself on her resilience but resents that this constant drumbeat of loss is her reality. In the days after a friend dies, she is unable to concentrate in class, she said. She goes to the funerals, some during the school week. She\u2019s nervous walking to school, afraid a man with a hoodie pulled over his head might be hiding a gun, afraid to walk in alleys or on side streets. She feels a jolt whenever she sees her slain friends\u2019 photos or someone mentions them, reminded each time that their lives had ended too early.\n\nProcessing trauma in the classroom\n\nJason Powell knows he can\u2019t begin teaching his English and music classes at Dymally, at 88th and San Pedro streets, until the kids can address the latest violence in their lives. Over the last five years, 105 people have been killed within a mile of the campus, the highest number surrounding any public high school in the county. Ten of the victims were 18 or younger.\n\nLast year alone, 20 people were killed within a mile \u2014 about one every 2\u00bd weeks. Sometimes they are current or former students, including Monyae.\n\nThey come in welled up with emotion, they\u2019re crying and there\u2019s no way they can concentrate on the lesson at hand. \u2014 Jason Powell, teacher at Dymally High School\n\nAfter the deaths of La\u2019marrion and Monyae, Powell gathered his ninth-graders in circles during class and asked them how they deal with pain. The students were used to sharing because they have these circles often on subjects both mundane and serious.\n\nThe exercise was intended to develop positive coping and conflict resolution skills. One by one, the students took turns sharing stories of loss. Similar scenes played out at several area schools where students had known the boys who were killed.\n\nStudents near high rates of homicide Kids in the highest-homicide areas are more likely to come from poverty and perform lower on state tests. Source: California Department of Education\n\nWhen a friend dies, \u201cthey come in welled up with emotion, they\u2019re crying and there\u2019s no way they can concentrate on the lesson at hand, so whatever\u2019s on the board as far as the lesson plan, that means nothing,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThey need more immediate help.\u201d\n\nJaleyah said that seeing the therapist on campus didn\u2019t help her, but that participating in similar community circles at Hawkins taught her how to voice her anger and channel it into action. \u201cThey give us a chance to speak and feel free [in] what we have to say, without being afraid,\u201d Jaleyah said.\n\nSometimes the loss is unrelenting. As Dymally was preparing for graduation just weeks after former student Monyae\u2019s death, there was more tragic news: Campus aide James Lamont Taylor was killed at 8:30 a.m., walking on the street about a mile from the school.\n\nThe journey their children take just getting to school is a source of stress also for parents.\n\nCarl\u2019s mom worries about him getting robbed or shot on the way to Dymally, or hit by a car while crossing the street. Her older son, Brian Hull, was killed in 2016 crossing the street near her home. She and Carl have grown used to hearing gunshots from their apartment in Broadway-Manchester, less than a mile from the high school. She\u2019s afraid that when he walks down the alley behind their home to get to school, he\u2019ll get hurt.\n\n\u201cI have real bad, heavy anxiety,\u201d Latanya Hull said. One afternoon in September, she began to worry when Carl didn\u2019t get home at the usual time. His phone was broken, so she couldn\u2019t reach him. She called the school. Carl was there, they said, in after-school tutoring.\n\nAssistant Principal Deon Brady ushers students back to their class in between periods.(Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times) Jason Powell, a teacher at Dymally High School, huddles with students for the community circle portion of his class.

Bottom, Jason Powell, a teacher at Dymally High School, huddles with students for the community circle portion of his class. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)\n\nA member of Dymally\u2019s school site council, Hull said she wants to see staff pay more attention to the climate on campus and try to understand the root of students\u2019 problems rather than suspending or arresting them. For example, she praised the school\u2019s assistant principal, Deon Brady, because he gets to know students on campus, welcoming them in the mornings and mingling at lunch. He takes parents\u2019 concerns seriously, Hull said.\n\nCreating mental health resources\n\nEducators know the violence outside of schools affects children after the morning bell rings, and they are trying to find ways to mitigate it.\n\nWhen students lose someone, or are afraid of what will happen getting to and from school, they might not show up, or show up and have difficulty concentrating, said Pia Escudero, executive director of student health and human services for the Los Angeles Unified School District. The constant state of alertness is exhausting and can lead to emotional numbness \u2014 neither of which is good for learning, she said.\n\n\u201cYou look at the kind of complex traumas that some of these young people face, it requires professionals who understand those situations,\u201d said UCLA education professor Tyrone Howard.\n\nWe work in this community. Your job cannot be an academic counselor only. \u2014 Luis Montoya, principal of Fremont High School\n\nWhile more and more schools are adding full-time mental health workers, some still deploy them only in emergencies \u2014 such as when a student or staff member is killed.\n\nAt Fremont High in the Florence neighborhood, seven academic counselors have been trained to look for signs that a student may be in mental distress, principal Luis Montoya said. The watch commanders at the local police station have Montoya\u2019s number, so they can alert him when something has happened that might affect his students.\n\n\u201cWe work in this community. Your job cannot be an academic counselor only,\u201d Montoya said.\n\nLAPD officers and first responders respond to a call from local residents reporting that a boy was shot in the foot.(Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLAPD officers respond to a call for a disturbance.

Bottom left, LAPD responds to a crime scene on the corner of 62nd Street and South Vermont Avenue. Bottom right, LAPD officers respond to a call of a disturbance. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBy his junior year at Fremont, Juan Mercado said, he had witnessed a double homicide at a park in East L.A., a shooting near his home, and had been robbed at gunpoint while skateboarding outside the school. He felt depressed and anxious, always looking over his shoulder, ditching classes and dropping extracurricular activities.\n\nHis mentality became: \u201cI\u2019m trying super hard in school, trying to get good grades and everything, for some random dude [to] just like, take that from me and then all of that work will be gone,\u201d he said.\n\nHe got the nerve one day in senior year to ask his academic counselor for help. She called a campus-based therapist, who began counseling Juan once a week at school. It was the push he needed to get his grades back on track. He graduated on time and is enrolled at L.A. Trade Tech, with aspirations to transfer to UCLA.\n\n\u201cIf she would have told me OK, like, \u2018Come back tomorrow or we\u2019ll talk to him tomorrow\u2019 and stuff, I just probably never would have gone,\u201d Juan said.\n\nDesigning a school with trauma in mind\n\nThe Hawkins campus includes three pilot schools focused on aspects of community health and problem-solving.\n\nTheir goal, in part, is to teach students how to deal with trauma before it happens. Incoming freshmen in the community health school take a summer bridge course to learn how stress \u2014 in such areas as cyberbullying, body image and relationships with siblings \u2014 affects the brain and how to cope.\n\nLearn more Resources for students and families affected by violence\n\nOne program that has shown some success in improving empathy and problem-solving was initially developed for military families \u2014 who can experience frequent moves and stress related to deployment \u2014 and adapted for L.A. Unified. It teaches students about trauma, how people can be triggered, and how to regulate emotions and manage stress, said Roya Ijadi-Maghsoodi, an assistant psychiatry professor at UCLA. The program is available to more than 5,000 students at 106 schools, including Dymally and the community health school at Hawkins.\n\nHigh schools with the most nearby killings Homicides within one mile in the past five years High school Homicides Academy for Multilingual Arts and Science at Mervyn M.

She said she considered leaving to join the Marines, but despite the violence around her there\u2019s a comfort to being home. So for now, she plans to live at home and attend community college after graduating from Hawkins in June. She wants to remember her friends and honor them, but knows they wouldn\u2019t want her grief to hold her back.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t be sad forever,\u201d Jaleyah said. \u201cI just got to keep moving on and do what I gotta do so I won\u2019t be in this situation.\n\n\u201cSo I can make it out of here.

Schools have begun incorporating the inevitability of trauma into their design, with curriculum addressing stress reduction and settling differences without resorting to violence. Mental health workers are now a staple at many campuses. Teachers and staff are often on the front lines of identifying the warning signs of emotionally needy students.\n\nThe Times analyzed homicide data to find the public high schools in L.A. County that are surrounded by the highest number of homicides. Then we spent time at home, at school, and in the spaces between, with teenagers and families who have lost friends and relatives and with the educators and others working to provide a safe environment for kids to learn and thrive.\n\nWhat we learned will soon appear in the series of stories below. Subscribe to our Essential California newsletter to be notified when they arrive.\n\nThe project was written and reported by Sonali Kohli. The photography is by Marcus Yam. Iris Lee and Priya Krishnakumar provided the data analysis, graphics and digital production. The idea for the series came from former Times staffer Jerome Campbell, who also contributed to the reporting."

    "title": "Here's Everything You Need To Know About USC's Many, Many Scandals",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The entrance to the Engemann Student Health Center on the campus of the University of Southern California (Photo by Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nUSC has been repeatedly rocked with scandal, after scandal, after scandal this past year and a half \u2014 from doctors accused of sexually abusing students to the medical school dean's involvement with a prostitute and hard drugs. Having trouble keeping up? Here's a quick recap:\n\nTHE PAY-TO-PLAY BRIBERY SCANDAL\n\nOn March 12, 2019 the U.S. Justice Department revealed that it had charged four current and former USC athletic officials with corruption charges related to a national college admission bribery scheme.\n\nProsecutors said the conspiracy was orchestrated by Newport Beach resident William \"Rick\" Singer through a college admission advising company and a non-profit charity. Singer used decades of experience as an independent college admissions advisor and relationships with college officials and test taking employees nationwide to promise parents guaranteed admission to elite colleges.\n\nProsecutors charged the following with racketeering conspiracy:\n\n- Donna Heinel, USC senior associate athletic director\n\n- Ali Khosroshahin, former head coach of USC women's soccer\n\n- Laura Janke, former USC assistant coach of women's soccer\n\n- Jovan Vavic, USC water polo coach\n\nOn the day of the investigation USC announced it had fired Heinel and Vavic. Lawyers for the four could not be reached for comment. They're scheduled to appear in court on March 25.\n\nProsecutors alleged that the USC employees worked with Singer to greenlight fabricated sports histories and achievements so that students would be admitted to USC as athletic recruits.\n\nIn one instance prosecutors allege that Singer schemed with Las Vegas resident Gamal Abdelaziz to fabricate basketball playing history and awards for his daughter that would be submitted to Heinel in order to admit her to the university as an athletic recruit. Abdelaziz paid Singer's charity $300,000. His daughter was admitted as a recruit and Singer's foundation began sending Heinel monthly $20,000 payments.\n\nPage 89 of federal indictment details involvement of Lisa Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli in a college admission fraud scheme. (US DOJ document)\n\nSinger's list of wealthy clients included business owners and Hollywood actors.\n\nActress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion entrepreneur Mossimo Giannulli allegedly paid Singer's charity $500,000 for Singer to create rowing achievements in order for their two daughters to be accepted into USC. Prosecutors said Singer asked Giannulli to mail $50,000 directly to USC's Heinel.\n\nUnlike USC's other scandals, this one did not appear to show that the university's top administrators knew about wrongdoing and failed to act to stop it. USC made that point in its statement reacting to the college admission investigation.\n\n\"USC has not been accused of any wrongdoing and will continue to cooperate fully with the government's investigation. We understand that the government believes that illegal activity was carried out by individuals who went to great lengths to conceal their actions from the university. USC is conducting an internal investigation,\" USC's media office said in an email.\n\nTHE CARMEN PULIAFITO CASE\n\nIn July 2017, the Los Angeles Times reported a major scandal that appeared stranger than fiction: Carmen Puliafito, the dean of USC's medical school and a nationally recognized opthamologist, had cavorted with a prostitute and criminals, used hard drugs with them both on and off campus, and tried to cover up a fellow drug user's overdose.\n\nCarmen A. Puliafito (Photo by Tonya Wise/Invision/AP)\n\nOne of the most damning accusations was that USC staff knew of Puliafito's behavior. That put a blinding spotlight on USC President Max Nikias. Puliafito was quietly removed as dean but continued to see patients at USC.\n\nThe university faced problems with Puliafito's replacement, too. USC had appointed Rohit Varma - also an opthamologist - as medical school dean, but withdrew the appointment after reporters found that Varma had settled a sexual harassment claim by a female researcher in 2003.\n\nIn July 2018, the California Medical Board suspended Puliafito's license to practice medicine.\n\nThe university's handling of this and accusations that USC's gynecologists abused students over a span of nearly 30 years shook the administration to its core.\n\nTHE GEORGE TYNDALL SCANDAL\n\nThe Los Angeles Times first reported in May 2018 that women had complained to university staff that during medical appointments campus gynecologist George Tyndall had performed unwanted pelvic exams, had made crude sexual comments, and had taken pictures of them naked.\n\nUSC created a telephone hotline to document the allegations. The LAPD announced that detectives had begun to interview 52 alleged victims, some who had called the hotline, as part of a criminal investigation against Tyndall.\n\n\"We believe that with only 52 people coming forward at this point in time, that's probably not an accurate representation of the people that saw him and the potential individuals that might have been victims,\" said LAPD Captain William Hayes. He speculated there could be as many as 10,000 victims, because Tyndall had been a doctor at USC for nearly 30 years.\n\nTyndall and his lawyers consistently denied that he did anything wrong.\n\nWomen who claimed they were Tyndall's victims began to flock to lawyers who helped them file lawsuits alleging the gynecologist sexually assaulted them and that USC was negligent, because it allowed Tyndall to continue seeing patients after women complained. By one count, more than 600 women have filed these kinds of suits.\n\nBy August 2018, the mounting allegations, the investigation and a public letter critical of the university signed by hundreds of professors led USC President Nikias to resign. USC's trustees appointed longtime aerospace executive Wanda Austin as interim president and vowed to conduct a national search for a permanent replacement for Nikias with wide input from USC students, faculty and staff.\n\nUSC's board of trustees is engaged in the process of picking a new president for the university Some faculty want a reformer to clean house up and down the administrative chain of command, while others want someone who will take a more moderate approach.\n\nOn Feb. 12, 2019, USC and plaintiffs' lawyers filed a $215 million settlement agreement in federal court. It includes proposed reforms to USC's student health practices, including the appointment of a women's health advocate and increased pre-hiring background checks of new health hires to find any incidents of sexual harassment or gender-based violence.\n\nThe agreement creates a tiered system for payments to victims ranging from $2,500 to $250,000, depending on the severity of the case. But not all of Tyndall's victims will join the class action. Lawyers for some women who sued Tyndall and USC in state court said the available amounts are too low \"for the severe abuse that they suffered and the emotional and psychological suffering that they've been dealing with for years and years and years,\" said Vince Finaldi, a lawyer who's helped dozens of women sue the university and Tyndall.\n\nTHE DENNIS KELLY ALLEGATIONS\n\nOn Feb. 11, 2019 a third USC doctor became the target of abuse allegations after six men sued USC and Dr. Dennis Kelly, the former campus men's health physician. The plaintiffs allege they were sexually assaulted as students by Kelly at USC's student health center. The men identify as gay and bisexual and claim Kelly targeted them because of their sexual orientation. The suit alleges that Kelly did not explain the reasons for rectal examinations and used inappropriate language when asking the students about their sexual activities.\n\n\"Despite receiving repeated complaints regarding Dr. Kelly's misconduct, USC actively and deliberately failed to investigate, discipline, or address Dr. Kelly's sexually abusive and discriminatory behavior and instead, continued to employ Dr. Kelly for years,\" the suit said.\n\nWhen asked by the L.A. Times, Kelly - who retired last year - denied the accusations and said his behavior with patients was professional. For its part, USC said it will release information about the allegations as it becomes available.\n\n\"We are aware of the lawsuit and are concerned by its allegations. We're working to understand the facts of this matter. We care deeply about our entire Trojan family, including our LGBTQ+ community,\" a USC spokeswoman said in an email.\n\nThe allegations against Kelly and criticism of how USC handled complaints echo in some similar regards accusations against Puliafito and Tyndall.\n\nUPDATES:\n\nMar 15, 2019: This article was updated to include a federal criminal investigation into an alleged college exam and admissions fraud scheme.\n\nThis article was originally published on Feb.21, 2019."

    "text": "High on the mountain of Yucunino, where a valley of pines leads you straight to Tlaxiaco, everyone knows about the girl.\n\nLa Yalitza, they call her \u2014 as if she were a storm that swept through their town. Young and indigenous, she was like so many women here, until she was plucked from her corrugated metal shanty and made a Hollywood star.\n\nYalitza Aparicio is now up for an Oscar for her role in \u201cRoma,\u201d and her hometown couldn\u2019t be more proud.\n\nBut as they eagerly watch to see where fame takes her, Tlaxiaque\u00f1os worry about the fate of another treasure in town.\n\nLife in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, rain or shine, revolves around fiestas. In Tlaxiaco, brass bands boom down cobblestone paths with dancers, fireworks and papier-mache puppets up to 10 feet tall. The parades happen every week. Kids join the calendas as soon as they\u2019re able to walk.\n\nFiesta de la Candelaria, the presentation of the Christ Child, is celebrated in the streets of Tlaxiaco, Mexico.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) More Photos\n\nDetr\u00e1s de la historia: La fama de \u2018Roma\u2019 se siente a un mundo de distancia del humilde pueblo de Tlaxiaco \u00bb\n\nIn 2015, big news came across the radio station La Poderosa. A prestigious musician, a classical trombonist named Alejandro Zamora, was coming from Mexico City to this town of indigenous Mixteco people.\n\nThe mayor, Alejandro Aparicio, persuaded Zamora to start a band at the Casa de la Cultura, a vibrant cultural center run by the city. Zamora, then 34, agreed under one condition: He wanted to launch a symphonic band with only children, each one starting from scratch.\n\n\u201cI had this vision in my mind, and the kids in Tlaxiaco seemed to have all the potential,\u201d Zamora said.\n\nEl Profesor was unlike anything folks in town had ever seen. He was demanding, pushy and passionate, with expectations for recognition that would stretch far beyond the mountain.\n\n\u201cLeave no room for error,\u201d he constantly told his 65-piece band.\n\nKids, ages 5 to 17, rehearsed two hours a day, seven days a week. Sometimes they rehearsed twice in one day.\n\n\u201cOne of my sons cried the first few days,\u201d said Ewdiuviel Lopez, 45. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018Papa, the profesor yells too much.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut in time, Lopez said, his three boys learned to appreciate their teacher. They grew attached to their clarinet, saxophone and snare drums.\n\nZamora taught his students, all Mixtecos like Yalitza, to master dozens of Mexican and Latin American compositions \u2014 sones, jarabes, chilenas and fandangos. These were high-energy pieces with rapid, twisting melodies, complicated rhythms and leaping crescendos.\n\nAlejandro Zamora warms up La Banda Sinf\u00f3nica de Tlaxiaco. (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) Alejandro Zamora gives instructions to students in La Banda Sinf\u00f3nica de Tlaxiaco at the Casa de la Cultura in Tlaxiaco.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) More Photos\n\nHe put the tiniest kids, or those missing teeth, on percussion. The rest played other instruments, such as flutes and clarinets, trumpets and saxophones.\n\nAt every rehearsal, the conductor stood front and center, slicing the air with his hands and watching each protege like a hawk, sometimes addressing them with the endearment my daughter, my son:\n\nValeria, mija, you have to catch up!\n\nChristian, you\u2019re running too much.\n\nWatch your notes, Diana.\n\nFeel the impulse everyone. Eso! Let\u2019s go.\n\n'I had this vision in my mind, and the kids in Tlaxiaco seemed to have all the potential.' Alejandro Zamora\n\nTwo years in, the Banda Sinf\u00f3nica de Tlaxiaco had gained regional acclaim. Tlaxiaque\u00f1os talked about the kids at the market, at church and school. Turning the band\u2019s name into an acronym, they constantly spoke of \u201cBASIT.\u201d Have you heard BASIT? they\u2019d ask. They booked the band for their fiestas, weddings and funerals.\n\n\u201cWe would go everywhere and put on our best show,\u201d said band parent Jesus Montes Bautista.\n\nThose with deep roots in Tlaxiaco like to talk about the days before the Mexican Revolution, when their pueblo was famous for craftsmen who turned out fine furniture, shoes and saddlery. Dealers on mules used to trek up the mountain to buy goods in bulk.\n\nSome Tlaxiaque\u00f1os grew quite wealthy. They vacationed in France and returned to the town square, or zocalo, in puffy, flounced dresses, penguin coat tails and silk gloves. People all over began to call the town El Paris Chiquito, the Little Paris.\n\n'Roma's' Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n shows us the Mexico City streets that shaped his Oscar-nominated film \u00bb\n\nYears later, during the revolution, rioters ran nearly all those folks out of town.\n\nToday, few relics remain from that era beyond Tlaxiaco\u2019s historic clock tower. Chippy and faded, it stands over the zocalo, where vendors peddle used clothes and chanclas as cumbias play, toddlers cry and women in aprons yell, \u201cPapayas! Papayas!\u201d\n\nThe town core has about 17,000 people, with thousands more, like Yalitza\u2019s family, in the outskirts. Many residents, most of all the indigenous families, lack the most basic necessities. They work menial jobs or survive off the land.\n\nBut ask Tlaxiaque\u00f1os what they\u2019re most proud of and they\u2019ll talk about their town\u2019s love of culture and the arts. Every season, at least 600 kids flock to the Casa de la Cultura to take classes in acting, painting, dance and music.\n\nJust as the band\u2019s fame was spreading, a new mayor in 2017 took hold of Tlaxiaco. \u201cYou could say this man was not a big fan of the arts,\u201d said Miguel Martinez Oseguera, director of the Casa de la Cultura.\n\nThen-Mayor Oscar Ramirez Bola\u00f1os cut many programs at the Casa and slashed Zamora\u2019s pay 80%, to $57 a week. Two of his assistants were let go. The third left as well over a pay cut. Parents began buying Zamora rice, beans and bags of tamales.\n\nThe worst insult came in 2018, when the mayor forbid the kids from trying out for Oaxaca\u2019s internationally renowned fiesta, La Guelaguetza. He formed his own band instead, hand selecting what he considered the best teenage musicians of Tlaxiaco. But those candidates didn\u2019t make it past the selection committee, and for only the second time in nearly 30 years Tlaxiaco was shut out of the festival.\n\nThe town, Martinez Oseguera said, was shocked and furious.\n\nStudents participate in a dance class at a preschool in Tlaxiaco, Mexico. Yalitza Aparicio, star of the movie \"Roma,\" taught at the school for three months in 2017-18.

(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) More Photos\n\nOn a recent afternoon, the fourth-generation Tlaxiaque\u00f1o sat behind his desk at the Casa, took a deep breath and scratched his bald head as he recounted the drama.\n\nHe had faced plenty of strife running the Casa for decades. But the mayor\u2019s actions, like most Mexican politics, left him helpless and baffled. Was the cause creative differences? Budget woes? Bad tempers? He\u2019s not entirely sure, and Ramirez Bola\u00f1os has since left town and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nLast summer, as the band\u2019s survival hung by a thread, the kids got what felt like a miracle. A man running for president campaigned in Tlaxiaco and heard them perform.\n\nDays later, his people surprised Zamora with a phone call. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador asked the kids to play at his final campaign rally, before 100,000 people. After he won, he also picked them, from thousands of bands, to perform at his inauguration.\n\nAsk Tlaxiaque\u00f1os what they\u2019re most proud of and they\u2019ll talk about their town\u2019s love of culture and the arts.\n\nThe band made national news. Zamora was overjoyed. Most of all, relieved. Mayor Ramirez Bola\u00f1os was about to term out and his successor was Alejandro Aparicio, the former mayor who had persuaded Zamora to start the band in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe made it,\u201d he told the kids. \u201cThe dark days are over.\u201d\n\nAparicio promised Zamora to restore his pay. He vowed to help him open a music university in Tlaxiaco so indigenous kids from all over could feel part of the band.\n\nBut the promise was short-lived. On Jan. 1, about an hour after Aparicio took office, a former police officer from northern Mexico rushed up to the mayor and shot him twice \u2014 once in the back, once in the chest. Officials continue to investigate the motive for the killing.\n\nAt his funeral, the band he so cherished somberly lined up at his casket and played all of his favorite songs.\n\nThese days, everything at the Casa de la Cultura is on hold until a new mayor takes charge. No one knows whether the next person will make things right.\n\nMeanwhile, every day, it seems, camera crews arrive in Tlaxiaco eager to tell the story of Yalitza. They go to her shanty in search of her sister, her mother, her brothers \u2014 but the family avoids all attention.\n\nSo one by one, reporters end up at the Casa, where Yalitza once took dance and painting classes. Where she held her fateful audition.\n\nMembers of Ballet Folklorico Son Mixteco wait to perform at the Casa de la Cultura in Tlaxiaco. Yalitza Aparicio, star of the movie \"Roma,\" had her audition at the center. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times\n\nIt was here, three years ago, where Martinez Oseguera helped \u201cRoma\u2019s\u201d crew hold a casting call for young women. Yalitza, a quiet student with no acting experience, came to keep her sister company and was persuaded to try out at the last minute.\n\nThe kids in the banda know the tale by heart. Martinez Oseguera likes to share it \u201cevery single day,\u201d Zamora said, laughing.\n\nWhen \u201cLa Yalitza\u201d comes up at band practice, their professor offers sage advice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful story,\u201d he tells them. \u201cBut that\u2019s like winning the lottery. What matters most in life is discipline and hard work.\u201d\n\n\u2018Roma\u2019 star Yalitza Aparicio is more than her Oscar fairy tale \u00bb\n\nOn a recent Sunday the kids were full of jitters. They took deep breaths, wiped tiny beads of sweat off their foreheads and tuned their instruments over and over. A guest of honor \u2014 the head of Oaxaca\u2019s Office of Art and Culture \u2014 was expected to walk through the Casa\u2019s door any minute.\n\nZamora and Martinez Oseguera were certain the frenzy over Yalitza had compelled this powerful woman, with little notice, to trek three hours from the state capital, Oaxaca City.\n\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s impossible to get attention from any of these people,\u201d Zamora said.\n\nThe band was determined to leave her impressed. The survival of the band was at stake. Maybe, they hoped, this visitor could open the door to this year\u2019s La Guelaguetza or perhaps assist with some funding.\n\nZamora stood in front of his band, arms akimbo.\n\n\u201cAtenci\u00f3n!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI want this to be impeccable. I want this to be nothing less than perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cSi, profe!\u201d his students answered.\n\nWhen the lady walked in with her long white huipil dress and gold folkloric earrings, the kids reached for their instruments and put on their best show.\n\nBehind the story: On location in Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca \u00bb\n\nBand members after a recent performance. The band made national news when it performed at the inauguration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times\n\nShe was impressed, but will her visit save the band? It\u2019s too soon to say.\n\nThe next morning, the young musicians of Tlaxiaco assembled in the Casa courtyard, rehearsing once more.\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

    "text": "The old man took out his iPhone and scrolled to a black-and-white photo taken 50 years ago on a movie set in Tehran. Mansour Sepehrnia is paunchy and gray now, but then he was slender and his hair jet black. Along with two other men in the photo, he\u2019s wearing a tuxedo.\n\nThey were filming a comedy and the trio evoked Three Stooges slapstick: Sepehrnia and another skinny actor held up a chunky guy with a goofy expression on his face as he struggled to stand.\n\nSepehrnia shared the image with his fellow diners, then turned to his right and looked at his old friend Shomayoun Tabrizian. He was the other skinny guy. \u201cRemember this photo?\u201d Sepehrnia asked.\n\nTabrizian nodded. Smiles all around at the memory.\n\nMemories fuel the conversation when Sepehrnia, 89, and other old friends gather each week at the Attari Sandwich Shop in \u201cTehrangeles,\u201d the Persian community in Westwood that blossomed after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 prompted thousands of Iranians to flee to the United States. It\u2019s not unusual to find old men gathered like this in other restaurants and tea shops in Tehrangeles. But you\u2019re more likely to see them play backgammon or grumble about the state of Iran today.\n\nAt the Attari, the topic is Hollywood \u2014 at least the Iranian version of it \u2014 and the memories come from a regular group of former actors, comedians, film editors and theater owners who were part of Iran\u2019s once-robust entertainment industry. They had to give up show business when they came to L.A. For 26 years, this little group has gathered at the restaurant every Tuesday at 11 a.m.\n\nThe number of diners, all men, varies \u2014 sometimes a few, sometimes about 10. They mostly speak Persian but sometimes throw in the occasional English. Although each left Iran at a different time and while some still travel to the Islamic Republic, their days in the industry are now distant memories. Sometimes the men sit together without exchanging a single word, simply happy to be in one another\u2019s presence.\n\nEvery Tuesday, several friends gather at Attari Sandwich Shop, where they recall Iran\u2019s once-robust entertainment industry before the Islamic Revolution. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe gathering brings to mind the famed roundtable at the Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles, where comedians such as George Burns, Groucho Marx and George Jessel cracked jokes and reminisced. At the Attari, the ambience is less glitzy and conversation less competitive \u2014 no one is trying to outdo one another \u2014 and the wisecracks don\u2019t flow in English.\n\nJust as Sepehrnia finished showing his friends the old photo, he recalled trying to film a fight scene. \u201cThe director was trying to show this guy how to fake-punch me, and he didn\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nSepehrnia speaks in a slow, methodological way and continued as the waiter dropped off tea.\n\n\u201cNext thing I know the guy swings his arm and hits my nose! I had blood everywhere. And I see the director is laughing so hard he has tears coming down his face,\u201d Sepehrnia recalled, laughing. \u201cThe director said now I am a real comedian.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Reza Taghavi, 79, jumped in, directing the men back to the tuxedo photo.\n\n\u201cYou guys were much better looking back then!\u201d he joked.\n\nThe room echoed with more deep laughter.\n\nAnother of the regulars, John Reghabi, recalled how in Iran fans always recognized him. Reghabi doesn\u2019t say this in a boastful way. He was a leading man and, as his friends see it, just stating the facts.\n\n\u201cI was a famous guy,\u201d said Reghabi, 81. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk down the street without being stopped.\u201d\n\nHis friends nodded.\n\n\u201cYes, everyone knew you!\u201d said Taghavi, who used to handle movie advertising. \u201cYou were famous.\u201d\n\nBut Reghabi\u2019s fortunes, and those of everyone else who gather each Tuesday at 11, changed 40 years ago last week. On Feb. 11, 1979, the revolution that would overthrew Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi began.\n\nLike many other older first-generation Iranian Americans, the men now feel stranded, stuck between their memories of an Iran that no longer exists and the American identities they have come to embrace. But they still have their memories of the movies.\n\nShomayoun Tabrizian, left, and Mansour Sepehrnia, right, were actors in Iran. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Reza Taghavi, who worked in movie advertising, fled Iran five months after start of the Islamic Revolution. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Shomayoun Tabrizian, left, with Mansour Sepehrnia, were actors in Iran. Reza Taghavi, right, who worked in movie advertising, fled Iran five months after start of the Islamic Revolution. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIran\u2019s film industry started to grow rapidly in the 1950s. Studios were launched and produced hundreds of films while movie theaters popped up in Tehran and the provinces.\n\nIn the last two decades before the revolution, the country\u2019s cinema underwent a transformation. The \u201cIranian New Wave,\u201d as it was known, used simple dialogue and camera work to portray the plight of the lower class and to critique sociopolitical conditions. Such films sought to compete with Hollywood-inspired films that were ubiquitous. Pahlavi censored or banned several New Wave films that he believed critiqued his efforts of \u201cWesterninizing\u201d Iran.\n\nSepehrnia\u2019s specialty was comedy, and he acted in more than 100 movies. He\u2019s most proud of a 1971 film, \u201cA Suitcaseful of Sex,\u201d in which he plays a thief who steals a suitcase only to find a young woman hiding in it. Given the plot, and especially the title, it wasn\u2019t the kind of movie that would win over religious authorities after the revolution.\n\nSepehrnia happened to be in Los Angeles visiting two friends when the revolution began. Sepehrnia\u2019s father called and told him not to return. There was no point, his father said.\n\nHis four children eventually joined him when he settled in Glendale, but his wife stayed behind in Iran. Sepehrnia become an entrepreneur, buying three gas stations, because he wasn\u2019t able to continue acting.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have an accent, I could have continued to be a comedian in America,\u201d he said.\n\nSepehrnia spoke at a table laden with cups of steaming tea, honey-soaked baklava and pieces of bamieh, fried dough infused with rose water and saffron. As a waitress dashed by with a bowl filled to the brim, Sepehrnia caught a whiff of the barley soup. He\u2019s hard of hearing and yelled out to the waitress.\n\n\u201cI want one of those!\u201d he said in English.\n\n\u201cYou have it!\u201d Taghavi said in Persian. \u201cIt\u2019s right next to you.\u201d\n\nThe men again burst out laughing, and when Sepehrnia saw he already had a bowl, he laughed too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you get old,\u201d he said as he dipped his spoon into the soup.\n\nLaughter is the predominant sound at the lunches, but it fades away as the men recall careers, and people, they have lost. Sepehrnia and Tabrizian sadly noted that the third man in the tuxedo photo \u2014 the one making the goofy face \u2014 had died.\n\nTabrizian still lives in Iran and was a rare visitor to the Tuesday lunch. Taghavi reflected on friends back in Iran who haven\u2019t been able to receive visas to visit the United States under the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban.\n\n\u201cWe used to have so many people visit,\u201d he said. \u201cNow barely anyone comes.\u201d\n\nTaghavi left Iran five months after the revolution, with his wife, 7-year-old son, 4-year-old daughter and $21,600. He had planned to stay for only three or four months. He would have brought more money, he said, if had known he\u2019d be spending the rest of his life in the United States.\n\nTaghavi looked at his friends. He began recalling what he felt when he visited Iran 10 years after the revolution. \u201cI saw the movie theaters were burned down. That\u2019s when I started crying,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Taghavi became an entrepreneur and opened a clothing store in Westwood. When that didn\u2019t work out, he sold toys at swap meets. He also founded a video gaming company, and when he and his son sold the business in 2006, it had 260 employees.\n\nHe did well. But it wasn\u2019t the movies, and not Tehran. Taghavi had lived in one of the city\u2019s best neighborhoods. He spent 20 years in marketing for the Iran film industry and met up with prominent actors and industry figures at least once a week for dinner.\n\nThe bittersweet memory was interrupted with the arrival of four other friends. Some men got up and slowly moved toward the arrivals, while others who have difficulty walking stood up and waited at the table. They embraced one another, smiling and, Persian style, gave kisses on both cheeks.\n\nAt Attari Sandwich Shop in a section of Westwood known as \"Tehrangeles,\" old friends reminisce about life in Iran before the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cCome here! Sit down!\u201d Taghavi shouted. His eyes widened as he gestured for his friends to take a seat.\n\nOn another Tuesday, Taghavi sat elbow-to-elbow with Sepehrnia and Reghabi, the former leading man. This time it was only the three of them.\n\nThey still follow the movie industry from afar. Sepehrnia is an ardent watcher of the Academy Awards and was pleased that Iranian director Asghar Farhadi\u2019s \u201cThe Salesman\u201d won the Oscar in 2017 for foreign-language film. He said people still find his films online and praise his acting.\n\nReghabi first visited Los Angeles in 1957 with the ambitious goal of building bridges between Hollywood and Tehran\u2019s film industry. With his thick eyebrows and a chiseled jawline, Reghabi told his friends, he could have been a Hollywood heartthrob. \u201cHollywood offered me to play James Bond when Sean Connery didn\u2019t want to,\u201d he said.\n\nReghabi took out his phone and held up a black-and-white photo of Iranian singer and actress known just as Googoosh. \u201cShe was my girlfriend,\u201d he said.\n\nReghabi never did cross over to American films, though he did build on connections he made with some of Hollywood\u2019s hottest stars. He began organizing film festivals in Tehran and imported Hollywood films, dubbing them into Persian. He rubbed elbows, he said, with Jerry Lewis, William Holden and Loretta Young, among others.\n\n\u201cI was a big shot in my country,\u201d Reghabi said.\n\nBut then came the revolution.\n\nReghabi put his phone in his jacket pocket, sipped his tea and got up.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Taghavi asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not even 12 p.m. We have more to talk about.\u201d\n\nReghabi insisted on leaving. He had plans to meet other friends at a store a block away, and he set off on a beautiful winter afternoon, brisk but full of sun."

    "authors": [
      "Frank Shyong"
    ],
    "text": "How many dumplings equal a \u201cmeal\u201d?\n\nI\u2019ve personally pondered this question because the number of dumplings I want to eat rarely corresponds with the recommended serving size.\n\nBut this question also happens to come up when you read the text of California Assembly Bill 626, a new law decriminalizing the sale of home-cooked food.\n\nThe law, which took effect Jan. 1, allows home cooks to earn up to $50,000 in annual revenue and sell up to 60 \u201cmeals\u201d a week after obtaining a permit, paying a fee and agreeing to inspections.\n\nThe disconnect I felt has a simple explanation, said Christina Oatfield, policy director of the Sustainable Economies Law Center. She alleges that tech giants are the true beneficiary of AB 626 because the law contains regulations allowing for the sale of home-cooked food over the internet.\n\n\u201cThis bill was really marketed as something that would help immigrants and people of color. The reality that I observed was that those immigrants and marginalized people weren\u2019t at the negotiating table,\u201d said Oatfield, who was part of the working group authoring AB 626 but left because the bill would not include specific language barring tech giants from the home-cooked food space.\n\nAB 626 was partly written by the founders of a tech start-up. Josephine.com, launched by Matt Jorgensen and Charley Wang in 2015, was a gig-based meal sales company that raised millions in venture capital.\n\nWang and Jorgensen say they were the anti-Silicon Valley start-up, focusing on offering value to the user rather than on growth and profit. For a 10% commission, they offered users a customer base, marketing tips, free takeout containers, training sessions about food safety and certification, and even food photography advice. Entrepreneurs like Joe Acanfora and Hai Lam, who sell home-cooked Thai food in Emeryville, Calif., said that signing up with Josephine.com enabled them to earn a healthy side income and find customers.\n\nAfter Josephine was eventually forced to shut down because regulators informed the company it was violating state home-cooking laws, Jorgensen launched C.O.O.K. Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group for home cooks. He and Wang were eventually approached by lawmakers to help write AB 626.\n\nWang and Jorgensen say that protecting immigrant home cooks from tech giants was one of their main priorities. That\u2019s why, Jorgensen said, they fought for provisions to the law requiring cooks to directly transact with customers rather than through a third-party service such as Uber Eats. But Wang acknowledges the possibility that tech giants could create an online, gig-based platform that dominates the home-cooked food space and extracts profits from home cooks.\n\n\u201cIf smart people aren\u2019t working to counter those forces, that is a totally fair concern,\u201d Wang said.\n\nCOLUMN: If Chinatown is a metaphor for anything, it\u2019s America \u00bb\n\nThe final version of the law includes specific regulations for any web platforms that enter the home-cooked food economy \u2014 a legal pathway for the dozens of home-cooked food start-ups to enter the space. Airbnb even signed on as a sponsor to AB 626 and spent thousands to lobby on the bill\u2019s behalf, most likely because the company is building home-cooked food into curated vacations, or \u201cexperiences\u201d that Airbnb sells on its website.\n\nAB 626 could give some home cooks the chance to launch a legitimate side business. Tech platforms could help cooks with payment processing, advertising, marketing or delivery \u2014 enriching Silicon Valley venture capitalists but also providing value to consumers\n\nBut for immigrants working in the informal food economy, the bill offers little. Regulators at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health told me they aren\u2019t exactly expecting a wave of applications from the beloved tamale vendors and underground dumpling entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cThis law is not intended to legalize unpermitted vending. It\u2019s intended for small entrepreneurs who want to do things right and be safe,\u201d said Veronica Petrosyan, a health specialist with the agency.\n\nNow we\u2019re left with the painful irony that a bill marketed as helping immigrants and people of color might actually help tech giants instead.\n\nIt\u2019s a pity, because food regulations do affect immigrant communities. Los Angeles County has issued 843 violations for selling food from an uninspected kitchen since 2016, and the violations, though rare, have occurred disproportionately in neighborhoods with high percentages of foreign-born residents, according to a Times analysis.\n\nImmigrant enclaves hit hardest by enforcement County health inspectors passed out 843 violations for home cooking over a three-year period.

She understands that selling the food without a permit is unlawful, she said. But so were ride-hailing services like Uber at the beginning, she said.\n\nI thought it was an interesting comparison. Entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and the San Gabriel Valley both break or ignore rules to do business. But our government\u2019s response to them is vastly different.\n\nAirbnb violated residential zoning requirements and became a multibillion-dollar company. Meanwhile, residential motels \u2014 unofficial hostel arrangements for budget travelers that have existed in Asian communities for decades \u2014 are unanimously labeled public scourges.\n\nForty-seven states have passed laws making it easier for Uber to operate, but taxi companies \u2014 which in L.A. are dominated by Armenian and Iranian immigrants \u2014 have been devastated.\n\nWho gets to break the rules, and who gets to change them? So often the answer to both questions is tech giants.\n\nA few weeks ago, thinking that the passage of AB 626 meant that I\u2019d have some good news for her, I paid my favorite underground dumpling maker a visit.\n\nShe perked up when I mentioned her dumplings, remembered my call and invited me in.\n\nAn immigrant from Shanghai, she\u2019s been operating the business with her sister for 10 years, but always in fear. She recently decided to open a restaurant so she\u2019d feel less stressed out.\n\nBut she was still afraid of authorities cracking down. Even after I offered to keep her identity anonymous, she claimed no dumplings were made on-site, though she wore a stained apron and an industrial-sized bucket of soy sauce was within view.\n\nThe law won\u2019t cover businesses like hers. She has more than one employee, and her business generates more than $50,000 in gross sales a year.\n\nAnd then there was the question of how many dumplings were in a meal (she sells thousands in a week).\n\nWe both had no idea.\n\nTimes staff writer Ryan Menezes contributed to this report.\n\nProduced by Brian Park.\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

    "text": "The subject of the new neighbor had the round table at the Donut Wheel riveted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all sitting here, waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Bobbie Jo Seaver said about former Gov. Jerry Brown \u2019s retirement to a ranch in Colusa County.\n\nSeaver, 86, and her sister Janet Staple, 90, are Brown\u2019s cousins. (Their grandmother Emma and his grandmother Ida were sisters.) Like many California families, a few generations ago one branch stayed on the farm and another left for the city. Now Brown\u2018s return to the ancestral home crosses the rural-urban divide.\n\nThe two lively white-haired sisters are the nucleus of the daily coffee klatch. Others know to drop by the doughnut shop for a chat.\n\nOn this day, rancher Gordon Detlefsen pointedly crossed his arms when the subject turned to Brown.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to catch Jerry in anything you have to saddle,\u201d he said, barely moving his lips. \u201cHe\u2019s not part of our world.\u201d\n\nBobbie Jo Seaver, center, and June O'Sullivan, right, chat over coffee at the Donut Wheel in Colusa, Calif. Noah Berger / For The Times\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Brown, a Democrat, has moved to an area populated by Republican ranchers. Or even that he is a lawyer and politician now residing where most people make a living off the land. It\u2019s that he\u2019s a newcomer.\n\nJim White, born and raised in Colusa, told a story about what happened when he first moved back to town after college in Chico and a lifetime working throughout the country. He saw a bunch of pickup trucks on Market Street, figured there must be a crowd at the Sportsman Club and joined the party.\n\n\u201cWay at the end of the bar I saw Jerry Moss, looking down in his beer. I walked over and shook his hand, and he said: \u2018Dammit! You\u2019ve been gone from here the 30 years I\u2019ve been here. But you walk in and it\u2019s like you never left and I\u2019m still the new dentist.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the new dentist!\u201d Seaver said, laughing. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t forgotten old Dr. Hickok.\u201d\n\nColusa is one of California\u2019s original counties, a land of golden hills and sprawling ranches. Velvet quilts of rice fields spread over wetlands of the Sacramento River.\n\nA woman crosses Market Street, the main thoroughfare through downtown Colusa. Noah Berger / For The Times\n\nUsually there are flocks of ducks taking to the sky, but this was one of the last days of hunting season. Each year, the locals say, any ducks that survive move to a wildlife reserve on opening day and don\u2019t return until the shooting stops. There are about a half-dozen duck-hunting clubs in the county, and they can cost as much as a half-million dollars to join.\n\nIn the town of Colusa, population 5,963 at last official count, most public buildings are Gold Rush-era, with a listing on historical registers. The new librarian (she\u2019s had the job three years) keeps her grandfather\u2019s Colusa library card pinned to the wall. Stacey Zwald Costello\u2019s goal is to stay in the job three decades, like the librarian she knew as a kid.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nBut change does creep in.\n\n\u201cI raised a liberal daughter,\u201d bemoaned Roy Lee, who ran Chung Sun, the town\u2019s only grocery store, which closed in 2014 so he could retire. \u201cMillie came home from college and read me the riot act about the Supreme Court guy,\u201d Lee said \u2014 referring to Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe Rotary Club\u2019s annual fundraiser had been a perennial failure, but members added a duck dinner, drinks and video gambling to the event. Now they rake in around $25,000 a year.\n\nSeaver and Staple were born in Colusa and never left.\n\n\u201cBoth married Colusa boys and here we stayed,\u201d Seaver said. \u201cWell, I did travel to gun shows with my husband. He loved those.\u201d\n\nThe roots they share with Brown stretch back to August Schuckman, their great-grandfather, a German immigrant who ran a popular stagecoach stop called the Mountain House. It\u2019s the same land where Brown and his wife, Anne Gust Brown (\u201ca real nice gal,\u201d Seaver said), built their solar-powered ranch house.\n\nKathryn Lees cuts Dan Yerxa's hair at the Sportsman barbershop in Colusa. \u201cI know Jerry, so\u2026 welcome to Colusa,\" said Yerxa. Noah Berger / For The Times\n\nStaple said Brown recently had them up to the ranch for \u201ca buggy ride.\u201d She said his dog, a Corgi named Colusa, sat on her lap \u201cpanting just as calm as could be while I held on for dear life, what with the way he drove that SUV.\u201d\n\nShe warned Brown to cut the grass around the house because of rattlesnakes, and to get some Guinea hens that will kill them. Brown told her his security staff already had barbecued some rattlers, eaten them and said they tasted like chicken.\n\nThe former governor may be getting along fine for now, Staple said, but she doesn\u2019t think he will stay long.\n\n\u201cWhen his grandma used to visit our grandma, she never stayed the week she promised,\u201d Staple said, \u201cbut left early because she hated the country.\u201d\n\nHer sister, however, thinks Brown is going to love it.\n\n\u201cHe never got to go fishing. He never got to do the things we done,\u201d Seaver said. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s out there planting his trees \u2014 we all got olive oil for Christmas. He\u2019s like a little boy in a sandbox.\u201d\n\nWhite, a Republican (\u201cthough I\u2019m just as likely to vote for a Democrat if I like them better\u201d), said he would like to get to know Brown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the same age. Both Jesuit-educated. And one of his best friends is brother to one of my college roommates.\u201d\n\nDetlefsen allowed that many of the locals probably would give Brown \u2014 who never won an election in Colusa County \u2014 a chance.\n\nBut only one.\n\nA worker prunes trees in an orchard in unincorporated Colusa County. Noah Berger / For The Times\n\n\u201cMost people around here are pretty damn good people, and they\u2019ll be the first ones to initiate some understanding. But don\u2019t abuse that step, because it will be the first and last they\u2019ll ever take,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to meet us \u2014 we\u2019re not moving for him.\u201d\n\ndiana.marcum@latimes.com\n\n@DianaMarcum"

    "text": "Parked outside a Calexico job center, Jonathan Lopez leaned against his worn SUV and took a drag from a cigarette. He was waiting, yet again, for word on his unemployment application.\n\n\u201cA well-paying, full-time job is impossible to find,\u201d the 39-year-old lamented as his son played nearby. \u201cI have a family with four children and we struggle. It is a daily battle to make ends meet.\u201d\n\nAs California has rebounded from the Great Recession, the Imperial Valley has largely defied attempts to expand its economy beyond seasonal farming and government work, and the county continues to suffer the highest unemployment rates in the state.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s latest five-year estimate, Imperial County's unemployment rate stands at 16% \u2014 four times greater than the state\u2019s overall jobless rate of 4.2%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much better than it was in 2009, when El Centro was mentioned as the highest unemployment in the nation at almost 30%,\u201d county Supervisor Ryan Kelley said. \u201cThis is supposed to be the recovery, and every time there is a recovery, we seem to be the least-benefiting area.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, locals have pinned hopes of economic salvation on a variety of new industries, such as geothermal energy , lithium extraction and the growing of industrial hemp.\n\nEl Centro City Councilman Jason Jackson said the valley \u2014 which has \u201call the things\u201d that should be attractive to industry, like abundant water from the Colorado River and low power rates \u2014 is on the cusp of breaking out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a little bit isolated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been thought of as an agricultural community, so industry has never really taken a good, solid look at us.\u201d\n\nWedged in the southeast corner of the state, between the Mexico border and the Colorado River, the valley has depended heavily on agriculture ever since the Imperial Land Co. helped to bring large-scale irrigation in the early 1900s and transformed a barren desert into abundant farmland.\n\nAlthough some argue the seasonal nature of farming has inflated county unemployment figures, there is no denying Imperial County is well-acquainted with economic adversity . The median household income is $44,770, well below the state median of $71,805, and nearly a quarter of its residents live below the poverty line. Statewide, that figure is 13.3%.\n\nThe vast expanse of flat, sunny land is seen by some renewable energy developers as ideal for solar farms. And the county is home to nearly a dozen geothermal power plants, which use a naturally heated underground reservoir to churn out pollution-free electricity around the clock.\n\n\u201cAbout five years ago, we saw a sustainable-energy boom, and we thought it would develop the workforce,\u201d said Priscilla Lopez, interim director of the Imperial County Workforce Development Board. \u201cBut once built, they didn\u2019t create jobs. You only need five or six people to run those plants.\u201d\n\nJackson remains optimistic despite such concerns, noting that home builders are coming back to the valley \u201cto look around\u201d for the first time since the housing boom turned into a bust.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a dance floor. Nobody wants to be the first couple to go out and dance, but once someone does, everyone goes out,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re just waiting for that first couple to dance. We haven\u2019t been able to land that one big fish yet.\u201d\n\nFarm workers from Mexico board their buses parked near a border crossing that carry laborers to job sites.

The fourth-generation farmer said he\u2019d been researching other crops as a way to help sustain his business.\n\n\u201cWe need those options,\u201d Vessey said. \u201cPlants are going to Mexico. I wouldn\u2019t call it an exodus, but I have to find other crops to grow.\u201d\n\nIndustrial hemp, which could be grown twice a year and was approved for cultivation by the federal government in 2018, is a primary candidate, he said.\n\n\u201cHemp is going to give this valley another high-value crop and possibly another industry through extraction for CBD oils \u2026 or making lotions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of areas in that industry are looking here.\u201d\n\nSergio Iberra, center, and other farmworkers work in an onion field in Holtville. Iberra crosses the border each day in Calexico. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)\n\nKey to Imperial County\u2019s economy is its relationship with the border city of Mexicali. More than 50,000 people cross each day, and an estimated $1 billion in consumer retail expenditures come from Mexico annually, according to a 2018 county report.\n\nThe county also has welcomed investment from beyond Mexico, under the program known as EB-5. There are three regional centers in Imperial County, approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, with the goal of stimulating the local economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors. In areas like this with high unemployment rates, investors must put up $500,000 to access the program and receive their own immigration visas.\n\nThe program has sparked multiple projects financed by Chinese investors, such as the Town Center Villa apartments in El Centro.\n\nBut other ventures have faced difficulties.\n\nA boarded and closed shopping plaza on Imperial Avenue in El Centro.

The project, funded through the investor program, stalled and the building and dirt lot that surrounds it will soon go to auction, county Supervisor Ray Castillo said.\n\nDriving along California 111 in Heber on a recent day, Castillo pulled into a vacant parking lot near a gas station. A Chinese investor broke ground on a project there too, he said, with plans to build a motel and open restaurants that would draw crowds to a new area they would call Imperial Center.\n\nThe restaurants opened, then most closed.\n\nAt its height, the project employed 150 people, Castillo said. All but 50 lost their jobs. The county seized the center in May as part of a loan default case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cThis started with grand ideas of what we could do.\u201d\n\nImperial County Supervisor Ray Castillo talks about a stalled Holiday Inn project in Imperial, funded through the EB-5 visa program. Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times\n\nInside an employment center in El Centro last month, crowds of people hunched over computer screens, searching for jobs.\n\nStephanie Aguilar perused the postings on a job board, which included correctional officer and sales associate at the Gap. She has been looking for work for five months, she said, after being let go from her previous position as a hotel sales manager.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because my parents live in Mexico,\u201d said Aguilar, 27, \u201cand I was helping them pay for my brother\u2019s medical school.\u201d\n\nAngelica Pacheco, a site supervisor for the job center, said some people come in every day to look for work or update their resumes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get hundreds of people applying for one or two openings sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard out there.\u201d\n\nJonathan Lopez and his wife had left Imperial County several times in hopes of building a better life, but \u201cevery time we couldn\u2019t make it out in the big city, we would come back out here to the valley because we have family out here \u2014 not because of the job opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe family can\u2019t afford to rent an apartment, so they live at Karla\u2019s mom\u2019s house in Heber. They and their four children squeeze into two of the house\u2019s three bedrooms.\n\n\u201cIt sucks here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe farther you go from the county, the more chances you got.\u201d\n\nHis best hope, he thinks, is to earn his air conditioning technician certification while collecting unemployment and looking for work.\n\nAfter that, he said, the family might move to Arizona to start fresh.\n\nJonathan Lopez and Karla de Lopez with their four children, ages 4 to 11. The farther you get from Imperial County, \"the more chances you got,\" says Jonathan. Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times\n\nStaff writer Sammy Roth contributed to this report."

    "text": "The thieves seemed to know exactly what they were looking for.\n\nThey entered an unmarked warehouse on a South Los Angeles side street, moved through a warren of file cabinets, yellowing papers and jettisoned desks, and breached a small storage room.\n\nInside was a cache of furniture designed by two of the most celebrated American architects of the 20th century, Frank Lloyd Wright and Rudolph Schindler.\n\nThe thieves made off with two of Wright\u2019s striking floor lamps and a cushioned chair believed to have been designed by Schindler \u2014 a haul with a potential value of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nSix years after the heist at the USC warehouse, the identities of the perpetrators remain a mystery.\n\nThere is a second puzzle: Why didn\u2019t the university report the theft to police at the time or seek the public\u2019s help in recovering the irreplaceable pieces?\n\nDetectives only learned of the larceny in recent weeks, after an anonymous letter to the Los Angeles Times revealed the crime.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright's Freeman House is seen in 2019. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nNinety years ago, the lamps illuminated one of the most breathtaking living rooms in L.A. The residence belonged to Samuel Freeman and his dancer wife, Harriet, an avant-garde couple who had commissioned Wright to turn a steep and narrow plot in the Hollywood Hills into a showplace.\n\nThe architect, already famous and enjoying a midlife sojourn in California, ringed the living room with tall windows that provided dramatic views down Highland Avenue and of the surrounding hills.\n\nThe furniture he fashioned for the room included the 6-foot-high cast iron and glass lamps. His protege, Schindler, later worked on the house, adding his own unique furnishings.\n\nFor decades, the Freemans\u2019 eclectic crowd of artists, scientists and leftists savored the home and its decor. \u201cCasablanca\u201d actor Claude Rains was a regular at the couple\u2019s so-called salons, and Harriet Freeman feted legendary choreographer Martha Graham at a dinner party in the living room.\n\nSamuel Freeman died in the living room in 1981. Harriet suffered a stroke and spent her final months in a bed in the living room. She died in 1986. Childless, they left the home and furniture to USC, hoping the university would treasure the property as a site for meetings, classes and historic preservation.\n\nThe patterned cement blocks from the Freeman House. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright designed the house in the early 20th century. Los Angeles Times\n\nPreservationists quickly learned that maintaining the Freemans\u2019 home, like other Wright designs in L.A., would be a major challenge. The residence\u2019s hallmark \u2014 patterned cement-block walls that recalled Mayan temples \u2014 proved uniquely unsuited for California\u2019s seismic environment.\n\nThe Freeman House suffered severe structural damage in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Tiles tumbled from the house and broke. It took the university years to secure more than $1 million in restoration funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other sources.\n\nAround 2000, in advance of the work, USC moved the contents of the home, including the Wright and Schindler furniture, to the architecture school\u2019s rented warehouse. The brick facility on 24th Street, formerly a city power station, has a cavernous interior with at least one separate, locked room.\n\nSome broken tiles were stored in the main room while the furniture was placed in the locked area, according to people familiar with the warehouse. For the next decade, the pieces that had delighted the Freemans and their guests would sit in the dark, glimpsed only occasionally by USC faculty, staff and students.\n\nThe Freeman House in 1998 was supported by braces and had a tent over its roof after the Northridge earthquake. Bob Carey / Los Angeles Times\n\nA 1998 photograph shows damage to a wall at back of the Freeman House. Bob Carey / Los Angeles Times\n\nA facilities staffer visiting the warehouse in September 2012 noticed items missing from the locked room.\n\nThere was no sign of a break-in or vandalism, and nothing but the Wright and Schindler furniture seemed to have been taken.\n\nKenneth Breisch, an associate professor who oversaw the graduate program in historic preservation, said that as far as he knew, there was only one key to the room and it was maintained by the facilities department.\n\nThe staffer who had discovered the missing items contacted Breisch to see whether he knew anything. Told no, the staffer said he planned to alert campus police, according to Breisch.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\n\u201cI just assumed they were taking care of it,\u201d said Breisch, who declined to name the staffer. \u201cI just assumed, I think, that it probably didn\u2019t consist of anything of value, [otherwise] I would have heard more.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the stolen floor lamps and chair had significant value. The lamps are particularly rare and coveted by collectors. A nearly identical piece Wright made in the same period for a Hollywood Boulevard residence sold at auction two years ago for $100,000.\n\nTold of the lamps\u2019 theft recently, architect and author Thomas A. Heinz, the foremost expert in Wright\u2019s interiors, exclaimed, \u201cWow. Wow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause these are so rare, I would say it\u2019s a tremendous loss,\u201d said Heinz, adding that Wright created about a dozen such lamps.\n\nSchindler\u2019s chairs are also in demand. Last July, two of the architect\u2019s redwood \u201csling\u201d chairs were reported stolen from an Olympic Boulevard storage unit rented by the Friends of the Schindler House, the nonprofit that maintains the architect\u2019s former West Hollywood residence.\n\nBoard member Robert Sweeney told the police the chairs were original to the Kings Road landmark and estimated their value at $25,000 each.\n\nDespite the clear value of the items taken, no one at USC filed a report with campus police, LAPD or the university\u2019s insurance carriers. Word of the theft circulated among some at the architecture school, but few, if any, outsiders were told.\n\nIt remained a secret until last summer when someone\u2019s conscience appeared to have been prodded by a listing at a Chicago auction. The listing described the lot for sale as a \u201ctextile block from the Samuel Freeman House, Los Angeles\u201d and identified the seller as a private collector in Chicago. It was a 16-inch square, the size of the original Freeman blocks, and had discolorations indicating decades in the elements. It sold for $5,000 in June.\n\nWeeks after its sale, The Times received an anonymous email describing the warehouse theft. The author also included a link to the auction and wrote that even if the sale was not connected to the theft, it was troubling. How could the tile have fallen into private hands when its ownership had passed directly from the Freemans to USC, the writer asked.\n\nThe building in South Los Angeles from which the pieces were stolen. Patrick Fallon /For The Los Angeles Times\n\nThe Times approached USC about the alleged theft in mid-January. A university spokeswoman expressed skepticism, saying that even the most minor infractions are documented by the campus police and shared with administrators. It strained credulity, she said, that a suspected felony involving priceless works of art had gone unreported.\n\nA search of campus police databases and inquiries to half a dozen employees turned up nothing about a theft, she said. But further investigation by USC\u2019s Office of Professionalism and Ethics, a new unit set up after recent scandals, determined that the tip had merit.\n\nOn Jan. 22, campus police filed a report with the LAPD, identifying the three missing items. The university blamed the 6\u00bd-year delay in contacting authorities on a miscommunication between employees, according to police.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite alarming, frankly, that there\u2019s a gap,\u201d said Lt. Perry Griffith of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Southwest station, who reviewed the report before handing it off to the department\u2019s Art Theft Detail.\n\nIn a statement, USC said it was fully cooperating with the police probe and pursuing its own internal investigation.\n\n\u201cThe university is reviewing its procedures and security measures related to the Freeman House and its assets,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement. She added that the university \u201cis working with its risk management team on the insurance claim process.\u201d\n\nLAPD Det. Don Hrycyk of the art theft unit said his investigation was at the preliminary stage.\n\n\u201cThere was no forced entry, so it looks like someone who had access to a key,\u201d Hrycyk said.\n\nUSC declined to identify those with access to the room and said in a statement, \u201cIt appears unlikely that there was only one key, however we expect that to be part of the investigation.\u201d\n\nThe passage of time had made dusting for fingerprints and other forensic techniques all but impossible. Memories have faded, and witnesses are out of reach.\n\n\u201cA lot of these people are no longer at USC,\u201d Hrycyk said.\n\nThe tile auctioned in Chicago is not part of the LAPD investigation, he said. USC said it had \u201cno verification\u201d as to whether it was stolen from the house.\n\nJeffrey Chusid, a Cornell University professor who is a leading authority on the Freeman House, said the auctioned tile appeared to be an original. Chusid, who lived in the house when he taught at USC in the 1980s and 1990s, said it was unlikely to be one that fell from the home during the earthquake because those were largely broken. During the 1990s, a vandal pried a tile from the street-side of the house, he said, \u201cand that might be floating around.\u201d\n\nRichard Wright, the president of the Chicago auction house, said the seller told him he obtained the piece several years ago from a dealer. Wright said he believed that the tile was originally from the Freeman House\u2019s garage and that it was removed after the 1994 earthquake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that there was some restoration done to the house,\u201d Wright said. \u201cGiven the not-great condition, it had been a tile that had been replaced.\u201d\n\nWright said the collector who consigned the tile had attested to the legal title of the concrete block.

    "text": "The protesters are already positioned when she pulls up in her rental car. One lurches at women approaching the clinic, rosary beads dangling from her outstretched palm. Another hands patients tiny fetus dolls that match their skin color.\n\nThe doctor tries to ignore them. There are demonstrators at every abortion clinic and they\u2019re all the same, she thinks: a nuisance. In Northern California, where she lives, a man yells, \u201cDon\u2019t take the blood money,\u201d as she arrives at work.\n\nAt least here, in Dallas, the protesters mostly stay on the sidewalk. The doctor slips inside the mirrored glass doors of the clinic \u2014 one of the busiest abortion facilities in the United States.\n\nShe comes here once a month, part of an unofficial network of physicians who travel across state lines to perform abortions in places where few doctors are willing.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet 9 a.m., and the clinic\u2019s waiting rooms are filled, navigating them a game of human Tetris. Women with their husbands. Women pushing strollers. Women alone.\n\nThe young doctor will spend 60 hours in Dallas this trip and perform 50 abortions. She will have to run in the hallways to keep up with her packed schedule.\n\nThe California physician was one of more than a dozen doctors interviewed by The Times who commute to other states to perform abortions. She allowed a reporter and a photographer to accompany her to Dallas on the condition that she not be named and that her face not be shown in photographs, citing concerns for her personal safety.\n\nThe doctor acknowledged that when she began traveling out of state to perform abortions, she was nervous, recalling stories of abortion providers who have been attacked or harassed while far from home. But she said that abortion doctors living in states where access has been restricted face heightened danger and deserve her help.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have people scare me away,\u201d she said.\n\nThe first step the doctor performs for patients seeking abortions is an ultrasound, and she has 80 scheduled today. That\u2019s three, perhaps four, times the number of patients a physician would typically see in a shift \u2014 and a testament to the burden on abortion clinics in a state where so many have been shut down.\n\nIn the exam room, she is careful not to seem as though she\u2019s in a rush. She pushes open the door smiling, instantly personable. She finds white coats too intimidating, so today she wears a sleeveless blouse with big, purple flowers.\n\nA special kind of storytelling returns For decades, Column One was a showcase for compelling storytelling in the Los Angeles Times. After a hiatus, it\u2019s back every Thursday online, reimagined for the digital age. Here\u2019s what readers can expect \u00bb\n\nOne patient carrying her 1-year-old wants to know whether she can breastfeed if she opts for pills that induce abortion. Another, thrilled when the doctor informs her she has naturally miscarried, leaps off the exam table and exclaims, \u201cThank you, Jesus!\u201d A mother of three says, \u201cI just want it out, is all,\u201d before asking how much the termination costs. The price varies based on how far along the pregnancy is, but is typically around $700.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expensive, but it\u2019s not as expensive as a baby,\u201d the patient says.\n\n\u201cAnd diapers,\u201d the doctor says.\n\n\u201cAnd waking up in the middle of the night,\u201d the woman replies.\n\nThe California doctor grew up on the East Coast and decided she wanted to be a physician when she broke her arm as a child and watched a doctor set it in a sling.\n\nIn college, she joined the student chapter of Planned Parenthood after a pregnancy scare made real for her the importance of abortion access. But it wasn\u2019t until she attended a protest against abortion restrictions in Washington, the spring before beginning medical school, that she considered a career performing abortions. A friend asked whether she was going to be an abortion provider.\n\n\u201cMy exact words were, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t really want to get shot, but yeah, I guess it\u2019s important,\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\nShe went into family medicine and then received specialized training in abortions. She works at several clinics in Northern California and states on her online dating profile that she is an abortion provider, considering it an essential part of who she is.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t walk down the street without thinking, \u2018Oh my God, this is so crazy that people are controlling women\u2019s bodies,\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\nA nurse comforts a patient after an abortion procedure at a clinic in Phoenix. The clinic is another that depends on doctors who travel from California. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) The nurse monitors the patient's ultrasound before the abortion procedure in Phoenix.

Bottom right: The patient rests after the procedure while the nurse stays close in a nearby exam room. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThat control, she believes, leaves women feeling ashamed. Her patients tend to look at the floor when she enters the exam room, their bodies hunched forward, expecting to be treated badly, she says.\n\nIn the clinic, she tries to compensate for that by asking patients about themselves and their jobs. She nods as they explain their reasons for wanting an abortion: Some can\u2019t afford more kids, others want to stay in school, still others don\u2019t want to be connected to the man who got them pregnant. She answers questions about whether an abortion will affect fertility, or whether it will hurt. Her voice is soothing yet upbeat.\n\nOne patient\u2019s ultrasound shows twins. The doctor has found that women often back out of the procedure when they learn there are two embryos, a discovery that transforms the pregnancy from an \u201cit\u201d to a \u201cthey.\u201d The patient begins to cry. The doctor grabs her a tissue and rubs her shoulder.\n\nTexas mandates a 24-hour waiting period between the ultrasound and the abortion; the doctor suspects the patient carrying twins may not come back.\n\nAnother patient asks the youthful-looking doctor if she has performed many abortions.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m confident it\u2019ll go well,\u201d she says, her hand on the patient\u2019s knee.\n\n\u201cI trust you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t deserve your trust yet, but hopefully tomorrow,\u201d she says.\n\nBehind the story: How a Times reporter gained intimate access to abortion clinics \u00bb\n\nThere are about 1,700 abortion providers nationwide, and they perform nearly a million abortions a year. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access, half of pregnancies in the U.S. are accidental, and half of accidental pregnancies end in abortion. One in four women will have an abortion in her lifetime.\n\nBut the doctors who do them are spread unevenly across the country. Some states have very few physicians willing to provide abortions. In California\u2019s Bay Area, by contrast, there are so many physicians who want to do abortions that many can\u2019t find work in the region.\n\nIn an attempt to address that imbalance, abortion rights activists created a program in 2016 to match clinics needing doctors with those who could travel to work. Estimates by abortion providers put the number of doctors commuting across state lines at around 100, three dozen of whom were matched by the program.\n\nThe California doctor takes a moment to rest after a long day at the abortion clinic in Dallas. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) The doctor consults with a patient on options for abortion at the clinic in Dallas. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) The doctor, left, and a clinic supervisor embrace as they leave the Dallas facility.

Bottom left: The doctor consults with a patient on options for abortion. Bottom right: The doctor, left, and a clinic supervisor embrace as they leave the Dallas facility. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cAs abortion restrictions became greater and some states became less friendly, it became more pressing to find physicians who were willing and able to travel,\u201d said Mary Frank, a former abortion clinic administrator who lives in Minneapolis and now runs the matching program.\n\nThe states most in need of abortion doctors include Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Michigan and Texas, Frank said. Most of the traveling physicians come from Maryland, New York, Oregon, Washington and California.\n\nThe doctor knew when she trained to become an abortion provider that there wouldn\u2019t be much demand for her in California, but she doesn\u2019t want to move.\n\nShe has settled into what she describes as an almost stereotypical California lifestyle; she hikes year-round, recently completed a 100-mile bicycle ride and co-parents her best friends\u2019 daughter. She is surrounded by doctor friends who support her work, a community she is reluctant to give up.\n\nSo when a friend told her in 2014 about an abortion clinic in Dallas that was short on doctors, she jumped at the opportunity to help. In California, just 5% of women live in a county without an abortion clinic, according to Guttmacher. In Texas, 43% do.\n\n\u201cMy intention doing abortion work was always to do something other people wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not as much use in California.\u201d\n\nThe situation in Texas is largely the product of a wave of legislation pushed by tea party candidates who took office in 2011 in several states. They passed laws making it more difficult for women to obtain abortions, such as requiring abortion clinics to upgrade to standards set for surgical centers, something experts say isn\u2019t medically necessary. Some states required doctors to obtain privileges at nearby hospitals or register with the state as abortion providers.\n\nThe restrictions led to a dramatic drop in the number of abortion clinics in politically conservative states. Several states now have only one abortion clinic. California has more than 150. Texas has fewer than 20.\n\nFor many women across the U.S., it\u2019s already a post-Roe vs. Wade reality \u00bb\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

Thank you.\n\nIn many cases, the traveling doctors donate their time and are not reimbursed for their travel or lodging. The doctor who flies from California to Texas has her expenses covered by the clinic, but she takes a vacation day and gives up a weekend to come here every month.\n\nOn this Friday morning, she prepares to do an ultrasound on a patient named Tara. She makes small talk, asking Tara whether she likes the food at the restaurant where she works.\n\nBut Tara becomes exasperated when she realizes she can\u2019t schedule her abortion for the following week. Abortions in Texas may be performed only by the physician who conducts the ultrasound, so Tara would have to come back the next day, before the doctor flies home. Tara says she\u2019s not sure she can return so quickly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get why you guys have such crazy schedules. Why do you do it like that?\u201d Tara says, sitting at the edge of the exam table, gasping for air through sobs.\n\nOf the seven doctors who see patients at the clinic, only two live in Texas.\n\nPlacing her hand on Tara\u2019s shoulder, the doctor says softly, \u201cI live in California.\u201d\n\nTara, surprised, looks up from the tissue scrunched in her hand. She stops crying and decides to request the next day off work.\n\nThe California doctor comforts a patient, Tara, on her decision to have an abortion at the clinic in Dallas. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) Tara meets with a therapist to discuss her decision to have an abortion.

Right: Tara meets with a therapist to discuss her decision to have an abortion. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe doctor then recites information required by Texas law, rattling it off like the end of a TV commercial for a prescription drug. \u201cThe other thing the state of Texas does is make me read this crazy piece of paper to you,\u201d she says.\n\nMany states have passed laws dictating what doctors say to patients before an abortion, often emphasizing possible risks. Texas laws are a contradictory mix.\n\nThe doctor must offer Tara pamphlets that suggest abortion causes infertility and breast cancer, though she knows those are falsehoods often propagated by antiabortion activists. In person, she tells patients the opposite \u2014 that abortion does not cause infertility or breast cancer.\n\nShe thinks the mixed message sometimes raises doubts in patients\u2019 minds about the risk of abortion. At the least, it leaves many patients confused.\n\nWhen she first started coming to the clinic, the doctor tried to avoid memorizing the speech, not wanting to fill her brain with restrictions she sees as paternalistic and misguided. But as of this visit, probably her 25th, she knows them by heart.\n\nShe realizes this during her lunch break, her first chance to reflect on the 50 patients she has already seen today.\n\nShe wonders which patients will come back tomorrow. Whether Tara will get the day off work. Whether the woman with the twins will show up. Sometimes patients cancel their appointments, then show up weeks later wanting an abortion. Sometimes they can\u2019t scrape together the money. Sometimes they simply change their minds.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s family members haven\u2019t always supported her mission to cross state lines to perform abortions. When she first told her father she was going to start flying to Texas to work at an abortion clinic, he worried about her safety. \u201cOver my dead body,\u201d he told her.\n\nSince 1990, 11 abortion providers in the United States have been killed, and 26 have been the victim of an attempted slaying, according to the National Abortion Federation, a group of abortion providers that tracks antiabortion violence. In 2009, abortion provider Dr. George Tiller was murdered in the foyer of his church in Kansas by a man who believed his death was justified because Tiller had killed babies.\n\n\u201cHe told me I couldn\u2019t become an abortion provider in Texas, and I was like, \u2018Well that\u2019s not true, because watch me.\u2019\u201d California abortion doctor\n\nAbortion clinics may have metal detectors, bulletproof glass and security guards, but doctors feel especially vulnerable when in transit. One of the California doctor\u2019s friends who performs abortions in Indiana carries a gun in her purse. Another who checked into a hotel in California\u2019s Central Valley to work at an abortion clinic there was forced out of his room by protesters.\n\nA few years ago, the Northern California doctor stopped posting her full name and specifics about her job anywhere. She also stopped Googling herself, frightened by websites calling her a murderer. Still, she did not heed her father\u2019s warnings.\n\n\u201cHe told me I couldn\u2019t become an abortion provider in Texas, and I was like, \u2018Well that\u2019s not true, because watch me,\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\nIt took a year for her and her father to start talking about her trips to Dallas. Her own nerves about it have settled too, yet she still chooses to keep her name private. \u201cComing out,\u201d as it\u2019s known in the abortion provider community, is just too risky.\n\nOn Saturday morning, she has changed from jeans into scrubs. Fifty women have abortions scheduled. Patients are either wheeled into operating rooms or sit and wait for the doctor to hand them pills that will end their pregnancy in a few days.\n\nTara, who was able to take the morning off work, waits in an exam room. She and her boyfriend don\u2019t want children, and she would rather focus on her career, where she\u2019s moving up in the ranks, she says.\n\n\u201cI never really felt like I was destined to be a mother, the way some women do,\u201d says Tara, who lives in a Dallas suburb. \u201cIt\u2019s not really part of my plan.\u201d\n\nThe doctor arrives, holding a cup of water and pills. \u201cDo you have any other questions?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cThank you so much, doctor. Thank you for coming from California, too,\u201d Tara replies.\n\nAt the abortion clinic in Dallas, Tara takes medication that will terminate her pregnancy. Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times\n\nIn the operating rooms, the physician performs one abortion after another. Soothing wood flute music plays. A sticker inside the door says, \u201cEvery day good women have abortions.\u201d\n\nStaff members coach patients through breathing exercises. One patient spends the five-minute procedure talking about how she wants to go to Dairy Queen afterward. The nurse says that she\u2019s more of a Popsicle person.\n\nThe abortion involves no cutting or surgery. The doctor explains that an early pregnancy is simply \u201ca clump of cells.\u201d When she looks at what she has removed from the patient\u2019s uterus floating in a glass dish, she sees a piece of yellowish-red tissue smaller than her little finger.\n\nAntiabortion rhetoric has distracted from the facts, the doctor says, citing studies by Guttmacher and other research organizations. Half of abortion patients were using contraception when they got pregnant. More than half of women who have abortions already have children. Abortions are safe, about as safe as colonoscopies, which are regularly recommended by doctors.\n\nDoctors who perform abortions say they feel especially motivated by the recent addition of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, which they expect to lead to more restrictions on abortions or possibly a ban on the procedure altogether.\n\n\u201cIf men got pregnant, you better believe that abortion wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIf men got pregnant, you better believe that abortion wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal.\u201d California abortion doctor\n\nThere is little common ground on abortion in the U.S. Fifty-eight percent of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to the Pew Research Center. But 37% believe it should be illegal in all or most cases.\n\nNeil Sandlin, pastor of a Baptist church near the clinic, is among those opposed to legalization. Outside the clinic, Sandlin stands next to some of his congregants, including children, holding signs that say, \u201cBabies are a Blessing, not a Burden,\u201d and \u201cBabies are Murdered Here.\u201d\n\nSandlin says multiple people in his congregation are waiting to adopt children. He asks women walking into clinics, \u201cMa\u2019am, do you know that\u2019s an abortion clinic?\u201d and hopes to change their minds.\n\n\u201cThis is the taking of innocent life,\u201d Sandlin says, a Bible next to his feet on the sidewalk.\n\nHector Renteria and his wife, Martha Reyes, pray outside an abortion clinic in Dallas.

(Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe doctor works through lunch on her second day in the clinic, later eating leftovers from the previous evening\u2019s Mexican dinner while filling out paperwork.\n\nThe woman with twins comes back for her procedure. One woman who had seemed so sure the day before \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve honestly been through this before,\u201d she had said confidently \u2014 is a no-show. Another woman holds the pills for more than an hour, torn over whether to take them, while her 4-year-old babbles cheerfully next to her. She ultimately swallows the pills.\n\nBy 5 p.m., the doctor has slipped off her shoes and presses her pink-socked feet against the base of a chair in the doctors lounge. She is one of the last people left at the clinic.\n\nShe finishes her paperwork, yawning. She used to pack sneakers, hoping to go for a run after work, but she\u2019s usually too tired. She knows the clinic might one day be unable to afford flying her out altogether. But as long as it is willing, she plans to keep coming.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s time to head out for a quiet dinner alone, then a flight back to California first thing in the morning. She flips off the light, glancing at a sign above her head with a Texas flag on it. It reads:\n\n\u201cHowdy Docs. Welcome back to Texas. Thank you and please come again.\u201d\n\nProduced by Vanessa Martinez and Brian Park."

    "text": "Sofia Barajas ran to the microscope and started toggling levers back and forth. Nothing happened. Eventually she figured out that the small, clear block encasing a dragonfly was meant to go under the lens. Then the insect would appear, enlarged, on the screen in front of her.\n\nIt was the 6-year-old\u2019s first time using a microscope. She found it in the Nature Lab at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, after visiting her favorite friends at the museum: the dinosaurs, because \u201cI like seeing the bones.\u201d Fair enough.\n\nSofia, like the majority of students enrolled in the Los Angeles Unified School District , was not in school last week. Instead, on Wednesday afternoon, the Natural History Museum became her classroom.\n\nThe museum in Exposition Park offered free admission to LAUSD students for the duration of a teachers\u2019 strike. Sofia was one of nearly 6,000 children and chaperones who took advantage of the offer last week, a museum spokeswoman said.\n\nSofia Barajas and her mom, Erica Barajas, visit the National History Museum during the L.A. Unified teachers' strike. Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times\n\nSofia\u2019s mom, Erica Barajas, decided to keep her kindergartner out of Buchanan Street Elementary School for a number of reasons. First, she supports the teachers and their demands, and the teachers union encouraged families that could to keep their children away.\n\nShe also was not sure what kind of supervision the kids would have, she said.\n\nA visit to Sofia\u2019s school on Thursday offered a picture of what Sofia was missing.\n\nBy late morning, 31 students had reported to her school that day \u2014 including four of her fellow kindergartners. Enrollment had continued to fall at the Highland Park school over the course of the week, as it did across the district.\n\nOn Monday, about 30% of the 350 students enrolled had shown up and it was downhill from there, Nancy San Jose, the school\u2019s principal, said Thursday.\n\nOn Thursday, the 31 present, spanning kindergarten through fifth grade, were in all in a single classroom, sitting in clusters of desks grouped by teacher.\n\nThey were actually doing Sofia\u2019s favorite activity: what she calls \u201ccounting collections\u201d but her teachers know as \u201ccognitively guided instruction.\u201d\n\nTeacher assistant Amanda Perez works with kindergarten students at Buchanan Street Elementary School. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nEach student had a worksheet and objects piled on the table in front of them. One group had beaded necklaces, another square plastic blocks. Older students had more things to count than younger ones \u2014 but the goal of the exercise was to see how they conceptualized math by watching how they did their grouping and counting. The idea in general is to help educators tailor instruction to the way their students think.\n\nOn this day though, San Jose was the only one in the room with a teaching credential; a handful of classified employees \u2014 teaching assistants for both general and special education students \u2014 walked among the groups to help. While the kids were learning, San Jose said, it wasn\u2019t the same as having their teachers there.\n\nThe school system depends on children showing up. State funding is tied to attendance. But providing instruction without teachers was easier when fewer students showed up.\n\nThe youngest in the room, two kindergarten girls, were counting popcorn kernels, sorting them into plastic cups, 10 at a time.\n\nAfter counting, the whole group moved one room over to play board games and transition into lunch.\n\nOn Monday, when more than 100 students attended, they watched \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d toward the end of the day.\n\nEven though San Jose said she would have liked to see all her students at school, she didn\u2019t quibble when she heard about what Sofia had been up to lately.\n\n\u201cField trips are also good learning opportunities,\u201d the principal said.\n\nSofia Barajas, 6, checks out a coyote at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County during the teachers' strike.

    "text": "On Wednesday \u2014 the third day of the strike, when you might expect some of the adrenaline to be dissipating and tempers to be fraying \u2014 the striking teachers at my neighborhood elementary school, Westminster, taught me a lesson in enthusiasm and compassion.\n\nWestminster is a so-called Title I school, where most children come from families poor enough to qualify for free breakfast and lunch. Paradoxically, it\u2019s on the northern edge of one the most expensive and trendiest neighborhoods on the Westside.\n\nThe school sits on Abbot Kinney Boulevard, across from the uber-hip Blue Bottle Coffee, and a block away from Blue Star Donuts, where a single buttermilk old-fashioned sets you back about $5.\n\nIt is also a couple of blocks west of Oakwood, one of the Westside\u2019s few historically black neighborhoods, now in a state of extreme transition because of skyrocketing property values. Westminster\u2019s mix of students reflects all of that.\n\nShortly after 7 a.m., in a drizzle, Jessica Dunn, a 35-year-old kindergarten teacher, saw me walking toward the school with my notebook in hand. She pranced up to me. I don\u2019t mean that in a patronizing way; I just don\u2019t know how else to describe the magical spring in her step.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s part unicorn,\u201d Westminster parent Lynn Hutchinson told me later. \u201cThe children love her.\u201d\n\nDunn loves them \u2014 and her job at Westminster. Like every other teacher with whom I spoke, Dunn loves the principal, Barry Cohen, a patient and soft-spoken former math coach. The burden of ensuring the safety of the students who have been coming to school during the strike has fallen to him. About a third of the school\u2019s 500 students are spending their days in the auditorium, where, teachers told me, Cohen is trying to impart some math instruction and showing movies.\n\nDunn said the strike will not alter the excellent relationship Cohen has with his staff.\n\n\u201cWe are a strong, close-knit community,\u201d she said.\n\nKindergarten teacher Sarah Nodelman said that when she was hired this year (there were 100 applicants for the job), Cohen forwarded her a note from Dunn: \u201cTell our new BFF we can\u2019t wait to teach with her!\u201d\n\nNodelman, who has taught for 15 years, said she\u2019d never felt so welcome anywhere.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was with family here on Day One,\u201d she said.\n\nWestminster Elementary School kindergarten teacher Beth Clark stands in the middle of Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice imploring passing drivers to honk. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nFor a couple of hours Wednesday morning, Dunn and her colleague Beth Clark, 49, a transitional kindergarten teacher, led other teachers, parents and a handful of kids in chants, the most pointed of which was a stab at the district\u2019s new superintendent \u2014 \u201cHey hey, ho ho, Austin Beutner has got to go!\u201d They danced back and forth in front of the school, urging passing cars to honk, and executed high kicks worthy of a chorus line.\n\nAt 7:40 a.m., a mom walked her daughter toward the school entrance. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she told Dunn, tears in her eyes. \u201cI have to. I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on in for a hug,\u201d Dunn replied, sweeping the woman into her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. We got your back.\u201d She also hugged the woman\u2019s child.\n\n\u201cThis is not a fight between us and the children and parents,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWe support the people who have had to cross the picket line.\u201d\n\n::\n\nI\u2019ve always been proud that my parents were public school educators and that I graduated from Los Angeles public schools in their heyday.\n\nMy mother was a special education teacher who taught deaf and hard-of-hearing students at various Los Angeles schools. She was active in the United Teachers Los Angeles union until she retired. My father was a professor at Cal State Northridge who fought for the rights of professors to bargain collectively when Ronald Reagan was governor of California.\n\nI went to Northridge Elementary School, which was torn down decades ago, then Calahan. I went to Northridge Junior High before the advent of \u201cmiddle schools\u201d and Cleveland High in Reseda, long before it was a magnet \u2014 well, long before magnets even existed.\n\nWe had nurses, counselors, librarians, textbooks, field trips, school cafeterias, orchestras, choruses \u2014 and the district funded it all.\n\nIt was just an accident of history that I came of age in California\u2019s golden age of public education, that I finished high school a few years before Proposition 13 gutted the funding that once made our schools so great. The deterioration of public education in this state is a crime against our kids.\n\nKindergarten students Isabella Dam, right, and Ava Berg, joined by sister Silke Berg, left, hold signs to support their teacher outside Westminster Elementary School. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nAt Westminster, like most L.A. public schools, a nurse stops by only once a week. A psychologist comes every two weeks. Gary Robbins, 77, is retired but loves his counseling work so much that he comes back to Westminster two and a half days a week. He could be at home painting, which is his passion. But he said with a shrug: \u201cKids need a friendly haven, someone to talk to. A grandparent has died, a dad lost his job, there\u2019s a divorce. This is what I do.\u201d\n\nHis salary is paid by money the school raises, not by the district. \u201cWe have to raise our own money for everything,\u201d said fifth-grade teacher Ann Steinberg, who has been at Westminster for 19 years. \u201cWe are lucky that our community can do it, but most can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDig a little deeper into district pockets, Mr. Beutner. A good public education should not depend on luck, timing or bake sales.\n\nrobin.abcarian@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @AbcarianLAT"

    "text": "Summer had not yet arrived, but already the hillside on the edge of Los Padres National Forest was the color of toast.\n\nEven a brilliantly sunny day couldn\u2019t dress up the dull palette of invasive grasses that had transformed the slope into a dried-up weed patch.\n\nOnly a sprinkling of young shrubs provided a hint of what the spot looked like before it had burned \u2014 again and again and again.\n\nIn the last 22 years, three wildfires have swept across the area, all but erasing the cover of gray-green sage scrub documented in 1930s aerial photographs.\n\nSouthern California\u2019s native shrublands are famously tough. Conservationist John Muir celebrated them as Mother Nature at her \u201cmost ruggedly, thornily savage.\u201d\n\nThey evolved along with long, hot summers, at least six rainless months a year and intense wildfires.\n\nBut not this much fire, this often.\n\nThe combination of too-frequent wildfires and drought amplified by climate change poses a growing threat to wildlands that deliver drinking water to millions, provide refuge from Southland sprawl and \u2014 142 years after Muir penned his mash note \u2014 are still home to mountain lions, bears and big-eared woodrats.\n\nThe footprint of the 2003 Piru fire can be seen atop a ridge in the Lake Piru Recreation Area. After the wildfire, invasive grasses (brown) replaced native shrub growth (green). Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nBurn maps show the astonishing extent of the wildfires that have seared the southern portion of the Los Padres forest and adjacent lands.\n\nThe border of the 2007 Zaca fire bleeds into the even bigger 2017 Thomas fire, which in turn runs into the footprint of the 2006 Day fire. Together they incinerated an area roughly twice the combined size of Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nDozens of other wildfires have raced across the forest\u2019s crumpled terrain in recent decades, including the 1997 Hopper, 2003 Piru and 2007 Ranch fires that blackened the grassy hill near Lake Piru.\n\n\u201cThere are not that many places where there\u2019s really old habitat left, that hasn\u2019t seen a fire in the 30 years I\u2019ve been here,\u201d said Los Padres forest biologist Kevin Cooper, who retired last month.\n\nSince 1950, hundreds of wildfires have burned in and around the southern portion of Los Padres National Forest. Sources: Cal Fire, Nextzen and OpenStreetMap\n\nWipe the steep mountainsides clean with flames and there is nothing to hold on to rainfall and let it seep into the ground, recharging aquifers.\n\nThere is nothing to prevent soil from washing away and silting up reservoirs and fish streams.\n\nThere is nothing to stop rivers of mud and rocks from crashing into foothill communities.\n\nThe Thomas fire was barely contained when monster debris flows roared down denuded slopes last January, killing at least 21 people and destroying more than 100 homes in the Montecito area.\n\nThere are not that many places where there\u2019s really old habitat left, that hasn\u2019t seen a fire in the 30 years I\u2019ve been here. Kevin Cooper, Los Padres forest biologist\n\nAcross Southern California, oft-scorched shrublands have given way to monotonous expanses of quick-to-dry invasive grasses that are of little ecological value, don\u2019t anchor the soil as well as deep-rooted chaparral plants and ignite easily, fueling more and more fires.\n\nFrequent fire is driving chaparral loss in the Santa Monica Mountains, which burned yet again in November. Roughly a quarter of the 97,000-acre Woolsey fire was a reburn of land charred in wildland blazes over the last two decades.\n\nOnce gone, the chaparral and sage scrub that drape the wildest parts of Southern California are proving ominously difficult to restore.\n\n\u201cFor so long, people thought of chaparral landscapes as being so resilient that papers came out in the \u201970s on \u2018How do you get rid of this stuff \u2014 it keeps growing back,\u2019\u201d said Nicole Molinari, the U.S. Forest Service ecologist for Southern California.\n\n\u201cAnd here we are finding ourselves at a time when we\u2019re actually concerned about its ability to persist and trying to restore it and having challenges in doing so. That to me is a little frightening.\u201d\n\nShane Dewees, left, Sameer Saroa and Stephanie Ma walk through thick invasive grasses that are crowding post-fire growth of native sage plants. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhen scrubland turns to grass\n\nSouthern California\u2019s native chaparral and sage scrub aren\u2019t so much adapted to wildfire as they are to a certain pattern of fire \u2014 periodically burning in hot, intense blazes that consume all the vegetation.\n\nRebirth begins almost immediately. Certain species, such as toyon and scrub oak, resprout from underground root systems or burls. Within months of the Thomas fire, bouquets of bright green shoots studded the bare, ashen mountainsides lining Highway 33.\n\nOther shrubs, such as ceanothus, regenerate when heat from the flames or chemicals from charred wood stimulate the germination of their dormant seeds.\n\nPictures in the News | Friday Jan. 11, 2019 \u00bb\n\nBut the spread of two things \u2014 people and non-native grasses \u2014 are helping disrupt that pattern by putting too much fire on the landscape too often.\n\nLightning accounts for less than a quarter of the fire starts in Southern California\u2019s four national forests. Most ignitions are human-related.\n\nRanch hands repairing a pipe started the Zaca. A transient burning trash ignited the Day. Laborers doing construction work on a boat launch sparked the Piru.\n\nOfficials have not declared a cause of the Thomas blaze, which burned into the Los Padres forest from adjoining land. But Southern California Edison has said its electrical equipment probably helped start the fire, thought to have had at least two ignition points.\n\nThe prevalence of human ignitions means wildfires are more likely to erupt when sundowner and Santa Ana winds can whip them into a fury, as happened with the Woolsey and the Thomas, the state\u2019s second-largest wildland fire on record.\n\nFrequent big fires mean that shrublands that would naturally burn at intervals of 30 to 60 years \u2014 or even a century or more \u2014 are sometimes torched at intervals of a decade or less.\n\nWhen that happens, resprouting species don\u2019t have sufficient time to regrow. Non-sprouting shrubs can\u2019t reach maturity and shower the ground with a new seed bank.\n\nInvaders can then take over in a process ecologists call type conversion.\n\nSlopes that wore a thick green jacket of wildlife-supporting shrubs turn brown under a blanket of exotic annual grasses that are dry and dead most of the year.\n\nNative wildflowers struggle to take root in the thick mats of non-natives. Erosion increases. Biodiversity declines. The fire cycle accelerates.\n\n\u201cThe more grass you get, the more likely you are to have fire,\u201d said Carla D\u2019Antonio, a professor of ecology at UC Santa Barbara. \u201cThat\u2019s a point that a lot of people don\u2019t appreciate.\u201d\n\nShe is overseeing restoration research as part of a multifaceted fire recovery program in the Los Padres forest.\n\nUC Santa Barbara ecology professor Carla D\u2019Antonio inspects cuttings of native chaparral plants in a campus greenhouse. Researchers will plant them at restoration sites in Los Padres National Forest. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times Shane Dewees, bottom, and other researchers, top, clean native shrub seeds in a botany lab.

The seeds of some chaparral plants need to be treated with heat or liquid smoke to simulate the fire conditions that would naturally trigger germination. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nNow in its third year, the work is painstaking and, so far, disheartening.\n\nStudents collected native shrub seeds by hand from local watersheds to maintain genetic purity. They cleaned the seeds in a campus botany lab. They soaked some in hot water to simulate the heat from a fire.\n\nThey experimented with different pre-planting methods at restoration sites near Lake Piru. Some patches were weeded, some were scraped bare. Others were left alone.\n\nThey planted more than 1,200 baby ceanothus, toyon, sage and other natives that were grown in a campus greenhouse using a special mix of potting soil and dirt from the sites.\n\nThey spread 40,000 seeds on the ground.\n\nStephanie Ma collects seeds from a native plant. The team uses seeds from the restoration areas to ensure genetic purity. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nOn a June afternoon in the field, UC researchers Stephanie Ma, Shane Dewees and Sameer Saroa hunted for survivors.\n\n\u201cThis guy is kind of alive,\u201d DeWees said, kneeling near a tiny ceanothus seedling. Ma, crawling on her hands and knees, spied another. \u201cWe have some survival here,\u201d she reported.\n\nBut mostly they found shriveled twigs or bare dirt next to the planting flags, which doubled as little tombstones.\n\n\u201cLong hot days with a lot of death,\u201d is the way Dewees described the team\u2019s field checks. \u201cSo if you can get one little leaf, it\u2019s not all despair.\u201d\n\nAll told, nearly three-quarters of the infant shrubs died. The seeding was an almost total failure, producing a paltry five plants.\n\nWhen the research team checked spots marked by small flags where they had planted native seedlings in 2017 and early 2018, they often found bare dirt or shriveled twigs. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nD\u2019Antonio suspects that rodents, accustomed to dining on an abundance of invasive grass seeds, gobbled up most of the native seeds before they could sprout.\n\nThe previous winter\u2019s meager rainfall contributed to the seedling mortality, as did crowding by a medley of non-natives: mustard, red brome, wild oat and foxtail.\n\n\u201cShrub seedlings just can\u2019t hack competition from the grasses,\u201d D\u2019Antonio said.\n\nThe more grass you get, the more likely you are to have fire. That\u2019s a point that a lot of people don\u2019t appreciate. Carla D\u2019Antonio, UC Santa Barbara ecology professor\n\nSouthern Californians tend to dismiss their native flora as a bunch of brush \u2014 something to be whacked and cleared and feared.\n\nWhen Dewees explains his project to private landowners in the Piru area, he said some of them ask \u201cwhy we\u2019re restoring to chaparral and not grass for grazing.\u201d\n\nWildland firefighters detest chaparral for its ability to burn with untamable ferocity when driven by Santa Ana or sundowner winds. A 1960 Times story recounted efforts by the L.A. County Fire Department and the U.S. Forest Service to find \u201cfire-resistant shrubs\u201d to replace the natives.\n\n\u201cThere is always the chance that scientists will find a slow-burning plant that will smother the chaparral,\u201d a county fire official said hopefully.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection plans to clear 14,000 acres of shrublands a year as part of a statewide fuels treatment program.\n\n\u201cEvery Cal Fire person I know \u2026 wants to cut it down wherever they possibly can,\u201d D\u2019Antonio said. \u201c[But] every time they cut a new fuel break, they put another strip of grasses on the landscape.\u201d\n\nUniversity of California wildfire specialist Max Moritz in front of a dead stand of bigcone Douglas firs that burned in the 2007 Zaca fire. Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times\n\nFire, then drought\n\nMax Moritz slowly made his way up a hill, through a jumble of shrubs and fallen branches, to a graveyard.\n\nSurrounded by dead bigcone Douglas firs, he scanned the slope for seedlings, searching for a sign that this patch of a unique Southern California mountain tree would survive.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see anything,\u201d he observed. \u201cIt has a fairly depressing quality to it, given the mortality and no regeneration.\u201d\n\nMore than 11 years after the Zaca cut a 240,000-acre swath across Santa Barbara\u2019s jagged backcountry, the landscape still bears scars.\n\nThe reach of 75-foot-tall flames is etched in towering tree trunks. Oak skeletons pepper the edge of the Dick Smith Wilderness.\n\nHillsides once blanketed with pygmy forests of chaparral are mottled with bare ground and clumps of young chamise and ceanothus shrubs. The ghostly profiles of dead bigcones rise from ridgelines.\n\nArmed with thick bark and the ability to resprout from branches, bigcone Douglas firs are one of the world\u2019s most fire-resistant conifers \u2014 built to survive the high-intensity wildfires that periodically chew through the chaparral that typically surrounds them.\n\nThe trees can be massive; one bigcone in the San Gabriel Mountains is as tall as a 15-story building. They can live for several hundred years.\n\nResearcher Ryan Salladay extracts a coring from a dead bigcone Douglas fir. The tree burned in the Zaca fire but survived, only to die some years later. Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times\n\nSo what doomed this old stand of bigcones off the Deal Trail? Was it the shooting flames of the Zaca, the brutal five-year drought that followed, or the one-two punch of both? Will these slightly goofy-looking conifers endure in the only part of the world they naturally grow?\n\nMoritz, a cooperative extension wildfire specialist at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara, and research assistant Ryan Salladay were looking for the answers.\n\nSalladay spent hundreds of hours poring over satellite imagery and aerial photographs, looking for the distinctive star-shaped spread of bigcone branches. He digitally mapped bigcone patches in the footprint of the Zaca burn and created a time series of pre- and post fire images to date tree mortality.\n\nOut in the Los Padres, research teams staked out 34 bigcone plots, each a tenth of an acre. They recorded the aspect of the slope and measured water stress in living trees. They studied post-fire soil surveys to see how severely the area burned in the Zaca. They checked for bigcone seedlings.\n\nAt Plot 3, Salladay drilled into a bigcone corpse with a simple T-shaped instrument and extracted a pencil-thin 3-inch coring.\n\nA coring from a dead bigcone Douglas fir. Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times\n\nBack in his lab, he would mount the core on a board, gently sand it and examine it under a microscope. The width of the outer growth rings would tell the story of the tree\u2019s final four decades.\n\nThe slender twigs still dangling from its bare branches provided a clue that the tree had managed to survive the Zaca and resprouted, only to die some years later.\n\n\u201cThe drought-following-fire issue is a total reshuffling of what might come back or survive,\u201d Moritz said.\n\nRunoff from wildfires filled this pool in Rattlesnake Creek near Santa Barbara. The pool was once so deep that fisheries biologist Kristie Klose had to wear chest waders to check on rainbow trout, which disappeared after the blazes. Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times\n\nA mounting toll\n\nKristie Klose, Los Padres\u2019 fisheries biologist, hiked along a stream in Rattlesnake Canyon on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, stopping at a 2-foot-deep pool rimmed with boulders and mud.\n\nBefore the 2008 Tea fire and the 2009 Jesusita fire, the water was so deep that Klose wore chest waders when she checked the pool\u2019s rainbow trout residents.\n\nNow the water doesn\u2019t even reach her knees. There are no fish to count.\n\nThe Tea and the Jesusita weren\u2019t that big as recent Los Padres fires go. But they were cheek by jowl. The Jesusita burned the upper watershed and the Tea, the lower. Runoff from naked slopes dumped dirt and rocks into frontcountry creeks.\n\nHundreds of speckled native trout vanished. \u201cThey all got killed, buried and washed out to sea,\u201d Klose said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never recovered.\u201d\n\nThese fires are so big \u2014 they take out so much contiguous country at once. Kevin Cooper, Los Padres forest biologist\n\nMany of the Los Padres\u2019 most imperiled species live in or near water: Southern California steelhead, red-legged frogs, arroyo southwestern toads and western pond turtles. When most of their watersheds go up in flames, they have no place to go.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had back-to-back and juxtaposed big fires,\u201d said Cooper, the forest biologist. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t leave many refugia for these species to hide out in and recover and then repopulate and move back into the burned areas.\u201d\n\nOne of those spots is miles to the north of Santa Barbara, just outside the boundary of the San Rafael Wilderness.\n\n\u201cYou look at this and think, \u2018This is nothing,\u2019 \u201d Klose said, standing next to a shallow, slow-moving stretch of Munch Creek vital to steelhead spawning. \u201cBut it can be crucial to the whole system.\u201d\n\nLos Padres National Forest biologist Kevin Cooper stands next to Munch Creek, which provided refuge for steelhead after the Zaca fire. Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times\n\nEndangered Southern California steelhead are the seagoing version of rainbow trout. Born in coastal streams, they migrate to the ocean as juveniles, mature there and then, salmon-like, return to natal streams to breed.\n\nThe 1993 Marre fire filled Munch Creek with fine sediment, driving out a small steelhead population. Five years later, rains cleaned out the silt. The steelhead returned, swimming some 35 winding miles from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nLater, when runoff from the Zaca fire clogged a downstream creek, the fish hung out in Munch and Davy Brown creeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough. But they\u2019re still in there,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWe want to maintain this habitat so they have a place they can survive in.\u201d\n\nAn SUV drives across Davy Brown Creek on a concrete apron, which will be removed and replaced with a bridge to allow fish passage. Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times\n\nTo that end, the Forest Service is tearing out old concrete streambed crossings and replacing them with fish-friendly bridges to connect steelhead creeks.\n\nBut the money to do that \u2014 as well as pay for the Moritz and D\u2019Antonio projects \u2014 comes from a one-time windfall of $20 million, which the forest collected in legal settlements with companies accused of negligently sparking the Zaca, Jesusita and Piru blazes.\n\nAs fire takes an ever bigger bite out of the Los Padres budget, there is less money for recreation, fish and wildlife management and trail maintenance. The permanent fire staff in the forest is now nearly four times the size of the non-fire staff.\n\nIn fiscal year 2006, firefighter salaries, equipment and fire station maintenance ate up 54% of the forest\u2019s budget. In fiscal year 2017, nearly 68% of a $23.2-million budget went to fire. That doesn\u2019t even include the enormous cost of fighting the conflagrations, which is covered by national Forest Service funds.\n\nOn the drive back to the forest office in Goleta, Klose and Cooper stopped at a turnout on Highway 154 south of Lake Cachuma.\n\nCooper looked across the rippling expanses of the Los Padres. That area burned in the Zaca and again in the 2016 Rey fire, he said. Over there was the 2009 La Brea fire. There, the 2013 White fire.\n\nA distant ridge resembled a balding head.\n\n\u201cThis piece by Little Pine Mountain is pretty bare now because of two fires in a row and the drought,\u201d he said. \u201cThese fires are so big \u2014 they take out so much contiguous country at once.\u201d\n\nThe fire-scarred mountains of Los Padres National Forest, seen from Highway 154.

    "text": "It was clear from the beginning that the Woolsey fire had the potential to be a monster.\n\nIt broke out mid-afternoon Nov. 8 on Boeing property near the Santa Susana Pass, fueled by strengthening winds and burning toward populated areas.\n\nBut during the critical first hours, the Woolsey fire took second priority.\n\nVentura County firefighters were already engaged in a pitched battle with another blaze, called the Hill fire, about 15 miles to the west that had jumped the 101 Freeway and was threatening hundreds of homes and businesses.\n\nThe Woolsey fire was growing but still far enough from subdivisions that it got fewer resources from Ventura County. Neighboring fire agencies sent some help, but it would take hours before they launched an all-out attack at the fire lines.\n\nThese turned out to be fateful choices in what would become the most destructive fire in Los Angeles and Ventura county history.\n\nA Times review of hundreds of pages of public records and several hours of radio transmissions shows that first responders on the front lines of the Woolsey fire struggled during those first critical hours, stymied by communication breakdowns and a scarcity of air tanker support, equipment and firefighters.\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Department sent some firefighters to the front lines but decided early on to deploy dozens more several miles away in the Agoura Hills area, according to interviews, incident logs and planning reports obtained under the California Public Records Act.\n\nL.A. County Fire Capt. Tony Imbrenda said the department knew the fire was headed toward L.A. County and staged four strike teams \u2014 20 engines and 88 firefighters total \u2014 in Agoura Hills to assess how the fire would affect homes and businesses once it reached the area.\n\nImbrenda said the department didn\u2019t send the strike teams, each comprising five engines and 22 firefighters, directly to the Woolsey fire line \u201cbecause the fire hadn\u2019t crossed into L.A. County yet. These resources were all set up to protect L.A. County.\u201d\n\nImbrenda said sending the strike teams to the fire line earlier would not have made a difference. \u201cThere was no way, no engine, no apparatus, no aircraft in this world that could have possibly stopped that fire from making it to L.A. County,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department, the city\u2019s fire agency, also sent engines toward the Woolsey fire, but its firefighters seemed to grow frustrated with the lack of a plan and resources on the scene, according to radio transmissions. Some firefighters said in radio transmissions they were hampered by a lack of water at the Boeing facility and by poor cellphone service, which forced them to move the command center to a Ventura County fire station.\n\nBy 5 p.m., the L.A. city fire department had completed a map modeling how the Woolsey fire would burn, showing with a high degree of accuracy its ultimate path through Bell Canyon, the Santa Monica Mountains and Oak Park.\n\nEven as the Woolsey fire worsened through that first afternoon and evening, firefighters struggled to get more boots on the ground. By 7:30 p.m., the Hill fire was being battled by 400 personnel while only 150 firefighters from three agencies were on the Woolsey fire, according to incident updates released by fire officials.\n\nOver the next three days, the Woolsey fire made a devastating march to the Pacific Ocean, destroying more than 1,500 structures from Oak Park to Malibu, burning almost 97,000 acres and killing three people.\n\nThe Hill fire, by contrast, destroyed just four structures and burned 4,500 acres.\n\nDerek and Linda Oliver watch smoke from the fast-moving Hill fire fill the skies in Thousand Oaks the afternoon of Nov. 8. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nA tale of two fires\n\nThe Woolsey fire started at 2:24 p.m. on the site of the old Santa Susana test lab near Simi Valley, with a column of smoke visible on what was a clear day across eastern Ventura County.\n\n\u201cDo you have eyes on where that smoke\u2019s coming from?\u201d a Ventura County firefighter asked another firefighter on his way.\n\nIt would take almost 20 minutes for the first unit to arrive, a Ventura County engine carrying three firefighters, driving from their Simi Valley station about eight miles away, according to incident logs and interviews.\n\nWhen a helicopter from the Los Angeles County Fire Department arrived about 2:50 p.m., a crew member estimated the Woolsey fire to be about five acres with a rapid rate of spread and structures threatened. Over the dispatch, the crew member reported a southeast wind of about 25 to 30 miles per hour.\n\nDo you have eyes on where that smoke\u2019s coming from?\n\nThe area where the fire started, at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, is located near the Los Angeles and Ventura County line in a \u201cmutual threat zone,\u201d an area that the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Ventura County Fire Department and Los Angeles Fire Department have agreed, through a memorandum of understanding, to defend together because of the threat a fire there poses to each agency\u2019s communities. Each year, firefighters from the three departments train together in the Santa Susana area to prepare for a fire. Their most recent training was in June.\n\nThe operating plan created and signed by the three agencies outlines the number of firefighters and amount of equipment they\u2019ll each send as part of their initial attack.\n\nOn Nov. 8, as the fire started burning, the plan called for Ventura County Fire to send a full brush response, a team of firefighters that includes five to six fire engines, a bulldozer and a helicopter. Instead, within the first hour of the fire, Ventura County sent only two engines and about 12 firefighters.\n\nThat\u2019s because at 2:03 p.m., 21 minutes before the Woolsey fire started burning, a Ventura County helicopter spotted a fire burning in Santa Rosa Valley, north of the 101 between Camarillo and Newbury Park. This would become the Hill fire.\n\nThe Hill Fire burns between Thousand Oaks and Camarillo on Nov. 8. (Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times) The Woolsey fire burns in the hills above Thousand Oaks on the morning of Nov. 9. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\n\nSoon, there would be two fires in a county that had already experienced incredible tragedy just 15 hours earlier \u2014 the shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, where 12 people were shot and killed.\n\nVentura County officials say the Hill fire took priority over the Woolsey fire because it was an immediate threat to lives and homes.\n\nThe Hill fire grew to 100 acres in the first 15 minutes. It jumped the 101 even sooner, in 12 minutes, and when the California Highway Patrol shut down the freeway, several drivers were trapped when they tried to go around the roadblock and drove directly into the blaze.\n\nCal State Channel Islands was evacuated. Calls poured into the Ventura County dispatch center from residents who were older or with disabilities asking for help in evacuating. Sheriff\u2019s deputies got boxed in while trying to evacuate people and, at least once, needed helicopters to make water drops near them so they could escape.\n\nCarolina Heuel prepares to evacuate her Camarillo home after loading her two cats and a cockatiel into her car on Nov. 8. Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times\n\nVentura County Fire Assistant Chief Dustin Gardner, who oversaw resources for the Hill and Woolsey fires, said it was clear from the beginning that the Hill fire was initially more dangerous.\n\nBy 4:10 p.m., the Hill fire hit open space that had burned in 2013 during an earlier fire. It began to burn more slowly east of Camarillo and largely stopped sending embers downwind. For the next several hours, firefighters worked to curtail other sections of the blaze. About midnight, as the Woolsey fire began burning into Oak Park, the Hill fire danger had subsided enough that officials started diverting an army of resources from the blaze to the Woolsey, Gardner said.\n\nGardner remembered the Hill fire commanders\u2019 concern when he told them to pull every resource they could and send it to the Woolsey fire.\n\n\u201cWe still have a 5,000-acre fire here,\u201d a commander responded.\n\nGardner said although they knew the Hill fire could keep growing, the Woolsey fire was now threatening human lives.\n\n\u201cFrom just looking at it, it looks like the response to the Woolsey fire was less than the response to the Hill fire,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cPut it in a perspective of managing the area, of looking at the totality of both fires and doing the best you can with what you have at the time you have it.\n\n\u201cThere was never any decision made that one fire was more important, per se, than another. The decisions were based on what was best for the most people with what we had at the time we were presented with it,\u201d he added.\n\nThere was never any decision made that one fire was more important, per se, than another. Ventura County Fire Assistant Chief Dustin Gardner\n\nBoth fires were driven by the same powerful Santa Ana winds.\n\nBut at least at the beginning, the two fires behaved differently. Gardner said the origin of the Woolsey fire was in an area with topography that shielded it from some of the most powerful wind gusts, which were blowing at 37 mph when the blaze first began.\n\nThis made it spread slower than the Hill fire \u2014 at least at first, Gardner said. The Woolsey fire grew to 750 acres within its first two hours, compared to the Hill fire, which officials initially said scorched 8,000 to 10,000 acres in its first 30 minutes.\n\nCertain details of the first hour or so of the Woolsey fire remain a mystery. The fire began near a Southern California Edison substation that experienced issues shortly before the Woolsey fire started, and the utility has said it\u2019s investigating whether its equipment sparked the blaze.\n\nIt remains unclear what role, if any, Boeing\u2019s firefighting and security staff had in dealing with the fire. Boeing has a private fire department on site at Santa Susana Field Laboratory, according to the California Department of Toxic Substances Control.\n\nBoeing has repeatedly declined to answer questions from The Times about its firefighters\u2019 efforts.\n\nThe company did not provide answers when asked how many firefighters work on the grounds, how many engines they have and what type of equipment they used to try to stop the fire.\n\nInstead, the company said in a statement that its fire and security personnel \u201cresponded to the fire that began on November 8 and provided assistance to local municipal and county fire crews as they responded to the scene.\u201d\n\nOfficials with Ventura County Fire Department said they didn\u2019t remember seeing or communicating with any Boeing firefighters.\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Department said in a statement that they had \u201clittle to no interactions\u201d with any Boeing firefighters, as was the case for LAFD.\n\n\u201cI was at the incident command post,\u201d said LAFD Deputy Chief Trevor Richmond. \u201cI was there with Ventura County and L.A. County Fire, and I do not recall seeing anyone from Boeing, and I did not interact with anyone from Boeing.\u201d\n\nBecause of the rocky, hilly terrain where the blaze started, aircraft had the potential to play an important role in fighting the Woolsey fire, making water and retardant drops on ridges which ground troops cannot reach.\n\nVentura County had two helicopters that flew through the night on both fires. LAFD sent three of its helicopters capable of flying at night, but they had all returned from the Woolsey fire by 6:30 p.m. (An agency spokeswoman said the decision to send the helicopters home would have come from the team managing the fire, not LAFD.)\n\nL.A. County Fire initially sent three helicopters; a pair of Bombardier CL-415 air tankers that can each hold 1,620 gallons of water at one time \u2014 commonly referred to as Super Scoopers; and an Erickson Helitanker, which has a 2,650-gallon water tank.\n\nA helicopter makes a water drop as L.A. County Fire battalion chiefs Dean Zipperman, left, and Jason Hing watch from the backyard of a home in Westlake Village on Nov. 9. Michael Owen Baker / For The Times\n\nHowever, once nightfall hit, their aircraft had limited effectiveness because of the high winds gusting over the region.\n\n\u201cAir attack resources were severely hampered by wind on the Woolsey fire,\u201d Imbrenda, a public information officer with L.A. County Fire, said in an email. \u201cOnce we have sustained winds of 40 mph, air drops become ineffective. Firehawk helicopters flew in support of ground operations throughout the night on Nov. 8. All other air resources were grounded due to high winds.\u201d\n\nOne of the additional challenges that the Woolsey incident commander faced was getting air tankers.\n\nWhereas helicopters are primarily used for direct attack, dropping water on active fire, air tankers are often used to drop pink retardant along ridges and mountainsides to create or improve control lines around the fire.\n\nOn Nov. 8, air tankers \u2014 which don\u2019t fly at night \u2014 were in high demand, Gardner said. The deadly Camp fire had started in Northern California the same day at 6:33 a.m., and officials from all three fires were calling state emergency leaders asking them to send help.\n\nGardner said he was repeatedly on the phone begging the state to send more tankers to Ventura County, arguing the Woolsey fire had the potential to hit Malibu, not realizing how bad the Camp fire had become.\n\nWithin the first hour of the Hill fire, the incident commander doubled his order from four to eight air tankers.\n\nSoon after, a dispatcher asked him if they could divert one of his fire\u2019s tankers to the Woolsey fire, which was potentially going to threaten homes and businesses in Simi Valley.\n\n\u201cYou can divert one of the air tankers,\u201d Ventura County Fire Assistant Chief Chad Cook, the Hill fire incident commander, said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep the rest of them here.\u201d\n\nAbout 40 minutes later, at 3:37 p.m., a dispatcher told the Hill fire incident commander two air tankers and two helitankers would soon arrive to fight the blaze. Only a few minutes later, the Woolsey incident commander was told by a dispatcher that the region had no more air tankers it could send, but that there were multiple helicopters available.\n\nAbout an hour later, the Woolsey incident commander seemed to be frustrated by his tanker requests going unfilled.\n\n\u201cI'd like to talk to my neighboring fire (commander) and see if I can get some from him,\u201d the Woolsey incident commander told his aerial coordinator over the radio at 4:26 p.m.\n\n\u201cCorrect, sir,\u201d the aerial coordinator said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to negotiate resource sharing. We\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d\n\nBut the Woolsey fire began spreading at a much faster pace \u2014 with far fewer firefighters on the ground than were battling the Hill fire.\n\nA firefighter pulls a hose to keep embers from a burning house from spreading in Oak Park on Nov. 8. Stuart W. Palley / For The Times\n\nA question of resources\n\nWith the Ventura County Fire Department consumed by the Hill fire, it was going to be up to neighboring agencies to help battle the Woolsey fire.\n\nAnd the location of the Woolsey fire seemed to make mutual aid achievable, with it burning along the Los Angeles County line not far from both L.A. city and county fire stations.\n\nThe agency to send the most fire engines in the first hours of the Woolsey fire was LAFD.\n\nRichmond, the LAFD\u2019s Valley bureau commander, said in an interview that he, along with other fire leaders working the Woolsey fire, discussed early on that they knew this fire would get serious quickly.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the concern, from my perspective on this incident, is obviously (we\u2019re) looking out for L.A. city and making sure that our assets and risks are protected, and if that means dropping water on a Ventura County fire, and it will help us down the road, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Richmond said.\n\nFirefighters from LAFD started streaming in less than a half-hour after the fire began.\n\nRadio transmissions show, soon after they arrived, the firefighters started placing hoses around the fire, giving them quick access to water, and assessing the size and direction of the fire. Within an hour, 11 fire engines and two fire trucks had arrived.\n\nWe\u2019re still coming up with a game plan.\n\nShortly after they arrived, an LAFD firefighter with Engine 481 asked Engine 28 to drive over and help them establish a fire line. But Engine 28 responded that the winds were shifting and they needed to stay put.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more resources where we\u2019re at,\u201d an Engine 28 firefighter said.\n\n\u201cRoger that,\u201d the firefighter on Engine 481 responded. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure something else out.\u201d\n\nRepeatedly over the next hour, the crew\u2019s battalion chief remarked that the fire\u2019s leaders were still establishing a plan and noted, \u201cWe\u2019re having issues with communications right now.\u201d The firefighters discussed how, because of a limited number of hydrants at the Boeing facility, they had to use trucks to keep shuttling water to each other to continue battling the blaze.\n\nL.A. County had about seven engines staging near the Boeing gate when the county\u2019s first strike team arrived about 3:30 p.m. and radioed in seeking orders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still coming up with a game plan,\u201d a fire leader responded.\n\nGardner, the Ventura County assistant chief, said the plan referenced was fire leaders developing their control objectives and other advanced strategic decisions, but that this wouldn\u2019t have kept firefighters on the ground from actively fighting the fire.\n\nThe LAFD continued to send more ground troops than L.A. County into the zone over the next few hours, according to state mutual aid data and incident logs.\n\nMeanwhile, the county fire department was amassing an army of engines at Fire Station 89 in Agoura Hills. By 4:33 p.m., four strike teams were in place there.\n\nImbrenda said the strike teams were used to assess neighborhoods in L.A. County that county fire leaders believed would eventually be in the path of the Woolsey fire. Those assessments were used to create a firefighting strategy for the area, he said.\n\nL.A. County\u2019s incident log, dispatch recordings and the state mutual aid data reviewed by The Times show those four strike teams did not arrive at the Woolsey fire line until just after 9 p.m. By then, the fire was approaching Oak Park, which is about three miles north of Fire Station 89.\n\nFirefighters battle the Woolsey fire in Oak Park on Nov. 9.

Bottom right, Masao Barrows evacuates his home in Thousand Oaks on Nov. 9. (Stuart W. Palley / For the Times)\n\nAt 8:54 p.m., Ventura County Fire Capt. Jeff Pike, the Woolsey incident commander, told Ventura County Division Chief John McNeil over the radio that fire activity was picking up, and that he expected the blaze to reach Oak Park in about an hour. He said he wanted five strike teams to defend Oak Park, according to radio transmissions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding we might have some L.A. County resources, staged at (Fire Station) 89,\u201d Pike said. \u201cIf we could use those resources with the understanding that if L.A. County gets impacted, we can bump those resources back into the L.A. County area.\u201d\n\nAbout eight minutes later, at about 9:02 p.m., an L.A. County firefighter radioed to dispatchers that the four strike teams from Station 89 were responding to the blaze.\n\nThe county fire department disputes this chronology, insisting the strike teams arrived hours earlier than the records indicate, and that the arrival time that\u2019s reflected in the records was a data entry error.\n\nBut officials would not provide any further documentation of the teams\u2019 exact arrival times.\n\nImbrenda cautioned The Times that the radio transmissions it reviewed might not include all tactical communications and that the broadcast could include erroneous reports from civilians.\n\nStation 89 sits along the 101 Freeway. Radio transmissions indicate that just an hour after the Woolsey fire started, one of the L.A. County battalion chiefs overseeing the agency\u2019s Woolsey response wanted to place firefighters on the 101 to prevent the fire from jumping the freeway.\n\nHis concern was understandable \u2014 history has shown that, once a fire crosses the freeway, it can easily make a run for the beach communities.\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl L. Osby defended his department\u2019s tactics, though he stressed he could not speak to specific actions, including when the strike teams arrived and how they were used.\n\nHe said it made sense for firefighters to make a stand at the 101.\n\nOsby said the decision-making focused on protecting lives and property across the entire region and that there was no special focus on areas served by the L.A. County Fire Department.\n\n\u201cWhen we have fires in that area, we\u2019re aware of the potential of it burning to the 101 Freeway and then the potential of it jumping the 101 Freeway,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were aware of the possibility that it could get to the 101 Freeway, so we did all that we could to prevent that.\u201d\n\nWe were aware of the possibility that it could get to the 101 Freeway, so we did all that we could to prevent that. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl L. Osby\n\nAround midnight, resources were beginning to flood into the Woolsey zone. Some came from the Hill fire, whose danger had lessened. From around midnight to 3 a.m., L.A. County alone sent about 12 more strike teams along with 10 more engines.\n\nOsby said he felt the strike teams arrived at the appropriate times and that his department had more firefighters assigned to the blaze than he could ever remember.\n\n\u201cOver half our department was allocated to this fire, which was really unprecedented practice in my career, and I\u2019ve been here for 30 years,\u201d he said.\n\nBut by midnight, the Woolsey fire had grown more powerful and was almost impossible to control at 4,000 acres. Fueled by gusts topping 70 mph, the fire burned homes in Oak Park and forced thousands to evacuate. By 3 a.m., it was 8,000 acres, and at 5:15 a.m. it jumped the 101 Freeway and began its fateful run toward Malibu.\n\nGardner, the Ventura County assistant fire chief, said he had no issues with the resources L.A. County and city fire provided, calling both agencies \u201c100 percent\u201d supportive during the Woolsey fire.\n\nSmoke from the Woolsey fire billows behind buildings and palm trees along PCH in western Malibu. Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times\n\nMaking a monster\n\nAs far as the Woolsey fire moved that first night, the following day would be much worse. The fire ate into the Santa Monica Mountains, burning 88% of federal parkland. It became 14 miles wide at one point as it devastated Malibu neighborhoods.\n\nVeteran firefighters say it was a once-in-a-lifetime event.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of experience, I\u2019ve never seen a fire that explosive,\u201d LAFD\u2019s Richmond said. \u201cSeeing how quickly that fire traveled to Agoura Hills and Oak Park and Thousand Oaks and jumped the freeway the next morning, and in four hours, it\u2019s burning kelp beds in the Pacific Ocean \u2014 that\u2019s pretty incredible.\n\n\u201cThis one was the big one,\u201d he said.\n\nThe question officials are facing now is whether different tactics would have stopped the fire sooner.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that those fighting the fire in those first few hours didn\u2019t have the resources they thought they needed, according to radio transmissions. It\u2019s also clear tactics used by fire officials that day limited the number of firefighters on the front lines that afternoon and evening.\n\nAt public meetings, some residents have complained about a lack of fire resources and what some claim was a flawed evacuation strategy. Both the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the Malibu City Council are creating panels to investigate how the fire was fought.\n\nMalibu Mayor Jefferson Wagner, who was injured in a futile attempt to save his home, put it this way: \u201cPart of the healing process includes understanding what happened and why it happened, and making improvements for the future.\u201d\n\nTimes staff writers Paul Pringle, Matt Stiles and Richard Winton contributed to this report."

In back, with his right hand raised and wearing a black beanie, is Telemachus Orfanos. At center, in the plaid shirt, is Garrett Gratland. In back at right, with his left hand raised, is Brendan Kelly.\n\nThey grin as they drape their arms around one another.\n\nTelemachus Orfanos and Brendan Kelly lift their beers in a toast. A tattoo memorializing the Las Vegas mass shooting \u2014 which both men survived \u2014 is visible underneath Kelly\u2019s shirt.\n\nIn front of them, Justin Meek and Garrett Gratland prop up a friend who is crouched off-balance, a finger pressed mischievously to his pursed lips. An American flag is displayed behind the 11 friends, who lean close together.\n\nThe photo was taken around 11 p.m. Nov. 7, minutes before a stranger walked into Borderline Bar and Grill, spraying bullets as people ducked for cover and fled in terror.\n\nBy the end of the night, 12 people had been killed, making the mass shooting one of the deadliest in American history.\n\nTwo of the friends in the photo did not make it out alive.\n\nSome chose to stay in the bar so they could help others hide and escape or shield them from gunfire. The bar was popular with veterans and cops, many of whom put their training saving lives to use that night.\n\nWitnesses\u2019 accounts from the Thousand Oaks massacre paint a portrait of heroism that often goes unrecognized in mass shootings. Most of the people who died that night did so while trying to save others, according to interviews and public statements from more than 75 survivors, law enforcement officials and victims\u2019 family members. Their bravery saved lives, officials say.\n\nAt funerals for those killed, pastors have repeated a telling refrain: There is no greater act of love than to lay down your life for a friend.\n\nBorderline Bar and Grill was a popular gathering spot in Thousand Oaks. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe country-themed Borderline is an unlikely institution in Thousand Oaks, a family-friendly suburb 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles.\n\nNestled away from the main road, Borderline resembles a large cabin with glass windows and wood-paneled walls. On Nov. 7, about 175 people were inside, including college students celebrating 18th, 20th and 21st birthdays. The dance floor, where people twirl and click their cowboy boots in unison, was mostly empty.\n\nAround 9:30 p.m., Orfanos, who worked as a Borderline security guard, sipped an extra-large beer. A friend swung open the bar\u2019s saloon doors and asked him if he was working.\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m working?\u201d Orfanos said, smirking.\n\nOrfanos, 27, had the night off. But after the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, Borderline had become a sanctuary for him and other survivors \u2014 a place to hear country music and feel safe. Orfanos, who served two and a half years in the Navy, had helped pack wounds for those injured at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival.\n\nOver the next hour, more of Orfanos\u2019 friends showed up. Borderline regulars recognized him, the life of the party with a warm smile. He was unusually kind; he would give drunk people rides home at the end of the night to make sure they got there safe.\n\nOrfanos and 10 friends gathered for a photograph near the pool tables. The photo was taken with the cellphone of Justin Meek, 23, who worked as a security guard and a promoter, encouraging people to spend their evenings at Borderline. Meek, a lifelong country music fan and gifted singer, had just finished running the 9 p.m. promoters meeting, at which they planned for the bar\u2019s Christmas party.\n\nMeek\u2019s younger sister was at the bar that night too, also working as a promoter. They were three years apart but liked to tell people they were fraternal twins.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to check on my sister,\u201d Meek told his friends. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\nKelly, a 22-year-old Marine, drank a shot at the bar. He\u2019d been lauded after the Vegas shooting for protecting a woman he had made friends with two hours before the blasts began. Kelly, a quadruplet who grew up in Thousand Oaks, could quickly befriend anyone, his crew would tell you.\n\nKelly heard the thumping of bass as \u201cTurn Up the Music\u201d by Chris Brown began to play over the speakers. He headed to the dance floor.\n\nGratland, 24, stayed back. He had been going to Borderline for six years but had never gotten the hang of line dancing. Instead, he ordered a grilled cheese and a beer.\n\nHe was headed overseas for a job in private security in a few days. He had recently left the Army after six years of service.\n\nOnce his sandwich arrived, Gratland tucked half of it into his shirt pocket as a joke. He was the group\u2019s goofball.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep this safe from you guys,\u201d Gratland said playfully, his handlebar mustache rising up with each word.\n\nThe gag was captured in a video timestamped 11:16 p.m., two minutes before the shooter entered the bar.\n\nStepping out of his car in the Borderline parking lot, Ian Long felt the sting of the chilly autumn night. He saw the glow of lights from the bar and silhouettes moving on the other side of the glass.\n\nLong, 28, had grown up in Thousand Oaks and had been to Borderline. Wednesday was \u201ccollege night,\u201d an 18-and-over event advertised to universities across the region, including the one nearby he had attended.\n\nAt 11:18 p.m., Long stalked through Borderline\u2019s front door wearing a black sweatshirt and a beanie. Armed with a .45-caliber Glock handgun, a folding knife and seven high-capacity magazines, he turned to his right and killed the young woman at the cash register.\n\nHe aimed his weapon at customers and kept firing. He was a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, trained as a machine-gunner.\n\nPatrons dropped to the floor or frantically tried to hide. Some called 911. Long fired at people who were lying down.\n\nThe dance floor Read more >>\n\nPatrons dropped to the floor or frantically tried to hide. Some called 911. Long fired at people who were lying down.\n\nNear the end of the bar counter, Gratland crouched on the ground atop a friend until he heard the shooter turn toward the dance floor, away from them. He shouted, \u201cRun, now!\u201d as he and his friends bolted to the patio.\n\nKelly, who was line dancing, pulled women frozen in fear to the floor and shielded one with his body. He swiveled his head to see Long headed toward him.\n\nAt first, there was no screaming. The DJ had cut the music. The shooter was silent but for the staccato pops of gunfire he unleashed.\n\nKelly planned an escape.\n\nGlass began to shatter around him as the bar\u2019s large windows became an unexpected lifesaving exit route.\n\nPeople hurled bar stools through the windows so they could flee. Others punched them with their fists. One man cannonballed through the glass. Some people fell 20 feet after jumping through windows.\n\nThe windows Read more >>\n\nPeople hurled bar stools through the windows so they could flee. Others punched them with their fists. One man cannonballed through the glass. Some people fell 20 feet after jumping through windows.\n\n\u201cGo, go, go, move, move, move!\u201d Kelly screamed as a flood of people charged for the exit nearby.\n\nAs he raced out of the building, Kelly tripped.\n\nThe shooter threw smoke bombs. The lights went out. Shards of glass littered the floor.\n\nSeven people hid in an employee bathroom with no lock. Another seven sought refuge in the attic. A busboy hid under a sink, watching the shooter\u2019s feet move behind the bar.\n\nMany of those killed died in the first few minutes, including some who probably could have escaped but chose to stay and fight.\n\nSean Adler, a bouncer, ran at the shooter and tried to disarm him, family members said. He died. Dan Manrique, a Marine veteran, \u201cpaid the ultimate sacrifice so that others might live,\u201d said a pastor at his funeral, based on information from his family. Cody Coffman, a 22-year-old who was planning to join the Navy, ushered at least four friends to safety before he returned to the bar and was fatally struck in the head by a bullet.\n\nWhen the shooter first entered the bar, Meek extended his arms outward to shield people from bullets. His friends standing near him made it out safely. So did his little sister.\n\nMeek planned to join the Coast Guard and had written in a paper for a class at Cal Lutheran University that \u201cit was ingrained into me that I must serve my country.\u201d\n\nHe was shot in the chest and killed. Police told his family he died a hero.\n\nSheriff's deputies investigate the shooting at Borderline Bar and Grill in the early morning hours of Nov. 8. Patrick T. Fallon / For The Times\n\nOutside the bar, Gratland led his friends toward a nearby gas station, then doubled back. As he approached Borderline, Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Ron Helus and two California Highway Patrol officers sprinted toward him from the parking lot.\n\n\u201cShow me your hands!\u201d one of the officers shouted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your guy,\u201d Gratland said.\n\nAt 11:26 p.m., Gratland watched as Helus and one of the officers stormed the bar. He heard the thunderous boom of gunshots. Long had ambushed the two officers, striking Helus five times.\n\nGratland later helped carry Helus into an SUV headed to the hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. Officials say that Helus\u2019 heart was punctured by a bullet fired by the CHP officer but that the men\u2019s bravery still saved lives.\n\nLong, meanwhile, remained unharmed. He had yet to be struck by gunfire.\n\nIn messages he posted on Facebook and Instagram while in the bar, Long wrote that he hoped people would call him \u201cinsane.\u201d He mocked the \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d that are frequently offered in public statements and on social media after mass shootings.\n\nHe sat in the bar\u2019s office, a small room with TVs displaying surveillance camera feeds from inside and outside the building.\n\nThe phone rang. It was the mother of a woman who had escaped minutes before. She thought maybe people trapped in the bar needed help. Long picked up the call, but remained quiet and eventually hung up.\n\nThe phone call Read more >>\n\nThe phone rang. It was the mother of a woman who had escaped minutes before. She thought maybe people trapped in the bar needed help. Long picked up the call, but remained quiet and eventually hung up.\n\nOrfanos, who worked at Borderline, knew its exits and entrances and most likely could have fled. But he was a security guard, military-trained, and had experience with a mass shooting. If anyone could help, maybe he could.\n\nOrfanos led a group of friends out and had returned to the bar to rescue more.\n\nHis wounds suggest he charged at Long. He was stabbed in the neck and shot multiple times. He died.\n\nOutside, Kelly regained his footing. He hid behind a sedan in the dark parking lot, yelling at others to do the same.\n\nAfter the Vegas shooting, Kelly trained as an emergency medical technician because he wanted to be more helpful if he ended up in a similar situation again. And now he had.\n\nHe carried to safety a man whose neck had been grazed by a bullet fragment and who\u2019d shattered a kneecap after leaping out a window. Kelly fastened his belt as a tourniquet around another friend\u2019s arm, where jagged glass had sliced him while pushing people out windows.\n\nThe metal buckle of Kelly\u2019s belt was engraved with the words \u201cRoute 91,\u201d the name of the music festival where he survived his first mass shooting.\n\nEventually, red flashing lights began to flood Borderline\u2019s parking lot as medics arrived to treat the injured. Many could not be saved.\n\nTwo 21-year-old best friends. An 18-year-old college freshman. A 21-year-old dancer who loved Borderline.\n\nHe was a bouncer, she loved music, he wanted to join the Army \u2014 these are the victims of the Borderline shooting \u00bb\n\nBack inside the bar, Long made a final decision. At 11:39 p.m. \u2014 21 minutes after he entered Borderline, pistol firing \u2014 he turned the weapon toward his head. He pulled the trigger.\n\nCrosses bear the names of the victims of the Borderline shooting. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times Brendan Kelly shows off a tattoo of \"Route 91,\" the name of the Las Vegas festival where he survived a mass shooting that killed dozens.

Now it\u2019s one of the last pictures of Meek and Orfanos.\n\nKelly and Gratland survived, as did the other seven friends in the photograph. A bullet skimmed the back of one of the men. Another friend escaped through a window shattered with a chair.

They gaze at the smiling faces of the friends who were lost.\n\nPolice are still investigating the massacre. They do not yet understand why Long targeted Borderline, a bar in his hometown. A place popular with veterans and young people, like himself. But the close bonds among Borderline regulars and staff undoubtedly altered the outcome of the tragedy.\n\nAmong those who survived was a bartender who guarded the attic door, ready to pounce on the shooter to save others hiding there. In the unlocked employee bathroom, three people leaned against the door to keep it shut.\n\nThe attic Read more >>\n\nWhen gunfire erupted, eight off-duty cops enjoying a night out protected customers by standing between them and the shooter and later carried people out. Other employees led patrons to hidden exits; most people believed the bar had only one way in and out.\n\nThese actions collectively seem to have derailed Long\u2019s rampage. After the exchange of gunfire with the officers, Long did not target any more victims. He had brought magazines containing 210 rounds but fired no more than 60, police said.\n\nThough the shooting has rattled Thousand Oaks, there is one thing survivors and their families return to as they remember the strangers who grabbed their hands and dragged them to safety, the people who smashed windows so they could escape, the friends who jumped in front of them as bullets flew: It could have been much worse.\n\nAnother photo of the Borderline group, taken a few minutes after the flag photo.

    "text": "On the evening of Nov. 7, Borderline Bar and Grill transformed from a neighborhood bar in Thousand Oaks into the site of a gunman's rampage. About 170 people who were at the bar survived by fleeing through emergency exits, leaping through shattered windows or hiding while listening to the gunman kill others.\n\nThese are their stories.\n\nThe dance floor\n\nMinutes before the shooting, the dance floor at Borderline Bar and Grill filled with people doing a line dance called \u201cAskin\u2019 Questions\u201d as \u201cTurn Up the Music\u201d by Chris Brown began to play.\n\nPoint, kick, point, kick, turn. Point, kick, point, kick, turn.\n\nKatie Wilkie, 24, assumed her favorite spot, near the front of the dance floor by the emergency exit. The song was about halfway through when she heard gunshots and looked over. Ian Long had started firing and was headed toward the crowd.\n\n\u201cI saw a handgun face everyone on the dance floor,\u201d she said.\n\nWilkie hid behind a large speaker, then tried to join a flood of people headed to the nearby exit. But so many customers were frantically trying to escape that she was pushed up against bar stools stacked next to a wall. Eventually, she made it out.\n\nIt was Alexis Tait, 23, who had asked the DJ to play Chris Brown, her boyfriend\u2019s favorite artist. The two had arrived at the bar around 9:30 p.m. after a joint birthday dinner with their families.\n\nWhile on the dance floor, Tait, who lives in Simi Valley, usually kept one eye on the door, where her friend Kristina Morisette worked the cash register.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll always give me nasty looks or flip me off or stick her tongue out at me,\u201d Tait said. \u201cI was giving her one back and laughing with her, and I was looking at the front door because somebody walked in. ... I just froze.\u201d\n\nLong entered the bar and shot and killed her friend.\n\nTait and her boyfriend, Harrison King, raced to the emergency exit. King, 24, steered people out the door while listening to the continued blasts of gunshots coming from inside. He bolted after 30 seconds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I finally ran out, I was like, \u2018OK, it\u2019s time for me to go,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nKing and Tait clambered up a nearby hill, where several people, including Wilkie, had scrambled to safety.\n\nKatie Wilkie and Justin Veditz, survivors of the Bordeline Bar and Grill shooting, embrace each other. Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe phone call\n\nKelsey Lewis, who was DJing that night, escaped through a broken window and called her parents.\n\nOn the phone, her father, Kyle Lewis, heard gunshots like the ones he heard when she called him last year during the mass shooting in Las Vegas. Then, she had told her dad that people were getting hit next to her as she sprinted to safety.\n\nAs she stood outside Borderline, she told her parents her friends were still inside. They told her to run. Soon after, her mom, Kathy, called Borderline to see if someone was inside the office who needed help. Her husband was beside her, listening as the phone rang and someone picked up and stayed silent.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said. He greeted her hello and then stayed quiet.\n\n\u201cAre you guys open today?\u201d she asked, trying to draw out the phone call.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he responded. He then said yes. When she asked how late they were open, he hung up.\n\n\u201cI was irate,\u201d Kyle Lewis said in an interview. \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s him.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe couple later recounted the conversation to the FBI.\n\nThe windows\n\nBryce Viole, a football player at Moorpark College, ran through a glass window when he saw Long approach, shattering it with the force of his body. He fell six feet to the ground, landing on his head. He then helped two women jump out the window after him.\n\n\"My football coach is always telling me, 'Don't lead with your head,' but this time it worked,\" said Viole, 20.\n\nViole, who lives in Agoura Hills, crossed his arms in front of his face when he smashed the glass. His hands and wrists were so badly gashed that the bone was visible. He needed 75 stitches.\n\nBryce Viole used his body to break a window and then jumped out of it to escape the carnage at Borderline Bar and Grill. Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times\n\nMany used bar stools to bust open windows. Dan Ceco, who worked at the bar until about a year ago, punched a window facing the 101 Freeway. He threw people out of it before jumping out himself. He does not remember breaking the window, but friends told him they saw him do it.\n\nOnce outside the bar, someone pointed out that Ceco\u2019s wrist was bleeding. He drove to the hospital, hitting 90 mph, and received stitches.\n\nThe bar counter\n\nSteve Campbell, 32, wedged himself into a small space near the edge of the bar counter. A young woman took cover beneath his legs.\n\nThe two shielded themselves from view with a serving tray, while smoke bombs provided extra cover. They heard a rapid sequence of gunshots, then silence.\n\nThe only thing Campbell could see were muzzle flashes from Long\u2019s pistol. At one point, the pair listened as the shooter walked behind the bar counter. Campbell struggled to keep his phone from loudly vibrating against a bucket near him.\n\n\u201cYou could hear his footsteps every time he comes through,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cYou just prepare yourself to die.\u201d\n\nSteve Campbell escaped Borderline Bar and Grill by hiding from the gunman with a young woman. Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times\n\nDylan Short, who had been sitting at the bar with a friend when Long entered, felt a bullet skim his back as he tried to take cover.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d he thought, before leaping out a window his friend had smashed. His shoes came off as he fled and he sped away in his truck without them, running red lights as he drove to another nearby bar.\n\nShort, who was bleeding badly, ran up to the doorman at the Tipsy Goat to warn him that a shooter had targeted Borderline. He was worried this bar would be next. Short\u2019s bloodied appearance probably caused confusion about shootings at multiple bars.\n\nThe attic\n\nTrying their best to stay quiet, seven people sought refuge in the bar\u2019s attic, which was filled with insulation and air conditioning units.\n\nBartender Bobby Langin Jr. and the bar manager lay next to the opening, at one point holding hands. Langin armed himself with a piece of plywood and watched the shadows through the door, fearful that every shot that went off was Long finding someone hidden and killing them.\n\nLangin could hear the shooter\u2019s footsteps and at one point what sounded like a struggle. The bartender was determined not to go down without a fight.\n\n\u201cI could either let him come up and kill every one of us or I can jump on him,\u201d Langin thought.\n\nLangin and the bar manager ushered Lindsey Scheivert, 24, and her boyfriend into the attic. Scheivert had been frozen on the floor of the storeroom until the bar manager persuaded her to get up.\n\n\u201cThey were more concerned about our safety than their own,\u201d Scheivert said.\n\nAt one point, those in the attic clambered on top of air conditioning units, worried that Long would shoot at the ceiling. For nearly two hours, they waited, listening as the police went in and yelled at the shooter and later as Long turned the gun on himself.\n\nAn additional 30 minutes passed before a SWAT team arrived and brought them down. The officers tried to create a wall with their bodies to block the survivors from seeing what had happened inside the bar.\n\nStill, they could see what had happened while they were hiding: trails of blood in every direction and articles of clothing that had been left behind.\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

We asked for another round, but they too were undercooked. We exchanged regretful, knowing looks, got in the car and drove to Panera Bread.\n\nPerhaps we should have known better. This was 2007 in Nashville, where authentic Chinese food is known to be incredibly elusive.\n\nDim sum is the holy grail of the thousand-odd Chinese people who live there, where Asian Americans form just 3.9% of the population. Every time a restaurant opens and starts throwing around words such as \u201chargow\u201d and \u201cshumai,\u201d we swarm as if it\u2019s Black Friday at Best Buy. So far no restaurant has been able to deliver.\n\nWhen I went back to Tennessee a few Christmases ago, the Nashville Scene had declared a restaurant named Lucky Bamboo the city\u2019s first authentic dim sum. I asked my dad about it when he picked me up from the airport.\n\nHis mouth tightened into a grim, unforgiving line. He had tried it.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d was all he said. He refused to elaborate.\n\nWhen we moved to Nashville in 1995, we quickly became intimately familiar with the seven or eight Chinese restaurants within driving distance, half of which seemed to be owned by my parents\u2019 family friends.\n\nOn weekdays when my parents were too tired to cook, there was Hot Wok, a cheap takeout place, where I would order fried rice, chicken on a stick, beef broccoli and a chewy, thick-skinned egg roll. After Chinese school on Saturdays, there was Golden Coast, a semi-authentic buffet place that had baos, a few dumplings and a dish with cow stomach. Sometimes, we\u2019d starve ourselves all day and gorge at Ming\u2019s Chinese Buffet in Cool Springs for $6 each. I cringed watching my mom steal all the scallops and shrimps from the seafood medley, but ate them when she scraped them onto my plate.\n\nTourists make their way up and down Broadway in downtown Nashville. William DeShazer / For The Times\n\nTo my parents \u2014 immigrants from Taiwan \u2014 these places must have felt like scratching an itch through a pair of jeans. A few times a year, we\u2019d pile into our metallic blue Nissan Quest and drive four hours to Atlanta \u2014 a little-known Deep South Chinese food oasis \u2014 which is to say that in the city\u2019s adjoining suburbs you could find a 99 Ranch Market, some Chinese bakeries and a dim sum restaurant.\n\nOur first stop was always Panda Inn on Peachtree Road to catch the back end of the dim sum service \u2014 fried taro dumplings were my favorite.\n\nAfterward, we usually went to a bakery to buy a box full of pineapple-top buns and egg tarts. Then, we\u2019d head to 99 Ranch and fill our car with dried noodles, dehydrated mushrooms, sheets of dried tofu, bags of rice and all of the groceries we couldn\u2019t find in Tennessee.\n\nJust as it got dark, we\u2019d squeeze in another meal, often ordering soup dumplings to go before we headed back.\n\nI could never understand why my frugal parents spent so much money in Atlanta, of all places. It was as if they became different people. My father relaxed his healthy values to drink soda and eat multiple meals within a few hours. My mom spent money freely, even allowed me to put items in her grocery cart. The only other time I ever saw them this happy was when we\u2019d visit family in Taiwan.\n\nA Shyong family photo from 2007. Family photo\n\nMy own relationship with Chinese food was complicated. As a child, I chafed mightily under our household\u2019s diet \u2014 to me, a tyrannical culinary regime that offered little justice to its subjects.\n\nThe biggest tantrum I ever threw was when I turned 5 and my parents promised to take me to Old Country Buffet for my birthday. They changed their minds halfway there \u2014 I think we forgot the credit card.\n\nI wept hysterically for the whole drive home and even bashed my head on the car roof a few times. Truthfully, I\u2019m not even embarrassed by the memory. I wanted some mashed potatoes in that moment more than anything.\n\nI didn\u2019t hate Chinese food, but I coveted American food. The more mundane, the more intriguing. I lusted after Lunchables, lasagna and green bean casserole \u2014 any kind of casserole, really.\n\nI had a particular taste for 1990s-era frozen foods, hopelessly slipping Go-Gurts and Hot Pockets and Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches into my mother\u2019s shopping cart (she never bought them). At Thanksgivings, I would personally cook the mashed potatoes, macaroni and turkey to go along with my mom\u2019s special-occasion Chinese foods. Just watching a Totino\u2019s Pizza Roll commercial could fill me with jealousy. White kids got to eat pizza as a snack while I had to wait for dinnertime, which was nearly always rice, stir-fried meat and vegetables.\n\nAmerica never felt more out of reach than when I opened the door to our pantry. I recall a deep sense of bitterness at the fact that we never had any cheese in our house. Melting cheese on top of stuff was, to me, nothing less than my God-given right as an American.\n\nI demanded money from my parents so I could try all the strange foods in the school cafeteria: puff pastries with turkey stew ladled inside, corn nuggets, sausage biscuits. When I got older, I began to sleep through my parents\u2019 Atlanta pilgrimages.\n\nI started skipping dinner at home to make clandestine runs to Sonic for onion rings and Texas toast hamburgers, eating in my car, tossing the bags and driving home with the windows down to get the smell out. I tried Krystal and White Castle and ate an entire Crave Case by myself. I hid Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies in my backpack and ate them by the box.\n\nBy my senior year, I got a job at Wild Oats Natural Marketplace, an organic grocery store chain later bought by Whole Foods. During breaks, I\u2019d stuff my face at the shelf in the back where we put dented or opened items, mostly weird healthy snack foods and Horizon vanilla milk.\n\nWhen I got home, I\u2019d head straight to my bedroom, past my mother\u2019s food cooling under Saran wrap on the counter, where she always left it for me.\n\nThe Shyong family at dim sum at Ocean Star in 2015 Family photo\n\nI grew up in an affectionate but uncommunicative Chinese household. For my family, love has always been like playing a game of catch in the dark. We all reach out to each other in our own ways, but we stumble over our words, groping for meaning in the space between our cultures.\n\nSometimes it feels as if we have never learned the vocabulary of emotion.\n\nWhen I ask my parents about their past, they become masterful equivocators.\n\nMy father can let a question hang in the air for so long that I end up repeating it, retracting it or trying to answer it myself. My mother drowns questions in rapid patter about grades, college, my weight or my romantic life.\n\nBut food opened the door to my parents\u2019 memories in ways that words never did. The making and eating of food communicated more than any conversation, a language we adopted when English and Mandarin failed us. We folded our feelings into dumplings and lavished love into lah mian. Screaming matches about the Bs on my report card would be followed by a silent dinner table. There were never apologies \u2014 only the sound of slurping and the cleansing clinking of chopsticks against porcelain bowls.\n\nAnd food brings us together, even if we\u2019re hundreds of miles away.\n\nThe year after I graduated from UCLA, I was in south Orange County, writing about the cities of Dana Point and San Juan Capistrano for the Orange County Register. One day I was seized by an intense, nostalgic desire to eat dim sum. I found a nearby place on Yelp.\n\nThe shumai arrived cold, no steam. The skins were dry and wrinkled, wrapped around what looked to be the world\u2019s tiniest shrimp. Six on a wilting lettuce leaf for $10.\n\nI stuffed three limp shumai into my mouth and chewed angrily. They tasted as though they had just been defrosted.\n\nIn that moment, I finally understood part of the yearning my parents had felt as Taiwanese immigrants in Tennessee. Eating Chinese food wasn\u2019t just their preference. It was how they tried, in a strange place, to feel like themselves. It was why they drove to Atlanta several times a year. Why we ate only Chinese food at home.\n\nFrank Shyong with dim sum at the Ocean Star Restaurant in Monterey Park. Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times\n\nAll cultures find meaning in their food, but for a lot of Asian Americans, and for families like mine, food shows us who we are.\n\nWe eat to remember. We eat when words fail us, which they often do. We eat to show love, even when we\u2019re full or concerned about our weight. We eat to make Tennessee feel like home, to express a version of ourselves that choices and circumstances have forced us to leave behind.\n\nThere\u2019s this idiom I\u2019ve only ever heard from older Chinese Americans that articulates this relationship perfectly (I\u2019ve never been able to find the source): Chinese people carry their homes in their stomachs.\n\nTaiwan is no longer the country my parents remember, and in many ways America will never feel like home. But if they look hard enough, they can find restaurants started by immigrants who remember Taiwan as they do.\n\nLurking in obscure strip malls are steamed, fried and boiled pieces of time and place, wrapped in dough, twisted into springy skeins, chopped or wok-seared, waiting to be discovered. The truest kind of home available to families like mine.\n\nA few years ago, my parents moved to Los Angeles. We started to have dinner together again.\n\nMy mother, who works as an MRI technician, is a fast and mercurial cook. She throws peanut butter into noodles for creaminess and improvises sushi with ham, pork threads, egg and radish. I cook fast too, and sometimes I buy jars of bamboo shoots in chili oil and eat them with chopsticks late at night standing over the kitchen sink, just like she does.\n\nMy dad, an engineer, cooks dishes with few ingredients and strong, singular flavors \u2014 potato strips fried with garlic and beef, or bean curd with green onion and pork, each rectangular piece of curd sliced exactly the same. I eat quickly and prefer meat like he does.\n\nWhenever the conversation falters, I pay attention to what they\u2019re eating to fill in the blanks.\n\nThere\u2019s always brown rice in the Zojirushi because my dad\u2019s on a health kick. Mooncakes and tea from Taiwan sit on the counter, because my mom has been going back more often to visit my grandma.\n\nThere are stacks of weird meal-prepped salad with sliced strawberries and onions in the fridge because my dad is trying to design the healthiest, most balanced lunch possible for people who don\u2019t care about how things taste.\n\nIn the fridge, sometimes I\u2019ll find one of my favorite foods, Taiwanese spring rolls from the 99 Ranch in Rowland Heights. It\u2019s a 90-minute drive in traffic, but my mom says they taste sort of like the ones she used to buy from a stand inside an ancient temple near her childhood bus stop in Hsinchu, Taiwan.\n\nOne bite, and we\u2019re home.\n\nFrank Shyong at Paul's Kitchen on San Pedro Street in Los Angeles.

    "text": "More than 20 years ago, Charles Ray Walker spotted green bamboo shoots growing along a drab warehouse by the Los Angeles River in Boyle Heights. A Texan, Walker turned a wedge of urban wasteland into a wildly colorful wonderland of vegetables and thousands of toys arrayed along carved, earthen terraces.\n\nHe built a shack under the shade of a tree and even a home entertainment room with a television set and sofa.\n\nLargely hidden from the world, \u201cBamboo Charlie\u201d nevertheless welcomed visitors, taking pride in the awe that his creation inspired. And yet, Walker was a homeless man whose life was weighed down under the hardship that came from living how he did. He suffered from terribly painful ulcers, had to defend his turf from other homeless people and in the end, at 61, died alone, gaunt and curled up in his fanciful home.\n\n2018 in review: L.A. spent big to end homlessness, but the crisis drags on \u00bb\n\nA homeless person's freshly laundered clothes lie in a row and dry in the afternoon sun along the L.A. River near Atwater Village. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) More Photos\n\nWhen people think of the homeless, their mind often takes them to standard images of who they are and where they supposedly live. Splayed out on the concrete of skid row; inside of tents lining major boulevards or underpasses; scrunched in a fetal position with a thin blanket in the doorway of a business late at night or early in the dewy morning. But such is the diversity of Southern California\u2019s landscapes that there is a scarcely a corner of the region that homeless men and women have not adapted to. They take pride in their creations, however dystopian or unfortunate.\n\nThere\u2019s the man who dug a bunker in the middle of the desert or the one who, far from the Pacific Ocean, lives under the hulls of two boats that have been flipped over. There\u2019s the couple in a treehouse in the Sepulveda Basin; the clan of people who live on a sandbar in the center of the Los Angeles River.\n\nNo matter how ingenious these makeshift homes are, however, they are inhabited by people who bear the scars of an unsettled, hardscrabble life.\n\nHere are some of their stories:\n\nAndrew Weber, 30, has a smoke outside of the bunker where he has been living homeless for the past year and a half in Lancaster. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) Weber climbs out of his cave that he dug out from the ground in Lancaster.

Right, Andrew Weber, 30, climbs out of his cave that he dug out from the ground in Lancaster. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) More Photos\n\nLancaster\n\nAndrew Weber made a rectangular, earthen bunker out of the desert dirt. Submerged like a giant, unfilled grave with a plywood and tarp roof, his homestead lies in an empty plot dotted with the huts of other homeless people.\n\nThe 30-year-old proudly calls himself a \u201cLane-cracker\u201d and struggles to spit out sentences. He says that 13 years ago, a motor bike accident paralyzed him and placed him in a coma. The injury left him with symptoms that resemble a stroke.\n\nHis left hand is often frozen into a balled fist. His white T-shirt is stained, and his beard runs wild across his face. He says he used to work for his father\u2019s plumbing business. Now he begs for money and does chores at a liquor store in exchange for a pack of smokes or a bottle of whiskey.\n\nHe built his bunker years ago for a friend and returned to it when he became homeless. A few cushions serve as his bed.\n\n\u201cI made it on my own. I did it with a shovel. I lowered the floor and raised the roof,\u201d he says between puffs of cigarettes.\n\nThe inside of the bunker is strewn with trash, but he likes it, because more often than not, he\u2019s left alone.\n\nWeber built this bunker years ago for a friend and then returned when he was homeless. Abandoned plywood and tarps function as the roof and a series of cushions serve as his bed. \"I made it on my own. I did it with a shovel. I lowered the floor and raised the roof,\" he said. Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times\n\nThree miles away, just off an empty road and far from downtown and the sea, Chris Strong, 51, dragged two abandoned boats into a desert lot and flipped them over. He lives inside their hull; the space is large enough to fit a queen-size mattress and a stove.\n\nUnlike Weber, the Woodland Hills native yearns for a conventional home. For now, \u201cCamp-Lic-Sac,\u201d which is lewdly spray-painted on the boat, will do. It stands apart from a small cluster of structures and campers that are far from the closest paved road and in the shadow of a nearby airport.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not proud of this place, but it\u2019s better than being on the sidewalk,\u201d he says.\n\nStrong is as tall as an NBA point guard, but in the confines of the upturned boat, he cuts a small figure, curled like a finger. He says an injury to his back makes it hard for him to stand for long anyway, or to work very much.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m sleeping too long, it hurts my back and neck; but sometimes I\u2019m like, \u2018Screw it, I\u2019m not getting up!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI want to accomplish something here instead of running from my problems.\u201d\n\nHis goals aren\u2019t complicated \u2014 obtaining tags that aren\u2019t expired so he can drive his car, acquiring a job that doesn\u2019t require him to commute to the San Fernando Valley and finding an affordable place to live.\n\nChris Strong, 51, looks out from his abode made up of two abandoned boats in Lancaster. Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times\n\nAs Strong stands outside his boat home, his friend since age 10 walks over. Steve Novak sports flowing long hair that makes him look like he could front a Black Sabbath cover band. He lives yards away in a camper next to a little clubhouse he calls \u201cCamp Coolness.\u201d\n\nBoth men moved out to the desert this year. Novak, who recently had a string of heart attacks, takes a decidedly more positive view of the situation. The interior includes a small couch, a neatly made bed and is adorned with Beanie Babies stuffed animals. Novak takes pride in building his shelter without any power tools.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re at a hobo camp, this is the coolest one you\u2019ll ever see,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re only homeless if you\u2019re on the curb. We take care of each other.\u201d\n\nSteve Novak, 52, reflected in a mirror, sits inside the small cabin he constructed in Lancaster.

Steps have been nailed to a tree trunk and, and there\u2019s a television that picks up local channels from an antenna. \u201cI saw these trees and built it at night.\" he said. Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times\n\nAs vehicles scream down Burbank Boulevard, Eric Montoya of LA Family Housing pulls his car over and leads a group of outreach workers on a narrow path through thick bush. A clearing opens, revealing two treehouses along a creek. Nearby rows of tents line a creek, and trash piles high.\n\nEven in this mess, one of the treehouses stands out as especially impressive: two stories constructed with plywood and tarp. Steps have been nailed to the tree trunk, and there\u2019s a television that picks up local channels from an antenna.\n\n\u201cI saw these trees and built it at night, because I didn\u2019t want people to see,\u201d says Tony Looman, who has lived here off and on for four years. \u201cAt night, even with the lights on, you won\u2019t see I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nLooman is a native Texan and loves to watch football. For many years, he says, he worked as a database administrator at Oracle but lost that job and others as he struggled with drug addiction. Now he works on and off as a cabinet maker.\n\nThroughout the encampment, which runs alongside the Encino creek and neighbors Looman\u2019s home, there are needles everywhere. It\u2019s hard to shake drugs. Everyone is high on something, he reasons.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re down and out, you feel like a loser,\u201d Looman says drearily. \u201cSo why not?\u201d\n\nMontoya listens to Looman\u2019s story. After telling Looman, 60, about a program to help him with his decaying teeth, Montoya moves on to another treehouse, where John King and Jackie Canez live.\n\nThe couple are from the San Fernando Valley and have been homeless for five years. Their treehouse has expanded with time \u2014 with the rains inspiring many of these remodelings. When the rain comes down hard, flooding fills the basin and washes over a baseball field across the creek. Sometimes firefighters in boats fish out people who stayed behind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to sleep at night and know we won\u2019t get swept away,\u201d King says.\n\nHe used to work as a contractor, but he says anxiety, depression and other ills from a hard childhood keep him from working. The Jim Beam he consumes doesn\u2019t help, but it numbs the pain, he said.\n\nKing is proud of his treehouse. He shows off the pool pump he submerges in the creek. It allows the couple to take showers whenever they want.\n\nEventually, King and Canez tell Montoya they want to move on. But the treehouse, and the pride he feels in it, somehow keeps him from going deeper into despair, King said.\n\n\u201cPeople say: \u2018They\u2019re homeless. They do nothing. We\u2019re just on our ass,\u2019\u201d he says before pointing up to his creation. \u201cLook at this.\u201d\n\nLooman, 60, has breakfast inside his two-story structure in the Sepulveda Basin off Burbank Boulevard in Encino. The native Texan said he worked as a database administrator at Oracle but lost that job and several others as he struggled with addiction.

Right: Pam Viscard, 32, right, and Christina, whom Viscard refers to as her street daughter, stand outside their tent in Hollywood. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe two tents sit precariously on the slope of a steep hill. Below, a moving audience roars incessantly on the 101 freeway.\n\nPam Viscard, 32, wears a turquoise tank-top as she shuffles around her tent, removing trash and looking after her dog Papa. Viscard has been on the streets of Hollywood since she was 15. She shares her tent with her wife, who is asleep and often afflicted with seizures.\n\nIn the tent next door, Viscard\u2019s self-proclaimed street kids \u2014 two women who are not blood family but rely on her for support \u2014 live as well. One is pregnant, and Viscard says they are both worried after having to recently fight off a man who was trying to get into their tent. They use a generator to charge their electronic devices.\n\nThe group is squeezed between shrubs on the wrong side of a fence behind a Denny\u2019s and near Netflix\u2019s headquarters off Sunset Boulevard. Viscard came here after being kicked out by police from a nearby underpass. Here, she thought, authorities would be less likely to bother her.\n\n\u201cThey want me to be out of sight and out of mind. But then they come and throw away our stuff,\u201d Viscard says.\n\nMichael Dodson. 46, sits in his tent perched on a steep embankment along the 101 Freeway in Hollywood. Dodson has been homeless for 10 years and lived in this spot for two weeks. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was young. Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times\n\nNearby, Michael Dodson built his tent on an even steeper embankment that leads down to the highway\u2019s offramp. He has managed to find a flattened patch of dirt to build a home for him and his tent mate, Anthony Caplos, 43.\n\nDodson said that despite carving steps into the dirt, he has taken his share of falls down the slope, though he has escaped serious injury. Dodson uses disinfectant to clean his tent and clothes and asks Caplos to pass him something.\n\n\u201cHe has no clue what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Dodson says, smiling as the unceasing roar of traffic fills his ears.\n\nDodson has been homeless for 10 years and lived in this spot for two weeks. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was young. Recently he kicked heroin, but now he uses meth, acid and marijuana to quell his mood.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone, not even myself,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a life I would\u2019ve wanted to have lived, but it\u2019s time to deal with it.\u201d\n\nA few days later, police show up to kick Viscard out. A sanitation crew clears their former homestead. Dodson manages to avoid detection because his tent, while in a more precarious spot, is also better hidden.\n\nAs he tosses bags into the back of his truck, a sanitation worker laments his daily routine. It\u2019s a sort of Whac-a-Mole with the homeless, he said. You clean up one encampment, and there\u2019s always another one.\n\n\u201cWe got homeless on the freeway, homeless on the streets. We have homeless people everywhere,\u201d he says before driving off.\n\nThe Los Angeles River\n\nRobin \"Country\" Boatner, 60, moves his belongings to higher ground while rain caused the LA River to flood his encampment which lies on an island near Atwater Village. Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times\n\nAs the Los Angeles River bends toward downtown, lush islands appear in the middle of the occasionally rushing waters. This area of the river, the Glendale Narrows, is teeming with wildlife.\n\nMallards lounge on rocks and ducks lazily float along. In the river\u2019s earthen center, thick reeds and palm trees make clearings on the islands hard to see from a nearby bike path. But for years, these sandbars have been a habitat for homeless men and women.\n\nMelissa Millner descended 12 years ago on this tent encampment that floods out when it rains. She shares her spacious area with Tyrone Hart. In a nearby clearing Robin Boatner \u2014 who goes by \u201cCountry\u201d \u2014 also makes his home.\n\nThey\u2019re a tightly knit group, sharing everything: food, gas, drugs. Whatever anyone needs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not homeless, I\u2019m an outdoorsman,\u201d Hart says in early September as he carries a pool float toward the onrushing water.\n\nHis tent sits right on the bank, and a cool breeze wafts through it. Hart said he has lived by the river 13 years and has been homeless for 20. He finds the location relaxing, he says, as he prepares to jump into the lime green raft and floats down the river.\n\nMillner compares the L.A. River encampment to being on Gilligan\u2019s Island, without the desire to be rescued by outsiders. She said it\u2019s \u201ckind of perfect at night time when people aren\u2019t acting like asshats.\u201d\n\nA homeless man stands in the rain at the L.A. River near Atwater Village.

(Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe homeless here say that as long as they stay away from the bike paths, police tend to leave them alone.\n\nRain, on the other hand, is a problem. When it comes \u2014 and in Southern California that can be very infrequently \u2014 the community of homeless people has probably no more than half an hour to grab their most valuable belongings and escape.\n\nOften helicopters are dispatched to rescue people who are stranded in the trees as the water rushes by.\n\nLater in the fall, after reading a report about coming rain and getting a visit from police, the group decides to move their camp to higher ground.\n\nThere, a small camp stove allows them to make pancakes, and the smell of syrup and butter briefly overcomes the smell of trash. Boatner has a solar panel to charge his phone and Millner\u2019s laptop. At 60, he feels set in his ways. He\u2019s tried to get clean at the Weingart Center on skid row a couple of times, but the ritual never sticks.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me a bit on the inside that I know I could be more,\u201d Millner says. \u201cWhen you get to my age, you don\u2019t change that much. So I\u2019m gonna stay here until I die. My remains will float down the river.\u201d\n\nTyrone Hart, 56, rafts down the L.A. River, where he has lived for 13 years. \"I'm not homeless; I'm an outdoorsman,\" Hart said. Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times\n\nWithout a Home They\u2019re part of the Los Angeles streetscape, as familiar as the swaying palm trees and idling traffic, living under freeways, alongside riverbeds and on canyon hillsides. The mentally ill, the drug addicts, the economically disadvantaged, many with their life belongings in a backpack or shopping cart. Here, The Times launches Without a Home, a special endeavor to examine a crisis of homelessness in our region. It is a challenge for each and every one of us. Citizens voted twice to open their wallets to fund a solution. Now, city leaders and others must act to improve the plight of some 58,000 of the county\u2019s most vulnerable residents.

    "text": "During severe winter storms, Cold Springs Creek above Montecito turns into a torrent of mud, uprooted trees and shed-size boulders as it drains three square miles of sheer mountain front.\n\nThe only thing protecting the people, homes and businesses below is a low dam that the Army Corps of Engineers built in 1964 at the mouth of the creek\u2019s canyon, forming a basin between the steep banks to catch the crashing debris.\n\nOver the decades, the basin filled up with sediment and grew thick with brush and trees.\n\nOver the years the Cold Springs Creek basin has repeated a cycle of filling and cleaning. By 2017, the basin was almost unrecognizable. (Google maps, UC Santa Barbara Library)\n\nFew officials gave much thought to the condition of the old structure \u2014 or to that of the 16 other basins built along the mountains\u2019 edge from Santa Barbara to Carpinteria \u2014 until the Thomas fire last December left the slopes bare and vulnerable to rapid erosion. On Jan. 9, a storm unleashed mudslides that ravaged Montecito, killing 23 people, destroying 130 homes and causing hundreds of millions in damage.\n\nAn eight-month Times investigation found that government officials did not heed decades-old warnings to build bigger basins that could have made the mudslides far less catastrophic \u2014 and that Santa Barbara County failed to thoroughly empty the existing basins before the disaster, drastically reducing their capacity to trap debris.\n\nThe 101 Freeway is closed as mud and debris clog the roadway at the Olive Mill Road overpass in Montecito January 10, 2018, after a rainstorm sent mud and debris roaring through neighborhoods.

(Los Angeles Times, Santa Barbara County Fire Department)\n\nCounty flood control officials and the Army Corps had known for half a century that there were too few catchments and that the ones they had were far too small to stop the enormous debris flows that the Santa Ynez Mountains were prone to produce.\n\nSources: California Stormwater BMP Handbook, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Nextzen, OpenStreetMaps (Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn 1969, the Corps\u2019 district engineer for the region, Col. Norman E. Pehrson, issued a dire warning to the county about the Montecito area.\n\n\u201cThe danger of loss of life and the menace of public health is great,\u201d said a memo summarizing Pehrson\u2019s conclusions five years after the Cold Springs Creek basin and five others were built in 1964.\n\nThe catchment on Cold Springs Creek \u2014 about the size of a Little League baseball field \u2014 has a 16-foot high dam with a culvert at the bottom to let water and mud pass through. It was designed to stop 20,000 cubic yards of debris.\n\nBut even after it was cleared out in 2005, the basin still only had two-thirds of its capacity, a county survey indicated. During a major mudflow, that reduction would enable 7,000 cubic yards of storm debris that could have been trapped to flow into Montecito. (A cubic yard is about the size of a washing machine.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only the Cold Springs Creek basin that had shrunk, according to records included in a 231-page county report on state of the flood control system, published online six months before the January disaster. Altogether, the 11 catchments surveyed had only 44% of their designed capacity.\n\nBut neither the flood control agency nor the community was worried. In documents released to The Times \u2014 in response to a public records request seeking all communications or records about the condition of the basins \u2014 no officials remarked that the catchments were more than half full with sand and rocks.\n\nAt the time, the mountains were stable, covered in thick chaparral.\n\nThen last December, the fire came.\n\n::\n\nMontecito clings to a sliver of coastline against the Santa Ynez Mountains that abruptly rise 4,800 feet above the Pacific. The semirural small-town atmosphere, the ocean views and proximity to Los Angeles have made it a haven for Hollywood celebrities and the ultrawealthy \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres, Jeff Bridges, Natalie Portman and on and on.\n\nBut the instability of the slope has always made living there risky in the long term. The Army Corps began analyzing the debris threat in Santa Barbara and Montecito in 1964 as more people moved into the region.\n\nThat September, the Coyote Fire burned 65,000 acres above the towns, and with winter rains on the horizon, flood control engineers acted swiftly. Crews started building six basins \u2014 including the one for Cold Springs Creek. To avoid the state permitting required for larger dams, and with limited time and money, the Army Corps capped the barriers at 20 feet high.\n\nThe weather didn\u2019t wait for them to finish. A storm rolled in on Nov. 9, 1964.\n\nJesse M. Williams, a foreman working on the Cold Springs Creek basin, had just given orders to a Caterpillar operator digging out the channel when he looked up the canyon.\n\n\u201cTo my horror, I saw a mud and log flow about 3 feet high approaching down the channel at approximately 15 mph,\u201d he recounted in a Corps report.\n\nWilliams ran up the side of the bank. The Cat operator spotted the mud surrounding his equipment, leaped out and ran with Williams. The mud rose over the top of the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWe were running for our lives,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe mudflow roared down the creek, and its boulders and trees clogged the culvert under Hot Springs Road, diverting the debris down Olive Mill Road following the freeway overpass over U.S. 101.\n\nThe basins, built at a total cost of $860,000, were intended to be preliminary measures; the Army Corps was planning to construct a more comprehensive system.\n\nThe California Dept. of Water Resources, in summing up a confidential report from the Corps in 1965, noted the structures were designed for the level of flooding that could be expected every 10 years on average, but would be overwhelmed during severe storms.\n\n\u201cConsidering the possibility of future fires in the area and the high rate of debris production in the watershed, the capacity of the debris basins should be increased \u2026,\u201d the state water agency concluded.\n\nThe agency implored county zoning and flood control officials to limit development in vulnerable areas and to put in place a strict regimen to keep the basins emptied. (While the Corps built the catchments, the county owns them and is responsible for their maintenance.) But building continued in the flood zones by the creeks, and the county did not allocate money to properly clean the basins.\n\nIn 1968 the Army Corps noted \u201ca lack of adequate maintenance for the removal of the sediment buildup\u201d at the Cold Springs Creek basin and two others.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o flooding in January 1969 made it clear that the military engineers had vastly underestimated the amount of debris the mountains could produce. Boulders crashed through homes along Romero and San Ysidro creeks, and 70 residences were destroyed.\n\n\u201cComputed damages did not contemplate complete destruction of homes by debris,\u201d wrote Pehrson of the Army Corps.\n\nCounty Supervisor George Clyde and the manager of the flood control district at the time, Jim Stubchaer, lobbied Congress for more money to study the potential destruction from these creeks when a heavy storm follows a fire.\n\nBut a devastating oil spill off the Santa Barbara coast just weeks after the flooding changed the political climate, triggering opposition not just to more offshore drilling, but to any project viewed as threatening the natural environment. Plans for big debris basins or concrete storm channels suddenly faced strong push-back from the community.\n\nIn February 1971, an engineer with the U.S. Forest Service, Mike Rebar, surveyed Cold Springs Creek and its tributaries high in the Los Padres National Forest. Rebar proposed 30 to 50 low dams going all the way up the canyons \u2014 compared to one in the entire watershed today.\n\nBut seven months later, the Romero fire erupted east of Montecito and shifted priorities toward Carpinteria. The Corps focused on the immediate danger below the burn zone, building seven small basins.\n\nWith little community or political will to pressure the Army Corps to build more basins, the main creeks threatening Montecito receded into their oaken tranquility.\n\nJim Stubchaer, 88, former San Barbara County flood control district chief, at Romero Canyon Creek debris basin, said he didn't have the budget to regularly clean out the basins. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Jim Stubchaer, 88, former San Barbara County flood control district chief, at Romero Canyon Creek debris basin, said he didn't have the budget to regularly clean out the basins. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn recent interviews with The Times, Stubchaer, 88, said locals did not trust the Corps because the agency did not consult the public about its projects. He noted that the USDA Soil Conservation Service, working with residents and community leaders, managed to build a giant debris basin in 1977 with a 60-foot-high dam on Santa Monica Creek just east of Montecito, above Carpinteria.\n\nCleaning the county\u2019s basins was difficult. With inadequate budgets, Stubchaer recalled, workers would simply shovel the sediment to the side, clearing a narrow channel so water could reach the dam\u2019s culvert and continue down the creek.\n\nAt a county board of supervisors meeting in 1987, residents railed for 90 minutes against Stubchaer\u2019s crews chain-sawing trees and plowing brush in the waterways, according to the Santa Barbara News Press. A Sierra Club member said it was time for him to stop his \u201cnefarious activities.\u201d The creeks, she said, \u201care not his private preserves to do as he pleases.\u201d\n\nWhen he left the agency in 1989, Stubchaer knew the channels and aging debris basins were not adequate for large floods.\n\nChannels once proposed to be widened to 70 feet mostly span just 16 to 32 feet today, according to a private engineering report conducted for a citizens group this year.\n\nThe only catchment added in 47 years in Montecito was a very small basin built in 2002 on Montecito Creek, below where the worst damage had historically occurred.\n\nOther regions with similar debris problems have been more proactive. After mudslides killed more than 41 people and demolished 146 homes in the Montrose area in 1934, Los Angeles County urged the Army Corps to build basins to protect the foothill communities of the San Gabriel Mountains. Today, there are 119 debris basins countywide, with 17 of them bigger than 100,000 cubic yards.\n\nOf the 17 basins in Santa Barbara County, only one is that large \u2014 the one above Carpinteria.\n\nBy 2016, the fear of serious flooding in Montecito was so low that Santa Barbara County agreed to remove five of the basins, including Cold Springs, to comply with a federal requirement to provide habitat and passage for southern steelhead trout. The dams blocked the fish\u2019s passage to potential spawning areas.\n\nIn June 2017, the county released its plan to take down those five catchments by 2026.\n\nSix months later, the massive 281,000-acre Thomas fire roared through every watershed above Montecito and Carpinteria, burning deep into the rainy season in late December. The threat of catastrophic erosion loomed as county crews cleared out the debris basin at Cold Springs Creek and four others.\n\nMany of the catchments were packed with river cobble and coarse sand, leaving less room to hold back the debris \u2014 despite county policy that they be emptied whenever they became 25% full.\n\nTom Fayram, the deputy director of public works, alerted state emergency officials and the Army Corps that the county needed help cleaning out basins and creek channels before the first storm of the rainy season. He feared that Montecito and Carpinteria could be in the direct path of a major mudslide.\n\n\u201cAs it is Dec. 10, we have precious little time,\u201d he wrote to Col. Kirk E. Gibbs, the commander of the district. \u201cWe all need to work extremely fast. The watersheds burned were almost totally burned so our assumption is worst case.\u201d\n\nStarting on Dec. 21, crews worked for two days and took a three-day break over Christmas. They worked for three days, took a four-day break over New Years and resumed for three more days, wrapping up by Jan. 5. Dump trucks took more nearly 1,200 loads to an out-of-commission landfill on Foothill Road. Fayram reported that the catchments were \u201ccleaned out.\u201d\n\nBut the work was only done in five of 11 basins below the burned section of the mountain front. And county officials said they didn\u2019t have the original Army Corps designs to guide them. At Cold Springs Creek, a big portion of the basin was not dug out \u2014 a third of the dam\u2019s length was buried under sediment and vegetation. On top of that span, an 18-year-old oak grows. Historic aerial photos showed the county last emptied that area in 1969.\n\nAfter the excavation, a county surveyor, Scott Brichan, set out to calculate the capacities of the basins. Brichan\u2019s findings, which were not released to the public at the time, might have unsettled residents.\n\nOf Montecito\u2019s three main basins, he reported to the flood control district, Romero Canyon\u2019s had a capacity of 7,821 cubic yards, compared to a design capacity of 27,000. There was no explanation why the number was so low.\n\nSan Ysidro\u2019s basin had a volume of 6,112 cubic yards, compared to its design of 11,000, he wrote. If correct, this meant that even after digging out an estimated 3,000 cubic yards of material, the basin remained 44% full.\n\nThe January storm came before Brichan surveyed Cold Springs Creek.\n\nFayram, the deputy public works director, said that the surveys were wrong or misleading, insisting the Montecito basins were emptied to their full original capacity. On Romero Canyon\u2019s reported capacity, he said there was \u201cno way\u201d it was more than two-thirds full before the storm.\n\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s flat out wrong.\u201d\n\nHe did not respond to questions about why the numbers would have been off, and why they have not been corrected. The surveyor, Brichan, declined to comment.\n\n\u201cI guess I never considered that anyone could, or would ever, question the completeness of our work,\u201d Fayram wrote to The Times in March.\n\nAfter several exchanges, the county\u2019s attorneys advised Fayram and other flood control officials not to speak with The Times. Questions were referred to a county spokeswoman, Gina DePinto. She didn\u2019t address the surveyor\u2019s numbers but said: \u201cIt\u2019s very simple, and we have said many times, they cleaned out what was actually present.\u201d\n\nIn one internal email before the clean-outs, Fayram assured a county supervisor he would \u201cminimize the amounts\u201d of sediment brought to the landfill on Foothill Road, which was in her district. It was the only place trucks took the excavated material.\n\nWith a Pineapple Express storm forecast for the night of Jan. 8, county officials issued mandatory evacuations \u2014 but only in the neighborhoods closest to the mountains, north of East Valley Road, even though many communities outside that area were in greater danger. FEMA had long ago mapped flood zones along the creeks all the way to the ocean.\n\nResidents had no idea of the devastation that the Santa Ynez Mountains could let loose in a major storm after a fire. They expected water or mud damage at worst, especially those living far from the rugged canyons. They put sandbags across their driveways and plywood across their front doors.\n\nFew considered how the giant sandstone monoliths adorning yards and parks arrived there; or that the gentle slope they lived on was the product of violent rock-and-mud flows that had taken place periodically over thousands of years.\n\nThe creeks they knew were mostly tame, even in the wet season, gurgling along, feeding the aquifer and the wildlife and the gnarl-armed oaks that gave the area its natural allure.\n\nThe Johnson family loved the wildlife \u2014 the hawks, rabbits and bobcats \u2014 in the mostly dry streambed behind their home. They lived two miles below the Cold Springs Creek basin on a relatively flat stretch of Olive Mill Road, twice as close to the ocean than to the canyons. They never saw mountain boulders as a threat.\n\nThe Johnsons were in a voluntary evacuation zone, and with the rain coming, Berkeley \u201cAugie\u201d Johnson recalled that he was mainly worried the creek might get high and water might seep into the house. So he stacked two rows of sand bags in front of his doors before sitting down to dinner. He watched Alabama beat Georgia in the college football championship and went to bed.\n\nThe storm rolled in after midnight and at 3:30 dropped 0.66 inches of rain in just 15 minutes. The downpour was more intense than anyone predicted, breaking records.\n\nFast-moving mud and ash picked up the sandstone boulders and burned trees and surged down the mountain. Within half an hour, the basins were overflowing. Mud gushed over the dams on Cold Springs and San Ysidro creeks with such velocity that it fractured both dams in places and coated nearby trees 30 feet high.\n\nA Montecito freeway sign sits in mud on Highway 101.

(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBelow its basin, Cold Springs Creek joins another stream to form Montecito Creek, which runs through the center of town. The debris quickly clogged up bridge culverts, then spilled into the same neighborhoods flooded in 1964 and 1969.\n\nJohnson woke up to the heavy rain and walked outside to check new gutters on his roof. He looked a few hundred yards up the creek and saw foliage rustling hard \u2014 in little wind. Trees started falling as if they were being slapped down. A low rumbling vibration grew louder.\n\nHe squinted to see better. Blurry movement in the distance sharpened into a mass of boulders, logs and metal rolling toward him, more like an avalanche than a flood.\n\nAs he ran inside, his back wall imploded, mud raced in and rose to his waist. He rushed upstairs where his wife, 13-year-old daughter and 20-year-old son had gone to sleep just in case the downstairs bedrooms got flooded.\n\nThe house groaned from the force of debris pushing against it, wood beams cracked, windows exploded. Boulders had ripped away the master bedroom without a trace, and he feared the second floor above it would cave in. The family crawled onto the roof.\n\nJohnson stood by his chimney in disbelief. A 30-foot cylindrical tank floated by spewing gas, and boulders thudded against the house, tearing it away piece by piece.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we put up those sand bags, Dad,\u201d his son deadpanned.\n\nThroughout Montecito, the deluge obliterated concrete landscape walls and wiped away cars and houses, sweeping up more wreckage as it rushed to the ocean, two to three miles from the mountains. People living on high ground blocks from the destruction woke up thinking there was an earthquake.\n\nAs it had in 1964 and 1969, debris followed Olive Mill Road down to U.S. 101, crossed an overpass, spilling over the sides, and emptied into the Pacific.\n\nBy daybreak, Montecito Creek had taken 17 lives. Four more were killed by San Ysidro Creek debris flows. Two others died on Romero and Hot Springs creeks. Bodies were found more than a mile from their homes.\n\nSeventeen of the 23 deaths happened outside of the mandatory evacuation zone.\n\nThe Johnsons survived, but their house was destroyed.\n\nAt sunrise, residents far from the disaster zone saw strange rain ruts running straight down the mountains \u2014 a rare glimpse of the immense hydrogeological forces that created the foothills and coastal plain they lived on.\n\nNo one, not even county officials, could fathom the destruction.\n\nThe consequences of decades of inaction were starkly drawn: In Carpinteria, no one died, and no homes were lost, because of the giant basin the USDA built 41 years ago on Santa Monica Creek.\n\n\u201cIt really saved Carp from untold misery, probably not that different from what Montecito had,\u201d Fayram told a local online news site, Coastal View.\n\n::\n\nWith the mountainsides still bare, Montecito remains in danger. The U.S. Forest Service predicted that the Cold Springs and San Ysidro watersheds would see three to four times their normal peak flows during heavy storms until 2028.\n\nSignificant parts of the dam and basin at Cold Springs Creek are still buried.\n\nA view of Cold Springs Creek Basin from before and after the Montecito mudslides. (Google maps)\n\nPatrick McElroy, a Santa Barbara city fire chief who retired in March, started a nonprofit with wealthy investors to study the ongoing risk and team up with the county and three engineering firms to prevent another catastrophe.\n\nThe Partnership for Resilient Communities has been calling for emergency measures, including a debris monitoring system and 14 removable steel-hoop retention fences at points along the creeks in Montecito. The group is privately raising $5 million to buy and install the nets and scrambling to get the necessary permits. Once the vegetation grows back, McElroy said, the fences would be removed.\n\nHe was hoping to have them installed before the rains hit, but is still trying to get them permitted by the county.\n\nA Colorado engineering firm hired to review his group\u2019s plans and convince regulatory agencies of the danger noted that the rain that occurred Jan. 9 was rare, but not unprecedented. Storms with twice the intensity hit the county in 1998 and 2015 when the mountains were not bare.\n\nMcElroy added that federal climatologists are predicting January 2019 will have a 70% chance of El Ni\u00f1o conditions, which normally bring above-average rains.\n\n\u201cUrgent action is needed to protect life and property in Montecito from the impacts of future debris flows,\u201d the Colorado engineers wrote in June.\n\nThat month, county officials filed papers to request FEMA funding to fortify and expand the basins at Cold Springs, San Ysidro and Romero creeks in the next two years. The county would also acquire property to build one additional basin each on San Ysidro and Montecito creeks by 2022.\n\nThe hard-hit areas are still disaster zones, with mud lines marking walls and eaves of ruined houses. A small number of residents are starting to rebuild, often in the same spot. Some, not all, are raising the building pads of their new houses.\n\nAlison Hardey, 56, a Montecito cafe owner who has lived there and in neighboring Carpinteria her whole life, wonders if people are once again falling into a state of willful amnesia.\n\nAlison Hardy hikes among the boulders exposed at the Cold Spring Creek December 4, 2018.

    "text": "Standing before dozens of his fellow Central American migrants, Walter Coello raised a megaphone to his lips and made an urgent plea.\n\n\u201cI need four valiant women and four valiant men to help me,\u201d the 41-year-old Honduran told the crowd. He wanted to form a committee of volunteers to organize cleaning and security duties, and to fact-check rumors that were sowing fear and confusion.\n\n\u201cNo one has information here. The days are passing us by and we aren\u2019t doing anything, compa\u00f1eros.\u201d\n\nIt was a sunny December afternoon, nearly two weeks after 2,500 migrants had moved into their latest home, El Barretal, an abandoned concert venue turned government shelter 30 minutes from the U.S. border, and a month since thousands of members of a roving caravan began streaming into this stressed border city.\n\nSome are determined to cross into the United States as soon as possible. The Mexican government says it has helped an additional 1,100 migrants return to their home countries. Others have taken jobs in local factories, or are trying to scrape together a few pesos by selling food or clearing rubble at construction sites while biding their time.\n\nFor those who remain, their chances of legally entering the U.S. diminished this week after the Trump administration and Mexico\u2019s government announced Thursday that immigrants seeking asylum in the U.S. will be forced to wait in Mexico while their cases are reviewed \u2014 a process that can often take well over a year.\n\nSo as authorities in both countries continue to debate policy with no long-term solution in sight, many migrants are hunkering down for months, or possibly years, in a purgatory of makeshift accommodations and spotty services.\n\nCoello, who said he\u2019d organized committees of migrants along the entire caravan route, has focused on helping resolve the day-to-day issues that arise when hundreds of men, women and children are packed into close quarters with old pipes and little privacy or security. Toilets are clogged. Showers are inoperable. Belongings disappear from tents when people leave to hunt for work.\n\nAnxiety and misinformation spread quickly here. Some residents say that government workers have pilfered donations and that certain people get priority access to the handouts. Others buzz about false reports that the United States is letting migrants in to work temporarily. Coello said it\u2019s hard to keep people informed without reliable internet access or regular updates from officials.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said, the humanitarian arm of Mexico\u2019s immigration services agency hasn\u2019t distributed donations of clothes, shoes, tents and blankets because officials wanted to ensure that the items would go to those in need and not be resold. Going forward, he believes, the migrants must fend more for themselves.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just pass the time eating,\u201d said Coello, who plans to stay in Mexico with a humanitarian visa and find work as a mechanic to support his wife and two daughters back home. He said he\u2019d been deported three times from the U.S., most recently in November 2017 after being stopped at an immigration checkpoint in California, where he was working the grape harvest near Bakersfield.\n\n\u201cIf we want to achieve something we\u2019re going to do it peacefully, just like the Haitians did,\u201d he said, referring to a 2016 influx of more than 3,000 Haitian refugees who settled in Tijuana after failing to enter the United States. \u201cThe struggle is ours together.\u201d\n\nFor all its challenges, El Barretal is a step up from the migrants\u2019 previous abode, the Benito Ju\u00e1rez Sports Center, which was shut down early this month because of what local authorities euphemistically called \u201cbad sanitary conditions.\u201d\n\nEl Barretal consists of a patchwork of individual and family tents \u2014 many covered by large white plastic canopies \u2014 and a separate indoor area housing families with young children.\n\nFrancisco Rueda G\u00f3mez, general secretary for the state of Baja California, told local news outlets that the immigration agency has leased the space at 100,000 pesos a month for seven months. The Mexican military operates multiple mobile kitchens there, and nearly 500 police maintain security, Rueda G\u00f3mez said.\n\nThe Red Cross operates another tent offering electrical outlets so people can charge their phones or borrow one to make a free call. Children and teens can hang out under supervision in a gated \u201ckids corner.\u201d Volunteers offer additional hot meals, some dishing up food out of the trunks of their cars.\n\nResidents have added their own touches. White sheets serving as privacy dividers push political messages. One depicts a U.S. flag and the words \u201cAmerican dream.\u201d Another, painted with a Canadian flag, implores, \u201cI am still waiting for your response\u201d and \u201cLet your dreams be bigger than your fears.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials said that Barretal will cost 100,000 pesos a month to rent.

The 22-year-old from Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n, Honduras, waited three weeks to get a work permit before landing a job in the meat section at Casa Ley, a supermarket within walking distance of the shelter. Madrid Moreno likes Tijuana and plans to stay. People have treated him well, and he already has a girlfriend.\n\n\u201cTruthfully, what we all want is to get to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now having found work, I feel more hopeful and encouraged.\u201d\n\nOther migrants have concluded that although Mexico isn\u2019t the promised land, it\u2019s their best bet for now.\n\nAt a job fair run by the Mexican government, a line with dozens of migrants snaked outside Proyecto Salesiano, a center run by Catholic missionaries. Trade groups have said several thousand jobs are available, though wages tend to be low.\n\nGerson Madrid Moreno, 22, of Honduras, who received a Mexican humanitarian visa, found work at Casa Ley supermarket near El Barretal. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times\n\nOnce inside, applicants learned that they could receive work permits by applying for a one-year humanitarian visa or asylum. A few companies, including a call center and a meat-processing plant, set up booths to field potential employees.\n\nFederal officials said 3,700 people have applied for work permits and more than 900 have been distributed \u2014 the vast majority to migrants from the \u201cNorthern Triangle\u201d of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.\n\nSuKarne, a local pork processing plant, had 33 openings at a starting salary of 1,600 pesos (about $80) per week. As of last week, 11 migrants had accepted jobs, though most were still waiting for their work permits to arrive.\n\nA few yards from the SuKarne booth, Madeline Rivera sat down to rest her achy body after fixing a clerical error with her 5-year-old daughter Gissell\u2019s humanitarian visa paperwork.\n\nDuring a health checkup at the Benito Ju\u00e1rez shelter two weeks earlier, the Honduran mother found out she was nearly three months pregnant. She\u2019d planned to find work in a clothing factory, but now that the abdominal cramps have started, she isn\u2019t so sure.\n\nRivera was No. 1,421 in line to present her asylum case before U.S. authorities. Her ex-boyfriend, a gang member, had beaten her when she was pregnant with their first child, a girl now 10 years old who remains in Honduras. Rivera said he\u2019d threatened to kill her after she told him she didn\u2019t want to get back together.\n\nBut, like many other migrants hoping for asylum, she didn\u2019t have evidence for her claims. She said she\u2019d saved threatening messages on her old phone, but it had fallen into a bucket of water on the journey to Tijuana and was ruined.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t let me in, I\u2019ll stay here in Tijuana,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t return to Honduras.\u201d\n\nRivera was one of the few lucky migrants with somewhere to stay other than the shelter. Her best friend, Mari, was already living in Tijuana when Rivera arrived with the caravan.\n\nBut Rivera\u2019s welcome wasn\u2019t entirely warm. After a neighbor complained to the owner of the apartment complex where Mari had lived for three years, the owner told Mari, \u201cIf you have people living there who came with the caravan, it\u2019s best that you leave,\u201d Rivera said. They had to find a new place by the following week.\n\nOthers fear that prejudice and resentment against them is breaking out into violence. Earlier this week, Mexican police said two people threw a canister of tear gas into the family section of El Barretal. Police also arrested two men and a woman on suspicion of killing two Honduran teenagers last weekend. Authorities said the teens, whose bodies were dumped in a Tijuana alley, weren\u2019t targeted for being caravan members.\n\nThough most were glad to leave the Benito Ju\u00e1rez sports complex, more than 300 remained for three weeks camped outside the shuttered facility with a backdrop of the U.S. border. Those who\u2019d stayed said El Barretal was too far away. Tijuana police forced them to vacate Thursday morning, informing them they were committing several infractions by living in the public right of way.\n\nPablo Maroquin of El Salvador approaches a car looking for day labor near the Benito Juarez Sports Center, formerly used as a migrant shelter, in Tijuana. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times\n\nOn a street corner one block from the complex, migrants had gathered early every morning to wait for work. Some days, vans pulled up at 8 a.m. and again at 9 a.m. seeking a handful of laborers to clear rubble at construction sites. Other days the vans never showed up, and the dejected migrants drifted back to their tents to figure out another way to pass the hours.\n\nOne recent morning before the area was vacated, residents slowly emerged from clumps of ragged tents to brush their teeth and search for breakfast. Reggaeton blasted from loudspeakers. Children wiped the sleep from their eyes. Three men carrying brooms walked through the camp with a megaphone, barking, \u201cLet\u2019s start cleaning!\u201d\n\nOn the corner of 5 de Mayo Avenue and S\u00e1nchez Ayala Street, Alberto Osorio, 25, and his family sold hot coffee, instant soup, sweetbreads and other Salvadoran foods from their stand underneath a thin white tarp. The clan had scraped together $60 to buy a portable stove and propane tank to start their small business.\n\nBack home in Zacatecoluca, an hour south of the capital of San Salvador, Osorio\u2019s mother ran a pupusa stand to support her husband and two children. But it wasn\u2019t enough to pay the rising extortion fees of local gangs. \u201cYou don\u2019t sleep and you don\u2019t live in peace,\u201d Osorio said. \u201cIt was like living a nightmare.\u201d\n\nThe family learned of the caravan through Facebook and TV. They heard it would get them to Los Angeles. The way Osorio sees it, the caravan got them close enough.\n\nThe Trump administration has made a practice of limiting the number of asylum seekers allowed to enter the U.S. each day at ports of entry. Osorio\u2019s family is No. 1,653 in line to apply for asylum. Each number represents 10 people.\n\n\u201cWe want to be there,\u201d he said, smiling and nodding north.\n\nCecilia Sanchez of The Times\u2019 Mexico City bureau contributed to this report.\n\nandrea.castillo@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @andreamcastillo"

    "authors": [
      "Abbie Vansickle",
      "Manuel Villa"
    ],
    "text": "When California lawmakers unveiled a plan in 2011 to reduce the number of inmates in state prison, officials in San Joaquin County thought the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse.\n\nThere were already signs that a recent dip in crime might be coming to an end in this Central Valley county east of San Francisco. Homicides were up by nearly 40% from the previous year. And in the midst of a financial crisis, the county and local cities were laying off police officers and prosecutors.\n\nNow the county would have to quickly absorb an influx of nearly 1,000 released prisoners.\n\n\u201cWe were super concerned,\u201d said Stephanie James, the county\u2019s probation chief. \u201cIt was such a significant number that were coming out of prison who were at a high risk to commit a violent offense.\u201d\n\nThe California Experiment This is one of an occasional series examining the impact of recent justice measures aimed at reducing incarceration. It is a collaboration between the Los Angeles Times and the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news outlet.\n\nAs they braced themselves, county officials set up a system of collaborative courts to help former prisoners find jobs, housing and treatment for mental health and addiction problems. They pioneered a program that uses sophisticated risk assessments rather than cash bail to decide which defendants were safe to release before trial. And local officials launched an array of novel anti-crime programs, including one aimed at building trust between police and residents and another that gives stipends to young people considered at risk of committing gun violence.\n\nWhat happened next surprised many.\n\nWhile overall crime in California increased slightly after 2011, San Joaquin County\u2019s dropped 20% \u2014 and hit a decades-old low last year. The county\u2019s jail, which had been under court-ordered monitoring because of dangerous overcrowding, now has empty beds. Participation in specialized drug courts has increased and recidivism among newly released offenders has dropped.\n\nStockton Police Officer Jason DiGiulio had been a patrol officer for about 15 years before he signed up to work with San Joaquin County's collaborative courts. Max Whittaker / For the Marshall Project\n\nIt is unclear how much of the county\u2019s success is the result of its new programs rather than other factors, such as hiring more officers once the county\u2019s finances improved. But San Joaquin County has become an intriguing model for other counties curious about what might work in an era of criminal justice reform.\n\nEmissaries from Yuba County have drawn inspiration from its educational programs for offenders. A Kern County judge came to examine an alternative court and spoke highly of the collaborative court model to local leaders in Bakersfield. And after the governor signed sweeping legislation this year eliminating cash bail for pretrial defendants, dozens of counties sent representatives to learn how San Joaquin County adopted a similar approach years earlier.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\n\u201cI was very impressed,\u201d said Ken Williams, a probation supervisor in Yuba County, who toured San Joaquin County\u2019s day reporting center, which provides job training and life skills to former prisoners.\n\nSan Joaquin County officials acknowledge there is more to do. Although the county\u2019s crime rate has been cut almost in half since the mid-2000s, it remains among the highest in the state. And most of that reduction was in property crime, not violent offenses, which increased in the last few years before dipping slightly in 2017.\n\nBut San Joaquin County offers useful lessons in how a county struggling with poverty and crime has adapted to \u2014 and embraced \u2014 recent criminal justice reforms.\n\nStockton Police Officer Jason DiGiulio searches the home of a collaborative court client who has been accused of violating probation.

(Max Whittaker / For the Marshall Project)\n\nWith a population of about 745,000, San Joaquin County is a largely rural, agricultural area. The landscape is dotted with cherry and apple orchards, fields of grape vines and tomatoes, and giant, boxy shipping warehouses that have sprouted in recent years.\n\nIts largest city, Stockton, has some of the dirtiest air in the nation and routinely makes lists of the worst places to live in the United States. Poverty is out in the open. Tents line a nearly empty canal a few blocks from downtown. Empty storefronts line the streets, many with hopeful \u201cavailable\u201d banners.\n\nAfter a housing boom abruptly ended in the 2008 financial crisis, Stockton became the largest U.S. city to declare bankruptcy. The number of officers in the city\u2019s police department shrank by more than 20%. In Stockton, the police union put up signs around town: \u201cWelcome to the 2nd most dangerous city in California: Stop laying off cops!\u201d\n\nIn 2011, California lawmakers passed Assembly Bill 109, known as \u201crealignment,\u201d which shifted responsibility for thousands of people convicted of nonviolent crimes from state prisons to counties. People convicted of nonviolent crimes would now serve sentences in county jails, not prison, and local communities, rather than state parole, were responsible for supervising them upon release.\n\nAs part of AB 109, the state promised to shift billions of dollars to the counties. San Joaquin County decided to use its money \u2014 about $6.8 million in the first year \u2014 on its day reporting center; specialty courts aimed at helping former prisoners transition back to the community; and expanded use of a risk assessment tool to rank each former inmate\u2019s likelihood of committing new crimes.\n\nStockton is the largest city in San Joaquin County. With some of the dirtiest air in the nation, the city routinely makes lists of the worst places to live in the United States. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe county tracked data on each person affected by the new laws. James said she noticed the vast majority of arrests of former prisoners were for property crimes. To her relief, the county\u2019s homicides fell by nearly 50% in 2013.\n\nStockton\u2019s police chief, Eric Jones, credits the recent crime drops, at least in part, to a transformation in the city\u2019s policing strategy. Stockton is one of six cities in the country chosen as part of a federally funded project called the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice.\n\nDuring the project, which began in 2015, Stockton police officers have undergone training on how to limit racial and other types of bias and met with community members to discuss bias and how to avoid it.\n\nRepresentatives from law enforcement, probation, the courts, the district attorney\u2019s office, the public defender\u2019s office and social service agencies meet monthly to examine data on arrest rates and discuss how to help newly released inmates so they don\u2019t reoffend.\n\nOnce the financial outlook improved, Jones was able to increase his department\u2019s ranks \u2014 as were other local law enforcement agencies. After dipping to a low in 2011 of 866 sworn officers, the county added nearly 150 more officers by 2017.\n\nLocal politics have also changed. After a scandal in the mayor\u2019s office, voters selected 26-year-old Michael Tubbs, a Stockton native, Stanford University graduate and the city\u2019s first black mayor.\n\nTubbs, who first decided to run for office after his cousin\u2019s murder, has championed a number of experiments aimed at improving public safety and reducing poverty, including one that offers local families $500 a month in donated cash, no strings attached.\n\n\u201cCrime has always been issue No. 1, but the narrative in this city is one about being a second-chance city,\u201d Tubbs said.\n\nJudge Richard A. Vlavianos, left, opens the gate for probationer Danny Batts during a collaborative court session in Stockton. Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times\n\nLeading the court\u2019s initiatives is Judge Richard Vlavianos, a former prosecutor who says he \u201cprobably sent more people to prison for drug offenses than any other D.A. in this county\u201d before he joined the bench in 1999.\n\nAs a judge, Vlavianos began doubting whether long prison sentences for drug crimes improved public safety.\n\n\u201cYou start to see people coming back over and over and over, and you see that something is not working,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you see their kids coming to court, and you really see it\u2019s not working.\u201d\n\nVlavianos wondered if the courts could function more like a hospital emergency room.\n\n\u201cAll of the people coming in have injuries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe job of the court is to screen, assess and refer. Because we\u2019re never going to get a behavior change if we don\u2019t address what\u2019s bringing them in.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, he began experimenting with alternative sentencing courts aimed at connecting people with services such as housing, employment and substance abuse treatment, in addition to handling their criminal cases. He started with drunk drivers. When he saw recidivism drop, he added more courts.\n\nThere are special courts for people who violate the rules of their state supervision under the new law and for people convicted of nonviolent felonies no longer requiring time in state prison. At any given time, about 1,500 people are enrolled in the collaborative courts, which last year accounted for about 7% of new case filings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the ER right there,\u201d Vlavianos said, before going onto the bench on a recent afternoon.\n\nJudge Richard A. Vlavianos, center, asks probationer David Vieira if everything is going well for him during a collaborative courts session in Stockton. Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times\n\nA woman in orange jail scrubs stood up, clearly agitated. She said she had a mental illness and missed her court dates because she was in and out of the hospital. The judge, glasses resting on the tip of his nose, looked at her calmly.\n\n\u201cI need you to take a deep breath,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to have a plan before I release you.\u201d He asked a case worker to talk with her.\n\nVlavianos turned to a burly bald man with a mustache who had missed a meeting with a probation officer. The man said he\u2019d had a hard time getting around because he relied on buses.\n\n\u201cI need your help,\u201d the judge said. \u201cI keep trying to keep you out of jail, and you keep putting yourself back in.\u201d\n\nHerbert Finton Jackson Jr., 45, had been in and out of state prison and under supervision for years when he landed in Vlavianos\u2019 court about three years ago. The judge noticed him struggling with his drug addiction and Jackson was placed in a residential treatment center.\n\nJackson finished his formal supervision and now has a job selling housewares at Macy\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThat court turned my whole life around,\u201d he said.\n\nThe judge uses a strategy based on research that found a few days in jail is enough to disrupt problematic behavior, but that people kept in jail for longer periods get comfortable and are more likely to later reoffend.\n\nIn his court that handles more hardened offenders, Vlavianos said he noticed a 40% drop in violations this year after he reduced the time of jail stays for scofflaws and required more intense supervision.\n\nDefendants who flout Vlavianos\u2019 rules can expect a knock on their door from Jason DiGiulio, one of two Stockton police officers assigned to work with the judge.\n\nTall and stocky with short-cropped hair, DiGiulio is hardly a liberal reformer. He blames Proposition 47, the 2014 ballot initiative that reduced sentences for drug and some minor theft offenses, for making it harder to arrest shoplifting suspects. Under the law, thieves now have to steal more than $950 worth of goods \u2014 up from $400 \u2014 before they can be charged with a felony.\n\nBut he has warmed to his role bringing people directly to Vlavianos, not jail, so the judge can quickly find out why scofflaws are violating the rules.\n\nStockton Police Officer Jason DiGiulio looks at photos of people whom he needs to bring back to court. Max Whittaker / For the Marshall Project\n\nOn a hot morning in late summer, DiGiulio flipped through a clipboard of mugshots in his patrol car. At any given time, he is looking for roughly 50 to 75 people.\n\nHe pulled up to a white bungalow with a well-manicured lawn. A woman who answered said the man the officer was looking for lived in an apartment in the basement, but that she hadn\u2019t seen him in days.\n\nIt took a few weeks before DiGiulio was able to bring the missing man to court, where Vlavianos ordered him to meet with a probation officer.\n\nAbout three months later, DiGiulio said, the man had earned a spot on what the judge calls \u201cthe A Team,\u201d an honor roll of sorts for the collaborative courts.\n\n\u201cJail or prison is needed,\u201d DiGiulio said. \u201cBut if you send an alcoholic or a drug addict to prison, when they get out, they will still have the addiction. You\u2019ve got to find them at just the right point, and you wear them out.\u201d\n\nThis article was published in partnership with the Marshall Project, a nonprofit newsroom that reports on the criminal justice system.

    "text": "During severe winter storms, Cold Springs Creek above Montecito turns into a torrent of mud, uprooted trees and shed-size boulders as it drains three square miles of sheer mountain front.\n\nThe only thing protecting the people, homes and businesses below is a low dam that the Army Corps of Engineers built in 1964 at the mouth of the creek\u2019s canyon, forming a basin between the steep banks to catch the crashing debris.\n\nOver the decades, the basin filled up with sediment and grew thick with brush and trees.\n\nOver the years the Cold Springs Creek basin has repeated a cycle of filling and cleaning. By 2017, the basin was almost unrecognizable. (Google maps, UC Santa Barbara Library)\n\nFew officials gave much thought to the condition of the old structure \u2014 or to that of the 16 other basins built along the mountains\u2019 edge from Santa Barbara to Carpinteria \u2014 until the Thomas fire last December left the slopes bare and vulnerable to rapid erosion. On Jan. 9, a storm unleashed mudslides that ravaged Montecito, killing 23 people, destroying 130 homes and causing hundreds of millions in damage.\n\nAn eight-month Times investigation found that government officials did not heed decades-old warnings to build bigger basins that could have made the mudslides far less catastrophic \u2014 and that Santa Barbara County failed to thoroughly empty the existing basins before the disaster, drastically reducing their capacity to trap debris.\n\nThe 101 Freeway is closed as mud and debris clog the roadway at the Olive Mill Road overpass in Montecito January 10, 2018, after a rainstorm sent mud and debris roaring through neighborhoods. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Al Seib / Los Angeles Times Firefighters successfully rescued a 14 yr old girl after she was trapped for hours inside a destroyed home in Montecito on Jan. 9. (Mike Eliason / Santa Barbara County Fire Department) Sheriffs deputies carry a body from the debris near Hot Springs Road in Montecito. (Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times) A rainstorm sent mud and debris roaring through neighborhoods in Montecito, killing 23 people and prompting rescue and evacuation efforts. (Los Angeles Times, Santa Barbara County Fire Department)\n\nCounty flood control officials and the Army Corps had known for half a century that there were too few catchments and that the ones they had were far too small to stop the enormous debris flows that the Santa Ynez Mountains were prone to produce.\n\nSources: California Stormwater BMP Handbook, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Nextzen, OpenStreetMaps (Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn 1969, the Corps\u2019 district engineer for the region, Col. Norman E. Pehrson, issued a dire warning to the county about the Montecito area.\n\n\u201cThe danger of loss of life and the menace of public health is great,\u201d said a memo summarizing Pehrson\u2019s conclusions five years after the Cold Springs Creek basin and five others were built in 1964.\n\nThe catchment on Cold Springs Creek \u2014 about the size of a Little League baseball field \u2014 has a 16-foot high dam with a culvert at the bottom to let water and mud pass through. It was designed to stop 20,000 cubic yards of debris.\n\nBut even after it was cleared out in 2005, the basin still only had two-thirds of its capacity, a county survey indicated. During a major mudflow, that reduction would enable 7,000 cubic yards of storm debris that could have been trapped to flow into Montecito. (A cubic yard is about the size of a washing machine.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only the Cold Springs Creek basin that had shrunk, according to records included in a 231-page county report on state of the flood control system, published online six months before the January disaster. Altogether, the 11 catchments surveyed had only 44% of their designed capacity.\n\nBut neither the flood control agency nor the community was worried. In documents released to The Times \u2014 in response to a public records request seeking all communications or records about the condition of the basins \u2014 no officials remarked that the catchments were more than half full with sand and rocks.\n\nAt the time, the mountains were stable, covered in thick chaparral.\n\nThen last December, the fire came.\n\n::\n\nMontecito clings to a sliver of coastline against the Santa Ynez Mountains that abruptly rise 4,800 feet above the Pacific. The semirural small-town atmosphere, the ocean views and proximity to Los Angeles have made it a haven for Hollywood celebrities and the ultrawealthy \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres, Jeff Bridges, Natalie Portman and on and on.\n\nBut the instability of the slope has always made living there risky in the long term. The Army Corps began analyzing the debris threat in Santa Barbara and Montecito in 1964 as more people moved into the region.\n\nThat September, the Coyote Fire burned 65,000 acres above the towns, and with winter rains on the horizon, flood control engineers acted swiftly. Crews started building six basins \u2014 including the one for Cold Springs Creek. To avoid the state permitting required for larger dams, and with limited time and money, the Army Corps capped the barriers at 20 feet high.\n\nThe weather didn\u2019t wait for them to finish. A storm rolled in on Nov. 9, 1964.\n\nJesse M. Williams, a foreman working on the Cold Springs Creek basin, had just given orders to a Caterpillar operator digging out the channel when he looked up the canyon.\n\n\u201cTo my horror, I saw a mud and log flow about 3 feet high approaching down the channel at approximately 15 mph,\u201d he recounted in a Corps report.\n\nWilliams ran up the side of the bank. The Cat operator spotted the mud surrounding his equipment, leaped out and ran with Williams. The mud rose over the top of the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWe were running for our lives,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe mudflow roared down the creek, and its boulders and trees clogged the culvert under Hot Springs Road, diverting the debris down Olive Mill Road following the freeway overpass over U.S. 101.\n\nThe basins, built at a total cost of $860,000, were intended to be preliminary measures; the Army Corps was planning to construct a more comprehensive system.\n\nThe California Dept. of Water Resources, in summing up a confidential report from the Corps in 1965, noted the structures were designed for the level of flooding that could be expected every 10 years on average, but would be overwhelmed during severe storms.\n\n\u201cConsidering the possibility of future fires in the area and the high rate of debris production in the watershed, the capacity of the debris basins should be increased \u2026,\u201d the state water agency concluded.\n\nThe agency implored county zoning and flood control officials to limit development in vulnerable areas and to put in place a strict regimen to keep the basins emptied. (While the Corps built the catchments, the county owns them and is responsible for their maintenance.) But building continued in the flood zones by the creeks, and the county did not allocate money to properly clean the basins.\n\nIn 1968 the Army Corps noted \u201ca lack of adequate maintenance for the removal of the sediment buildup\u201d at the Cold Springs Creek basin and two others.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o flooding in January 1969 made it clear that the military engineers had vastly underestimated the amount of debris the mountains could produce. Boulders crashed through homes along Romero and San Ysidro creeks, and 70 residences were destroyed.\n\n\u201cComputed damages did not contemplate complete destruction of homes by debris,\u201d wrote Pehrson of the Army Corps.\n\nCounty Supervisor George Clyde and the manager of the flood control district at the time, Jim Stubchaer, lobbied Congress for more money to study the potential destruction from these creeks when a heavy storm follows a fire.\n\nBut a devastating oil spill off the Santa Barbara coast just weeks after the flooding changed the political climate, triggering opposition not just to more offshore drilling, but to any project viewed as threatening the natural environment. Plans for big debris basins or concrete storm channels suddenly faced strong push-back from the community.\n\nIn February 1971, an engineer with the U.S. Forest Service, Mike Rebar, surveyed Cold Springs Creek and its tributaries high in the Los Padres National Forest. Rebar proposed 30 to 50 low dams going all the way up the canyons \u2014 compared to one in the entire watershed today.\n\nBut seven months later, the Romero fire erupted east of Montecito and shifted priorities toward Carpinteria. The Corps focused on the immediate danger below the burn zone, building seven small basins.\n\nWith little community or political will to pressure the Army Corps to build more basins, the main creeks threatening Montecito receded into their oaken tranquility.\n\nJim Stubchaer, 88, former San Barbara County flood control district chief, at Romero Canyon Creek debris basin, said he didn't have the budget to regularly clean out the basins. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Jim Stubchaer, 88, former San Barbara County flood control district chief, at Romero Canyon Creek debris basin, said he didn't have the budget to regularly clean out the basins. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn recent interviews with The Times, Stubchaer, 88, said locals did not trust the Corps because the agency did not consult the public about its projects. He noted that the USDA Soil Conservation Service, working with residents and community leaders, managed to build a giant debris basin in 1977 with a 60-foot-high dam on Santa Monica Creek just east of Montecito, above Carpinteria.\n\nCleaning the county\u2019s basins was difficult. With inadequate budgets, Stubchaer recalled, workers would simply shovel the sediment to the side, clearing a narrow channel so water could reach the dam\u2019s culvert and continue down the creek.\n\nAt a county board of supervisors meeting in 1987, residents railed for 90 minutes against Stubchaer\u2019s crews chain-sawing trees and plowing brush in the waterways, according to the Santa Barbara News Press. A Sierra Club member said it was time for him to stop his \u201cnefarious activities.\u201d The creeks, she said, \u201care not his private preserves to do as he pleases.\u201d\n\nWhen he left the agency in 1989, Stubchaer knew the channels and aging debris basins were not adequate for large floods.\n\nChannels once proposed to be widened to 70 feet mostly span just 16 to 32 feet today, according to a private engineering report conducted for a citizens group this year.\n\nThe only catchment added in 47 years in Montecito was a very small basin built in 2002 on Montecito Creek, below where the worst damage had historically occurred.\n\nOther regions with similar debris problems have been more proactive. After mudslides killed more than 41 people and demolished 146 homes in the Montrose area in 1934, Los Angeles County urged the Army Corps to build basins to protect the foothill communities of the San Gabriel Mountains. Today, there are 119 debris basins countywide, with 17 of them bigger than 100,000 cubic yards.\n\nOf the 17 basins in Santa Barbara County, only one is that large \u2014 the one above Carpinteria.\n\nBy 2016, the fear of serious flooding in Montecito was so low that Santa Barbara County agreed to remove five of the basins, including Cold Springs, to comply with a federal requirement to provide habitat and passage for southern steelhead trout. The dams blocked the fish\u2019s passage to potential spawning areas.\n\nIn June 2017, the county released its plan to take down those five catchments by 2026.\n\nSix months later, the massive 281,000-acre Thomas fire roared through every watershed above Montecito and Carpinteria, burning deep into the rainy season in late December. The threat of catastrophic erosion loomed as county crews cleared out the debris basin at Cold Springs Creek and four others.\n\nMany of the catchments were packed with river cobble and coarse sand, leaving less room to hold back the debris \u2014 despite county policy that they be emptied whenever they became 25% full.\n\nTom Fayram, the deputy director of public works, alerted state emergency officials and the Army Corps that the county needed help cleaning out basins and creek channels before the first storm of the rainy season. He feared that Montecito and Carpinteria could be in the direct path of a major mudslide.\n\n\u201cAs it is Dec. 10, we have precious little time,\u201d he wrote to Col. Kirk E. Gibbs, the commander of the district. \u201cWe all need to work extremely fast. The watersheds burned were almost totally burned so our assumption is worst case.\u201d\n\nStarting on Dec. 21, crews worked for two days and took a three-day break over Christmas. They worked for three days, took a four-day break over New Years and resumed for three more days, wrapping up by Jan. 5. Dump trucks took more nearly 1,200 loads to an out-of-commission landfill on Foothill Road. Fayram reported that the catchments were \u201ccleaned out.\u201d\n\nBut the work was only done in five of 11 basins below the burned section of the mountain front. And county officials said they didn\u2019t have the original Army Corps designs to guide them. At Cold Springs Creek, a big portion of the basin was not dug out \u2014 a third of the dam\u2019s length was buried under sediment and vegetation. On top of that span, an 18-year-old oak grows. Historic aerial photos showed the county last emptied that area in 1969.\n\nAfter the excavation, a county surveyor, Scott Brichan, set out to calculate the capacities of the basins. Brichan\u2019s findings, which were not released to the public at the time, might have unsettled residents.\n\nOf Montecito\u2019s three main basins, he reported to the flood control district, Romero Canyon\u2019s had a capacity of 7,821 cubic yards, compared to a design capacity of 27,000. There was no explanation why the number was so low.\n\nSan Ysidro\u2019s basin had a volume of 6,112 cubic yards, compared to its design of 11,000, he wrote. If correct, this meant that even after digging out an estimated 3,000 cubic yards of material, the basin remained 44% full.\n\nThe January storm came before Brichan surveyed Cold Springs Creek.\n\nFayram, the deputy public works director, said that the surveys were wrong or misleading, insisting the Montecito basins were emptied to their full original capacity. On Romero Canyon\u2019s reported capacity, he said there was \u201cno way\u201d it was more than two-thirds full before the storm.\n\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s flat out wrong.\u201d\n\nHe did not respond to questions about why the numbers would have been off, and why they have not been corrected. The surveyor, Brichan, declined to comment.\n\n\u201cI guess I never considered that anyone could, or would ever, question the completeness of our work,\u201d Fayram wrote to The Times in March.\n\nAfter several exchanges, the county\u2019s attorneys advised Fayram and other flood control officials not to speak with The Times. Questions were referred to a county spokeswoman, Gina DePinto. She didn\u2019t address the surveyor\u2019s numbers but said: \u201cIt\u2019s very simple, and we have said many times, they cleaned out what was actually present.\u201d\n\nIn one internal email before the clean-outs, Fayram assured a county supervisor he would \u201cminimize the amounts\u201d of sediment brought to the landfill on Foothill Road, which was in her district. It was the only place trucks took the excavated material.\n\nWith a Pineapple Express storm forecast for the night of Jan. 8, county officials issued mandatory evacuations \u2014 but only in the neighborhoods closest to the mountains, north of East Valley Road, even though many communities outside that area were in greater danger. FEMA had long ago mapped flood zones along the creeks all the way to the ocean.\n\nResidents had no idea of the devastation that the Santa Ynez Mountains could let loose in a major storm after a fire. They expected water or mud damage at worst, especially those living far from the rugged canyons. They put sandbags across their driveways and plywood across their front doors.\n\nFew considered how the giant sandstone monoliths adorning yards and parks arrived there; or that the gentle slope they lived on was the product of violent rock-and-mud flows that had taken place periodically over thousands of years.\n\nThe creeks they knew were mostly tame, even in the wet season, gurgling along, feeding the aquifer and the wildlife and the gnarl-armed oaks that gave the area its natural allure.\n\nThe Johnson family loved the wildlife \u2014 the hawks, rabbits and bobcats \u2014 in the mostly dry streambed behind their home. They lived two miles below the Cold Springs Creek basin on a relatively flat stretch of Olive Mill Road, twice as close to the ocean than to the canyons. They never saw mountain boulders as a threat.\n\nThe Johnsons were in a voluntary evacuation zone, and with the rain coming, Berkeley \u201cAugie\u201d Johnson recalled that he was mainly worried the creek might get high and water might seep into the house. So he stacked two rows of sand bags in front of his doors before sitting down to dinner. He watched Alabama beat Georgia in the college football championship and went to bed.\n\nThe storm rolled in after midnight and at 3:30 dropped 0.66 inches of rain in just 15 minutes. The downpour was more intense than anyone predicted, breaking records.\n\nFast-moving mud and ash picked up the sandstone boulders and burned trees and surged down the mountain. Within half an hour, the basins were overflowing. Mud gushed over the dams on Cold Springs and San Ysidro creeks with such velocity that it fractured both dams in places and coated nearby trees 30 feet high.\n\nA Montecito freeway sign sits in mud on Highway 101.

(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBelow its basin, Cold Springs Creek joins another stream to form Montecito Creek, which runs through the center of town. The debris quickly clogged up bridge culverts, then spilled into the same neighborhoods flooded in 1964 and 1969.\n\nJohnson woke up to the heavy rain and walked outside to check new gutters on his roof. He looked a few hundred yards up the creek and saw foliage rustling hard \u2014 in little wind. Trees started falling as if they were being slapped down. A low rumbling vibration grew louder.\n\nHe squinted to see better. Blurry movement in the distance sharpened into a mass of boulders, logs and metal rolling toward him, more like an avalanche than a flood.\n\nAs he ran inside, his back wall imploded, mud raced in and rose to his waist. He rushed upstairs where his wife, 13-year-old daughter and 20-year-old son had gone to sleep just in case the downstairs bedrooms got flooded.\n\nThe house groaned from the force of debris pushing against it, wood beams cracked, windows exploded. Boulders had ripped away the master bedroom without a trace, and he feared the second floor above it would cave in. The family crawled onto the roof.\n\nJohnson stood by his chimney in disbelief. A 30-foot cylindrical tank floated by spewing gas, and boulders thudded against the house, tearing it away piece by piece.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we put up those sand bags, Dad,\u201d his son deadpanned.\n\nThroughout Montecito, the deluge obliterated concrete landscape walls and wiped away cars and houses, sweeping up more wreckage as it rushed to the ocean, two to three miles from the mountains. People living on high ground blocks from the destruction woke up thinking there was an earthquake.\n\nAs it had in 1964 and 1969, debris followed Olive Mill Road down to U.S. 101, crossed an overpass, spilling over the sides, and emptied into the Pacific.\n\nBy daybreak, Montecito Creek had taken 17 lives. Four more were killed by San Ysidro Creek debris flows. Two others died on Romero and Hot Springs creeks. Bodies were found more than a mile from their homes.\n\nSeventeen of the 23 deaths happened outside of the mandatory evacuation zone.\n\nThe Johnsons survived, but their house was destroyed.\n\nAt sunrise, residents far from the disaster zone saw strange rain ruts running straight down the mountains \u2014 a rare glimpse of the immense hydrogeological forces that created the foothills and coastal plain they lived on.\n\nNo one, not even county officials, could fathom the destruction.\n\nThe consequences of decades of inaction were starkly drawn: In Carpinteria, no one died, and no homes were lost, because of the giant basin the USDA built 41 years ago on Santa Monica Creek.\n\n\u201cIt really saved Carp from untold misery, probably not that different from what Montecito had,\u201d Fayram told a local online news site, Coastal View.\n\n::\n\nWith the mountainsides still bare, Montecito remains in danger. The U.S. Forest Service predicted that the Cold Springs and San Ysidro watersheds would see three to four times their normal peak flows during heavy storms until 2028.\n\nSignificant parts of the dam and basin at Cold Springs Creek are still buried.\n\nA view of Cold Springs Creek Basin from before and after the Montecito mudslides. (Google maps)\n\nPatrick McElroy, a Santa Barbara city fire chief who retired in March, started a nonprofit with wealthy investors to study the ongoing risk and team up with the county and three engineering firms to prevent another catastrophe.\n\nThe Partnership for Resilient Communities has been calling for emergency measures, including a debris monitoring system and 14 removable steel-hoop retention fences at points along the creeks in Montecito. The group is privately raising $5 million to buy and install the nets and scrambling to get the necessary permits. Once the vegetation grows back, McElroy said, the fences would be removed.\n\nHe was hoping to have them installed before the rains hit, but is still trying to get them permitted by the county.\n\nA Colorado engineering firm hired to review his group\u2019s plans and convince regulatory agencies of the danger noted that the rain that occurred Jan. 9 was rare, but not unprecedented. Storms with twice the intensity hit the county in 1998 and 2015 when the mountains were not bare.\n\nMcElroy added that federal climatologists are predicting January 2019 will have a 70% chance of El Ni\u00f1o conditions, which normally bring above-average rains.\n\n\u201cUrgent action is needed to protect life and property in Montecito from the impacts of future debris flows,\u201d the Colorado engineers wrote in June.\n\nThat month, county officials filed papers to request FEMA funding to fortify and expand the basins at Cold Springs, San Ysidro and Romero creeks in the next two years. The county would also acquire property to build one additional basin each on San Ysidro and Montecito creeks by 2022.\n\nThe hard-hit areas are still disaster zones, with mud lines marking walls and eaves of ruined houses. A small number of residents are starting to rebuild, often in the same spot. Some, not all, are raising the building pads of their new houses.\n\nAlison Hardey, 56, a Montecito cafe owner who has lived there and in neighboring Carpinteria her whole life, wonders if people are once again falling into a state of willful amnesia.\n\nAlison Hardy hikes among the boulders exposed at the Cold Spring Creek December 4, 2018. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Alison Hardy hugs David Scharps, who survived staying in this home during the floods and fire as they hike among the exposed boulders at Cold Spring Creek.\u0094 (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Alison Hardy hugs David Scharps, who survived staying in this home during the floods and fire as they hike among the exposed boulders at Cold Spring Creek. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\n\nShe often hikes in the canyons above the debris basins. She loved climbing these great sandstone rocks as a girl. Now they give her a chill \u2014 they look like they\u2019re just \u201cwaiting to come down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou feel how enormous this thing was,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like ants against these mountains. We probably should have never been here to begin with.\u201d\n\nProduced by Swetha Kannan.\n\nGraphics: Lorena I\u00f1iguez Elebee, Swetha Kannan.\n\njoe.mozingo@latimes.com\n\n@joemozingo"

Those include houses, businesses, factories and other buildings, such as barns.\n\nSan Diego is second with more than 88,000 structures. Among the top 10 are Santa Clarita, Thousand Oaks and Glendale, along with the combined four cities of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, whose 23,000 structures are nearly all in the highest severity zone.\n\nThe total number at risk is probably higher, because the Microsoft database of building footprints employed in the analysis, among the most complete lists available, is not comprehensive.\n\nThe top spots Large clusters are found where cities run up against rocky terrain, such as where the Santa Monica Mountains bisect Los Angeles.

Paradise and Malibu were both among them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good feeling to look back on how we mapped Paradise \u2014 it\u2019s almost all red \u2014 and then having this event come through that validates the map,\u201d said Dave Sapsis, researcher with the state\u2019s Fire and Resource Assessment Program. \u201cWe\u2019ve really got to address this trend.

They do give notice to local agencies, insurance companies and residents, and they support requests for fire planning and mitigation grants.\n\nThe devastation of the last two fire seasons has raised calls for new development to be restricted in fire-prone areas \u2014 and even for prohibitions on rebuilding destroyed homes \u2014 but The Times\u2019 analysis highlights the scale of the threat that already exists.\n\nRecent wildfires have destroyed homes across the state, including Ventura, Malibu and Paradise. (Wally Skalij, Al Seib, Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAs persistent drought and the warming climate are making wildfire a more frequent and severe threat, the vast extent of vulnerable communities shows the need for action by state and local governments, and the communities themselves, to reduce the risk.\n\nNearly 60% of the state\u2019s at-risk structures are within the jurisdiction of incorporated cities or counties, placing the burden of preparing them on local fire departments, overwhelmingly in Southern California.\n\nThe maps should put communities on notice that they need to adapt to the certainty of fire, said Scott Ferguson, chairman of Topanga\u2019s emergency response group.\n\n\u201cIt keeps driving home that point that you have to take some extraordinary steps,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThere are a whole lot of things you have to do in your daily life to make yourself safer.\u201d\n\nAre you at risk? Search your address. The state\u2019s 8,900\n\nvery severe hazard zones are mapped below. Ben Welsh / Los Angeles Times Source: CalFire\n\nBeyond mapping the hazardous areas, the state does too little to address the causes of the risk, Halsey said.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed, he said, is legislation requiring a comprehensive plan for every high-severity hazard zone, including \u201ca retrofit plan, mitigation plan, evacuation plans, planning in terms of how to keep more dangerous houses from being built there.\u201d\n\nCurrent state law provides limited tools to reduce the vulnerability of fire-prone communities beyond the requirement for defensible space around homes. The state building code requires new homes in those areas to use fire-adapted materials and designs such as ember-resistant attic vents and fire-rated siding and roofs.\n\nBut it has no provision for upgrading existing homes, often built decades before the threat was identified and new standards were enacted.\n\n\u201cThis is the part that is hard about all of this,\u201d said Michael Jarred, policy consultant with the California Senate Office of Research. \u201cWe\u2019re adding a lot of requirements for new developments, but more time must be spent on figuring out what can be done for existing structures.\u201d\n\nNew laws adopted after last year\u2019s fires will require the state fire marshal to publish a catalog of low-cost retrofits and conduct a survey to identify communities like Paradise where evacuation routes would be inadequate in a disaster, Jarred said.\n\nLike the hazard maps, though, those laws will provide information but not require it to be acted upon.\n\nGiven the limitations, the onus for fire prevention largely falls on communities and the local fire agencies that serve them.\n\n\u201cGet the communities involved,\u201d Halsey said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult.\u201d\n\nAn aggressive town\u2019s approach\n\nTopanga Canyon is at the forefront of community self-help.\n\nBesides the emergency preparedness group, it has a volunteer Arson Watch, a Community Emergency Response Team of volunteers trained to assist the fire and sheriff\u2019s departments and a Fire Safe Council that over the years has obtained $350,000 in grants to improve fire preparedness.\n\nFlames race toward a home during the 1993 Topanga fire (Ken Lubas / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cImagine what would happen when a storm of embers hits, just thousands of matches being thrown at your house,\u201d Beth Burnam, co-director of the North Topanga Canyon Fire Safe Council, told an audience of 100 Topangans gathered at the community library. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to light? What\u2019s not going to light?\u201d\n\nThe council called the meeting shortly after the Woolsey fire, hoping to take advantage of the heightened state of alertness to promote its ember ignition assessment program.\n\n\u201cEverybody has a broom on their deck,\u201d Burnam said. \u201cWe talk to people [about] how to be prepared on a red-flag day: Get cushions off outdoor furniture, take doormats away. That\u2019s just like a broom. It just wants to ignite.\u201d\n\nThe L.A. way\n\nIn Los Angeles County, communities that want to confront their fire risk receive support through the Fire Department\u2019s Forestry Division.\n\nAssistant Chief J. Lopez works with city governments and resident groups in unincorporated areas, guiding them in the process of establishing fire safe councils, applying for fire prevention grants and learning how to recognize risk factors.\n\nIn Topanga, Lopez worked with residents on grant programs to identify and cut down trees that could impede evacuation if they caught fire.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time driving up and down our roads with J. Lopez, learned about what makes trees hazardous,\u201d Burnam said.\n\nThe county also has foresters who teach vegetation management.\n\n\u201cIt has to be the right plant in the right place,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cPalm trees are highly flammable. Same with eucalyptus and pine. We encourage the removal of that vegetation, but it also can be the overgrown bougainvillea on the deck.\u201d\n\nWill Buckley tries to extinguish flames and save his home during the Woolsey fire. (Patrick T. Fallon / For The Times)\n\nTo date, there are 25 fire safe councils in the county, some more active than others, Lopez said.\n\nDespite having 30 neighborhoods with 1,000 or more structures in the highest fire risk zone \u2014 led by Pacific Palisades with 9,300 and the Hollywood Hills with 6,100 \u2014 the city of L.A. has no counterpart to the county\u2019s Forestry Division.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Department spokesman Peter Sanders said the department holds numerous community meetings to discuss wildfire safety, brush clearance requirements and evacuation plans. In conjunction with the Los Angeles Police Department, it has recently conducted evacuation exercises in Brentwood and the Hollywood Hills.\n\nNone of the more than 150 local councils organized under the California Fire Safe Council are in the city, however.\n\nSanders said the agency does not participate in the program \u201cas it is primarily designed for more rural and often low-income communities and is usually paid for via grant funding.\u201d\n\nMeasured results\n\nBecause the Woolsey fire spared Topanga, there\u2019s no way of knowing how well its defenses would have performed in a fire.\n\nAs it was, the community had to adapt to the unexpected when the fire knocked out power several hours before the Sheriff\u2019s Department ordered a mandatory evacuation, meaning few residents would receive electronic notifications.\n\nSupport our journalism Become a subscriber today to support editorial writing like this.

The buffer allowed firefighters to deflect the 2009 Station fire and later protected the community from mudslides, Lopez said.\n\n\u201cNone of those homes were affected by the rains,\u201d Lopez said, \u201cbecause there were 18 acres that didn\u2019t burn.\u201d\n\nContact the reporters"

The state building code requires new homes in those areas to use fire-adapted materials and designs such as ember-resistant attic vents and fire-rated siding and roofs.\n\nBut it has no provision for upgrading existing homes, often built decades before the threat was identified and new standards were enacted.\n\n\u201cThis is the part that is hard about all of this,\u201d said Michael Jarred, policy consultant with the California Senate Office of Research. \u201cWe\u2019re adding a lot of requirements for new developments, but more time must be spent on figuring out what can be done for existing structures.\u201d\n\nNew laws adopted after last year\u2019s fires will require the state fire marshal to publish a catalog of low-cost retrofits and conduct a survey to identify communities like Paradise where evacuation routes would be inadequate in a disaster, Jarred said.\n\nLike the hazard maps, though, those laws will provide information but not require it to be acted upon.\n\nGiven the limitations, the onus for fire prevention largely falls on communities and the local fire agencies that serve them.\n\n\u201cGet the communities involved,\u201d Halsey said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult.\u201d\n\nAn aggressive town\u2019s approach\n\nTopanga Canyon is at the forefront of community self-help.\n\nBesides the emergency preparedness group, it has a volunteer Arson Watch, a Community Emergency Response Team of volunteers trained to assist the fire and sheriff\u2019s departments and a Fire Safe Council that over the years has obtained $350,000 in grants to improve fire preparedness.\n\nFlames race toward a home during the 1993 Topanga fire (Ken Lubas / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cImagine what would happen when a storm of embers hits, just thousands of matches being thrown at your house,\u201d Beth Burnam, co-director of the North Topanga Canyon Fire Safe Council, told an audience of 100 Topangans gathered at the community library. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to light? What\u2019s not going to light?\u201d\n\nThe council called the meeting shortly after the Woolsey fire, hoping to take advantage of the heightened state of alertness to promote its ember ignition assessment program.\n\n\u201cEverybody has a broom on their deck,\u201d Burnam said. \u201cWe talk to people [about] how to be prepared on a red-flag day: Get cushions off outdoor furniture, take doormats away. That\u2019s just like a broom. It just wants to ignite.\u201d\n\nThe L.A. way\n\nIn Los Angeles County, communities that want to confront their fire risk receive support through the Fire Department\u2019s Forestry Division.\n\nAssistant Chief J. Lopez works with city governments and resident groups in unincorporated areas, guiding them in the process of establishing fire safe councils, applying for fire prevention grants and learning how to recognize risk factors.\n\nIn Topanga, Lopez worked with residents on grant programs to identify and cut down trees that could impede evacuation if they caught fire.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time driving up and down our roads with J. Lopez, learned about what makes trees hazardous,\u201d Burnam said.\n\nThe county also has foresters who teach vegetation management.\n\n\u201cIt has to be the right plant in the right place,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cPalm trees are highly flammable. Same with eucalyptus and pine. We encourage the removal of that vegetation, but it also can be the overgrown bougainvillea on the deck.\u201d\n\nWill Buckley tries to extinguish flames and save his home during the Woolsey fire. (Patrick T. Fallon / For The Times)\n\nTo date, there are 25 fire safe councils in the county, some more active than others, Lopez said.\n\nDespite having 30 neighborhoods with 1,000 or more structures in the highest fire risk zone \u2014 led by Pacific Palisades with 9,300 and the Hollywood Hills with 6,100 \u2014 the city of L.A. has no counterpart to the county\u2019s Forestry Division.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Department spokesman Peter Sanders said the department holds numerous community meetings to discuss wildfire safety, brush clearance requirements and evacuation plans. In conjunction with the Los Angeles Police Department, it has recently conducted evacuation exercises in Brentwood and the Hollywood Hills.\n\nNone of the more than 150 local councils organized under the California Fire Safe Council are in the city, however.\n\nSanders said the agency does not participate in the program \u201cas it is primarily designed for more rural and often low-income communities and is usually paid for via grant funding.\u201d\n\nMeasured results\n\nBecause the Woolsey fire spared Topanga, there\u2019s no way of knowing how well its defenses would have performed in a fire.\n\nAs it was, the community had to adapt to the unexpected when the fire knocked out power several hours before the Sheriff\u2019s Department ordered a mandatory evacuation, meaning few residents would receive electronic notifications.\n\nSupport our journalism Become a subscriber today to support editorial writing like this.

The buffer allowed firefighters to deflect the 2009 Station fire and later protected the community from mudslides, Lopez said.\n\n\u201cNone of those homes were affected by the rains,\u201d Lopez said, \u201cbecause there were 18 acres that didn\u2019t burn.\u201d\n\nContact the reporters"

    "authors": [
      "Steve Lopez"
    ],
    "text": "The sky was tombstone gray last week when 200 people gathered to honor the lives of 1,457 people they did not know. It was L.A. County\u2019s annual ceremony marking the burial of unclaimed remains, and this year, a few dozen of the deceased were children.\n\nCounty records offered only minimal information about the deceased. Most of the children died the day they were born, others were several months old. Brian Elias, chief of operations for the L.A. County Medical Examiner-Coroner\u2019s department, told me some of the children were abandoned or born to transients who can\u2019t be tracked down. In other cases, there\u2019s a back and forth as parents try to raise funds for burial, and the county keeps remains for three years before going ahead with burials.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with families that have had difficulty with the combination of grief over losing a child and not having the resources for services,\u201d said Elias.\n\nWhen I left the ceremony, I called Magda Maldonado, director of Continental Funeral Home in East Los Angeles. She told me last year that roughly half her clients have trouble paying mortuary and cemetery costs, and many of them find that it\u2019s cheaper to fly bodies to Mexico for burial. Maldonado called me back on Thursday and said a family from La Puente had just lost a 10-year-old son and was planning a fundraiser to bury him.\n\nHector and Maria Torres and their daughter Jocelyn, 21, were remarkably composed when I met them at Continental on Friday morning, just 24 hours after the death of Matthew Isiah Torres. But that would not last.\n\nThe family had lived a relatively comfortable life, even if Maria\u2019s income as a hotel clerk and Hector\u2019s job driving trucks for a disposal company barely covered the bills. Everything changed in October of 2016.\n\n\u201cI went to school to pick up Matthew, and he was limping when he came out,\u201d said Maria, who figured her extremely active child had fallen or bumped into something.\n\nMatthew said he didn\u2019t know what was wrong and insisted he was fine. But the pain in his right knee didn\u2019t go away, so Maria took him back to the doctor for X-rays that showed an abnormality. After a biopsy a week later, Matthew, 8 at the time, found out he had bone cancer.\n\n\u201cOn my 40th birthday, he started chemotherapy and he fought very hard,\u201d said Maria, unable to hold back tears.\n\nA knee replacement was one option, but that would involve multiple surgeries and the disease might persist.\n\n\u201cEven as a baby, he was so independent and so strong,\u201d Jocelyn said of her little brother as her father fought tears.\n\nJocelyn, Hector and Maria Torres of La Puente at Continental Funeral Home in East L.A., making arrangements for Matthew Torres, who died this week at the age of 10 after two years with cancer. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe family asked Matthew what he wanted to do. He chose amputation.\n\n\u201cAs a mom, I wanted to see my baby whole,\u201d said Maria. \u201cI wanted to see him the way he was born, with two legs and a full life.\u201d\n\nMatthew said he didn\u2019t want to have to keep going back to the hospital and he stuck with his decision.\n\n\u201cWe are so blessed to be the parents of a very unique individual,\u201d said Maria.\n\nWhen she and her husband were working, before Matthew got sick, Jocelyn looked after her little brother.\n\n\u201cI was like his second mom, and ever since he was a baby he wanted to sleep in my bed,\u201d said Jocelyn. \u201cMom and Dad would work long hours and come home at 7, 8, 9 at night. I would get out of school and find my way to him, and he was my best friend.\u201d\n\nFive days after his amputation in early February of 2017, Matthew, whose sport was jujitsu, had to find new ways to stay busy. His mother bought him a remote control truck and his friend Junior from across the street would come play with him.\n\nA week after the amputation, a scan turned up cancer in Matthew\u2019s lungs. On his 9th birthday in July of 2017, he was in the hospital, completing chemotherapy treatment and celebrating with red velvet cake.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, the family\u2019s hopes rose. Matthew was recovering nicely and the cancer appeared to be in retreat. But three months later, it was back in his lungs. Matthew said he was not going to let the next round of chemo take his hair, so he took a pair of electric shears and shaved it off himself. This was not easy for him. He had thick dark hair and he took care to make sure to maintain it just so. On a video of the clip job, his nervous laugh can be heard.\n\n\u201cHe would not submit to cancer,\u201d said Maria. Always, he would take control.\n\nMatthew taught himself to swim and learned how to ride a bike with one leg. His buddy Junior kept coming to play with him, and the boys didn\u2019t let Matthew\u2019s illness get in the way of their fun.\n\n\u201cHe was optimistic the entire time. He never had a why-me phase and he never complained about anything,\u201d said Jocelyn.\n\n\u201cHe would always smile and laugh and make other people laugh, and he never felt sorry for himself,\u201d said Maria.\n\n\u201cAs difficult as this last year was for him, you would never be able to tell he was going through this torture,\u201d Jocelyn said, convulsing in tears.\n\nMaria quit work to care for Matthew full time and make doctor and hospital visits, and Jocelyn got a job at In\u2019N\u2019Out to help pay bills. Hector Torres kept working until two months ago, when he tore a knee ligament at work and went on disability. Hector\u2019s Kaiser plan covered the bulk of Matthew\u2019s medical bills, but the family\u2019s savings dwindled to nothing.\n\nEvery time Matthew got a scan, the cancer had spread. Lungs, hips, his other knee, his ankle. In September, it went to his brain and a tumor was surgically removed.\n\nThe family decided not to subject him to any more tests or hospital visits, and Matthew didn\u2019t ask why. In the last week, he called Junior to come play with him and the family heard the boys laughing in Matthew\u2019s room. He called Maria\u2019s godson over to watch a video with him and then they took a nap together.\n\nIt was grace and courage all the way the through. The brave little boy was quiet on Wednesday, and on Thursday morning, at 11:15, the suffering was over.\n\nOn Friday, while the family filled out paperwork at the mortuary, Magda Maldonado took me into her office and showed me a wall-board with the names of all the recent deceased. The list included 33 people who had been unclaimed by relatives, friends or anyone else this years. Hospice agencies had asked Continental to handle the bodies, and Maldonado said they were cremated and will be laid to rest in one of the upcoming annual county burials in Boyle Heights. She said 33 was the highest number ever for her mortuary in a single year.\n\nIn California, wealth and poverty coexist like nowhere else in the nation, and for far too many people, death brings yet another bill too big too handle. Maldonado said fundraisers are common among those who come through her door. They are determined not to let their loved ones pass \u2014 the old and young alike \u2014 without the dignity of proper burials.\n\nThe Torres family picked out and will pay for a $1,550 casket for Matthew. Hector Torres is the cousin of a man married to one of the Maldonados, and Continental will cover the mortuary costs. But the family was on the way to the cemetery Friday to make arrangements that may cost as much as $10,000, and the family is planning a food fest and silent auction to help cover the costs.\n\nJocelyn left college to help care for her little brother. She said that in the hospital, she was moved by how compassionate and helpful Matthew\u2019s nurses were, and she intends to become a pediatric oncology nurse. She left no doubt that she will be a good one.\n\nHector and Maria seemed to find some strength in talking about Matthew\u2019s embrace of life and his courage in facing death. They fought tears, but they smiled a lot too and held each other\u2019s hands.\n\nIn a week in which 1,457 poor souls were buried alone, but for the strangers who paid their respects, Matthew Isiah Torres was at least surrounded by family in his final hours.\n\nHe was known; he was loved; he will be remembered.\n\nGet more of Steve Lopez's work and follow him on Twitter @LATstevelopez"

    "text": "It was the best bad place.\n\nTo the south was a gun shop called Fins, Fur & Feather Sports, stocked with live ammunition. To the northeast, a propane yard. Across the street, a Fastrip gas station. All around, soaring, drought-crisp pines.\n\nAnd in the center? About 150 terrified people who had fled the ferocious Camp fire only to be stopped at the intersection of Skyway and Clark Road, forced to sit out the deadliest conflagration in California history.\n\nIn a parking lot. Surrounded by fuel. Barred from escape by roaring flames and roads that were choked, first with traffic, then abandoned vehicles, and, finally, with burned-out hulks of charred metal.\n\n\u201cAre we gonna die?\u201d volunteer firefighter Chris Rainey was asked, over and over again. His job that day was to keep the panicky crowd as calm as possible. His response each and every time: \u201cNo, you\u2019re not gonna die.\u201d\n\nDespite its obvious downsides, he told them, the parking lot was the safest place to be on Nov. 8, as flames raced through Paradise with astonishing speed, taking authorities and residents by surprise, snarling roads with evacuees, killing 88 people and counting.\n\nA complicated series of small decisions made by firefighters, law enforcement personnel, volunteers and evacuees themselves saved the people in the parking lot and hundreds of others \u2014 men, women and children who could not leave their burning neighborhoods and had to do what no one wants to do in a disaster.\n\nWait.\n\nThe Camp fire approaches the intersection of Skyway and Clark Road. (David Demaree) About 150 terrified people who tried to flee the Camp fire as it bore down on the town of Paradise, Calif., were stopped at the intersection of Skyway and Clark Road. (David Demaree) About 150 terrified people were trapped at Skyway and Clark Road as the Camp fire bore down on the town of Paradise. Resident David Demaree watched the inferno for hours from his truck. (David Demaree)\n\nCalin Moldovan, an engineer with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, had just started an 11-day vacation at his home in a Sacramento suburb when he awoke to a text message from his captain in Magalia, population 11,000 or so, tucked on a ridge in the Sierra Nevada north of Paradise.\n\nThe message bore a single image: a giant, billowing column of smoke.\n\nHow bad? Moldovan texted back.\n\nBad.\n\nSo the 34-year-old hopped into his Ford Fusion hybrid, raced through the Sacramento Valley and into the Sierra Nevada, tailing fire engines up the mountain on Clark Road, as residents fled in the opposite direction.\n\nWhen he arrived in Paradise, the winds were so strong that smoke could no longer billow up. Instead, it moved side to side, shrouding the town in a cloud so dark the sun was blotted out. It was 10:30 a.m.\n\nMoldovan whipped out his smartphone to document the otherworldly experience.\n\nAn hour later, the crush of cars at Skyway and Clark came to a standstill. The normally bustling Y-shaped intersection joins two of the main ways out of the town\u2019s northern tip.\n\nOn this morning, there was only silence \u2014 dozens of people waiting for cars to move. Flames were \u201csheeting across the road,\u201d he said. The fire\u2019s main flank approached from the east. Showers of embers ignited homes to the west.\n\nThe fire \u201cbasically became a noose that began to shrink,\u201d Moldovan said.\n\nCal Fire engineer Calin Moldovan and law enforcement officers evacuated 150 people from their cars and told them to shelter in a parking lot as flames from the Camp fire approached. The only two exit roads were on fire and clogged by abandoned cars. Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times\n\nThat\u2019s when he and several law enforcement officers made one of many decisions that would ultimately help save more than 100 lives.\n\nThe intersection was home to a new strip mall. Its parking lot was freshly poured concrete. Two metal-roofed buildings were under construction. At its edge was Optimo lounge, a nightspot known for live music, karaoke and Chinese food.\n\nThe sloping landscape embraced the mall, creating a kind of bowl shape. The fierce winds shot over the bowl, which kept burning embers mostly at bay.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean this was the safest place in the whole entire Paradise ridge,\u201d said Moldovan, the first full-time firefighter on the scene. \u201cIt just means that it was the safest place that we had access to at the time.\u201d\n\nAs the fire transformed trees into torches, Moldovan and the law enforcement officers shepherded evacuees out of cars and onto the concrete lot. Volunteers helped people in wheelchairs trundle over curbs. Others served as lookouts, monitoring flames that neared the strip mall\u2019s buildings and threatened the panicked crowd.\n\n\u201cDogs, cats and pets. People bringing suitcases,\u201d Moldovan recalled. \u201cPeople crying, people reverting in the fetal position and sleeping on the curb.\u201d\n\nOnly one thing will persuade someone who is stuck in a car near a propane yard as wind-whipped embers sail by to leave what seems like certain shelter for an open parking lot.\n\nBrutal honesty.\n\nOr as Butte County sheriff\u2019s Det. Jim Beller told holdouts on that terrible Thursday, \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t get out of your car, you\u2019re going to die. You need to have a building between you and the propane company.\u201d\n\nBeller persuaded one elderly man to escort his ailing wife away from the gridlock to the lot\u2019s relative safety. But the man came back. He\u2019d forgotten his wife\u2019s medication.\n\nWill she die without it? Beller asked. She might, the man responded.\n\nThe Camp fire rages through Paradise, Calif., where tens of thousands of people fled the fast-moving blaze on Nov. 8.

(Peter DaSilva / EPA/Shutterstock)\n\n\u201cIf she dies, I\u2019m not going to be able to live with myself,\u201d Beller thought. \u201cIf he goes to the car and dies, I'm not going to be able to live with myself. If I go to the car and get the medication and I die, I won\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nIt was one more bad choice in a day filled with them.\n\nBeller made his way carefully to the couple\u2019s car. He could hear the moan of gas from overheated propane tanks. He grabbed the medicine and ran back to the parking lot.\n\nThat\u2019s when a firefighter yelled at the top of his lungs to the crowd at Skyway and Clark that if they heard explosions they should not run. The last thing they needed was mass panic.\n\n\u201cIt sounded like war,\u201d Beller said. \u201cI was scared to death, but I was trying not to show it. Because they were all staring at us the whole time.\u201d\n\nThere was no water at Skyway and Clark.\n\nThe fire hydrants had all gone dry. Flames had consumed thousands of structures, exposing pipes and letting precious water drain away uselessly. The result was no water pressure anywhere in town.\n\nFire engines, which carry 500 gallons, had yet to reach the evacuees in their perilous redoubt, as the blaze raced ever closer.\n\nMoldovan got on his radio. They needed air drops and engines and anything that could keep them safe until they were able to leave the scorched ridge.\n\nParadise residents huddle in a strip mall parking lot until firefighters can ensure their safe exit.\n\nFinally, the first fire engine roared up Skyway, punching its way through a string of abandoned cars, opening an escape route. Firefighters on board told members of the group that, if they moved fast, the engine could escort 10 cars south at a time.\n\nMoldovan told dozens of people to prepare for a swift departure.\n\nTen minutes later, the first caravan was ready. Optimism soared.\n\nThen a second fire engine plowed up the hill. Its sides were scorched by flames.\n\nThe message its occupants carried was grim: \u201cDo not send anyone down,\u201d a firefighter said, \u201cbecause it will kill whoever we send in there.\u201d\n\nNot that the strip-mall-turned-temporary-refuge was all that much safer.\n\nDavid Demaree watched it for hours from the vantage point of his truck, which he had parked at Skyway and Clark and repositioned as the flames moved.\n\nThe 60-year-old thought about joining the evacuees who found shelter in the parking lot. But he couldn\u2019t juggle the cat carrier with Gatsby and Willow inside, while leading Fayla, his border collie-husky mix, and dragging two backpacks filled with memories: DVDs of his kids\u2019 early Christmases, his grandfather\u2019s 1919 Georgetown University yearbook.\n\nAs the fire closed in on the evacuees, he sometimes wondered if he\u2019d make it out, if he\u2019d ever see his wife, Kathy, again. \u201cI was ready at one point to drive through fire if I had to,\u201d he said. \u201cI was shook up. But you have to kind of keep yourself calm.\u201d\n\nSo he stayed. And he watched.\n\nDavid Demaree with his wife, Kathy, and dog, Fayla. Demaree thought about joining the evacuees at the parking lot but couldn't lead Fayla while juggling the cat carrier along with backpacks filled with memories. Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times\n\nFlying embers ignited a spot fire in the frontyard of a house directly across Skyway from the Optimo parking lot. Firefighters on site caught it early and extinguished it with hand tools. But as the flames roared from east to west, ever closer, the house itself caught on fire.\n\nThe engines were gone. They\u2019d left to help clear roads. There was nothing anyone could do.\n\n\u201cOne woman was standing on the side of the road, sobbing,\u201d said Paradise police Sgt. Rob Nichols. \u201cWe asked her to move. We didn\u2019t want her to get hurt.\n\n\u201cIt was her house burning.\u201d\n\nSarah Drummond could feel the heat blasting off the burning home. The air was thick with smoke. People were coughing. The scene was \u201creally intense and gloomy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe looks on people\u2019s faces, it was a saddening feeling in the whole area.\u201d\n\nDrummond is 19, a dietary aide at a local nursing home called Cypress Meadows Post-Acute. Buses that should have helped evacuate the facility were not allowed into the fire zone, so the patients were loaded into staff members\u2019 cars.\n\nA man in his 80s with dementia ended up in the back seat of Drummond\u2019s gray Ford Focus hatchback. In the front passenger seat was a woman in her late 60s, wearing a hospital gown and a diaper and hooked to an oxygen tank.\n\nThey left Cypress Meadows. And then, gridlock. Drummond flagged down a police officer to help her get the patients to the Optimo parking lot. They\u2019d driven less than a mile. But the road was choked with abandoned cars. The cruiser couldn\u2019t get anywhere close. Neither patient could walk.\n\nParadise police Sgt. Rob Nichols walks in front of a shattered pane of glass that was broken by authorities during the Camp fire, allowing evacuees to take shelter from the heat of the fire. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) Cal Fire Capt. Sean Norman made the order to break into the vacant stores at the Skyway and Clark Road intersection to shelter evacuees. He figured the stores could tolerate heat for 30 minutes to an hour before they started to burn.

(Lara Solt / For The Times)\n\n\u201cThe old woman was in a lot of pain,\u201d Drummond said. \u201cHer diaper was leaking on my passenger seat. We got her out of the car \u2026 She was saying, \u2018Ow!\u2019 And crying. I told the cops, you have to go easy on her ...They got the little old man out.\u201d\n\nThe patients were loaded into the police car, but it didn\u2019t have seats, Drummond said, and the officer was driving \u201cchaotically\u201d to get them around barriers as the fire bore down.\n\n\u201cThe little old residents were flopping around,\u201d she said. \u201cI was holding each of their hands so they wouldn\u2019t hit their heads. We got to the parking lot. We sat the old woman on a bucket.\u201d\n\nHer first words on getting to safety at Skyway and Clark: \u201cWhen are we going to eat? I need a sandwich.\u201d\n\nShe was diabetic and needed food to stabilize her blood sugar level. Nichols and Drummond walked through the crowd asking for food. Someone gave them cookies, a blanket and a Raiders ball cap to keep the old man\u2019s head warm.\n\nThen the house across the street ignited. Fire officials made yet another life-saving decision. They smashed a big pane of glass at the coffee shop under construction and shepherded the evacuees in.\n\nFrom inside the shop on the parking lot\u2019s edge, Drummond could feel the fire\u2019s heat. She began to cry. \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t make it out of here?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWhat if we end up getting stuck in this thing, this coffee shop, and it caught on fire?\u201d\n\nBut as the flames drew nearer, her panic subsided. The firefighters knew what they were doing, she figured. They were all going to be OK.\n\n\u201cI had a little string of faith in me,\u201d Drummond said.\n\nA massive plume of smoke from the Camp fire, burning in Feather River Canyon near Paradise, Calif. David Little / TNS\n\nMoldovan and Cal Fire Capt. Sean Norman, who ordered the break-in at Skyway and Clark, figured the strip mall\u2019s two unfinished buildings could tolerate heat for 30 minutes to an hour before they started to burn.\n\nIf the coffee shop ignited with evacuees inside, the men reasoned, the people could be moved to a different building. If that caught fire, everyone could head to the center of the parking lot again and huddle tightly together.\n\nIt was the kind of bet being made in pockets throughout Paradise. Some people waited out the fire in houses, and others in store parking lots where they prayed the asphalt expanses could keep the flames at bay.\n\nNorman was well aware of the danger. While driving toward the Optimo parking lot earlier in the day, he passed a car that had rolled and was engulfed in flames. A body was later found inside. He saw motorists abandoning burning cars and running toward a nearby Walgreens.\n\nEmbers were catching in people\u2019s hair, lighting it on fire. Evacuees ran past, badly burned, crying out for help.\n\n\u201cJust keep going to the Walgreens,\u201d Norman had shouted. \u201cThere\u2019s firefighters waiting down there for you.\u201d\n\nNorman told firefighters to break into the drugstore. Somewhere between 60 and 80 evacuees poured inside. Two fire engines were stationed to defend the building.\n\nHis order to the firefighters: \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t let this building catch on fire.\u201d\n\nThe flames hit Walgreens hard from two different directions. It had already torched homes and a gas station. Shopping carts, wooden pallets and shrubbery ignited.\n\nAbandoned vehicles blazed. Burning pine needles blew in the wind. Firefighters poured precious water on the Walgreens roof. Embers showered down. To Norman, it was an \u201curban firestorm.\u201d\n\nBurned-out abandoned cars sit on the road after the Camp fire moved through the area. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images\n\nWalgreens held, thanks to its concrete-block construction and the firefighters\u2019 efforts.\n\nSo did the parking lot at Skyway and Clark. As embers ignited a pine tree between the gun store and the coffee shop, fire engines finally returned.\n\nThey hosed down the tree. They sprayed water on Optimo, then stopped. They needed to save the scarce resource and focus on the gas station. Bulldozers cleared the road.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nThe parking lot\u2019s weary inhabitants were finally able to drive off by late afternoon. Drummond and the nursing home residents made it to safety. Demaree was reunited with his wife. Their house was destroyed.\n\nAs the last evacuees left, Optimo burned.\n\nRainey, the volunteer firefighter, was one of the last to go. It was a good decision to get the people out before night fell, he said, even though they had to drive through flames to get to safety.\n\nIt was 6 p.m. Night had fallen. Firetrucks were making their way up the hill. Reinforcements, he thought, finally.\n\nIt was a sight to see.\n\nA view of Skyway and Clark Road, facing south, after the fire.

    "text": "When his mother\u2019s health was declining, Dennis Hutson moved to Allensworth in California\u2019s Central Valley. The town, founded in 1908, was created on the principle that African Americans could own property, run their own town and live peacefully while pursuing the American dream. Population 471, the town is now just 5% African American.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of place where everyone knows everybody. Some cite the demographic shifts of African Americans moving to cities, and others the closure of the Allensworth railroad stop, for the economic downfall of the area. There is not even a service station or corner store in the town.\n\nDennis Hutson directs two farmworkers as they auger holes for trees to act as a windbreak on his farm. Gabriel Scarlett / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhen his mother, Nettie Mae Morrison, moved to Allensworth in 1979, Hutson began visiting. He was amazed by the poverty and lack of economic development. A Methodist preacher and Air Force chaplain, he said God spoke to him and told him to be a positive change in the community.\n\nDennis Hutson preaches to the small congregation at First Baptist Church in Pixley, Calif., in August. Gabriel Scarlett / Los Angeles Times\n\nSince then, he has purchased a 60-acre farm, hired several African American farm hands, and is now on his way to owning a sustainable, organic farm. In a country in which less than 2% of farmers are African American, Hutson hopes to provide a boost to this once-thriving town.\n\nHe is doing it to honor his late mother (\u201cthe unofficial mayor of Allensworth\u201d) and to provide economic opportunity for his African American brothers and sisters.\n\nAfter a morning of work on his farm and checking his fields' water levels in the evening, Hutson rests. His wife and most of his family live in Las Vegas. He jokes that all of his decades in the Air Force and tours around the world helped prepare him for this \u2014 his most remote posting. His wife plans to join him within a year, when the farm is more functional, and they will build a home.\n\nHutson points to a dike in his alfalfa fields. After the harvest, the process starts over and he floods the fields for several weeks. Gabriel Scarlett / Los Angeles Times\n\nHutson checks irrigation valves in his alfalfa fields. He could not recall any rainfall over the entire summer. Gabriel Scarlett / Los Angeles Times\n\nHutson rests at home after a long day in his fields. Gabriel Scarlett / Los Angeles Times\n\nIn the evening, Hutson drives to the edge of his farmland to visit his mother\u2019s grave.\n\n\u201cI think she would be very pleased and proud to see what we have done here,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that part of the reason that she hung on so long was because she wanted to see the progress here and that someone other than herself was working for this community.\u201d"

    "text": "Luz Rivas knew the two dozen fifth-grade girls sitting before her. Not by name, but by experience.\n\nShe once lived in tight spaces, shared homes, back houses, a garage. It was back in the 1980s, when she and her mother and sister would get squeezed out of one place, hear about another and start over again. It\u2019s still that way for children in the Pacoima neighborhood around Telfair Elementary, only more so.\n\n\u201cI hated that assignment in school when they asked you to draw your house,\u201d Rivas, 44, told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to draw a garage.\u201d\n\nRivas managed to overcome the disadvantages, and the path she followed began at Telfair. Now, three decades on, she was back at her old school, having gone to MIT and Harvard, having become an electrical engineer and then a member of the California Assembly.\n\nIt was here in fifth grade, Rivas told the students, that she discovered an interest in engineering while trying to figure out how to program an Apple IIe computer. So when she started a nonprofit called Do It Yourself Girls, an after-school tech program that has served more than 2,000 fifth- to 12th-grade students at 14 schools, Telfair got the first chapter.\n\n\u201cWhy did you decide to join DIY?\u201d Rivas asked the students.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to start my own DIY,\u201d one girl said with full authority. \u201cI thought it was not going to be that fun, but then we did the first project and I thought about it, and it was fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be an engineer like my sister,\u201d said another.\n\nCan it happen? Of course. Rivas rose up, and others will follow.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s more of a challenge now,\u201d said Trini Rodriguez, former Telfair student and cofounder of Tia Chucha\u2019s Centro Cultural and Bookstore in Sylmar. \u201cNo matter how hard you try to meet your needs, there\u2019s an obstacle instead of a bridge.\u201d\n\nMany of Telfair\u2019s students don\u2019t have computers or Wi-Fi connections at home.\n\nMany of the area\u2019s manufacturing and aerospace companies died years ago, giving way to minimum-wages and two-job hustles that stack crushing burdens on families.\n\nAnd for public schools in California, including Telfair, the golden age of full investment is a distant memory.\n\nAssemblywoman Luz Rivas visits Vaughn Next Century Learning Center in San Fernando, Calif. She founded Do It Yourself Girls, a nonprofit that serves 14 schools. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nIn populated urban areas, we don\u2019t like the state of our schools, and we\u2019ve spent years squabbling about what\u2019s wrong and how to fix them.\n\nWe make arguments for more charters, fewer charters, more resources, more accountability, more decentralization, more testing, more parental involvement, more curriculum overhauls, more repercussions for teachers who don\u2019t cut it. The Times recently reported that L.A. Unified Supt. Austin Beutner is considering a major realignment, with 32 separate school clusters, more local control and a smaller central bureaucracy.\n\nBut after decades of combat, we\u2019ve flunked consensus and compromise. Sure, schools can and should do better, but we\u2019ve unrealistically expected them to magically compensate for the burden of widening economic disparity.\n\nIn well-off communities, students tend to do pretty well.\n\nIn poor communities, they tend to struggle.\n\nIt\u2019s easy, from a distance, to look at disappointing test results and determine that a school is a failure.\n\nTelfair, admittedly, doesn\u2019t have a very good report card. It lags behind the district and state averages in student performance. When the most recent statewide test results came out, Telfair was up 2% in language arts and down 2% in math. In each subject, less than one-third of Telfair\u2019s students met or exceeded minimal standards as established by the state.\n\nBut those scores are less a measure of promise than of poverty.\n\nWhen you visit classrooms, when you go to the motels and garages where children live, when you get to know that the heaviest load isn\u2019t what\u2019s in their backpacks, when you learn that some teachers are working 10-hour days, tutoring students during recess and lunch and volunteering to run after-school clubs for no pay, you begin to realize it\u2019s not the schools that are failing \u2014 it\u2019s everything else.\n\nSociety, culture, politics, public policy. The economy is tilted, the hill is steep.\n\nIt was early September when I began visiting Telfair, which had more students classified as homeless than any other in Los Angeles Unified last year. A school at which virtually every student is poor enough to qualify for free and reduced-price meals.\n\n\u201cEvery year, we have to do more with less.\u201d Jose Razo, principal of Telfair Elementary School\n\nThe remarkable thing is how common that profile is in California, home to the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, happy hordes of 1-percenters and the highest rate of poverty in the nation when housing costs are considered. About one-fifth of the state\u2019s residents can\u2019t afford basic needs, according to the Public Policy Institute of California, and 45% of the state\u2019s children are poor or nearly so.\n\nA gaggle of researchers concluded in September that California students learn on par with students in other states, but many of them start far behind and never catch up. A lack of quality childcare and preschool education was cited, along with \u201ca poor record of identifying young children with disabilities.\u201d Latinos, African Americans, recent immigrants and foster children struggle the most, according to the research. Telfair, almost entirely Latino, hits three of those four categories.\n\n\u201cThe tests don\u2019t tell the whole story,\u201d Principal Jose Razo argued one day in his office. \u201cA test looks at one day in the life of one kid at one particular time, and if that kid is hungry that day, or tired that day, or slept in his car, or his mom had an argument with his dad who left the day before, that\u2019s not a true assessment.\u201d\n\nPrincipal Jose Razo sets a high bar for students at Telfair Elementary School. Because many of them live in wrenching poverty, he and his staff work long hours and offer after-school programs to instill a sense of \u201cganas\u201d: the desire for a better home and a better life.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t making excuses. Razo, as much as anyone, wants his district and his school to do better, and he wants his students to believe they\u2019re on track to go to college. Telfair is draped in the banners of universities from all over the country.\n\nBut as Luz Rivas put it, Telfair lacks some of the basics that existed when she was a student there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not investing in the students early enough,\u201d she said, \u201cand I think of these things as a legislator now. When I was here, there was a full-time nurse and when you were sick, you went to the nurse. It was a given. The library was open every day and it had a librarian.\u201d\n\nTrained librarians gave way to library aides years ago, then to locked doors, with books kept in a vault \u2013 beyond the reach of students who need extra stimulation, not less.\n\nFifth-grade teacher Maria Alvarez told me her students get just one hour of library time each week. She said she got a note from the part-time nurse advising her not to send students her way unless there\u2019s a significant problem, and Razo said he and other staff often take on first-aid duties.\n\nTelfair tries to compensate with programs such as DIY Girls. Razo\u2019s childhood mentor was a band director who fused music and discipline, so the principal started a mariachi program at Telfair three years ago in conjunction with LA\u2019s Best, the after-school enrichment service. But his school doesn\u2019t have the janitorial or maintenance staffs it once had. The asphalt playground is cracked and chunking apart. Two urinals in a boys bathroom were out of order, draped in black plastic, and a janitor said it could take weeks for someone from the district to take a look. One student\u2019s grandfather volunteers to maintain the garden out front.\n\nAngelica Razo, from left, Destiny Armijo and Angel Espinoza meet after school at Telfair Elementary for mariachi practice. Manuel Torres, center, plays the trumpet during mariachi practice at Telfair Elementary School. Principal Jose Razo, right, counsels a frustrated student at Telfair Elementary School. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhen I went to California public schools in the 1960s, the state served as a clinic for the entire nation, demonstrating that a full investment in grade school, colleges and universities was key to upward mobility. Funding per student was near the top. But since then, the state\u2019s standing has plunged.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is 46th in the nation,\u201d said Kelly Gonez, the school board member who represents the northeast San Fernando Valley, \u201ceven though we have the largest population of English learners of any school district.\u201d\n\nOther rankings put California closer to the middle of the pack, based on different methods of calculation. But Gonez said you can\u2019t talk about school performance without taking the funding decline into account, and Razo summed it up this way:\n\n\u201cEvery year, we have to do more with less.\u201d\n\nThe principal said that given the trauma his students experience \u2014 frequent moves, cramped quarters, family separation, violence, depression, the constant stress of barely surviving \u2014 he could sure use a psychiatric social worker. Same for literacy and math coaches, but hiring for those positions would mean sacrificing other critical needs. Because so many of his students are English learners from poor families, he decided to hire an extra first-grade teacher to bring class sizes down to 16, so the students get plenty of attention at the beginning of their education journey.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not investing in the students early enough.\u201d Assemblywoman Luz Rivas\n\nThis is not to say there have been no efforts in Sacramento or individual districts to lend a hand. L.A. Unified has mental-health screening, wellness centers and a program to link homeless students and their families with housing and other service providers. Recently, the school board approved a resolution backed by Gonez to explore permanent and interim housing solutions for families, on district properties, in partnership with government, nonprofit and private parties.\n\nBut at the moment, need exceeds help, and by some measures, chronic exposure to childhood stress \u2014 including abuse, neglect and household dysfunction \u2014 can hinder brain development and cause physical and mental-health problems. Not temporarily, but for life.\n\nSan Francisco physician Nadine Burke Harris told me exposure to four or more stress triggers as a child has been linked to rates of adult heart disease twice the normal rate. When I told her about Telfair and the number of students living in motels and garages, she was reminded of a patient whose family of six lived in one room and struggled when the father lost his job.\n\n\u201cI began to see changes in her weight, her rate of infection, changes in behavior and school performance. I was seeing it right in front of me \u2014 the manifestation of toxic stress,\u201d said Burke Harris, founder of the Center for Youth Wellness and author of \u201cThe Deepest Well: Healing the Long-term Effects of Childhood Adversity.\u201d\n\nBurke Harris prescribes more early intervention, along with coordinated support from the judicial and welfare systems. When I asked about the cost, she threw back at me the high cost of incarceration and long-term healthcare for preventable chronic diseases.\n\nPrincipal Jose Razo, left, assists Telfair Elementary fifth-grader Angela Carrillo with an engineering project in the Do It Yourself Girls after-school program.

Telfair Elementary got the first DIY Girls chapter, which introduced Kassandra Toscano, above right, and other students to technology. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLast week, a task force called on Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom to deliver multibillion-dollar investments in child care, tax credits, rental subsidies and more to help close an income gap that has made child poverty \u201ca human and a fiscal crisis\u201d in California, in the words of co-chairman Conway Collis. The group \u2014 with public, private and community representatives \u2014 said such investments could produce long-term savings and could improve living conditions for 450,000 of the state\u2019s poorest children in the next four years.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said before, I think schools are underutilized. They should be redesigned as community centers that stay open in the evening for student tutoring, parenting skills training, and family planning healthcare for adults who don\u2019t yet have the means to support large families. They need more support from local nonprofits, neighborhood businesses and billion-dollar corporations. And decades after the collapse of blue-collar manufacturing and aerospace jobs in the Valley and elsewhere, they need to be better outfitted to prepare students for jobs in technology, healthcare and other developing industries. A DIY Girls and a DIY Boys at every school would be a good start.\n\nShame on us for sitting back, in cynical judgment, while schools go without the tools once considered essential to a healthy, nurturing educational environment, and students already at a disadvantage fall further behind because of it. What better way to benefit everyone in California than to return to the days when we cared enough about our children, and the future, to give them their best shot at success?\n\nThe day Luz Rivas visited her old school, Telfair Principal Razo stood in a corner of the classroom, a man of proud bearing. When Rivas was finished speaking, he had something to say, and it echoed an article of faith he had shared with me weeks earlier at our first meeting \u2014 he wants every student to know, no matter how difficult their lives or how long the odds against them, that he and his teachers believe in them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you before, I have two daughters and I want the best and most out of my daughters,\u201d Razo said to the class. \u201cYou guys can do anything. Maybe I could have the first female president come out of my school.\u201d\n\nWhen the speeches were done, the girls went to work. Within minutes, they were all budding engineers.\n\nThe DIY staff had set work kits in front of each student, and the girls used batteries, buzzers and switches to create a circuit and send energy coursing along a twisted wire. It was a variation of the game Operation. The girls had to carefully run a looped wand along a self-designed roller coaster of wire, and if the loop made contact, it set off the buzzer.\n\nShrieks, giggles, laughter.\n\nThe sound of trapped potential set free.\n\nA note on this series: Facing child poverty in L.A. and our own conflicting emotions \u00bb\n\nThis form requires JavaScript to complete.\n\nPowered by Screendoor.\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

    "text": "\u201cThere it is,\u201d Yolanda Vasquez said, pointing to the converted garage she and her family of six lived in for four years.\n\nWe stood on Kewen Avenue, a block from Telfair Elementary School. Vasquez was giving me a tour of her old neighborhood on a blistering September afternoon before picking up her daughter, Ammy, a third-grader.\n\n\u201cI have one son diagnosed with autism, and it was difficult to be in such a small space,\u201d said Vasquez, who paid $1,175 a month for the garage but finally found a roomier rental in Northridge a couple of years ago for $1,500.\n\nThe garage, tan-colored with red trim, was attached to a stucco house with a yard. It had a bathroom but no kitchen, and Vasquez said she used to cook on a hot plate.\n\nClothing was draped over the fence that borders the property, a common sight in a neighborhood where people push food carts and sell whatever they can to pay bills. A hulking old trailer with faded paint was parked on the street, and I wondered if someone was living in it, knowing that in L.A. Unified, with more than 15,000 students classified as homeless, some live in rolling homes.\n\nA man with one leg amputated at the knee emerged from the garage, hobbling along on a wooden peg, wondering what we were doing there. I told him Vasquez had once lived in the garage and he nodded. I asked about his leg and he said he was riding his bike, got hit by a car and lost his job. At the hospital, he got a prosthetic limb that has since cracked.\n\nIt was something of a metaphor, you could say. People get by in Los Angeles. They make do.\n\nAngelina Orellana, 8, does homework in a garage as a German shepherd lounges at her feet. (Francine Orr/ Los Angeles Times) Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nBeyond the tree-shaded comforts of suburban living, miles from the 20,000-square-foot mansions, the hilltop castles, the Rain Bird-sucking lawns, the $40,000 private schools, the gated glory and the daily symphony of leaf blowers, L.A. residents by the thousands live in motels, vehicles, shelters, shared homes and 400-square-foot garages.\n\nThe things I heard as a kid, and repeated to my own kids, don\u2019t apply for a lot of L.A.\u2019s public school students. There is no quiet place to do homework. There is no private space without distraction. Los Angeles kids, like their parents, make do.\n\nWhen I was growing up, a garage was where you parked your car and kept your lawn mower, motor oil and tools, rather than where you cooked dinner, slept and dressed for school. In my day, a few families converted their garages into what were called rumpus rooms, but I don\u2019t recall anyone renting out garages as mini-apartments.\n\nSuch conversions have been happening in Los Angeles for at least a few decades, but teachers at Telfair who grew up in the neighborhood say living in garages is more common now. If the statistics are accurate, about 60 of Telfair\u2019s more than 700 students went to sleep in garages last year. This year\u2019s count is still being tallied.\n\nVasquez and I walked back up Kewen Avenue to Telfair, where more parents were arriving to pick up their kids at the 2:23 p.m. bell. Marisol arrived in a black pickup and said she lives in a small house nearby with her in-laws. It\u2019s cramped, she said. She and her husband sleep in the living room.\n\nThree more women arrived and said in Spanish that they live in nearby garages, but they didn\u2019t care to share the details. A woman named Alejandra was more comfortable with me and my questions. She said she and her two kids live in a garage and I could visit if I wanted to.\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d Alejandra said when I arrived the next morning.\n\nA tiny kitchen was set off from the main living area. On the way to a small bedroom with bunk beds, I passed a bathroom. There was little natural light, but the walls were plastered and painted, and caged parrots chirped. The washing machine was outside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s $900 a month,\u201d Alejandra said. Her husband no longer lives there but works in construction and pays the rent, plus a little more, she said. A chicken was boiling on the stove, and the garage smelled like soup.\n\nAlejandra said it wasn\u2019t much, but it worked for her and the kids. It was better than what she had in Mexico, she said, and Telfair offered a better education than her kids could have gotten south of the border. The daily routine is school and homework. They go to Ritchie Valens Park on Laurel Canyon Boulevard and the library on Van Nuys Boulevard. It\u2019s a life.\n\nWhen I asked where her son does his homework, Alejandra pointed to a weight-lifting bench pushed against a table in the corner of what in a different time was a garage, not a home.\n\n\u201cI feel like a failure... It\u2019s not a good thing to have had my kids up and down, from one place to another, as soon as they walked.\u201d Blanca, mother of five\n\nI\u2019ve written about people living in cars who told me they felt lucky, because it could have been worse. From that perspective, you can argue that people living in converted garages are in better shape than many others.\n\n\u201cWe have roughly 200 families in crisis- or interim-housing right now. That could mean a temporary shelter, it could be a motel,\u201d said Dan Parziale, senior director of housing navigation for the San Fernando Valley-based nonprofit L.A. Family Housing.\n\nThat was the agency that helped Yolanda Vasquez finally get out of the garage, but the demand for stable, affordable housing always exceeds the supply. Families account for about 15% of L.A.\u2019s 50,000-plus homeless people, according to L.A. Family Housing. Parziale and his boss, Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, told me they had so many clients shuffling through different motels along Sepulveda Boulevard and elsewhere in the Valley, they leased an entire 19-room inn on San Fernando Road to better manage their cases while trying to find better housing options.\n\nThe motel is about a mile from Telfair Elementary and looks like a place a trucker on a tight budget might stop at to take a break from a long haul. On the day I visited, a woman named Blanca invited me into the room she shares with her husband and five children. It was not quite as large a space as Alejandra\u2019s garage, but it had a bathroom, along with access to a common kitchen.\n\n\u201cOh my God, I don\u2019t have words,\u201d Blanca said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, to be honest with you, to not have to pack and unpack every day.\u201d\n\nBlanca, 31, serves dinner to her sons Marcos, center, and Israel, 9, at a motel on San Fernando Road. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful ... to not have to pack and unpack every day,\u201d the mother says. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Blanca prepares dinner with her son Marcos by her side. After years on the move, the family received help from L.A. Family Housing to secure shelter at a motel. (Francine Orr/ Los Angeles Times) Blanca's daughter Sophia, 4, takes a sip of a soft drink.

Blanca's daughter Sophia, 4, above right, takes a sip of a soft drink. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)\n\nShe said the family was on the move for years, surviving on food giveaways at churches, crushed by housing costs they could barely afford despite her former job as a Sears clerk and her husband\u2019s gardening job. Now they were close, it appeared, to getting an apartment with the help of L.A. Family Housing.\n\nIt was achingly clear that Blanca was worn out by her family\u2019s odyssey and wanted to say more than she already had, but she couldn\u2019t speak up in the presence of the kids. When they stepped outside the room and into the motel parking lot, she visited her own childhood.\n\nShe said her father was murdered, and her mother was an addict. Blanca so feared for her mother\u2019s safety that she would insist on going on her mom\u2019s drug runs, in the middle of the night, to shepherd her back home. Blanca said she was sent to live with relatives for a while, and that brought new horrors. She said she was sexually abused regularly.\n\n\u201cI feel like a failure,\u201d she said, tears coming up as she spoke again of her children. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not a good thing to have had my kids up and down, from one place to another, as soon as they walked.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve had to switch schools, say goodbye to friends and teachers, and another move was approaching \u2014 this one to the south side of the city.\n\n\u201cThe teachers tell me they\u2019re behind,\u201d Blanca said.\n\nA few months ago, Blanca posted something about her situation on Facebook. She took some jabs from people wondering why she had so many kids she couldn\u2019t afford to provide for.\n\nSuch judgments are easy to make from a distance. But in the aftermath of a traumatic childhood and in the clutches of corrosive poverty, decisions can become fogged by a thousand factors, including a yearning to be loved.\n\n\u201cI would never regret my children,\u201d said Blanca, who also heard from a few people who wanted to help.\n\nRochelle Edwards-Gilbert, manager at Fabrocini\u2019s Italian Kitchen in Tarzana, posted on Facebook that she would give Blanca free pizza.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of negativity about homeless people using drugs and vandalizing, but she didn\u2019t appear to be one of those,\u201d said Edwards-Gilbert. \u201cThey came to get the pizza in the van and it was all broken down, with all the kids in there. It was sad.\u201d\n\nJose, 40, right, gets a hug from his son, Angel, 12. Jose and his wife, Blanca, may be getting an apartment soon with the help of L.A. Family Housing. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nEdwards-Gilbert kept in touch and gave Blanca\u2019s daughter a stuffed animal on her birthday. Others got involved, too, including L.A. Police Department Senior Lead Officer Duc Dao, who heard the family was living in a van at a local park. Dao bought a birthday cake and delivered it to a motel where Blanca\u2019s family was staying, and he helped the family connect with L.A. Family Housing.\n\n\u201cI look at it this way: It\u2019s hard enough right now, that we\u2019re going through this,\u201d Blanca told me. \u201cBut it was worse before, if you understand what I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d\n\nLate one afternoon, outside the garage where Yolanda Vasquez used to live, I introduced myself to sisters Christina and Wendy Urquilla and told them I was working on stories about the high number of Telfair students living in less-than-ideal conditions.\n\nThey invited me into the garage without hesitation.\n\nThe man with the amputated leg was asleep in one of the beds, which took up most of the space. A wheelchair, a German shepherd, a fan, a guitar and trash bags full of what appeared to be clothing nearly took up the rest of the room.\n\nChristina and Wendy said they pay $1,500 for the garage. They have access to the kitchen in the house, which is rented by members of their extended family.\n\nTwo adults and three kids sleep in the garage. I asked 15-year-old Samantha, a San Fernando High School student, where she does her homework. She pointed to her bed. Her younger brother lounged on the bottom level of a bunk bed. He ignored my question about homework and one of the adults said he had a learning disability.\n\nChristina eyed me, as if awaiting my assessment of their predicament. And then she offered her own appraisal.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d she said, \u201cis a life of poverty.\u201d\n\nBlanca's daughter Kimberly, 5, sits on her bunk bed during dinner. The family had been on the move for years. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nTelfair does not have a psychiatric social worker, but a roving mental-health specialist sometimes uses a desk in the office. I spotted her going over some paperwork one day and asked what kinds of issues are common among L.A. Unified students.\n\n\u201cDepression, PTSD, anxiety, autism and ADHD,\u201d she said. \u201cMood disorders, irritability, sleeping difficulty, disruptive behavior.\u201d\n\nAnd what are the causes?\n\n\u201cTrauma. Housing issues. Divorce. Homelessness. Abuse. Harsh economic reality.\u201d\n\nRegarding the latter: \u201cOut of my 28 students, I\u2019d say probably 26 families are living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d said Maria Alvarez, who teaches fifth-grade at Telfair.\n\n\u201cLast year I had a student, the friendliest child you will meet, and I noticed he started getting very distracted \u2026 and wasn\u2019t bringing in his homework,\u201d said Alvarez. \u201cHe always brought in a phone and asked if he could charge it here. It was a strange pattern, every day. I asked if everything was OK and he said, \u2018We don\u2019t have electricity.\u2019 Here I was worried about his homework, and he doesn\u2019t even have electricity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a life of poverty.\u201d Christina Urquilla, lives in a garage\n\nSome parents work hard to compensate for the hardships that sabotage success in school. Yolanda Vasquez helped start the Telfair PTA \u2013 Friends of the Little Tigers. She attended adult parenting and English classes at Telfair. She volunteers for everything, which reminds Principal Jose Razo of his own mother, who demanded that he did well in school and that his educators did their best too.\n\nWhen they lived in the garage, Vasquez told me, she gave her four kids a 15-minute break after school, then it was time for homework. There was no desk in the garage, so they sat on the floor.\n\nIn their new home, sometimes there\u2019s no money left after they pay the $1,500 rent, depending on how much work she and the kids\u2019 father can get. Vasquez, who cleans houses, said she checks with churches and community groups to see if they have leftovers from their events.\n\nThey make do. They get by.\n\nThe day I met Vasquez, I went to see her daughter Ammy\u2019s teacher after school.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of conversations about life, and about how they feel,\u201d said Maria Mancilla, who told me she has counseled students who lost loved ones to tragedy, or who were distraught over losing siblings who were put up for adoption.\n\nI asked her how Ammy was doing and Mancilla fawned.\n\n\u201cAmmy is a bright, bright girl,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just had tests and she had the highest scores on math and science. I don\u2019t know how she does it.\u201d\n\nA note on this series: Facing child poverty in L.A. and our own conflicting emotions \u00bb\n\nPart 4: For children trapped in poverty, breaking free is getting harder \u00bb\n\nThis form requires JavaScript to complete.\n\nPowered by Screendoor.\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

She suspects she is still suffering from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder caused by barely making it out of last year\u2019s blaze."

    "text": "I didn\u2019t know anything about Jose Razo\u2019s back story when I first reached out to him. I was simply checking in with the principal who leads the L.A. Unified campus that has more students classified as homeless than any other.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s personal,\u201d the 43-year-old Razo told me one morning in a tight office with no room for one more box, folder, motivational poster or paper clip. \u201cI do see myself in the faces of the students who walk through these hallways.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because years ago, he lived as so many of them do today.\n\nRazo, who attended nearby Haddon Avenue Elementary and other local schools as a kid, said his father was not around much. His mother, as he described it, managed the trick of carrying herself as if she was persevering rather than struggling. For a time, Razo had no idea they were poor.\n\nNot until they moved into a garage.\n\n\u201cMy mother did anything she could,\u201d Razo said. \u201cShe did massage. She would make and sell donuts, tamales, corn. My coming to Jesus moment was when we lived in that garage and I had to go to the bathroom. We didn\u2019t have one in the garage, so we had to go to the owner\u2019s house and knock on the door.\u201d\n\nThe garage had no running water. Mrs. Maria Maximina Razo and her five children had access to an outdoor sink. Maria Razo, Jose\u2019s older sister, recalls a standing house rule: Do not knock on the owner\u2019s door after 8 p.m. If you had to go to the bathroom, you had to hold it until the morning.\n\nAs he told me his story, Razo was able to hold himself together until he got to the part about his greatest regret. After several months in the garage, the family moved into the nearby San Fernando Gardens projects, a big move up in the world despite the crime and drug activity there. But the financial struggles continued.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d go to the laundromat and I\u2019d see friends washing clothes while I was selling corn or tamales with my mother,\u201d Razo said, \u201cand I remember how it bothered me. I remember being ashamed.\u201d\n\nRazo stopped, swallowed hard and wiped the tears that pooled behind his glasses. He took a deep breath and said a friend once spotted him with his mother on the way to sell corn. He told the friend they were raising money for the benefit of other families, rather than their own. He said it in English, thinking his mother wouldn\u2019t understand.\n\nBut she did understand, he later discovered.\n\n\u201cThese are the things I think about,\u201d Razo said. \u201cThis is why I work so hard to make sure to provide the best possible place for our students. The best place for them to feel safe.\u201d\n\nAriel Olivare, center, makes a joyful entrance to the honors assembly, where she received an award.

(Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThere is no reliable formula for going from living in a garage to running the elementary school down the street. In Razo\u2019s case, it probably didn\u2019t hurt that he was a devout Catholic and served in the U.S. Marine Corps. Faith and discipline still go to work with him every day, along with his boot camp buzz cut.\n\nRazo recalls his mother telling him no one was going to help, so he better get to work. At San Fernando High School, Razo played trumpet in the marching band, where Army veteran Richard Gigger was a beloved music director.\n\n\u201cHe was the father I didn\u2019t have,\u201d Razo said. \u201cHe made sure I stayed up on my grades, along with my mother. They tag-teamed me. Being in the band with Gig was like being in the military. He made sure you got to morning practice before school, and if your grades slipped, he benched you.\u201d\n\nMaria Razo remembers her little brother getting home from band practice and sprinting through the open spaces of the projects to avoid getting harassed by gangbangers.\n\n\u201cHe was always studying,\u201d she said.\n\nRazo planned to find work in criminal justice after his Marine duty, but took a job as a teacher\u2019s aide at Pacoima Elementary, just to try it out. And there it was. He liked the service aspect, so he got his credentials, along with a master\u2019s degree, did some teaching, worked at district headquarters for a stretch, then took a test to become a principal.\n\nWhen his mother asked how it went, he didn\u2019t tell her the whole story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in God\u2019s hands,\u201d he said, holding back the part about how he thought he\u2019d blown his interview by spending most of the time talking about how much he admired her rather than how he\u2019d run a school.\n\nBut Mom \u2014 now deceased \u2014 turned out to be the charm.\n\nHer son, just 35, was hired to be principal at Lankershim Elementary, which he led for two years. Five years ago he transferred to Telfair, where, in his office, photos of his mother and his high school bandleader sit on a cabinet near his desk.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s personal ... I do see myself in the faces of the students who walk through these hallways.\u201d Jose Razo, principal of Telfair Elementary School\n\nTelfair Elementary was built when Harry Truman was president, baby boomers were booming and L.A. Unified built schools to put kids in rows, not to win architecture awards. No imagination was borrowed in assembling the box of faded chocolates that accounts for the main part of campus. The bungalow barracks, added later as classrooms, extend onto a playground that hears the roar of traffic rumbling along the 118 Freeway.\n\nIn 2012, a onetime third-grade teacher at Telfair got 25 years for molesting 13 former students. A gang shooting left a 16-year-old dead near the school in 2009. In May, police shot and killed a man with a pickax near campus.\n\nBut there are brighter notes in the school\u2019s history. Three current public officeholders \u2014 Congressman Tony Cardenas, Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Assemblywoman Luz Rivas \u2014 got their start at Telfair. And five teachers on staff were once Telfair students.\n\nAfter school one day, teachers attended a professional development class on math instruction when Assistant Principal Norma Alvarez asked if any of them wanted to run after-school clubs. Nine teachers raised their hands, even after Razo told them he didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to get them a nickel for their extra work.\n\nSecond-grade teacher Rosa Rubalcava leads a class at Telfair Elementary, where she attended as a youth. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nRosa Rubalcava, second-grade teacher and former Telfair student, said she wanted to do a robotics club. Rita Ontiveros, kindergarten teacher and former Telfair student, said she hadn\u2019t chosen a subject yet, but she just wanted to make clear that she was in.\n\n\u201cThis is my community, and I want to be here,\u201d Ontiveros told me as she and third-grade teacher Ruben Ayon led me down a hall to show off an engineering lab that\u2019s under construction and could serve as the headquarters of an after-school club.\n\n\u201cI do it because the students in this community need to be exposed to what the kids in more affluent communities have at home,\u201d said Ayon.\n\nBut for all this dedication to a noble cause, declining enrollment has cost teachers, class sizes are larger than ideal and some students are still learning English. And many of them carry the toll of their stressful lives into the classroom each day.\n\nTeachers told me about hungry kids, tired kids, kids without a change of clothes, kids with bedbugs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very distracted because they\u2019re thinking about their home life as opposed to what we\u2019re doing in class,\u201d said Maria Alvarez, who teaches fifth grade. \u201cI think they\u2019re focused on where they\u2019re going to sleep tonight and what they\u2019re going to eat tonight and whether their parents are going to argue about the situation. \u2026 I don\u2019t get depressed. I try to motivate them.\u201d\n\nThe staff buys school supplies and clothing for students who need help, and Razo estimated that staffers have bought 15 pairs of shoes in each of the last two years.\n\n\u201cI have a student who\u2019s exploding out of his shoes,\u201d said Maria Mancilla, a third-grade teacher.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re raising some of these kids,\u201d said Ontiveros.\n\nSandra Tejeda was exhausted one day after school, and I asked what was wrong. She said she has a student who defiantly disrupts class, tapping his pencil hard on his desk for attention, and \u201cgetting in my face\u201d when she reprimands him.\n\nI told her I knew that student. He lives in a crowded garage near the school.\n\nIf such a student doesn\u2019t do well in class, Tejeda said, \u201cWhy should the burden be on us?\u201d\n\nTejeda and first-grade teacher Gricelda Gutierrez, both former Telfair students, wondered if parents today aren\u2019t doing as good a job as their parents did, or if the difference is widespread poverty.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s both,\u201d said Gutierrez. \u201cIt goes back to the economy. A lot of these people are in survival mode.\u201d\n\nTelfair Elementary School Principal Jose Razo, left, his wife Cristina, right, and daughters Angelica, 9, left, and Mia, 5, talk around the island in the kitchen of their home in Sylmar.

Razo, at right, shares some time with Mia in their backyard. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)\n\nRazo and his wife, Cristina, a teacher at nearby O\u2019Melveny Elementary School, lead a life far removed from the one he knew as a child. They and their two daughters \u2014 one goes to Telfair, the other to O\u2019Melveny \u2014 have a comfortable Sylmar home with a backyard the size of a small park, where their dogs chase balls and the Razos host weekend gatherings for their dozens of godchildren and extended family.\n\nIn their backyard one night, they couldn\u2019t agree on how many godchildren they now have. She thought it was 20-something. He thought it was more.\n\nRazo knows the economy around Telfair has changed in ways beyond his control, but he said he thinks too many people have stopped fighting for opportunities, content to see what can be given to them rather than what they can earn. He is his mother\u2019s child, and despite great challenges in his life, he endured, and he knows many others who did too.\n\n\u201cThese students have to be given more services, but I don\u2019t believe in the pobrecito mentality and people who say, \u2018Oh, he can\u2019t make it,\u2019\u201d Razo said, referring to those who write off poor students as incapable of rising above their challenges. The economy will evolve in ways difficult to predict. Opportunities will arise. And Razo wants his students to be well-educated enough to have a shot.\n\nOne day after school, the principal and I traveled to the street where Razo had lived in the garage where he had to ask permission to use the bathroom. He looked up and down the block, trying to figure out where it was, then realized the house was gone, replaced by a row of businesses.\n\nJose Razo, principal of Telfair Elementary, walks across San Fernando Gardens, a housing project in Pacoima. As a child, he sprinted to avoid gang members. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nHe stood there for a moment, back in that time, as if he couldn\u2019t believe how far he\u2019d traveled since. Razo doesn\u2019t dwell on his students\u2019 challenges but on their potential. Even though Telfair is just an elementary school, he wants his \u201ckids,\u201d as he sometimes calls the students, to hear what he heard from his mother.\n\n\u201cFrom the first day, it\u2019s not a question of whether they\u2019re going to college, but which one,\u201d Razo said.\n\nCollege banners hang in Telfair\u2019s classrooms and on designated days, students can leave their uniforms home if they wear a college T-shirt or sweater to school. Every student filed into the auditorium one morning, one class after another, and leadership awards were presented to students in a celebration of progress and hope.\n\nRazo knows intimately the travails of his students, some of whom have lost parents, some of whom are in foster care, some of whom have mental health issues before they\u2019re out of kindergarten. Some of whom live in garages as he once did.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t have the mind-set that they can be successful, and that we believe in them,\u201d the principal said, \u201cwe don\u2019t have a fighting chance.\u201d\n\nA note on this series: Facing child poverty in L.A. and our own conflicting emotions \u00bb\n\nPart 3: Whether home is a van, a motel or a garage, L.A.\u2019s suburban poor children learn to survive \u00bb\n\nThis form requires JavaScript to complete.\n\nPowered by Screendoor.\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

    "text": "School had been in session less than two months when Brenda Salgado and her kids packed and moved. It was mid-September and they\u2019d already been in three places. First a motel, then a two-bedroom apartment stuffed with more than two dozen people, then one of the many discount lodges on a dreary stretch of Sepulveda Boulevard in North Hills.\n\nOne morning, a little after 7, I wheeled into the parking lot of Salgado\u2019s one-star motel near a busy Sepulveda intersection where the air smelled of burned gas and fried food. Guests stood outside their rooms under rising parachutes of cigarette smoke, and some of the parked cars were crammed with the belongings of people on the move.\n\nI took the stairs to Salgado\u2019s second-floor unit and heard the giggles of children. When I knocked, Salgado called me in.\n\nThe $95 room had two beds, a dark rug, harsh light and the familiar, unnatural scent of motel sanitizing agents. There was no kitchen, no quiet corner for homework, no outdoor space. Anthony, 9, Jordan, 6, and Madelyn, 5, were dressed and ready for school at Telfair Elementary, six miles away in Pacoima. One-year-old Mayla, dark-haired and curious, sat upright on a bed and looked me over.\n\nThe most disturbing thing about the scene was that for the kids, this was no temporary setback. This was life, dragging belongings from one place to the next, tethered to problems they didn\u2019t create.\n\nAnthony and Jordan took to the carpet for a wrestling match while Salgado sat on the edge of one bed, brushing Madelyn\u2019s hair as her daughter smiled appreciatively. I noticed a case of instant noodles on the dresser, next to a 7-Eleven pizza box. Sometimes, Salgado said, dinner comes from McDonald\u2019s or KFC, which are within walking distance from the motel.\n\n\u201cGuys, stop,\u201d Salgado urged the two wrestlers. \u201cDo you know how dirty these floors are?\u201d\n\nAnthony, 9, brushes his teeth as Salgado, grooms his hair. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Madelyn, 5, left, eats noodles from a cup as her mother, Brenda Salgado, brushes her hair before heading to Telfair Elementary School. Baby sister Mayla plays on the bed. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Brenda Salgado gets her children, Anthony, 9, left, and Madelyn, right, ready for school at Telfair Elementary. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)\n\nJordan, 6, from rear, and Anthony follow their mother, Brenda Salgado, and sister Mayla from the motel to catch a ride to school. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nIf the kids were going to make it to school on time, they needed to leave soon. By 7:30, their ride had not arrived. Salgado has no car, and said she had several people she relied on. She began dialing for a backup driver while Anthony complained that his backpack was left behind when they made their last move.\n\n\u201cCan you take them?\u201d Salgado said into her phone.\n\nMayla managed to lower herself to the floor while no one was watching. She slid down a corner of the bed as if she were rappelling, then got rolled up in the tangled limbs of her brothers. Salgado told the boys to knock it off before somebody got hurt.\n\nMadelyn grew jumpy as she waited for her ride. The kids generally eat breakfast at school, but she didn\u2019t appear to be counting on it this particular day. She grabbed a slice of pepperoni out of the 7-Eleven pizza box and popped it into the microwave. On the first bite, the cheese burned her mouth and she winced.\n\nThe clock struck 7:40, 7:45, 7:50.\n\nStill no ride.\n\nI\u2019d been to Telfair before, and I had gotten to know the principal and some teachers. I knew that nearly a quarter of the students were classified as homeless last year. I knew about the burden that puts on the students, the teachers, the school, the district. Salgado\u2019s kids began their education at a disadvantage, and showing up to school late wasn\u2019t going to help.\n\nI offered to take them, but just before 8, their uncle arrived.\n\nWhen the car turned out of the lot, the morning stress subsided, giving way to melancholy. Brenda Salgado sat on a bed holding her toddler, the two of them holed up for another day. Salgado told me she had been regularly abused by a parent and landed in juvenile hall and rehab. She imagined a better life for her kids, but that was more a dream than a plan, and even some of her friends wondered why she kept having kids before she had something to stand on.\n\nNow she was 29, with no job, no credit, no escape. The kids\u2019 father was helping, but Salgado said he had his own problems. She told me the kids were doing OK, considering. But they all insisted on sleeping with her at night, leaving one bed empty, probably because they feared being removed from her care as they have been in the past.\n\nSalgado said her oldest boy was more aware than the others that this is not how childhood is supposed to be.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s angry and depressed,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cHe just wants somewhere to call home.\u201d\n\nBrenda Salgado says she imagined a better life for Mayla and her other children. At 29, Salgado has no job, no credit and no escape plan. Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times\n\nLos Angeles Unified, the second-largest public school system in the country, is more than a sprawling collection of campuses \u2014 it\u2019s one of the nation\u2019s largest depositories of child poverty. About 80% of the more than 600,000 students qualify for free or reduced-price meals. When I heard from Supt. Austin Beutner that nearly a quarter of the students at Telfair last year were classified as homeless, I began visiting the school and the neighborhood, hoping to give some human shape to the numbers.\n\nYou don\u2019t see sprawling tent villages on the streets around Telfair, and there\u2019s little of the squalor so starkly evident on skid row and elsewhere. Poverty is quieter here. It lives indoors for the most part. To an extent, it\u2019s hidden in the fabric of the suburban design, and for all the focus on homeless encampments in Los Angeles, far more people cope with cramped, inadequate, barely affordable housing.\n\nLike I said, appearances can be deceiving. Rows of small stucco houses line the streets near Telfair, where the median household income hits the county average of about $54,000, and you can still buy a home for less than $500,000.\n\nBut the neighborhood has changed dramatically over the decades, said fifth-grade teacher Sandra Tejeda, a former Telfair student who has taught there for 29 years. Tejeda still lives down the street from the school in the house she grew up in.\n\n\u201cOh my goodness, things were beautiful,\u201d Tejeda told me as we sat in her classroom after school one day. \u201cPeople had front lawns, everybody owned their house, we knew who was in each house and we knew we were safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt used to be single families... Now you see multiple families in a home, in a garage, in makeshift shanties.\u201d Gricelda Gutierrez, teacher at Telfair Elementary\n\nNow, Tejeda said, you see vehicles parked in some yards where gardens once thrived, and small villages of people live on some properties.\n\n\u201cIt used to be single families,\u201d said first-grade teacher Gricelda Gutierrez, another former Telfair student who stopped by Tejeda\u2019s class to join our conversation. \u201cNow you see multiple families in a home, in a garage, in makeshift shanties.\u201d\n\nSo what drove the change?\n\nMore poverty. More renters. Fewer good jobs.\n\nTejeda\u2019s father worked at the General Motors plant in Van Nuys. In August 1992, the last car \u2014 a red Chevy Camaro \u2014 rolled off the assembly line where 6 million cars had been produced in 45 years.\n\nThe following year, The Times ran a story about the death of blue- and white-collar jobs in San Fernando Valley\u2019s once soaring aerospace industry. Hughes Aircraft, Litton Industries, Northrop, Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin were scaling back or closing altogether. In good times, Pacoima residents didn\u2019t have to work at those places to benefit from the money those jobs sent rippling through the local economy.\n\nJust up the street from Telfair, hundreds of union jobs were lost in 1997 when Price Pfister, a kitchen faucet manufacturer, moved production to Mexico. I spent a week looking for a former Price Pfister employee, and one day I found a guy named Emilio Servin, who participated in a 10-day hunger strike in 1997, seated on the front porch of his home in Sylmar.\n\n\u201cI found another job within a week,\u201d said Servin, 64, who became a driver for a Van Nuys auto dealership after losing his Price Pfister job. But he said he got nicked in the process, going from nearly $12 an hour to just above $7.\n\n\u201cWe rented out a bedroom of our house to make up the difference,\u201d Servin said. His daughter, Elizabeth, recalled that after Price Pfister closed, the family shopped for clothes at flea markets instead of stores.\n\nToday, a Lowe\u2019s home improvement center stands on the spot where Price Pfister made its faucets.\n\nLowe\u2019s sells Pfister faucets.\n\nMade in Mexico.\n\nThe evaporation of solid jobs by the thousands was not exclusive to the Valley \u2014 it staggered the entire region, and many of the poorest communities have never recovered. The emerging service economy had jobs for the taking, but the wages were lower, even as housing costs rose, and rose, and kept on rising.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if renting homes and rooms is brand new in the northeast San Fernando Valley. And for some in predominantly Latino Telfair boundaries, where nearly half the residents were born in another country, according to census figures, living with extended family can be a cultural preference as well as an economic necessity. But given the decades-long decline of solid jobs, the house-sharing industry has boomed.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how many people call me each day and ask, \u2018Can I see the bedroom, can I bring my husband, can I bring my kids?\u2019\u201d said local real estate agent Gilmer Pozo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got this friend who bought a four-bedroom house near here,\u201d Pozo said. \u201cHe rents each bedroom for $750, and it\u2019s $900 for the bedroom with a bathroom. For the garage, he gets $1,500.\u201d\n\nBrenda Salgado cleans up the bathroom area while Madelyn, left, Jordan, center, and Anthony play around. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Madelyn, left, and her sister Mayla horse around. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Madelyn opens a cup of instant noodles to prepare it for breakfast before school. The 5-year-old has been living in hotel rooms since she was 1, Salgado says. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Brenda Salgado cleans up the bathroom area as her children play in the motel room. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAt Telfair, I asked to see the breakdown on the school\u2019s 182 students who did not have homes of their own. Fifty-four percent lived \u201cin another family\u2019s house or apartment.\u201d Thirty-one percent lived in rented garages. Eight percent lived in motels, shelters, vehicles or campsites. Another 7% had unspecified \u201cother\u201d arrangements.\n\nIt seemed to me that a garage, while certainly not ideal, would have been a better and cheaper option for Brenda Salgado and her kids. But with no credit and no money for a down payment, she was trapped in the more expensive motel.\n\nAfter my visit with her, she moved to a different motel that was slightly cheaper, then returned to another unit in the first motel.\n\nOne evening, I visited again. Anthony and Jordan were having a pillow fight on one bed. The children\u2019s father had dropped by, and he had a bandage on the crease of his left arm. He said he had a job in a warehouse but work was unsteady, so he had begun selling his plasma at a clinic in Van Nuys.\n\nI\u2019d heard at Telfair that the kids were falling behind, and Salgado told me they had missed nearly an entire week. They all had scabies, which they may have picked up in one of the motel rooms.\n\nHousekeeping had not cleaned the room, so Brenda Salgado dampened a white hand towel and began wiping the sink and the dresser and tidying up packaged foods and clothing, as if this were a home.\n\nJordan tosses a football at the motel. The 6-year-old and his siblings don't always make it to school because their mother doesn't have a car and relies on family or friends for transportation, which isn't reliable.

    "text": "At the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, sea level rose 9 inches between 1854 and 2016. Climate change caused most of this rise by melting of land ice and thermal expansion of ocean water. Local governments on the California coast are using projections of sea level rise to develop plans to reduce future risks. Ocean water acidity off the coast of California increased 25% to 40% from the preindustrial era (circa 1750) to 2014 due to increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide from human activities. The marine heat wave along the Pacific Coast from 2014 to 2016 occurred due to a combination of natural factors and climate change. The event led to the mass stranding of sick and starving birds and sea lions, and shifts of red crabs and tuna into the region. The ecosystem disruptions contributed to closures of commercially important fisheries."

Good, he said, giving them a pat. They\u2019re doing OK. He can move along.\n\nChecking on the dogs is just one chore on Evans\u2019 list. He\u2019s one of a handful of people left in Concow, Calif., a mountain hamlet tucked deep in the woods that has been under mandatory evacuation orders since the Camp fire tore through here Nov. 8. If he leaves, he can\u2019t get back in.\n\nHis neighbors stuck on the outside have been emailing him requests. Because the gas in the generator powering his electricity \u2014 and his internet \u2014 is limited, he hops online for a few minutes each day, answers their questions and gets going.\n\n\u201cEvery single morning until the afternoon, I\u2019m huffing it,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI\u2019m going and going and going. There\u2019s pigs to feed and goats and ducks and chickens.\u201d\n\nNot to mention the eight dogs he\u2019s rescued.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stuck here anyhow,\u201d he added. \u201cWe may as well do something valuable.\u201d\n\nA thin man with a bushy mustache and a quick laugh, Evans, 59, has become an unofficial keeper of Concow. Neighbors send him addresses and ask if he could please go see whether their houses burned down. Almost always, the answer is yes.\n\nFrom Chico, the nearest city outside the massive evacuation zone, thick smoke obscures the Sierra foothills towns and their devastation.\n\nJeff Evans, center, chats with his dad, Chuck, as neighbor Gary Green moves propane tanks Friday in Concow, Calif.

Left: Burned trees on a hillside in Concow. Right: Cars destroyed by the Camp fire sit outside a home along Yana Trail. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThis week, a drive up to Concow, an unincorporated community of 710 people, included stops at closed intersections guarded by military police. At burned-out houses all along the way, search teams picked through the rubble for human remains, their white coveralls making them look like ghosts in the smoke.\n\nEvans, who owns a Chico pest control company, lives in a three-bedroom house at the end of a dirt road, his property abutting Concow Reservoir. He\u2019s been there 22 years and still can\u2019t believe his luck. He can catch 6-pound bass right in his backyard.\n\nAbout a year ago, he moved his parents, Chuck, 91, and Janet, 82, in with him. Janet is hard of hearing and moves slowly with a walker. Chuck chops the wood and keeps the gutters clean.\n\n\u201cHe told me I could move down here and retire and not have to do anything,\u201d Chuck said. \u201cThat was a crock.\u201d\n\nAbout 7:45 a.m. on Nov. 8, Evans and his dad stepped outside and saw that the skyline was orange. Already, smoke filled the air. The wind was blowing hard.\n\nWhat started as a tiny brush fire became the state\u2019s deadliest wildfire. Here\u2019s how \u00bb\n\nChuck drove a quarter of a mile north up Eleran Lane to Hoffman Road \u2014 the only way out \u2014 to see how it looked. He saw flames. They were trapped.\n\nHe and Evans considered their options. Maybe they could get in the reservoir? No, Janet can\u2019t swim. They\u2019d have to protect the house.\n\nEvans, his dad and a few neighbors spent a frantic morning with tractors, rakes and shovels cutting firebreaks and tossing dirt on the flames that came from all directions.\n\n\u201cWe kind of admitted to one another that there\u2019s a possibility that we\u2019re not going to make it through this,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI mean, if you stood here and heard that sound, this freight train huffing and puffing just unbelievably loud \u2014 we realized that this is volatile.\u201d\n\nHe and his dad stopped for a few seconds to consider that they might die. Then they started working again. They didn\u2019t want to worry Janet, so they didn\u2019t tell her how bad it was. She sat inside, playing solitaire at the kitchen table.\n\nEvans said the fire burned his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad it didn\u2019t burn your mustache,\u201d Chuck said with a crescendoing laugh.\n\nThe next day, Evans drove a mile up Hoffman Road to the crossing at Concow Creek on the path they would have taken out. There were five abandoned vehicles and dogs inside.\n\nHe took the dogs home and posted their pictures on Facebook. Their owners all contacted him, some weeping with joy, and told him the same story: At about the same time Evans\u2019 father was telling him they were trapped, the drivers up the road became surrounded by flames.\n\nSuddenly, they saw a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection pickup truck just ahead and heard a man calling out. Then, a canoe pulled up on the water. They\u2019d have to leave now. There was no room for dogs.\n\nA week after the fire, 11 dogs, including three of Evans\u2019 own, crowded his kitchen floor, tails wagging. Some lay next to each other, sleeping. They were strangers, but they have been getting along. Evans thinks \u201cthey get it.\u201d\n\nJeff Evans is surrounded by some of the dogs he rescued. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nA black collie mix named Bella has matted, singed fur all over her back and tail, and her eyes are burned. Evans found her at his friend\u2019s house, cowering in a hole, scared as could be. She was tied to a long lead line in the yard while her owners were at work. Her doghouse burned down.\n\n\u201cShe lived through that,\u201d Evans said, gently petting her face. \u201cThat\u2019s just mind-blowing to me. She\u2019s such a good-hearted creature.\u201d\n\nLater that week, a group of donkeys wandered into the yard. Chuck gave them peppermint candies, and they followed him around.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Evans started his rounds. He drove to the house of Glenn Madsen, Bella\u2019s owner. As others have been doing, Madsen told Evans to get into his house, which is still standing, to get food. When he pulled up, he was concerned: The gate was open and the generator was running. Did someone break in?\n\nHe found his friend in the yard, working in a dust mask, and wrapped him in a hug. Madsen was sheepish about how he got there.\n\n\u201cGlenn, I saved everything in your freezer,\u201d Evans said. \u201cAll the meats, they\u2019re still frozen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in my freezer. So if I need, I\u2019ll eat them, but I think we\u2019re going to do fine. So when it\u2019s all said and done, I\u2019ll bring those back.\u201d\n\nEvans took half a bag of potatoes from Madsen\u2019s house, and Madsen gave him 10 gallons of gas for his generator. Evans was relieved. He\u2019d only had five gallons left \u2014 enough for a day of electricity.\n\nEvans drove up the road and ran into another friend checking on a burned property. He\u2019d gotten word that an older man they\u2019d all helped look for had been found dead under his pickup truck.\n\n\u201cI expected it,\u201d Evans said with a sigh. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the facility to drive too far, too fast.\u201d\n\nAs he drove along Concow Road, he passed the burned husk of a four-door pickup.\n\n\u201cSomeone died there,\u201d he said softly.\n\nHe pulled into Camelot, a gated subdivision where houses were built in a tighter, planned grid that was meant to attract wealthy buyers but was too isolated to really do so. After the fire, Camelot is no more.\n\nJeff Evans carries a container of gasoline he found at a Concow property Friday. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nHe checked a burned home where he\u2019d left food for a badly burned stray cat he had spotted a few days earlier. The food hadn\u2019t been touched.\n\n\u201cI think the cat died,\u201d he said, his voice breaking. \u201cDoggone it. I just hate to see animals suffer.\u201d\n\nJust up the road, he brightened up. There was another stray cat in good shape. He ran and grabbed two of the three cans of Fancy Feast he\u2019d left out and crawled down a culvert where the cat was hiding.\n\n\u201cKitty, kitty, kitty!\u201d he called. \u201cHere you go, buddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love that,\u201d he said in the truck. \u201cI love that!\u201d\n\nIn the week since the fire, he\u2019s gotten to know many of the multitudes of firefighters and utility workers, who now recognize him. Some bring him gas they find on others\u2019 properties. He asks for the address so he can replenish it when the neighbors come back.\n\n\u201cBut they say, \u2018They\u2019re never going to need it because there\u2019s nothing there,\u2019 \u201d Evans said.\n\nOn Friday, firefighters delivered him supplies sent from some friends on the outside: Canned goods, peanut butter, toilet paper, 10 gallons of gasoline.\n\nPeople around here get a reputation that they\u2019re backward, and some look a little rough, Evans said. But you wouldn\u2019t find kinder people anywhere, he said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t judge a book by the cover in this neck of the woods, I\u2019ve gotta say,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThey\u2019re damn good people.\u201d\n\nWhen Evans got home, his dad said some utility workers told him it would be at least Christmas before they got lights.\n\nBut the dark up here isn\u2019t so bad, Evans said.

Evans found her at his friend\u2019s house, cowering in a hole, scared as could be. She was tied to a long lead line in the yard while her owners were at work. Her doghouse burned down.\n\n\u201cShe lived through that,\u201d Evans said, gently petting her face. \u201cThat\u2019s just mind-blowing to me. She\u2019s such a good-hearted creature.\u201d\n\nLater that week, a group of donkeys wandered into the yard. Chuck gave them peppermint candies, and they followed him around.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Evans started his rounds. He drove to the house of Glenn Madsen, Bella\u2019s owner. As others have been doing, Madsen told Evans to get into his house, which is still standing, to get food. When he pulled up, he was concerned: The gate was open and the generator was running. Did someone break in?\n\nHe found his friend in the yard, working in a dust mask, and wrapped him in a hug. Madsen was sheepish about how he got there.\n\n\u201cGlenn, I saved everything in your freezer,\u201d Evans said. \u201cAll the meats, they\u2019re still frozen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in my freezer. So if I need, I\u2019ll eat them, but I think we\u2019re going to do fine. So when it\u2019s all said and done, I\u2019ll bring those back.\u201d\n\nEvans took half a bag of potatoes from Madsen\u2019s house, and Madsen gave him 10 gallons of gas for his generator. Evans was relieved. He\u2019d only had five gallons left \u2014 enough for a day of electricity.\n\nEvans drove up the road and ran into another friend checking on a burned property. He\u2019d gotten word that an older man they\u2019d all helped look for had been found dead under his pickup truck.\n\n\u201cI expected it,\u201d Evans said with a sigh. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the facility to drive too far, too fast.\u201d\n\nAs he drove along Concow Road, he passed the burned husk of a four-door pickup.\n\n\u201cSomeone died there,\u201d he said softly.\n\nHe pulled into Camelot, a gated subdivision where houses were built in a tighter, planned grid that was meant to attract wealthy buyers but was too isolated to really do so. After the fire, Camelot is no more.\n\nJeff Evans carries a container of gasoline he found at a Concow property Friday. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nHe checked a burned home where he\u2019d left food for a badly burned stray cat he had spotted a few days earlier. The food hadn\u2019t been touched.\n\n\u201cI think the cat died,\u201d he said, his voice breaking. \u201cDoggone it. I just hate to see animals suffer.\u201d\n\nJust up the road, he brightened up. There was another stray cat in good shape. He ran and grabbed two of the three cans of Fancy Feast he\u2019d left out and crawled down a culvert where the cat was hiding.\n\n\u201cKitty, kitty, kitty!\u201d he called. \u201cHere you go, buddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love that,\u201d he said in the truck. \u201cI love that!\u201d\n\nIn the week since the fire, he\u2019s gotten to know many of the multitudes of firefighters and utility workers, who now recognize him. Some bring him gas they find on others\u2019 properties. He asks for the address so he can replenish it when the neighbors come back.\n\n\u201cBut they say, \u2018They\u2019re never going to need it because there\u2019s nothing there,\u2019 \u201d Evans said.\n\nOn Friday, firefighters delivered him supplies sent from some friends on the outside: Canned goods, peanut butter, toilet paper, 10 gallons of gasoline.\n\nPeople around here get a reputation that they\u2019re backward, and some look a little rough, Evans said.

    "text": "Jeff Evans steers his white Dodge Ram along a narrow dirt road, scanning the blackened trees and ashen ground for two skittish dogs.\n\nThey come running when they hear the truck, and Evans offers them dog biscuits from the big red box of Milk-Bones he keeps on his floorboard. Good, he said, giving them a pat. They\u2019re doing OK. He can move along.\n\nChecking on the dogs is just one chore on Evans\u2019 list. He\u2019s one of a handful of people left in Concow, Calif., a mountain hamlet tucked deep in the woods that has been under mandatory evacuation orders since the Camp fire tore through here Nov. 8. If he leaves, he can\u2019t get back in.\n\nHis neighbors stuck on the outside have been emailing him requests. Because the gas in the generator powering his electricity \u2014 and his internet \u2014 is limited, he hops online for a few minutes each day, answers their questions and gets going.\n\n\u201cEvery single morning until the afternoon, I\u2019m huffing it,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI\u2019m going and going and going. There\u2019s pigs to feed and goats and ducks and chickens.\u201d\n\nNot to mention the eight dogs he\u2019s rescued.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stuck here anyhow,\u201d he added. \u201cWe may as well do something valuable.\u201d\n\nA thin man with a bushy mustache and a quick laugh, Evans, 59, has become an unofficial keeper of Concow. Neighbors send him addresses and ask if he could please go see whether their houses burned down. Almost always, the answer is yes.\n\nFrom Chico, the nearest city outside the massive evacuation zone, thick smoke obscures the Sierra foothills towns and their devastation.\n\nJeff Evans, center, chats with his dad, Chuck, as neighbor Gary Green moves propane tanks Friday in Concow, Calif.

Left: Burned trees on a hillside in Concow. Right: Cars destroyed by the Camp fire sit outside a home along Yana Trail. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThis week, a drive up to Concow, an unincorporated community of 710 people, included stops at closed intersections guarded by military police. At burned-out houses all along the way, search teams picked through the rubble for human remains, their white coveralls making them look like ghosts in the smoke.\n\nEvans, who owns a Chico pest control company, lives in a three-bedroom house at the end of a dirt road, his property abutting Concow Reservoir. He\u2019s been there 22 years and still can\u2019t believe his luck. He can catch 6-pound bass right in his backyard.\n\nAbout a year ago, he moved his parents, Chuck, 91, and Janet, 82, in with him. Janet is hard of hearing and moves slowly with a walker. Chuck chops the wood and keeps the gutters clean.\n\n\u201cHe told me I could move down here and retire and not have to do anything,\u201d Chuck said. \u201cThat was a crock.\u201d\n\nAbout 7:45 a.m. on Nov. 8, Evans and his dad stepped outside and saw that the skyline was orange. Already, smoke filled the air. The wind was blowing hard.\n\nWhat started as a tiny brush fire became the state\u2019s deadliest wildfire. Here\u2019s how \u00bb\n\nChuck drove a quarter of a mile north up Eleran Lane to Hoffman Road \u2014 the only way out \u2014 to see how it looked. He saw flames. They were trapped.\n\nHe and Evans considered their options. Maybe they could get in the reservoir? No, Janet can\u2019t swim. They\u2019d have to protect the house.\n\nEvans, his dad and a few neighbors spent a frantic morning with tractors, rakes and shovels cutting firebreaks and tossing dirt on the flames that came from all directions.\n\n\u201cWe kind of admitted to one another that there\u2019s a possibility that we\u2019re not going to make it through this,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI mean, if you stood here and heard that sound, this freight train huffing and puffing just unbelievably loud \u2014 we realized that this is volatile.\u201d\n\nHe and his dad stopped for a few seconds to consider that they might die. Then they started working again. They didn\u2019t want to worry Janet, so they didn\u2019t tell her how bad it was. She sat inside, playing solitaire at the kitchen table.\n\nEvans said the fire burned his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad it didn\u2019t burn your mustache,\u201d Chuck said with a crescendoing laugh.\n\nThe next day, Evans drove a mile up Hoffman Road to the crossing at Concow Creek on the path they would have taken out. There were five abandoned vehicles and dogs inside.\n\nHe took the dogs home and posted their pictures on Facebook. Their owners all contacted him, some weeping with joy, and told him the same story: At about the same time Evans\u2019 father was telling him they were trapped, the drivers up the road became surrounded by flames.\n\nSuddenly, they saw a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection pickup truck just ahead and heard a man calling out. Then, a canoe pulled up on the water. They\u2019d have to leave now. There was no room for dogs.\n\nA week after the fire, 11 dogs, including three of Evans\u2019 own, crowded his kitchen floor, tails wagging. Some lay next to each other, sleeping. They were strangers, but they have been getting along. Evans thinks \u201cthey get it.\u201d\n\nJeff Evans is surrounded by some of the dogs he rescued. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nA black collie mix named Bella has matted, singed fur all over her back and tail, and her eyes are burned. Evans found her at his friend\u2019s house, cowering in a hole, scared as could be. She was tied to a long lead line in the yard while her owners were at work. Her doghouse burned down.\n\n\u201cShe lived through that,\u201d Evans said, gently petting her face. \u201cThat\u2019s just mind-blowing to me.

Did someone break in?\n\nHe found his friend in the yard, working in a dust mask, and wrapped him in a hug. Madsen was sheepish about how he got there.\n\n\u201cGlenn, I saved everything in your freezer,\u201d Evans said. \u201cAll the meats, they\u2019re still frozen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in my freezer. So if I need, I\u2019ll eat them, but I think we\u2019re going to do fine.

It appeared to be the same owl that Los Angeles Times photographer Wally Skalij snapped just an hour before finding the alpacas tied to the lifeguard stand.\n\n\n\nSkalij said he was drawn to the area when he saw horses on the beach, and then the unusual sight of the owl."

On Wednesday, she was one of more than 100 people who sought refuge in the parking lot of a Chico Walmart. Dozens of tents had been set up in a vacant lot next to the store, and part of the parking lot had been filled with donations, from food to toys.\n\nTwo women passed out homemade muffins. A woman gave out warm washcloths. People came to the camp to help those they thought might be in need.\n\nThe east end of the lot had turned into a full-blown outdoor resource center by Wednesday. People from churches and residents in the area brought food \u2014 from enchiladas to pastries. A man made patties out of a large tray of ground beef to cook hamburgers. Another served minestrone he had made at home. There was an area for pets, with food piled high and dog beds.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: California fires \u00bb\n\nRob Busick, who owns a local food truck, first came to the parking lot after he heard people were evacuating here. He thought that evacuees in the lot could use some food. Then the donations started coming. \u201cPeople kept coming at a rapid pace,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s a makeshift store.\u201d\n\nBusick said he\u2019s been in the parking lot for six days for nearly 15 hours a day helping to coordinate the effort. He knows it\u2019s not permanent but said he\u2019s hoping to help the people in tents transition to their next place. He wanted people to know that the Walmart camp wasn\u2019t the \u201cblack sheep of the shelters.\u201d\n\nDeAnn Miller and Ron Irick eat breakfast in a Walmart parking lot in Chico that has become a temporary shelter for Camp fire evacuees. Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times\n\nWhile Laura Whitaker\u2019s daughter took her 8-year-old son for a donated haircut, Whitaker hung out with her dog, Sadie, outside her tent.\n\nWhitaker couldn\u2019t go to a shelter with the large dog, a rescued Rottweiler, so here she was, camping instead.\n\n\u201cI love her to death,\u201d Whitaker said of her dog. \u201cI\u2019m not going to put her in a kennel.\u201d\n\nWhitaker has been through this before. When she was 5, her home was struck by lightning, she said. She\u2019s used to living in fire-prone areas, but this time she didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d make it. As she evacuated from Paradise, she drove down the highway, flames on each side of her, trees creating balls of fire around her.\n\n\u201cI kept thinking I was going to pass out,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that was it.\u201d\n\nWhen she got to the camp last Friday, she said it \u201cfelt like family\u201d because everyone had been through the same thing. But it\u2019s changed with more evacuees moving in. Some people were selling drugs out of a car, and others complained that items had gone missing from their tents.\n\nWhitaker said she hoped the police would keep the settlement safe, at least until she could go back home and rebuild.\n\n\u201cI love Paradise. If it were safe to be there, I\u2019d be there, on the property, pitch a tent right now.\u201d Laura Whitaker\n\nChris Yarbrough, who lost his home in the Camp fire, plays a donated guitar in a tent city set up by evacuees in a Chico parking lot.

His daughter, who is 8\u00bd months pregnant, lost her home in the fire. Wright said she had just gotten a crib for the new baby.\n\nMatthew Flanagan, 55, ran an antiques booth in Paradise. He set up camp in the Walmart lot with about five tents in a half-moon shape. In the center were chairs and a 45-gallon plastic bin that was being used as a table. A puppy named Nell wearing a pink sweater lay nearby.\n\nA woman walked up to Flanagan and gave him a $25 gift card to Walmart. \u201cI might give it to someone else who needs it,\u201d he said.\n\nFlanagan met Daryl Merritt at the camp and realized they had lived a block away from each other in Paradise. On Tuesday night, the men tried to think of names for the tent city.\n\n\u201cThis is Wal-y-hood right here,\u201d Merritt said.\n\nDenise Chester, 44, was nearby, placing donated toys on a yellow blanket while children ran around, playing in the area.\n\nChester, of Magalia, left her home with her two children, ages 13 and 11, and her husband. She reminded her kids to keep checking in with her as they roamed the camp while she organized a pile of crayons, markers, coloring books, playing cards, blankets and stuffed animals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know my situation yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d\n\nMaggie Missere, 61, and her partner, Michael Crowder, 64, spent five days sleeping in their truck at the Burger King parking lot with their dog, Coco.\n\nMissere, who has heart problems, had difficulty sleeping in the truck, so Monday night the couple headed to Walmart to buy a tent but met a pastor who set them up with donated supplies.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, Missere and Crowder sat outside their red tent clutching warm mugs of coffee while their dog slept on a new bed beside them. A man walked up and gave Crowder $60 in cash, sending him into tears; the couple had spent most of the little money they had on fast food.\n\nLuckily, a friend got word to them that the couple\u2019s home in Magalia is OK. Now, they just have to wait until they can go back home.\n\n\u201cI feel relieved that we have a home,\u201d Crowder said."

    "text": "At least 88 people have been confirmed dead in the blazes that ravaged California in November.\n\nThe Camp fire in Butte County is the deadliest wildfire in California history, with at least 85 deaths. Three people died in the Woolsey fire in Malibu.\n\nIt is an extremely difficult task to find the remains of bodies in areas where nearly everything has been scorched, and then to identify those remains, many of which may be charred beyond recognition.\n\nHere are some of the stories of the lives lost to the Camp and Woolsey fires.\n\nJohn Digby, 78 | Paradise\n\nCamp fire\n\nJohn Digby was a soft-spoken, kind Air Force veteran who missed his neighbor\u2019s call to evacuate, his son said.\n\nJohn Digby Roman Digby\n\nDigby moved to California from Vermont when he was 15, and in 2008, he and his wife retired in Paradise, according to his son, Roman Digby, who said authorities called Wednesday to confirm his father\u2019s death.\n\nRoman Digby said he last spoke with his father by phone early Thursday \u2014 both unaware of the growing wildfire. Someone knocked on the door during their conversation, but Digby senior didn\u2019t answer \u2014 he was sick in bed at the time. It wasn\u2019t until later that Roman Digby realized it was a neighbor trying to get his dad to evacuate.\n\nHours later in Minnesota, Digby tried his father again. Static met him on the other end. After trying the Police Department to no avail, he Googled \u201cParadise\u201d and learned a fire had taken the town.\n\n\u201cHe was loved, and he\u2019ll be missed,\u201d Roman Digby said of his father. \u201cHe was a very kindhearted man.\u201d\n\nJohn Digby is survived by his son and a 14-year-old grandson.\n\n\u2014 Colleen Shalby\n\nJesus Fernandez, 48 | Concow\n\nCamp fire\n\nJesus Fernandez, or Zeus, as he was known to his friends, died in the Camp fire, the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office confirmed.\n\nJesus Fernandez Myrna Pascua\n\nFernandez \u201cwas the epitome of determination, respect, loyalty, and perseverance. A tireless provider, a dependable and loyal friend, a considerate neighbor, and loving father, he will be sorely missed by all who knew him,\u201d a family friend, Myrna Pascua, said in a written message Tuesday. Pascua, along with Fernandez\u2019s family and other friends, had been searching for Fernandez and his German shepherd since the fires struck Concow.\n\nFamily and friends are asking for donations for Fernandez\u2019s funeral and memorial on GoFundMe.\n\n\u2014Sonali Kohli\n\nErnest Foss, 63 | Paradise\n\nCamp fire\n\nA rock \u2019n\u2019 roll musician, Ernie Foss lived in San Francisco all his life until he was priced out a decade ago. He became a father at a young age, said his eldest daughter, Angela Loo, who was born when her father was 20.\n\nErnest Foss Angela Loo\n\nFoss eventually gave up his band lifestyle to be a single father to three children. But he raised them with a recording studio in their small Bay Area cottage.\n\nFoss, a Paradise resident, died during the Camp fire, Butte County authorities confirmed.\n\nThe 63-year-old played a variety of instruments. Guitar was his favorite, but he also played drums, bass guitar and the saxophone, Loo said. He taught lessons out of their San Francisco house and even helped her with her violin. Music runs in the family.\n\n\u201cHe had a beautiful voice, his mom was a trained opera singer,\u201d Loo said. \u201cHe had a crazy wild life, and then he had kids, and then he did his best to do right by us \u2026 being a single dad.\u201d\n\nHe always tried to help people, she said, opening his home to people in need even when he didn\u2019t have much himself.\n\nAuthorities told Loo that Foss\u2019 body was found outside his home near his minivan, next to the body of his service dog, Bernice. He probably died on the morning of Nov. 8, around 9:45 a.m., when flames overtook that part of Edgewood Lane, she said. He lived there with his stepson and caretaker, Andrew Burt, who was still missing as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nFoss wasn\u2019t afraid of death, Loo said \u2014 for the last 10 years he had been living with a debilitating condition called lymphedema that left him bedridden. Loo doesn\u2019t know how he was able to even get out of the house when the fire hit; it\u2019s possible that her stepbrother was able to get him into a wheelchair and near the car, she said.\n\nFor the last decade, Foss had been preparing for his death, Loo said. He had specific instructions for his instruments and wanted to pass his extensive vinyl collection to a friend. But he had told Loo to go through them first.\n\n\u201cI hid stuff for you in the dust jackets,\u201d he told her.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t been to Paradise yet to see the damage but has heard that the home, and everything in it, is gone.\n\n\u201cFor this to happen, it just sends me off my center of gravity,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared for this.\u201d\n\nThe family is asking for donations for funeral expenses through GoFundMe.\n\n\u2014Sonali Kohli\n\nDebbe Morningstar, 65 | Paradise\n\nCamp fire\n\nDebbe Morningstar came from a musical family, and she loved to sing.\n\nDebbe Morningstar Alison Holguin\n\nDuring family get-togethers, Morningstar would play the piano while she and her three sisters harmonized a song \u2014 often \u201cThe Longest Time,\u201d by Billy Joel, or a John Denver tune. They\u2019d sing and talk and laugh for hours on end.\n\nIt\u2019s the musical talent and irreverent sense of humor that Alison Holguin, 38, remembers most about her aunt, who died in her home during the Camp fire.\n\n\u201cThere was always this joyful noise in our home when we would gather,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cIt was really a wonderful blessing to grow up being surrounded by them all.\u201d\n\nMorningstar had evacuated from her home during previous fires and decided not to this time. Holguin said the evacuations came so suddenly that her other aunt Becki Nelson left clothes in the dryer, expecting she\u2019d be home soon enough.\n\nInstead, both sisters\u2019 homes \u2014 a five-minute drive from each other \u2014 burned.\n\nMonday afternoon, the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office called the family to say Morningstar hadn\u2019t survived.\n\n\u201cThere were hundreds of people missing at the beginning,\u201d Holguin said. \u201cMany people reunited with their loved ones. Up until that phone call, we were really hopeful.\u201d\n\nMorningstar, who had worked as a secretary, was retired. She lived alone, except for the company of her cats but kept busy with family and close friends. Thanksgivings and Christmases were always in Paradise.\n\nThe siblings, including their brother Chris Tomer, who died a few years ago, grew up in Downey and Corona. Holguin\u2019s mother, Margaret Rummens, was the first to settle in Paradise, and soon most of the family followed. Morningstar lived there for more than 30 years.\n\nYears ago, Tomer rode into town on his motorcycle. Rummens remembers their mother tried to convince Morningstar to go for a ride. Morningstar told her, \u201cI\u2019ll go if you go.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo my mom strapped on a helmet and took a ride around the block,\u201d Rummens said. \u201cAnd true to her word, Debbe did the same thing.\u201d\n\nAfter getting the call Monday, Rummens announced her sister\u2019s death in a Facebook group for missing people.\n\n\u201cRest in peace, sister,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u2014Andrea Castillo\n\nPhyllis and Christopher Salazar | Paradise\n\nCamp fire\n\nPhyllis and Christopher Salazar made their dream of having a big family come true by raising their biological son alongside five adopted children and three foster children.\n\n\u201cThere were so many of us that it was like a party at the house every day,\u201d said their foster daughter Anita Razo, 58.\n\nChris Salazar with his granddaughter Melina Gonzalez Melina Gonzalez\n\nPhyllis, 72, and Chris, 76, weren\u2019t able to escape their house on Sawmill Road in Paradise. They died in the fire.\n\nRazo, who lived with them in Ventura from age 14 to 19, said her dad was kind and understanding, while her mom was the caregiver and disciplinarian. Chris was in the military and later worked for the Postal Service.\n\nThey were generous parents who raised their children with faith in God. Razo remembers going on family trips and to church every Sunday.\n\nThanksgivings and Christmases were always happy. They would round up the kids for a camping trip in the Ventura County mountains and be back home in time for a big dinner on Christmas Day.\n\nChris rode a Honda Gold Wing motorcycle and would often take it on rides with a small group of friends. He played the piano at their church. Phyllis was the church accountant and often organized events or potlucks there.\n\nPhyllis Salazar Melina Gonzalez\n\nWhen all of the kids were out of the house, Phyllis spent more time caring for elderly people around the neighborhood and giving them rides to the doctor before Chris\u2019 health began to worsen. The last few years, Chris got around on a motorized scooter and Phyllis cared for him, refusing to put him in a nursing home.\n\nWhenever Razo or any of the other children had issues, she remembers their dad would tell them: \u201cDon\u2019t fret too much. Things have a way of working out.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was there for him until the end,\u201d Razo said of her mother. \u201cIf his words hold true and things work themselves out, it probably would have been their wish to go together.\u201d\n\n\u2014Andrea Castillo\n\nJudith Sipher, 77 | Paradise\n\nCamp fire\n\nWhen her elderly parents moved to Paradise, Judith Sipher followed and she stayed in the retirement community after their death, moving to an apartment complex. Her brother, Wally, remained in close contact with her from down the valley in Chico.\n\n\u201cShe loved Paradise. She loved living up there,\u201d he said.\n\nJudith had retired from circuit assembly for Hewlett-Packard, in Santa Rosa. But she was in poor health, suffering from congestive heart failure and relying on a walker and an oxygen tank. On the morning of the fire, she also was coping with a bout of the flu.\n\nWally called to warn his sister when he heard of the fire\u2019s start six miles away in Pulga, but she was nonchalant about the danger.\n\n\u201cIt was just another fire,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said, \u2018I heard.\u2019 A lot of people didn\u2019t think it would be that bad. She told me, she said, she wasn\u2019t feeling well and could barely move.\u201d\n\nWally left Chico and tried to drive to Paradise to fetch his sister, but he hit a traffic blockade on Skyway of people fleeing the fire and could not get in.\n\nTwo days later, a sheriff\u2019s deputy told him his sister\u2019s apartment complex was rubble. Sixteen days later, a detective informed him that human remains were found at her address.\n\nWally went to the Sears store to provide the county coroner a DNA sample to verify his sister\u2019s identity. He\u2019s waiting to hear back whether it is a match to the remains found at his sister\u2019s place.\n\n\u2014Paige St. John\n\nCarl Wiley, 77 | Magalia\n\nCamp fire\n\nCarl Wiley was a veteran whose family was from Alaska.

    "text": "It has been 10 days since he killed here, but the smell of death still fills the air.\n\nPieces of the wild horse are left scattered among the dirt and grass. A red rib, not yet sun-bleached, lies in the dirt. A vertebra of spine over by a sage bush. Tufts of the horse\u2019s dark mane sit among the black and brown lava rocks. Coyotes, vultures and bobcats have already been here, picking through the killer\u2019s leftovers.\n\nLess than 300 feet away, a herd of wild horses graze, unfazed by their proximity to the dismembered 10-month-old foal.\n\nProwling a home range of about 386 square miles is an adult male mountain lion known as M166. In the last year, while his feline counterparts have feasted mainly on deer, this cougar has garnered a reputation as a horse killer par excellence.\n\nLocal ranchers who believe this part of rural Modoc County has too many wild horses for the local ecology must, grudgingly, tip their hats to the mountain lion. They wish more of the area\u2019s cougars had a gift for mowing down horses.\n\nIt might alleviate the messier issues that come whenever humans have to get involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a split decision around here,\u201d said Teri Brown, owner of the only feed store in town, Modoc Farm Supply. \u201cA lot of people who have lived here their entire lives, they\u2019ve never seen populations like this \u2014 both of horses and of mountain lions \u2014 and both make them uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nWise examines the remains of a horse in Modoc National Forest. While M166's feline counterparts have feasted mainly on deer, this cougar has garnered a reputation as a horse killer par excellence. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nWildlife biologist Colton Wise, from the Institute for Wildlife Studies, examines the remains of a horse possibly killed by a mountain lion, M166, who lives in Modoc National Forest. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nFor the last few weeks, a helicopter has whirred above Modoc National Forest in an effort to gather 1,000 of the estimated 4,000 wild horses that live in the Devil\u2019s Garden. Experts found that the 258,000 acres of the forest where the horses live can sustain no more than 402 horses without significant damage to the ecosystem and to the horses themselves. The effort has spawned complaints and lawsuits.\n\nEven in a part of California with one of the densest cougar populations, M166 can only do so much. He has killed more than 30 horses since June of 2017. At the scene of one of the killings, he also killed a beaver. At another, a dove.\n\n\u201cThis lion, he is just wired for horse,\u201d said David Garcelon, president of the Institute for Wildlife Studies, which is collaring and researching cougars in Northern California. \u201cIt was one of those things where you go in the first time, and it\u2019s \u2018Oh my gosh, he\u2019s taken a horse \u2014 look at this,\u2019 and everyone is calling each other and you\u2019re shooting pictures, and the next time, he\u2019s taken two horses now, and pretty soon, you\u2019re like \u2018Everything he takes is a horse.\u2019 One after another after another.\u201d\n\nExperts wowed by the mountain lion\u2019s prowess at hunting horses say they only wish M166 was a she instead of a he.\n\n\u201cIf it was a female, we\u2019d be really excited because she\u2019d be teaching her youngsters how to do that as well,\u201d Garcelon said. \u201cFor a male, they come in do their business with their lady friend, and that\u2019s usually the last of their involvement. It\u2019s the female and what they feed on that helps the youngsters learn what they\u2019re going to be killing and going after.\u201d\n\nMountain lions are being killed on freeways and weakened by inbreeding. Researchers have a solution \u00bb\n\nThe plan to reduce the horse population has been controversial. It has led to multiple lawsuits by wild horse advocates who say the U.S. Forest Service is ignoring science in favor of cattle ranchers. Many argue that the forest should use fertility control on mares and, when needed, smaller gathers that use bait trap, instead of helicopter roundups.\n\n\u201cIn the big picture, the Forest Service got here from a basic failure to manage the horses for years, and now they\u2019re trying to deal with that, and they\u2019re choosing the wrong path,\u201d said Suzanne Roy, director of the American Wild Horse Campaign, which has sued over the management plan and the October gather. \u201cThese mass roundups are not only cruel \u2014 they also don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nWild horses are chased by helicopter as they are gathered in the Devil's Garden section of Modoc National Forest. Experts found that the 258,000 acres of the forest where the horses live can sustain no more than 402 horses without significant damage to the ecosystem. Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times\n\nHorse advocates say that the idea that the wild horses hurt the land ignores the thousands of cattle and sheep that graze on Modoc\u2019s public lands every year.\n\nSome argue that, instead of horse gathers, just let nature run its course \u2014 such as letting mountain lions take care of the problem.\n\nAs of Thursday, 713 wild horses had been removed from the Devil\u2019s Garden Plateau Wild Horse Territory. Since the gather began in early October, 10 horses have been euthanized: eight for \u201cpreexisting conditions\u201d and two for acute injuries. A foal died in holding last week. And two mares miscarried.\n\nThe most controversial aspect of the gather is forest officials\u2019 decision to sell the horses 10 and older without limitations if they aren\u2019t purchased or adopted by January at the earliest. Although it is against California law for horses to be sold for slaughter for human consumption, advocates fear the older horses could be taken elsewhere and killed. They could be sold for as little as $1, with a limit of 36 horses per buyer.\n\nModoc National Forest supervisor Amanda McAdams said she and her staff want to do everything they can to get horses adopted and avoid this option altogether. They\u2019re holding the gather, she said, because they fear that if they don\u2019t decrease the number of wild horses competing for foliage in the Devil\u2019s Garden, many will suffer and die in the cold winter months.\n\n\u201cThis is what I don\u2019t think people understand \u2014 we love these horses,\u201d McAdams said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re doing the right thing, and the right thing is really controversial, and I understand why not everybody supports what we\u2019re doing, and I appreciate what they\u2019re saying and the way they feel, and I just hope they understand I\u2019m doing the best I can. We\u2019re doing the best we can.\u201d\n\nA wild horse, caught during gather operations, tries to escape while awaiting transport to a temporary holding facility, in the Devil's Garden section of the Modoc National Forest. Wild horses roam on the land of the Modoc National Forest. Wildlife biologist Colton Wise, from the Institute for Wildlife Studies, scours the ground for the remains of a horse potentially eaten by a mountain lion. Top: A wild horse, caught during gather operations, tries to escape while awaiting transport to a temporary holding facility in the Devil's Garden section of Modoc National Forest. Left: Wild horses roam in the national forest. Right: Wildlife biologist Colton Wise, from the Institute for Wildlife Studies, scours the ground for the remains of a horse potentially eaten by a mountain lion known as M166. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)\n\nM166 is doing the best he can to kill horses \u2014 about one per week. A husky cat, M166 has a strong jaw and thick neckline. When he was captured and collared, the puma weighed 138 pounds \u2014 similar in weight to an adult male St. Bernard.\n\nHe measured 7.25 feet from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail, a typical length for a male mountain lion.\n\nHis horse-killing canine teeth were a little longer than an inch, 30 millimeters long. At the time of capture, he had a chip out of his upper right canine, a tear in his right ear and some scars on his neck and left side.\n\nNo one knows where M166 was born \u2014 or how he learned to kill horses. But biologists have found that after a big cat dines equine, they\u2019re less enthusiastic about cervine.\n\n\u201cOnce they get a young horse, I think they realize, \u2018Oh my gosh, this is way easier than a deer,\u2019\u201d said Meeghan Gray, a biology professor at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno who has studied wild horses and mountain lions. \u201cAnd so they tend to specialize.\u201d\n\nMale mountain lions will generally leave their mother\u2019s territory, and they can travel significant distances. Two collared juvenile males in Northern California have traveled about 100 miles from their mother's territory.\n\nAll the horses M166 killed were younger than 14 months. The largest horse he is documented to have killed was about 350 pounds. Mustangs are generally on the smaller side of horses, usually weighing between 700 and 900 pounds. Larger wild horses might weigh 1,000 pounds. Their foals are much smaller, about 100 pounds or less.\n\nM166 spends at least three days at a kill site, but acts as though he\u2019s confident his food source will remain abundant: he usually eats a small part of the horse, maybe a haunch, before moving on.\n\nThis mountain lion, known as M166, lives in Modoc National Forest and mainly feeds off wild horses in the Devil's Garden. In this photo, he is just about to wake up and scamper off after being anesthetized so that wildlife biologists can record his vitals. Institute for Wildlife Studies\n\nBecause of this, M166 creates a food chain, leaving much of his kills for the coyotes, bobcats and vultures who readily swoop in when he leaves.\n\nBeyond horses, his food options include deer, generally plentiful in Modoc, and pronghorn antelope. Pronghorn can see nearly 300 degrees around them without moving their head or eyes, and they can detect movement up to four miles away. They are also the fastest land mammals in North America, known to reach speeds of up to 60 mph.\n\nAnd M166, evidently, does not like fast food.\n\nBy comparison, the mountain lions living in the Santa Monica Mountains and surrounding Southern California region kill mostly deer, eating the carcass for three to five days before leaving. They also kill goats and sheep if there\u2019s no guard dog to scare them off.\n\n\u201cWhenever they make a kill, with deer, for example, they\u2019ll go in right in the abdominal cavity, and they\u2019ll eat the heart, the liver, all of that first,\u201d said Jeff Sikich, a biologist with the National Park Service who studies mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. \u201cThey\u2019ll push the stomach contents and intestines off to the side, they don\u2019t consume that, and then they\u2019ll go for the meat. That\u2019s pretty typical cat behavior, in terms of how they feed.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unknown whether the removal of 1,000 horses from the Devil\u2019s Garden will alter M166\u2019s appetite.\n\nMany in Modoc hope M166 doesn\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one mountain lion that we know of, and they say it is eating about one horse a week,\u201d said Laura Snell, Modoc County director at UC Cooperative Extension. \u201cBut even at those numbers, we\u2019re not even making a dent really at all in the population.\u201d\n\nA mountain lion is an apex predator, and its greatest threat, arguably, is humans.\n\nTo many, this is cattle country. In the spring, a cattle drive might cause a brief traffic jam, as a few ranchers who live close enough to public grazing lands in Modoc National Forest still use their method to move cows.\n\nWhen a mountain lion kills livestock, it can be hunted down if the California Department of Fish and Wildlife issues a depredation permit. In 2017, three mountain lions were killed in Modoc County under these permits.\n\nFortunately for M166, cattle does not seem to be on the menu.\n\nThe mountain lion known as M166 stands over his most recent kill, a young horse. Even in a part of California with one of the densest cougar populations, M166 can only do so much.

    "authors": [
      "Ralph Vartabedian"
    ],
    "text": "My son, Marc, and I had tromped through shin-deep snow for several hours, and by the time we reached the blustery top of the peak, we couldn\u2019t see more than 25 feet because of a whiteout.\n\nSomewhere in front of us was a deep crater and the surrounding peaks of a volcanic rim we had hoped to reach. But as we stood on one of the highest peaks in the Armenian Caucasus Mountains, we were satisfied we had made it this far.\n\nFor much of the last century, nobody would have considered the former Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic a hiking destination.\n\nBut a few decades of independence and a strengthening democratic government have given the little nation a growing reputation as an interesting, safe hiking place. We met hikers from France, England, Canada, Belgium and Australia in just a few days on the trails.\n\nSimilarities, differences\n\nSweeping vistas and lush forests draw hikers to Dilijan National Park in Armenia. Marc Vartabedian\n\nSmithsonian magazine earlier this year identified Armenia as one of the next world-class hiking destinations.\n\nThe country\u2019s beautifully wooded Dilijan National Park resembles Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The plateaus of volcanic Mt. Aragats look something like the Sierra Nevada\u2019s high country, with its barren igneous rock, gravelly slopes and snow-covered peaks.\n\nLake Sevan is twice as large as Lake Tahoe and a thousand feet higher in elevation. Though its waters don\u2019t have the clarity that makes Tahoe so spectacular, you won\u2019t find a traffic jam around the lake\u2019s perimeter or dense neighborhoods of mansions.\n\nWhat the country lacks in affluence is offset by the warmth of the people, whose identity is anchored to its long history. Yerevan, the capital, was founded in 782 B.C., decades before Rome. Between hikes, you can visit ancient temples and some of the oldest Christian churches in the world.\n\nBut anyone who frequents California\u2019s well-traveled mountains would find a few surprises and challenges in hiking or climbing in Armenia.\n\nSevanavank Monastery on Lake Sevan, consisting of two churches built in the 9th century, is one of the most visited sites in Armenia. Marc Vartabedian\n\nYou often will not find marked trail heads. The weather will be unpredictable. The flora will be foreign. You might end up driving your rental car across a boulder- strewn mountain river to get near a trail. If you find a topographic map, it will probably be written in Armenian \u2014 which doesn\u2019t use the Latin alphabet.\n\nJust how surprising traveling around Armenia could get dawned on me when Marc and I rented a car in early June in Yerevan, and the rental agent warned me that my California driver\u2019s license wasn\u2019t strictly legal.\n\nIf I was stopped by police, he said, just offer money. How much, I asked? About $10 would be more than enough. Now that\u2019s the kind of advice you don\u2019t get at a U.S. rental counter. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t needed.\n\nJust to get to Armenia requires a long flight that takes you to a place that\u2019s 11 hours ahead of California. That\u2019s important in planning strenuous hiking, because it takes awhile to get over that day-to-night jet lag.\n\nBut the country rewards those who make the effort. It will be a liberating experience from the crowded trails, packed parking lots and scarce back-country permits in California. In fact, you won\u2019t need any permits in Armenia.\n\nWild poppies and other flowers bloom in Armenia. Ralph Vartabedian\n\nTime to hike\n\nI had long searched for a good reason to visit Armenia. As I grew up in Detroit, my father often reminisced about growing up in the Caucasus Mountains in the early 20th century. Marc had just completed graduate school and had a one-week window to join me in Armenia. He spent a week surfing in Indonesia and flew west, and I flew east.\n\nAfter a day of exploring Yerevan on foot, we planned for three or four days of hiking. On the way to Dilijan National Park, we stopped at the Sevanavank Monastery, two 1,100-year-old stone churches overlooking Sevan Lake.\n\nWe also did two hikes in Dilijan, one to pleasant back-country Gosh Lake, along the Transcaucasian Trail, or TCT. We met a Canadian hiker at the lake, who seemed lost. He joined us, and we gave him a ride back to the city of Dilijan.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nA few days later, I met park superintendent Armen Abrahamyan at the park\u2019s headquarters just outside Dilijan. The park now has 124 miles of trails, about half of them on the TCT, he said. Some of them are Jeep roads, although we didn\u2019t encounter vehicle traffic on our hikes. The TCT will eventually extend from Georgia through Armenia, covering 1,864 miles and connecting existing and future national parks.\n\nThe second hike took us to the ruins of the 11th century Jukhtak Monastery, deep in a forest. I imagined how people, isolated from the rest of the world, would hike to that mountaintop 1,000 years ago. It seemed such a far cry from driving to a church parking lot these days.\n\nThe main objective of our trip was Mt. Aragats, the highest peak in the country, about an hour\u2019s drive east of Yerevan.\n\nI found a crude digital topographic map of Aragats on the internet that a graphic artist at The Times was kind enough to print. I wasn\u2019t sure there was an actual trail, and we didn\u2019t have time to find our own route.\n\nI quickly realized we would need a guide. A hiking brochure, produced under the sponsorship of the U.S. Agency for International Development, advised guides for many of the much less ambitious hikes in Armenia. The only problem was finding a good one.\n\nI talked with Armenian travel agents, Armenian journalists and Armenian aid officials. I found hiking guides online and tried to email them. I talked with a couple of guys with the Armenian Hiking Society whom I\u2019d met on the Sam Merrill Trail above Altadena.\n\nOur camp site near Kari Lake at about 10,000 feet elevation. Ralph Vartabedian\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I got to Armenia that things fell into place and I met Hovik Mizrakyan, a jewelry designer and strong hiker affiliated with FindArmenia.com. Marc and I camped the night before at sub-alpine Kari Lake. There were no fire pits, picnic tables, fee stations or infrastructure you\u2019d expect when car camping. Mizrakyan would meet us the next morning.\n\nWe met a group of Belgians camping nearby, led by Nver Avetisyan, a friendly mountain guide. He drove the only Dodge Caravan we saw on our trip. (\u201cI like American cars,\u201d he said.) He invited us into his dining tent for some tea and coffee. We brought a bag of ripe cherries we had bought earlier and talked about the future of democracy in Armenia.\n\nMt. Aragats has four peaks, the highest being the North summit, at 13,420 feet. It was still snow-covered in mid-June and would have required a 6,000-foot vertical climb in one day or an overnight stay in the crater. Either way, we would be traversing deep, soft snow.\n\nThe weather wasn\u2019t cooperating. The Caucasus Mountains can be unpredictably stormy, with violent lightning. In the morning, the storm clouds roiled. So we nixed climbing Aragats North and chose the much tamer Aragats South, at 12,756 feet. We weren\u2019t disappointed.\n\nLandscape view of Mt. Aragats in spring in Armenia. Tigran Hayrapetyan / Getty Images\n\nOur hiking trip barely scratched the surface of what Armenia\u2019s four national parks have to offer. I ran out of time before we could get to Arevik National Park along the southern border. Maybe some day I\u2019ll try again for Aragats North, knowing I\u2019ll need more time.\n\nEven in the Sierra, you sometimes have to try more than once to reach a peak.\n\nIf you go\n\nTHE BEST WAY TO YEREVAN, ARMENIA\n\nFrom LAX,\n\nFrom LAX, Aeroflot, Air France, Qatar, Austrian, Lot, KLM and Delta offer connecting service (change of planes) to Yerevan. Restricted round-trip fares start at $1,122, including all taxes and fees.\n\nTELEPHONES\n\nTo call the numbers below from the United States, dial 011 (the international calling code), 374 (the country code for Armenia) and the local number.\n\nMy Verizon iPhone would not work in Armenia. My son\u2019s AT&T iPphone worked fine. Be sure to arrange an international calling plan before you leave.\n\nWHERE TO STAY\n\nIbis Yerevan Center Hotel, 5/1 Northern Ave., Yerevan: 10-59-59-59. Discount European hotel; doubles from $65.\n\nAvan Dzoraget Hotel, 1st Street, Building 127, Village Dzoraget; 93-94-78-89. Awesome hotel north of Yerevan. Part of the Tufenkian Heritage Hotels chain. Doubles from $151.\n\nWHERE TO EAT\n\nLahmajun Gaidz, 5 Nalbandyan, Yerevan; 77-33-21-18. Terrific lunch fare (we tried lamb and beef lahmajun, a kind of Armenian pizza) just off Republic Square. Lunch for two was less than $10.\n\nFor the hikes, we had brought energy bars with us. When we camped, we bought some shawarma wraps (meat wrapped in pita).\n\nGEAR\n\nIf you are planning to day hike, you\u2019ll obviously want the standard equipment: day pack, lightweight boots, good rain gear, water bottles, sunscreen and lots of moisture-wicking clothes. If you are backpacking, keep in mind that camping stove gas will be difficult to find and that you can\u2019t take it with you on the plane.\n\nTO LEARN MORE\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

He\u2019d driven by it with his father, who restored old homes.\n\n\u201cI was amazed, \u201c he said of the diminutive replica. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was, but I wanted to do just that.\u201d\n\nWhen Christmas came, he asked his parents for a kit to make a miniature two-story log cabin. Next came a Victorian, followed by a farmhouse.\n\nArtist Chris Toledo has built a bite-size house with hopes that his creation will one day help him buy him a real house. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAt home in Alhambra, Toledo would spend months building each structure, then use money he\u2019d earned from chores to furnish every space. In Yucaipa, where his family often camped, there was a miniatures store, where he\u2019d go to buy petite floral sofas, chests of drawers and china cabinets.\n\nHis parents, immigrants from Argentina, hoped it was a calling.\n\n\u201cWe were convinced he\u2019d be an architect,\u201d said his mother, Liliana Eschoyez.\n\nInstead, he grew up to work in fashion, photography and later in his current field, graphic design.\n\nFour years ago, after a long pause, he returned to building the little houses that had brought him such boyhood joy.\n\nBut this time, ready-made kits would no longer be enough. He wanted to create an entire tiny home from scratch.\n\nIt was supposed to be a hobby, until he saw it might be more.\n\nArtist Chris Toledo is reflected in the mirror inside the guest bathroom. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) Artist Chris Toledo peeks into the living room of the miniature home he has built piece by tiny piece. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) Artist Chris Toledo is reflected in the mirror inside the guest bathroom (left). Toledo peeks into the living room of the grand but tiny home he has built. (right). (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nToledo\u2019s plan was to build a two-story, two-bedroom Spanish villa, a vision he\u2019d formed from watching Bob Villa restore a Spanish home on TV and spending hours driving around ogling grand estates in Hancock Park and South Pasadena.\n\n\u201cI imagined I was a wealthy person in the 1920s ... who moved to Los Angeles to build a home for my family. This would be my castle,\u201d he said.\n\nOn miniaturist sites, there are plenty of examples of Victorian homes and English cottages. Spanish dwellings are rare. So Toledo had to make things up as he went.\n\nEverything his father taught him about carpentry, painting and metal work came in handy. So did the hours he spent watching YouTube tutorials and home restoration shows.\n\nTo build scroll railings, he taught himself to solder bits of brass \u2014 beads, wire and charms he sourced online.\n\nTo make six different types of terra-cotta and ceramic tiles, he tried nearly 20 methods \u2014 including flattening clay on a pasta machine. He ended up hand-painting each tile and laser-etching the grout lines.\n\nTo get precise measurements for his barrel roof, he scrambled onto the rooftop of his two-story apartment building.\n\n\u201cIf something wasn\u2019t just right,\u201d Toledo said, \u201cI\u2019d literally tear it down and build the whole thing over again.\u201d\n\nTools took over the guest-room closet: saw, drill, soldering iron. Shelves filled up with paint cans, spackle pastes and sculpting clay.\n\nIn one corner, he set up a big laser cutter he bought for $3,500 on EBay. In another, a table to do the tiniest tasks, such as attaching 10-millimeter hinges to wooden doors less than 7 inches tall.\n\nTo afford everything he needed, he sold some of his clothes and miniature furniture he\u2019d collected since he was a boy. He lived modestly. But the costs added up, into the hundreds, then thousands.\n\nThere were times when Toledo grew so overwhelmed by the house, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to go near it. Sometimes, too, it looked so lifelike and perfect from the outside that it was painful knowing that he\u2019d never live inside.\n\nA sneak peek of his freshly tiled staircase, a close-up of his hand-painted ceiling beams, a wide shot of his living room, washed in the electric glow of his scroll work sconces \u2014 Toledo started posting images on Instagram and Facebook. Each carried a little clue to show the scale \u2014 a quarter leaning on the fountain, a Super Glue bottle in the corner of the guest room, a pencil lying wall-to-wall across the kitchen.\n\nThe comments began to roll in.\n\n\u201cEverything is so real! I imagine it on a hill above Montecito.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've come back again and again to gaze into this scene.\u201d\n\nOne person went so far as to call him \u201cthe Michelangelo of miniatures.\u201d\n\nHis fan base grew to nearly 40,000. Other miniaturists took notice. They marveled at his precision, his technique, his ability to constantly outdo himself \u2014 aged plaster on the walls, glistening tile on the kitchen ceiling. When Toledo posted photos of himself beside the home, they marveled that he was so young \u2014 and male.\n\nThe miniature world is full of women, many from the East Coast.\n\nHe made friends with Bridgette, whose specialty is teensy-weensy cats, mice and bunnies; June, who fashions French Baroque furniture; Barbara, who does wonders with stained glass.\n\nSoon, Toledo had become a new star.\n\nA fireplace in the living room is viewed through the window. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) Artist Chris Toledo peeks thru the front door of his latest piece. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) A fireplace in the living room is viewed through the window (left). Artist Chris Toledo peeks through the front door of his latest piece (right). (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cThe kid is astonishingly talented,\u201d said Bradley Meinke, who lives in Missouri and is the head of the Cat\u2019s Meow Miniature Society, a group with about 350 members. \u201cIf he sticks with it, he\u2019s going to be in the upper echelon of the miniature world.\u201d\n\nThe upper echelon, Toledo learned, is a rarefied place. It includes those who make the sort of intricate edifices Kay Browning began acquiring in the 1970s and displays in her museum in Maysville, Ky.\n\nBrowning recently came across Casa California\u2019s black-and-white-tiled bathroom online.\n\nThe space instantly transported her to her Greek Revival childhood home.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel very comfortable and warm inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI really wanted to have it.\u201d\n\nSo she commissioned Toledo to build that childhood bathroom. They have yet to discuss a price.\n\nBrowning\u2019s miniature world includes buildings that have sold for more than $200,000. Some collectors have been known to take out mortgages to buy such properties. Others pay interior designers large sums to outfit their interiors.\n\nBrowning says one furnished piece, her ancestral home in Cheshire, England, is worth close to $500,000.\n\nMatthew Mathiasen and his partner, artist Chris Toledo, with Toledo's latest piece, a 1920s Spanish Mediterranean miniature home that Toledo has spent the last two years building. Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times\n\nToledo and Mathiasen long to own a piece of Los Angeles \u2014 a real house they can settle into after they marry this fall.\n\nNow they realize that Casa California may be their best bet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine art,\u201d said Mathiasen, who works as a fashion sales manager. \u201cIt can be worth a lot.\u201d\n\nAt first, he didn\u2019t fully understand. He thought of miniatures as toys.\n\nSometimes he\u2019d wander into Toledo\u2019s workspace and tinker around in the tiny bathroom. He\u2019d accidentally break the leg off a tub, the faucet off a sink. Toledo would stare at him, dead silent.\n\n\u201cHe and the cat are the two household members forbidden from entering my studio,\u201d Toledo said.\n\nEvery week, the couple hunt for properties on Zillow. Their phones buzz all the time with new listings.\n\nBut in L.A., their maximum price of $600,000 is pretty much entry-level.\n\nSo the homes they can afford with the kind of charm Toledo wants are in sketchy neighborhoods or have major problems: water damage, faulty foundations, kitchens and bathrooms that are total gut jobs.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, the two hit the road in Mathiasen\u2019s Mazda to do what they often do: drive around Hancock Park and worship the houses.\n\nDown wide, commodious June Street, the two sighed and craned their necks to catch a glimpse of every entryway and balcony.\n\n\u201cLook at the Tudor over there,\u201d Toledo said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s stunning,\u201d said Mathiasen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a buffet of gorgeous houses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI literally want every single one.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re hopeful a collector might shell out as much as $80,000 for Casa California \u2014 which would go a long way toward a down payment.\n\nNot on a house of its grandeur \u2014 with splendid stained glass and tile, said Toledo.\n\n\u201cMaybe a little Spanish bungalow we can fix up over time.\u201d\n\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

    "authors": [
      "Rosanna Xia"
    ],
    "text": "After more than three decades of stops and stalls, the state this week made clear the fight for beach access at Hollister Ranch is far from over.\n\nCoastal officials revived efforts to create a long-delayed public path while also preventing a family from building on its slice of the ranch until all visitors can enjoy the 8.5 miles of secluded Santa Barbara County coastline.\n\nEarlier this year, the fight for access to some of the state\u2019s most unspoiled beaches seemed like a done deal in favor of ranch owners, who have long contended the environment has benefited from their private stewardship. A controversial state deal ceded a contested claim to access by land, and a veto by Gov. Jerry Brown last month was cheered by Hollister as a victory.\n\nBut mounting outrage from beachgoers has kept the pressure on.\n\n\u201cBecause of the public outcry, I think every commissioner is of one mind that we are resolved to finally, one way or the other, get real public access by land through Hollister Ranch,\u201d California Coastal Commissioner Aaron Peskin said.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of policy, this commission is resolved to say that either Hollister Ranch is going to provide public access or we are going to interpret the law to say that there should be no future development there.\u201d\n\nThe commission\u2019s latest strategy relies on an access program for Hollister Ranch that the state had adopted in 1982 after a complicated legislative history and a long standoff with resistant landowners.\n\nRead more: California beaches are supposed to be public. So why is the Hollister Ranch coast an exception? \u00bb\n\nWith 14,500 acres connected only by private roads, ranch owners at the time had argued it was impossible for each of them, as required by the Coastal Act, to provide a public route to the beach every time they sought a permit to build.\n\nThey challenged this in court, saying that individual lot owners were unable to do so because the common roads were controlled by a third party \u2014 the Hollister Ranch Owners Assn.\n\nSo lawmakers added a special section to the Coastal Act, allowing owners to pay a fee instead that would fund a ranch-wide access program that the state would implement \u201cas expeditiously as possible.\u201d\n\nThe 1982 program included a walking trail and bicycle lane that would run parallel to the ranch's main private road. To minimize the number of cars \u2014 in the interest of privacy and environmental protection \u2014 a bus would operate from nearby Gaviota State Park to six Hollister beaches, where there would be picnic areas and bathrooms.\n\nFacing pushback, officials agreed to implement the plan in three phases. A cap was also set on the number of people allowed on the ranch each day, beginning with 100 people in phase one and a maximum of 500 in phase three.\n\nRead the 1982 Hollister Ranch coastal access plan \u00bb\n\nBut \u201cas expeditiously as possible\u201d turned into 36 years and counting. The standoff continued until the issue faded from institutional memory and public scrutiny.\n\nJon Schleuss / Los Angeles Times\n\nFor decades, many Californians accepted without question that Hollister Ranch was a private oasis that sometimes granted access to scientists, academics, historical societies, environmental groups and schoolchildren. Owners have said managing access is what has allowed the ranch to remain environmentally special.\n\nThe push for greater access had gone quiet until this year, when coastal officials agreed to a settlement that kept the ranch\u2019s coastline closed off to everyone but landowners, their guests, select groups and those strong enough to paddle or boat in through treacherous waters.\n\nAfter a flood of public outcry, lawmakers introduced legislation that would have recommitted the state to the 1982 access program and clarified a funding source. It also laid the foundation for more aggressive strategies, such as acquiring private land for public use through eminent domain.\n\nThe governor acknowledged the spirit of these efforts, but in a veto message last week said the 1982 plan was outdated. He urged officials to draft a more contemporary strategy.\n\nCoastal officials said the 1982 plan laid a strong groundwork and remains relevant today. If anything, they said, there\u2019s room to update the program to provide greater access.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s commission meeting, held in downtown San Diego, the agency announced it has created a team to update the program as quickly as possible. The goal is to have something ready early next year \u2014 in time for the next legislative session, executive director Jack Ainsworth said.\n\nMonte Ward, president of the ranch owners group, which represents more than 1,000 owners, cited Brown\u2019s veto and said in a statement that \u201cthe 1982 Hollister Ranch Access Plan is outdated. We hope that the State reaches out to us to coordinate regarding the contents of a revised plan.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, officials at the State Lands Commission have been looking into their own legal authorities, which include eminent domain proceedings, land exchanges or negotiating new boundary lines.\n\nRead more: Amid backlash, Coastal Commission asks state to 'explore all potential options' to open Hollister Ranch to the public \u00bb\n\nThe Coastal Commission\u2019s commitment to finish what was promised in 1982 came the same day officials voted unanimously to overrule a permit that had been issued by Santa Barbara County \u2014 citing for the first time in decades that a condition of any permit at Hollister Ranch, under the Coastal Act, is providing beach access through the ranch in a timely manner.\n\nThe move marks yet another front in the fight for access.\n\nMark Shields, whose family sought the permit to build a house, guesthouse and footbridge, said they had spent years coming up with a reasonable project, followed all the rules, and are now unfairly being swept into this larger battle at the ranch.\n\n\u201cWe respect the fact that coastal access is the right of all Californians. We understand that the larger issue in play, the question of Hollister Ranch access, is the source of our troubles,\u201d Shields wrote in a letter to the commission. \u201cPlease know that we are simply a family who has worked hard, loves California, and wants to complete a heartfelt family compound before we are too old to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nHis family\u2019s project, he said, is being overruled by \u201cwhat appeared to be solely political reasons, citing issues which we have no control over nor ability to rectify.\u201d\n\nThe ranch owners association echoed these sentiments, saying in a statement that the permit had been approved without opposition from Santa Barbara County. The group added that \u201cthe Shields\u2019 parcel is over a mile inland, so the Coastal Commission appeal seeks public beach access over land that the Shields do not own.\u201d\n\nRead more: Coastal advocates challenge deal that bars public from reaching Hollister Ranch by land \u00bb\n\nThese pleas drew little sympathy from coastal advocacy groups, which are fighting for greater access through a court intervention. In their own letter to the commission, advocates said that \u201cpublic coastal access at Hollister Ranch is long overdue, and the County\u2019s mishandling of [coastal development permits] including [the Shields family\u2019s] has hindered establishing that access.\u201d\n\nPeskin, one of the commissioners who initiated the vote to overrule the permit, said this issue has gone on for almost four decades and the writing is on the wall.\n\n\u201cIf there was one message that came out of today\u2019s meeting,\u201d he said, \u201cit's a very bright message to the Hollister Ranch Owners Assn. that it's time to work things out.\u201d\n\nrosanna.xia@latimes.com\n\nInterested in coastal issues?
