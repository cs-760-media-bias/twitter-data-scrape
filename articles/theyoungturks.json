    "text": "\n\nFormer Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper speaks in lower downtown Denver on March 6, 2019. He is among a growing number of male presidential candidates being asked whether they would commit to naming a female running mate. (David Zalubowski)\n\nDemocrats, badly bruised by their failure to make Hillary Clinton the nation\u2019s first female president in 2016, are in a delicate position: Do they make another go at the glass ceiling in 2020 or do they do what their party did for the first 188 years of its history and gravitate toward someone with a Y chromosome?\n\nAnd if they settle on a man, can they still be the party of gender diversity?\n\nJust how hazardous these dilemmas may prove in the Democratic contest became clear on Wednesday, when John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado, was asked what is becoming a stock question for men seeking the Democratic nomination: whether they would choose a female running mate if they thwarted plans for a female standard-bearer.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the mild-mannered 67-year-old centrist, who went from geologist to brewer to politician, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash in a town hall in Atlanta. He would have a bevy of options. Already six women are White House contenders.\n\nThen he tried to flip the script, succeeding mainly in illustrating how fraught the gender politics of the Democratic primary are shaping up to be.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll ask you another question,\u201d he said. \u201cBut how come we\u2019re not asking, more often, the women, \u2018Would you be willing to put a man on the ticket?\u2019\u201d\n\nAsked by Dana Bash if he would vow to put a woman on his presidential ticket, John Hickenlooper replied, \u201cOf course,\u201d and then said, \u201cHow come we\u2019re not asking, more often, the women, \u2018Would you be willing to put a man on the ticket?\u2019\u201d #CNNTownHall pic.twitter.com/AC7hWtyZ7D \u2014 CNN (@CNN) March 21, 2019\n\nThe remark elicited what sounded like a shout of disapproval from the audience. Many observers \u2014 including members of the media in Denver, where Hickenlooper got his political start as mayor \u2014 interpreted the query as tone-deaf, revealing a lack of sensitivity about the historic underrepresentation of women in politics.\n\nOn Twitter, the statement was termed a \u201chickenblooper.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he'd put a woman on his ticket, @Hickenlooper asked whether the female candidates are being asked if they'll put a man on their ticket. Woof. #copolitics \u2014 Kyle Clark (@KyleClark) March 21, 2019\n\nAfter the event, the Democrat told a CNN reporter that he had intended to criticize the premise of the question, which he said discounted a woman\u2019s chances of rising to the top of the ticket \u2014 and therefore facing the vice president choice herself. \u201cPeople can take it out of context,\u201d he said. In response to a request from The Washington Post, a campaign spokeswoman pointed to the candidate\u2019s clarification.\n\nWhether his observation was ahead of the curve or woefully behind, it spoke to Democratic sensitivities about the cause of gender diversity. So, too, it captured a fierce debate about contrasting expectations for male and female political aspirants, now expected to broadcast their intimate lives on social media as they compete for the chance to try their hand against a president who became famous on reality television. These questions have taken on new significance as a record-breaking number of female candidates seek the Democratic nomination, following the historic number of women who entered midterm races last fall.\n\nI ran @HillaryClinton\u2019s Instagram account for the 2016 campaign & you never saw posts like these from us because:\n\n\n\n1) The reaction would have been absurdly sexist\n\n\n\n2) There *aren\u2019t* photos like this of HRC b/c she knew there are different rules for men & women running for office pic.twitter.com/bs4EbvIrep \u2014 John Buysse (@JohnBuysse) March 19, 2019\n\nHickenlooper, who is barely registering in early polls, is not alone in being asked whether he would put a woman on the ticket.\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey was unequivocal in an appearance Wednesday on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should be a ticket that reflects the diversity of this country \u2014 gender diversity, race diversity,\" Booker, 49, said. \"And if I am elected as the nominee, I\u2019m going to make sure there is gender diversity on the ticket.\u201d\n\nPart of his motivation, he explained, owed to the fact that he \u201cwanted there to be a woman president in 2016. It\u2019s unfortunate that there wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSome of his male competitors have signaled that they are thinking along similar lines but declined to make a commitment.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman whose failed Senate bid last year drove historic turnout among minorities and young voters, was pressed by a voter on Saturday after a house party in Dubuque, Iowa, about picking a woman to be his running mate.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who entered the presidential race last week, has already learned a lesson about the centrality of issues of representation in the crowded Democratic field. He was forced to apologize on Friday for joking on the campaign trail that his wife was raising their kids, \u201csometimes with my help.\u201d Showing contrition during the taping of a podcast in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, he said, \u201cI have enjoyed white privilege.\u201d\n\nAs O\u2019Rourke, 46, considered his response about a potential running mate, a woman off-screen chimed in, \u201cI need a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see a reason why I would not do that,\u201d said O\u2019Rourke, who raised more than $6.1 million on the first day of his campaign. \u201cBut talking about who I would pick as vice president just feels really premature.\u201d\n\nThe man in Dubuque continued to press the candidate, saying a woman needed to be on the ticket.\n\n\u201cI hear you. Again that would be my preference,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI feel like it would be very presumptuous for me to talk about who I would select as vice president right now. But your point is taken.\u201d\n\nAnd in February, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent who lost a spirited primary bid to Clinton in 2016, said he would aim to balance out the ticket, in terms of not just gender but also age.\n\n\"I think we would look for somebody who is maybe not of the same gender that I am, and maybe somebody who might be a couple of years younger than me,\u201d the 77-year-old said in an appearance on \u201cThe Young Turks,\u201d a progressive online news show.\n\nBeyond gender and racial diversity, Democrats are also grappling with a generational question \u2014 whether to send someone of President Trump\u2019s age cohort into the ring with him, or whether to put forward a fresher face. The party has an opportunity to nominate a millennial in Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who would also be the nation\u2019s first gay president.\n\nButtigieg, 37, has denounced Vice President Pence, who hails from his home state, as a \u201ccheerleader of the porn star presidency,\u201d but hasn\u2019t confirmed the demographic profile of the person he would choose to be his No. 2.\n\nMatt Viser contributed to this report.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nAn 88-year-old ex-senator is the newest Democratic dark horse thanks to the \u2018acerbic\u2019 teens running his Twitter\n\nShe seemed like a normal Web-savy teen. She was actually waging \u2018e-jihad\u2019 with ISIS hackers.\n\nIt\u2019s a 'magic fridge!\u2019: Men find ice-cold beers in a field after long hours cleaning up Nebraska flood wreckage"

O'Rourke's campaign later corrected the average donation size, saying it was actually $48. By comparison, Sanders\u2019 campaign said its first-day haul came from over 223,000 individual donors for an average contribution size of $27.\n\nWhile O'Rourke didn't elaborate on what he meant by unique contributions, the measure is generally regarded as different from the number of individual donors.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nO\u2019Rourke first announced Monday that he had raised $6.1 million in the opening 24 hours of his campaign. That figure was $5.9 million for Sanders.\n\nO\u2019Rourke built a small-dollar donor army with his blockbuster U.S. Senate campaign last year. But Sanders has also proven to be a fundraising phenomenon and accumulated a more massive base of small-dollar donors during his 2016 presidential bid.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of individual donors Bernie Sanders' campaign reported for the first 24 hours of his campaign."

    ],
    "text": "Cenk Uygur is subscribing to the idea that Kellyanne Conway is using her husband George as a vehicle to tell the truth about President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Young Turks held a conversation on Monday about Mr. Conway, who\u2019s been active on Twitter lately disparaging the president\u2019s mental health and accusing him of having narcissistic personality disorder. Uygur called this is a \u201cvery clear warning\u201d from Conway since it matches what former White House insiders have already disclosed about Trump being \u201cunstable.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Uygur presented his view that Mr. Conway\u2019s tweets should really not surprise people since they\u2019re most than likely based on what his wife tells him about her job.\n\n\u201cMark my words\u2026Kellyanne Conway will claim afterward \u2018I was trying to send you guys signals,'\u201d Uygur said. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s my husband! I went home and told him the guys a lunatic! Tell everybody! It\u2019ll be obvious it\u2019s coming from me!'\u201d\n\nUygur guessed that Mrs. Conway will eventually use that claim as an \u201cexcuse\u201d to sell the idea that she was secretly working from the inside to inform the country about Trump. He also supposed that Kellyanne will refer to her public defenses of Trump as a \u201ccomically over-the-top\u201d persona, which she will leverage and then discard so she can land a new job on TV after the White House.\n\nAna Kasparin gave a degree of credence to the theory since it assumes that Mrs. Conway will free herself up through plausible deniability after extorting her White House gig as much as possible. Uygur advised people to not buy into Conway in that scenario, saying that ploy is insufficient compared to Conway saying outright that the 25th Amendment should be used against Trump.\n\nSince this segment aired, Trump and Mr. Conway are now fighting with each other directly, exchanging barbs on Twitter.\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Ken Meyer (@KenMeyer91) on Twitter\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com"

The Young Turks reports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He is filled with bigotry. It's not a debate,\" Cenk Uygur said on The Young Turks while talking about Donald Trump's response to the mass shooting in New Zealand and Kellyanne Conway's claims that Trump condemns bigotry and hate.\n\n\"There isn't anything that Trump could do or say that cable news wouldn't debate,\" Uygur said, referencing Trump's Fifth Ave. comments, \"he could say 'you know what I'm Black' and his supporters would go on cable news and go 'orange is the new black, of course he is' and they'll have a debate!\" ...\n\n\n\n\"Remember, after the hate march in Charlottesville, Virginia, he felt the need to refer to 'some of those individuals' as 'very fine people,'\" Kasparian added, \"he stokes fear and encourages violence against minority groups on a regular basis. To say that he condemns hate and evil is ridiculous.\" She then rolled video examples of Trump going after the Muslim community.\n\nWatch Uygur and co-host Ana Kasparian talk about it in the video above."

    "text": "This week Representative Lee Zeldin (R-NY) got a nasty voicemail that insulted him. He felt threatened by it. Wow! If you think that reaction is callous, you should walk a mile in my shoes and see what it\u2019s like to live with right-wing terror every day. What happened to Rep. Zeldin while terrible to the uninitiated is a minuscule fraction of what the right-wing inflicts upon its opponents everyday in America.\n\nI\u2019m the founder and host of The Young Turks, the largest online progressive news show. We put out dozens of videos every day within our network and get back thousands of comments filled with rage, hatred, vitriol and physical threats. The right-wing has professionalized that type of terror, so when they turn around and declare a national emergency when they get one nasty message back, you\u2019ll excuse me if I\u2019m not overly moved by their plight.\n\nIf you think, I am over-dramatizing the situation by using the word terror, you haven\u2019t experienced what we go through every day. Just this past week I got threatening calls on my phone, on top of the literally thousands of hate comments online, and my wife started getting calls on her phone. This is life in the right-wing terror dome. You also might not know how often those hate filled verbal comments turn into physical violence against perceived enemies of the right-wing.\n\nIt\u2019s called stochastic terrorism. That\u2019s a new word I learned. Had to learn. It means terrorism that is generalized, not directed at any one target. So, you encourage general violence for people on your side to partake in - and then random acts of terror start popping up that can\u2019t necessarily be connected back to you but that you incited on purpose. Sound familiar?\n\nIf a host on Fox News or an alt-right pundit online or a President says go do harm to a specific person, that is horrible and actionable. It is illegal and can have consequences for the speaker. If that same host tells you how problematic one group of people are, then repeats it endlessly on a loop and then shows you those people climbing fences to get into your backyard \u2013 and then asks you how mad you are about it and whether you\u2019re going to do something about it, he has not violated any laws. But he has released stochastic terror into the world. If someone happens to act on it, well, I guess he caught a break.\n\nFor visible progressive leaders, there are multiple threats of violence upon us on a daily basis. This has come to be accepted as the new norm. They say we let in the enemy, we encourage the people who would do us harm. Isn\u2019t anyone going to do anything about it?\n\nThink about what percentage of any group is mentally unstable. Now think about a group that are engulfed in conspiracy theories, heavily armed and paranoid by nature. You know they are out there. Weaponized lunatics armed with hate and fear and actual heavy weaponry.\n\nThis is not theoretical. The ADL just put out a report that showed that literally every terror attack where someone got killed in 2018 was done by a right-wing terrorist. The massacre at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh \u2013 a right-wing terrorist who hated Jews and said they were \u201cbring[ing] invaders in that kill our people.\u201d The massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL \u2013 a white-supremacist terrorist who hated blacks and Muslims. The massacre at the Yoga Studio in Tallahassee \u2013 a right-wing terrorist who hated women and minorities.\n\nIf targeting these specific groups with hate-filled propaganda wasn\u2019t enough, then they stoke their rabid followers to target anyone bringing you reporting or facts. Does it get any clearer then calling someone an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d? What do you do someone who is an enemy of the people? You take action against them. Into that toxic stew steps in Cesar Sayoc to send pipe bombs to the media who dare to do their job and to progressives who dare stick their neck out to fight back against right-wing ideology.\n\nNow, think about how much you would want to speak out against the right-wing in a situation like that. Are you willing to have people on the internet tell everyone where you live? Willing to let them paint you as the face of the enemy? No? Well, this is how they win. Then the good are silenced into inaction.\n\nLast we heard, Christina Blasey Ford was moving from one location to another daily to avoid the people threatening her life non-stop. Some of the Sandy Hook parents have had to move several times to try to evade conspiracy theorists egged on by right-wing pundits. Their kids were murdered and now they are stalked themselves. This is what terrorism looks like.\n\nAnd fascism slowly sets in. It creeps into the assumptions of our lives. It starts to control not only our actions but our inactions. With the ever looming threat of violence lurking over your head, you begin to wonder if you should \u201cinvite\u201d trouble by speaking out. It might not be their leaders who take action themselves, it might not be someone who is fair representative of a majority of the group, but they know there is a guy - a guy who is out there. He exists. Waiting. Waiting for us.\n\nThat\u2019s terror. Stochastic terror. And in this country, right-wing terror."

    "text": "\n\nCaleb Brock, right, and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hold a painting with the words \"Abolish ICE\" reversed. (Serlesi Olguin)\n\nCaleb Brock is a budding activist who says he\u2019s already taken part in several protests, though he is just 17.\n\nBut the high school senior took a different political tack for an event hosted by a local tea party group after finding out that Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) would attend. Brock turned on the charm. He told organizers that he was a \u201chuge fan\u201d of Patrick \u2014 and brought a painting that he wanted to give him, that he had covered in a GOP flag.\n\n\u201cI was just like, I want to get a picture with Dan Patrick,\u201d Brock said in an interview.\n\nPatrick eventually came by and told him how much he liked the painting, Brock said.\n\n\u201cI told him, I want you to run for 2020,\u201d Brock said.\n\nAccording to video of the event published by the Young Turks YouTube channel, Patrick did seem pleased with the gift. He stood holding it as another speaker introduced him \u2014 and then brought it onto the stage when he went up to speak. Caleb stood a few paces away.\n\n\u201cI walk in the door, and Caleb, delightful fellow, just met him tonight,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cHe traveled an hour here, and he brought me a painting, he did. And so I want to show you this, it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nPatrick turned the painting around to show it to the audience. It is a messy mix of colors and words; \u201cDan 2020,\u201d it says on one side, along with \u201cprincipled\u201d and \u201cconservative leadership\u201d elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThis is all of the things, like conservative, principled conservative, it\u2019s kind of abstract,\u201d Patrick said, making a joke about running for president of his homeowner\u2019s association. Patrick said he planned to bring the painting in the plane back home.\n\nBut the painting was embedded with two hidden messages: \u201cAbolish ICE,\u201d and \u201cImpeach Trump,\u201d two rallying cries for the far left, were written across its top, visible but hazy, and written backward and thus legible clearly only in a mirror. ICE refers to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThe lieutenant governor had been duped. Brock is not a Patrick fan.\n\nPolitical pranks \u2014 satire brought to life \u2014 are a time-honed tradition in the emotional world of politics, made famous by groups such as the Yes Men and others. Richard Tuck, a longtime Democratic strategist and trickster, was famous for many of these stunts, perhaps foremost among them booking Richard M. Nixon during Nixon\u2019s Senate campaign in 1950 to an empty auditorium. Groups such as the Yippies, a counterculture consortium of pranksters, made waves in the 1960s \u2014 for pranks like when they rained small-denomination bills onto the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange, brokers making a mad dash to pick them up in what made for an effective portrait of greed. In the late 1990s and 2000s, the Yes Men targeted corporations such as Dow Chemical and Halliburton.\n\nBut pranks, which can quickly bleed into the world of hoaxes, misinformation campaigns and other less-savory and underhanded political tricks, have seemed to occupy a less prominent space in recent years as the intensity and nastiness of the political sphere has ramped up.\n\nIt is not clear when Patrick found out about the prank, but the ruse was exposed when the Young Turks wrote about it Wednesday.\n\nPatrick took the trickery in stride.\n\n\u201cI meet lots of young people in my travels around the state, and I always try to engage with them when I can,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis young man\u2019s very elaborate prank \u2014 painting all the letters backward in abstract so it couldn\u2019t be read until it was flipped in a photograph \u2014 and giving it to me as I walked in the door of a speech was certainly clever \u2014 but if that\u2019s the worst that happens on the trail, it has to make you laugh.\u201d\n\nJulie McCarty, president of the NE Tarrant tea party, which hosted the event, said \u201cof course this guy had to sneak and manipulate his way onto the stage.\"\n\n\u201cNobody would willingly give up time and attention for his nonsense,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nBrock said in an interview that he was not a student of political pranks; he just didn\u2019t think the logistics of the event would have allowed him to confront Patrick in another way.\n\n\u201cThis was one of the first ideas that came to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to start a conversation on the topic of the cruel immigration policies we have in this country right now.\u201d\n\nPatrick was chosen solely because of his prominence in the state\u2019s powerful Republican constellation \u2014 and the fact that he was appearing in the Fort Worth suburb of North Richland Hills, about 30 miles south of Brock\u2019s home in Denton.\n\nBrock said he does not know what happened to his painting.\n\nThe high schooler will be a freshman next year at the University of Texas, where he hopes to begin a course of study that will lead to a career as an immigration lawyer. He particularly likes the refugee and immigrant advocacy organization RAICES. He said looks forward to voting after he turns 18 in May.\n\n\u201cWe have an older generation that is viewing youth and dismissing our voices a little bit. They\u2019re saying \u2018They\u2019re too young to really know what\u2019s going on,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cNo, we\u2019re living in this world, and we can all see the atrocities being committed by ICE and this administration.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly indicated the original publisher of the video. It was first published by the Young Turks on YouTube. Editor\u2019s note: We also called the Young Turks a \u201clefty blog,\u201d and that wasn\u2019t very nice. What is a \u201cblog\u201d anymore? I\u2019m not really sure.\n\nRead more:\n\nTucker Carlson says he\u2019s the victim of a powerful bully.

    "text": "The Democratic National Committee sent a clear message when it announced its 2020 convention would be held in Milwaukee: We don't want a repeat of 2016.\n\nThat year, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton lost Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes to Republican Donald Trump \u2013 marking the first time since 1984 that a GOP presidential candidate had won the state. Clinton also lost the Wisconsin primary to Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont democratic socialist who led a surprisingly strong challenge to the Democrats' presumed front-runner.\n\nCritics often blame Clinton's failure to campaign in the state for her loss to Trump in the general election.\n\nNow, as the 2020 race heats up, the Democratic Party has a made a number of changes to its strategy, rules and bylaws as it struggles to manage a primary process with an unwieldy number of candidates, including Sanders.\n\nAs the party seeks a strong challenger to Trump, it faces a delicate balancing act: please its establishment wing, satisfy its expanding base and maintain impartiality.\n\n\"They need to be as transparent as possible,\" said Doug Sosnik, a former senior advisor to President Bill Clinton, to prove \"that they're being an honest broker and not leaning toward one candidate.\"\n\nDNC Chairman Tom Perez, who stepped in after the 2016 election, told CNBC the organization is aware of its past errors and has \"passed the most wide-ranging reforms in decades.\"\n\nHere are the key steps the DNC is taking to repair its damage from the 2016 campaign, from blowback over so-called superdelegates to the Russian email hack."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Cenk Uygur called out Tucker Carlson on The Young Turks Wednesday for what he called the promotion of an anti-semitic trope in his \u2018The Zucker Puppet.\u2019 Carlson\u2019s imagery was in response to CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter, who had harshly criticized Carlson\u2019s non-apology after recent audio clips from Carlson\u2019s past shock-jock interviews came to light.\n\nDuring a Tuesday segment in which Carlson counter-punched against Stelter and the progressive media watchdog Media Matters behind the released clips, the Fox News prime time host featured the following graphic that featured Stelter as a puppet to CNN President Jeff Zucker, who is Jewish-American.\n\nUygur compared this puppet master imagery to 1940s propaganda in Germany. \u201cThat is a deeply anti-semitic trope, it goes back in history a long time of the Jews being puppet masters. Jeff Zucker is a Jewish-American.\u201d Uygur said, calling out Carlson for perpetuating an anti-semitic trope. He added, \u201cthese are the people who claim to be outraged by Ilhan Omar.\u201d\n\nUygur went on to describe Carlson\u2019s segment as an, \u201cover the top counterattack,\u201d and showed a comparison of \u2018The Zucker Puppet\u2019 graphic to propaganda from 1940s Germany of a Jewish puppet master. He then showed two posters from 1940\u2019s Germany that also featured Jewish puppet imagery\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a super clear anti-semitic trope,\u201d Uygur reiterated, before hitting Carlson\u2019s non-apology. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do the right thing here. He didn\u2019t, in any way, show contrition for all the terrible things he has said,\u201d Uygur further explained.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, to double down and use an anti-semitic trope. Totally unacceptable from the people who feigned outrage over Ilhan Omar\u2019s comments.\u201d\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has received a lot of unwanted attention for a series of what many have labeled anti-Semitic tropes, notably suggesting that members of Congress were in support of the pro-Israel lobby because of financial influence, and the suggestion of dual loyalty by some Jewish American members of Congress.\n\nThe Jewish \u201cpuppet master\u201d conspiracy was most recently in the news last year after a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh Synagogue in which the assailant appeared to believe that Jewish billionaire George Soros, who helps to fund many progressive outlets, where funding the caravans of migrants heading to the US Southern border.\n\nWatch above via The Young Turks.\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com"

    ],
    "text": "Newly released documents reveal Immigration and Customs Enforcement is tracking and targeting immigrants through a massive license plate reader database supplied with data from local police departments \u2014 in some cases violating sanctuary laws.\n\nThe documents, obtained by a Freedom of Information lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and released Tuesday, reveal the vehicle surveillance system collects more than a hundred million license plates a month from some of the largest cities in the U.S., including New York and Los Angeles, both of which are covered under laws limiting police cooperation with immigration agencies.\n\nMore than 9,000 ICE agents have access to the database, run by Vigilant Solutions, feeding some six billion vehicle detection records into Thomson Reuters\u2019 investigative platform LEARN, to which police departments can buy access.\n\n\u201cThe public has a right to know when a government agency \u2014 especially an immoral and rogue agency such as ICE \u2014 is exploiting a mass surveillance database that is a threat to the privacy and safety of drivers across the United States,\u201d said Vasudha Talla, staff attorney with the ACLU of Northern California, in an email to TechCrunch.\n\nTalla, who sued ICE to release the documents, said the government \u201cshould not have unfettered access to information that reveals where we live, where we work, and our private habits.\u201d Critics have noted several high-profile cases of police misusing and improperly accessing license plate data.\n\nAutomatic license plate readers (ALPR) scan and detect license plates, along with the time, date and location from thousands of cameras installed across the country to spot criminals and fugitives with warrants out for their arrest. The ACLU previously called it one of the new and emerging forms of mass surveillance in the United States. Companies like Vigilant feed data collected from ALPR cameras into databases accessible to law enforcement and federal agencies, which the ACLU accused ICE of using to find and deport immigrants.\n\nICE has a \u201chot list\u201d of more than 1,100 license plates of suspects, felons or other subjects of interest, according to the documents released. Plates on the hot list trigger an alert to ICE that the vehicle has been spotted, including where and when.\n\n\u201cHot lists are just one method by which ICE agents can track drivers with this system,\u201d said Talla.\n\nICE spokesperson Matthew Bourke said the agency does not break down how many hot list detections led to deportations or removals from the U.S.\n\nThomson Reuters spokesperson Jeff McCoy declined to comment. Vigilant Solutions did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt\u2019s the third effort by ICE to secure access to the database in the past five years, after earlier attempts in 2014 over privacy concerns and 2015 over price negotiations failed. The agency rushed to secure the contract before a planned hike in cost by Thomson Reuters toward the end of 2017.\n\nICE spent $6.1 million on its latest contract in February 2018, gaining access to 80 law enforcement agencies covering almost two-thirds of the U.S. population. To allay fears of potential misuse, the agency was required to pass a revised privacy impact assessment explaining how ICE can and cannot use the license plate data. In one released email to an NPR reporter, ICE said agents \u201ccan only access data\u201d uploaded by police departments if they elect to share it through the system.\n\nBut the ACLU found emails of ICE agents directly contacting local law enforcement officers to ask for license plate search data, circumventing the database.\n\nOver a years-long effort, one ICE agent \u2014 whose name was redacted by the government \u2014 sent several requests to a La Habra police detective by email asking for license plate data.\n\nLa Habra is one of 169 police departments in California, and is one of dozens of departments known to use ALPR. But the city\u2019s police department is not on Vigilant\u2019s list of law enforcement partners that supply license plate data to ICE, the documents show.\n\nWe asked La Habra Chief of Police Jerry Price if turning over records to ICE was in violation of California\u2019s sanctuary status, but he would not comment.\n\n\u201cBy going to local police informally, ICE is able to access locally collected driver location data without having to ask for formal access to the local system through the LEARN network, which could trigger local oversight or concern,\u201d said Talla.\n\nOther police departments were named as partners that actively feed data into the ICE-accessible database, like Upland, Merced and Union City \u2014 three cities in California, which in 2018 passed state-wide laws that offer sanctuary to immigrants who might be in the country illegally or otherwise subject to deportation by ICE. The laws prohibit law enforcement in the state from sharing of license plate data with federal agencies, said Talla.\n\nWhen reached, Union City Police Department chief Victor Derting did not comment. Spokespeople for Upland and Merced police departments did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe ACLU called on the immediate end to the license plate information sharing.\n\nThe documents also revealed how ICE initially considered trying to keep the database a secret, arguing that disclosing the capability would \u201calmost immediately diminish its effectiveness as a law enforcement tool.\u201d\n\nAmid a controversial and questionable national emergency declared by the Trump administration, ICE remains a divisive agency more than ever. Last year, 19 of the top ICE investigators that investigate serious criminal cases, like drug smuggling and sex trafficking rings, called on the government to distance their work from ICE\u2019s enforcement and removal operations unit, which investigates immigration violations and handles deportations.\n\nIn January, TechCrunch revealed dozens of ALPR cameras are still exposed on the internet \u2014 many of which are accessible without a password.\n\nUpdated with Thomson Reuters\u2019 decline to comment"

But Twitter had some fun snarking on the reemergence of this weirdness:\n\nTrump if he ever comments on #FakeMelania: \u201cI have the best body doubles. My body doubles are very strong. I\u2019m the BEST husband. So best that I have two Melanias.\u201d And no, I don't buy the conspiracy. But I'm definitely here for it. \u2014 Ana Kasparian (@AnaKasparian) March 9, 2019\n\nI just checked to see why #FakeMelania was trending\u2026..you really can\u2019t make this stuff up or can you. \u2014 Karine Jean-Pierre (@K_JeanPierre) March 9, 2019\n\nMe after clicking on #FakeMelania thinking there was nothing to it pic.twitter.com/w33cz3uhdr \u2014 Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) March 9, 2019\n\nNext time someone takes a bad photo of me, I\u2019m gonna day it\u2019s my body double.#FakeMelania \u2014 Lisa Guerrero \ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffd (@4lisaguerrero) March 9, 2019\n\nSNL is going to do a fake Melania audition sketch now, aren't they? \u2014 Schooley (@Rschooley) March 9, 2019\n\nMelania Body Double is QAnon for Resistance types.\n\nAlso: who cares? https://t.co/qSu0BJ0NEK \u2014 Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) March 8, 2019\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com"

    "text": "Freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, provoked a high-profile and contentious debate in Washington after she accused pro-Israel lawmakers of pushing \"for allegiance to a foreign country\" in a tweet last weekend.\n\nMany Democrats, including some members of leadership, accused Omar of playing into decades-old anti-Semitic stereotypes about American Jews' \"dual loyalty\" to Israel.\n\nOmar supports the movement to boycott Israel and has been critical of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. She has also been vocal in her opposition to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in Washington that nearly always aligns with the Israeli government.\n\nRead more: Several 2020 Democratic candidates are rushing to defend embroiled Rep. Ilhan Omar over accusations of anti-Semitism\n\nLast month, Democratic leaders in the House condemned another tweet in which Omar argued that pro-Israel American lawmakers were influenced by donations from groups like AIPAC. Omar apologized amid the intense backlash.\n\nOmar, who is Muslim and moved to the US from Somalia as a refugee, also faced criticism for tweeting during the Israeli military campaign against Hamas in November 2012 that \"Israel has hypnotized the world.\"\n\nThe congresswoman has repeatedly rejected accusations of anti-Semitism.\n\n\"I am told everyday that I am anti-American if I am not pro-Israel. I find that to be problematic and I am not alone. I just happen to be willing to speak up on it and open myself to attack,\" she tweeted on Sunday.\n\nThe GOP attacks, despite\n\nMany Republicans jumped on the opportunity to attack Omar and Democrats more broadly. Some, including President Donald Trump, pushed for the congresswoman to be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nAt the White House last month when Omar was under fire for previous anti-Semitic comments, Trump also said the embroiled congresswoman should resign from Congress.\n\n\"What she said is so deep-seeded in her heart that her lame apology, that's what it was, it was lame and she didn't mean a word of it, was just not appropriate,\" Trump said during a January cabinet meeting.\n\nTrump tweeted again on Wednesday, condemning House Democrats for failing to \"take a stand against anti-Semitism in their conference.\"\n\nDemocrats have pointed out that Trump himself has repeatedly made comments widely interpreted as anti-Semitic. He and his campaign have, on numerous occasions, promoted anti-Semitic memes, including an image of Hillary Clinton with a Jewish star and a pile of money. In 2017, he said some members of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville were \"very fine people.\"\n\nIslamophobic attacks\n\nOmar has also been a victim of bigoted attacks recently.\n\nLast Friday, the West Virginia Republican Party displayed a poster linking Omar with the 9/11 terrorist attacks during an event at the statehouse. The poster featured an image of the twin towers in flames with the words \"'Never Forget' \u2014 you said..\" above an image of Omar with the words \"I am the proof \u2014 you have forgotten.\"\n\nThe state Republican Party said in a statement that it never approved of or saw the poster before it was displayed and that it had it removed after learning of its existence.\n\nKen Klippenstein\u200f, a reporter for the left-wing news outlet The Young Turks, reported on Wednesday night the right-wing group, ACT for America, behind the poster has ties to the Trump administration. ACT Director of Government Relations Lisa Piraneo is married to Department of Homeland Security official John Barsa, who previously served as then-DHS Secretary John Kelly's special assistant. Trump has nominated Barsa to lead USAID's Latin America Bureau.\n\nFreshmen Reps. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and Katie Hill (D-Calif.) Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call\n\nDemocrats divided\n\nThe Democratic response to Omar's most recent comments have exposed a rift in the Party on issues of race and religion.\n\nWhile some Democratic lawmakers, including several Jewish members, have pushed Party leadership to formally condemn Omar's remark, many lawmakers of color and younger members have denounced the criticism as unfair or misplaced.\n\nDemocratic leadership proposed putting a House resolution condemning anti-Semitism to a vote.\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday laid into both Democrats and Republicans who've condemned Omar, arguing that her treatment is evidence of a double-standard when it comes to how Congress deals with allegations of bigotry.\n\n\"Where are the resolutions against homophobic statements? For anti-blackness? For xenophobia? For a member saying he'll 'send Obama home to Kenya?'\" the 29-year-old New York progressive tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nMany progressives have also argued that Omar's critics aim to censor voices that oppose Israeli government policy and US policy in the Middle East.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates released statements this week defending Omar.\n\n\"We must not ... equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right-wing, Netanyahu government in Israel,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is Jewish, said on Wednesday.\n\nRead more: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez laid into Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leadership after they condemned Ilhan Omar's Israel comments\n\nHe added, \"What I fear is going on in the House now is an effort to target Congresswoman Omar as a way of stifling that debate. That's wrong.\"\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren similarly argued that criticism of Israel shouldn't be \"automatically\" branded as anti-Semitic.\n\nSens. Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand took a different tack. While Harris expressed concern that singling out Omar would jeopardize the congresswoman's safety, Gillibrand called the Republican response to Omar hypocritical given their silence in the face of similar remarks made by their own members.\n\nSome Democrats expressed frustration that debate over Omar's statements has overshadowed the Party's legislative agenda.\n\n\"We are actually making great progress on gun safety legislation, on democracy reform, on prescription drug reform \u2014 and Republicans would like nothing more than for us to be dragged down into daily skirmishes over identity politics at this point,\" Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin told The New York Times. \"We have to get past all of this, and quickly.\"\n\nFILE PHOTO: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks to the media on Capitol Hill in Washington Reuters\n\nA resolution condemning \"all forms of hate\"\n\nDuring a contentious closed-door caucus meeting on Wednesday, several members criticized the proposed House resolution. The Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus both pushed back on the measure, and argued the resolution should include a condemnation of Islamophobia, as well.\n\nThe backlash convinced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to postpone a vote on the resolution in order to broaden its language.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the House voted overwhelmingly on a resolution condemning \"all forms of hate.\" It doesn't mention Omar by name.\n\nPelosi also told reporters that she doesn't believe Omar was motivated by anti-Semitism and that the congresswoman was unaware that she was playing into hurtful stereotypes.\n\n\"I feel confident that her words were not based on any anti-Semitic attitude, but that she didn't have a full appreciation for how they landed on other people,\" Pelosi said during a Thursday press conference.\n\nJohn Haltiwanger contributed to this report."

    "text": "Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.\n\nLate last summer, President Trump fired off a tweet that felt off-topic, even for someone who routinely uses Twitter to try to divert the attention of the media. It was the same week his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was found guilty of multiple crimes and his personal attorney Michael Cohen agreed to a plea deal, but for some reason, the president was tweeting about the seizing of land from white farmers in South Africa, who were also the victims of \u201clarge scale killing.\u201d The language echoed a rallying cry of white supremacist groups who are obsessed with post-apartheid South Africa, but Trump picked up on it after a misleading segment on\u2014what else?\u2014Fox News.\n\nTrump appears to routinely set policy and priorities based on whatever Fox is airing, a relationship charted in a stunning expos\u00e9 by the New Yorker\u2019s Jane Mayer. It might be easy to assume that this is simply synergistic: Fox News caters to the very voters who form Trump\u2019s base, which is why its hosts carry water for a scandal-beset president, who in turn takes cues from Fox\u2019s hosts (for example, with his hyperfocus on the border wall). One important question that Mayer\u2019s piece asks is: Other than ratings, what does Fox News get out of it? Mayer\u2019s reporting shines some important light on that question\u2014and suggests an explanation for several of the more baffling decisions regarding media ownership that have come out of the executive branch.\n\nLast year, the Department of Justice challenged the $85 billion merger between AT&T and CNN\u2019s parent company, Time Warner, on antitrust grounds. There are valid concerns about reduced competition that critics of the deal have raised. But one normally wouldn\u2019t expect any of them to come from a Republican administration that favors less governmental intervention\u2014except, perhaps, one led by a president who really, really dislikes CNN. While the Justice Department said it opposed the merger independent of the president\u2019s feelings, Trump vocally opposed the deal, and, Mayer reports, \u201cmany people suspected that his objection was a matter of petty retaliation against CNN.\u201d Most shockingly, Mayer reports that Trump ordered his former chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, to pressure the Justice Department to try to block the deal. Though Cohn reportedly told White House chief of staff John Kelly, \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare call the Justice Department. We are not going to do business that way,\u201d the story makes clear that Trump wanted the merger quashed and made his feelings very well known.\n\nIf Trump really pressured his aides to try to kill the merger, it calls into question other actions\u2014and nonactions\u2014on the part of the Trump administration regarding tech and media policy. Why did the Justice Department decide to challenge the merger of AT&T and Time Warner and not the merger of Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox, even though, as Mayer notes, the new entity stands to account for half of all box-office revenue in the country and leave the Murdoch family\u2014which is selling most of its entertainment assets to Disney but keeping Fox News\u2014$2 billion richer? Certainly, that merger will make it harder for new market entrants in the entertainment industry to gain a foothold. If anything, it\u2019s a less ambiguous antitrust concern than the one at play in AT&T and Time Warner. In both cases, the DOJ took the position that benefits Rupert Murdoch.\n\nIn both cases, the DOJ took the position that benefits Rupert Murdoch.\n\nThat\u2019s not even the most confusing inconsistency. Consider the Sinclair bid to buy Tribune Media, which would have given the conservative broadcaster, already the largest television owner in America, control of a total of 232 stations across the country. For months, the FCC rolled out a deregulatory red carpet that seemed designed to help the merger pass. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, led the independent agency to nix all kinds of rules, effectively lifting the limits on the number of stations a single company could own nationwide and in a single market. The FCC eliminated an 80-year-old rule requiring broadcasters to maintain a studio in or near their community of license, which was meant to ensure some level of local programming and accountability in each market. Now, a broadcaster can own a station in Milwaukee and run it from California with no local presence. The FCC also loosened the local-ownership limit that prevented a single television-station owner from owning more than one of the top four stations in a single market. It also rolled back rules that allowed for stations to share studio space and jointly sell advertising. And all of this coincided with Sinclair\u2019s push to expand\u2014at a time when its \u201cmust-run\u201d segments were forcing local stations to run unerringly pro-Trump opinion content.\n\nBut in July, just as the Sinclair deal appeared set for a regulatory signoff in time for the midterm elections, Pai suddenly criticized the deal, saying that the evidence in front of him suggested that Sinclair\u2019s divestitures (to bring it in line with national ownership limits) weren\u2019t made in good faith and that the company would continue to run the stations it gave up. After that, the deal died in the water.\n\nOne could theorize that this was to save his own hide: At the time, the FCC\u2019s inspector general was reviewing Pai\u2019s deregulatory moves following a request from some members of Congress. But similar investigations haven\u2019t stopped the chairman before. He went ahead with the gutting of net neutrality while under investigation\u2014and that one eventually concluded that Pai hadn\u2019t been truthful about a cyberattack he claimed caused the agency\u2019s comment system to crash. (It was actually because of a John Oliver segment.)\n\nWe don\u2019t really know what motivated Pai\u2019s change of heart. It was certainly out of line with Pai\u2019s usual pro-industry zeal. But as former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt put it to Mayer, the only way to explain the \u201cextremely unusual\u201d antitrust and telecommunications agenda under Trump \u201cis that they\u2019re pro-Fox, pro-Fox, and pro-Fox.\u201d And Sinclair was poised to become a major Fox competitor.\n\nWhich brings us back to CNN. If the Department of Justice did truly want to reinvigorate the nation\u2019s atrophied antitrust policies, it\u2019s not clear why it would start with this case. The combination of AT&T and Time Warner is called a vertical merger, meaning the two companies weren\u2019t previously competing with each other. This was the first time since the Nixon administration that the Justice Department has challenged a vertical merger like this, and it didn\u2019t exactly bring its A-game. The agency\u2019s lawyers argued that by leveraging Time Warner properties like content\u2014like the Harry Potter franchise or HBO\u2014AT&T would be able to drive up its prices. Citing a dynamic entertainment landscape of content distribution that includes competitors like Netflix and Hulu, however, the court found this unconvincing. The Justice Department lost in court and again lost an appeal. There was probably a better case to make, as I wrote recently, but that one would\u2019ve put the DOJ at odds with the FCC\u2019s view on net neutrality. Taken all together\u2014the weak arguments, the difficulty of the case, the lack of scrutiny of other media mergers\u2014the whole ordeal felt suspect.\n\nThe Justice Department denies that Trump\u2019s antipathy toward CNN factored into its decision to fight the merger. We certainly have no evidence he directly ordered the agency to do anything regarding the deal. What we do now know is that he reportedly wanted his administration to kill it\u2014and told senior aides to make it happen."

    "text": "Cenk Uygur has an academic challenge for President Trump.\n\nThe founder and host of the Young Turks, a progressive programming network, called on Trump to voluntarily release his records from high school and college, as well as his SAT scores. If Trump\u2019s grades during his undergraduate years at the University of Pennsylvania were better than his, Uygur promised he would give the president $1 million.\n\n\u201cMy grades versus your grades at Penn. We both went to Wharton undergrad, so it\u2019s a good apples-to-apples [comparison], okay?\u201d Uygur declared during his show Wednesday. \u201cIf you have better grades than me, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars. If I have better grades than you, you give me a million dollars. If you release all those things and agree to this deal, we definitely have a bet.\u201d\n\nUygur seemed to be banking on two assumptions: First, that Trump wouldn\u2019t voluntarily fork over his academic records, which he has taken pains to ensure the public never sees, if the testimony of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen is to be believed.\n\n[The extensive effort to bury Donald Trump\u2019s grades]\n\nCohen told Congress last month that Trump directed him to send letters to schools warning of civil and criminal actions if they ever released his grades or SAT scores.\n\n\u201cWhen I say con man, I\u2019m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores,\u201d Cohen testified to the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nSecond, Uygur proclaimed with confidence there was a \u201cbetween zero percent and negative 20 percent\u201d chance that Trump had outperformed him academically in school. Trump attended New York Military Academy, a private high school, and then Fordham University for two years before transferring to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Wednesday, Uygur predicted Trump\u2019s high school grades would be \u201claughably pathetic . . . [and] show that you never should have even gotten into Fordham.\u201d He also charged that Trump\u2019s Fordham grades, if made public, would \u201cshow you clearly couldn\u2019t have transferred into Penn\u201d and that his Penn grades would show \u201cyou probably barely graduated with the great help of your dad and all of his millionaire friends.\u201d\n\nThey were strong assertions \u2014 so strong that Uygur concluded by admitting he did not have a million dollars, prompting protests by his co-host.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll bankrupt me and take everything I have,\u201d Uygur said. \u201cGo for it, Donald Trump. You know how ecstatic MAGA would be if you bankrupted me, head of the Young Turks? So go for it. Let\u2019s see if you got better grades than me at Penn. You don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n[May 2018: It\u2019s the 50th anniversary of the day Trump left college and (briefly) faced the draft]\n\nUygur said he has been interested in seeing Trump\u2019s academic records since 2011, when Trump publicly demanded Barack Obama release his grades.\n\n\u201cWhen he talked about Obama\u2019s transcripts, I thought that was just deeply racist because everything on the record indicated that Obama was an excellent student,\u201d Uygur told The Washington Post. \u201cThe only reason to [question Obama\u2019s achievements] was presumably because of his race.\u201d\n\nUygur added he felt confident he had made \u201cthe safest bet in America\u201d and doubted he would hear back from Trump\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what good students don\u2019t try to do: desperately try to hide their grades,\u201d Uygur said. \u201cA person who threatens to bulldoze the school if they release his grades is unlikely to release his grades.\u201d\n\nTrump has frequently boasted of his academic achievements, especially of his two undergraduate years at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve also heard I was first in my class at the Wharton School of Finance,\u201d Trump said in May, invoking a school he often references. (The school was named the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce when Trump attended but in 1972 changed its name to the Wharton School.)\n\nHowever, Trump has gone to great lengths to order his academic records be hidden \u2014 perhaps even more extensively than Cohen described to Congress, as The Post\u2019s Marc Fisher recently reported:\n\nIn 2011, days after Donald Trump challenged President Barack Obama to \u201cshow his records\u201d to prove that he hadn\u2019t been a \u201cterrible student,\u201d the headmaster at New York Military Academy got an order from his boss: Find Trump\u2019s academic records and help bury them. The superintendent of the private school \u201ccame to me in a panic because he had been accosted by prominent, wealthy alumni of the school who were Mr. Trump\u2019s friends\u201d and who wanted to keep his records secret, recalled Evan Jones, the headmaster at the time. \u201cHe said, \u2018You need to go grab that record and deliver it to me because I need to deliver it to them.\u2019 \u201d The superintendent, Jeffrey Coverdale, confirmed Monday that members of the school\u2019s board of trustees initially wanted him to hand over President Trump\u2019s records to them, but Coverdale said he refused. \u201cI was given directives, part of which I could follow but part of which I could not, and that was handing them over to the trustees,\u201d he said. \u201cI moved them elsewhere on campus where they could not be released. It\u2019s the only time I ever moved an alumnus\u2019s records.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article stated the Wharton School of Finance \"technically does not exist.\u201d However, when Trump attended, the school was called the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce. In 1972, it was renamed the Wharton School.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Grab that record\u2019: How Trump\u2019s high school transcript was hidden\n\nJune 2016: Confident. Incorrigible.

    "text": "In January, during the longest government shutdown in America\u2019s history, President Donald Trump rode in a motorcade through Hidalgo County, Texas, eventually stopping on a grassy bluff overlooking the Rio Grande. The White House wanted to dramatize what Trump was portraying as a national emergency: the need to build a wall along the Mexican border. The presence of armored vehicles, bales of confiscated marijuana, and federal agents in flak jackets underscored the message. But the photo op dramatized something else about the Administration. After members of the press pool got out of vans and headed over to where the President was about to speak, they noticed that Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, was already on location. Unlike them, he hadn\u2019t been confined by the Secret Service, and was mingling with Administration officials, at one point hugging Kirstjen Nielsen, the Secretary of Homeland Security. The pool report noted that Hannity was seen \u201chuddling\u201d with the White House communications director, Bill Shine. After the photo op, Hannity had an exclusive on-air interview with Trump. Politico later reported that it was Hannity\u2019s seventh interview with the President, and Fox\u2019s forty-second. Since then, Trump has given Fox two more. He has granted only ten to the three other main television networks combined, and none to CNN, which he denounces as \u201cfake news.\u201d Hannity was treated in Texas like a member of the Administration because he virtually is one. The same can be said of Fox\u2019s chairman, Rupert Murdoch. Fox has long been a bane of liberals, but in the past two years many people who watch the network closely, including some Fox alumni, say that it has evolved into something that hasn\u2019t existed before in the United States. Nicole Hemmer, an assistant professor of Presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center and the author of \u201cMessengers of the Right,\u201d a history of the conservative media\u2019s impact on American politics, says of Fox, \u201cIt\u2019s the closest we\u2019ve come to having state TV.\u201d Hemmer argues that Fox\u2014which, as the most watched cable news network, generates about $2.7 billion a year for its parent company, 21st Century Fox\u2014acts as a force multiplier for Trump, solidifying his hold over the Republican Party and intensifying his support. \u201cFox is not just taking the temperature of the base\u2014it\u2019s raising the temperature,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a radicalization model.\u201d For both Trump and Fox, \u201cfear is a business strategy\u2014it keeps people watching.\u201d As the President has been beset by scandals, congressional hearings, and even talk of impeachment, Fox has been both his shield and his sword. The White House and Fox interact so seamlessly that it can be hard to determine, during a particular news cycle, which one is following the other\u2019s lead. All day long, Trump retweets claims made on the network; his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has largely stopped holding press conferences, but she has made some thirty appearances on such shows as \u201cFox & Friends\u201d and \u201cHannity.\u201d Trump, Hemmer says, has \u201calmost become a programmer.\u201d Fox\u2019s defenders view such criticism as unfounded and politically biased. Ken LaCorte, who was in senior management at Fox News for nearly twenty years, until 2016, and recently started his own news service, told me, \u201cThe people at Fox said the same thing about the press and Obama.\u201d Fox\u2019s public-relations department offers numerous examples of its reporters and talk-show hosts challenging the Administration. Chris Wallace, a tough-minded and ecumenical interviewer, recently grilled Stephen Miller, a senior Trump adviser, on the need for a border wall, given that virtually all drugs seized at the border are discovered at checkpoints. Trump is not the first President to have a favorite media organization; James Madison and Andrew Jackson were each boosted by partisan newspapers. But many people who have watched and worked with Fox over the years, including some leading conservatives, regard Fox\u2019s deepening Trump orthodoxy with alarm. Bill Kristol, who was a paid contributor to Fox News until 2012 and is a prominent Never Trumper, said of the network, \u201cIt\u2019s changed a lot. Before, it was conservative, but it wasn\u2019t crazy. Now it\u2019s just propaganda.\u201d Joe Peyronnin, a professor of journalism at N.Y.U., was an early president of Fox News, in the mid-nineties. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it before,\u201d he says of Fox. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the President had his own press organization. It\u2019s not healthy.\u201d\n\nNothing has formalized the partnership between Fox and Trump more than the appointment, in July, 2018, of Bill Shine, the former co-president of Fox News, as director of communications and deputy chief of staff at the White House. Kristol says of Shine, \u201cWhen I first met him, he was producing Hannity\u2019s show at Fox, and the two were incredibly close.\u201d Both come from white working-class families on Long Island, and they are so close to each other\u2019s children that they are referred to as \u201cUncle Bill\u201d and \u201cUncle Sean.\u201d Another former colleague says, \u201cThey spend their vacations together.\u201d A third recalls, \u201cI was rarely in Shine\u2019s office when Sean didn\u2019t call. And I was in Shine\u2019s office a lot. They talked all the time\u2014many times a day.\u201d Shine led Fox News\u2019 programming division for a dozen years, overseeing the morning and evening opinion shows, which collectively get the biggest ratings and define the network\u2019s conservative brand. Straight news was not within his purview. In July, 2016, Roger Ailes, the co-founder and C.E.O. of Fox, was fired in the face of numerous allegations of chronic sexual harassment, and Shine became co-president. But within a year he, too, had been forced out, amid a second wave of sexual-harassment allegations, some of them against Fox\u2019s biggest star at the time, Bill O\u2019Reilly. Shine wasn\u2019t personally accused of sexual harassment, but several lawsuits named him as complicit in a workplace culture of coverups, payoffs, and victim intimidation. Shine, who has denied any wrongdoing, has kept a low profile at the White House, and rejects interview requests, including one from this magazine. But Kristol contends that Shine\u2019s White House appointment is a scandal. \u201cIt\u2019s been wildly under-covered,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s astounding that Shine\u2014the guy who covered up Ailes\u2019s horrible behavior\u2014is the deputy chief of staff!\u201d The Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, another conservative Never Trumper, used to appear on the network, but wouldn\u2019t do so now. \u201cFox was begun as a good-faith effort to counter bias, but it\u2019s morphed into something that is not even news,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a mouthpiece for the President, repeating what the President says, no matter how false or contradictory.\u201d The feedback loop is so strong, she notes, that Trump \u201cwill even pick up an error made by Fox,\u201d as when he promoted on Twitter a bogus Fox story claiming that South Africa was \u201cseizing land from white farmers.\u201d Rubin told me, \u201cIt\u2019s funny that Bill Shine went over to the White House. He could have stayed in his old job. The only difference is payroll.\u201d \u201cAnd this is my niece. She\u2019s four. She\u2019d also love to eat you.\u201d With Shine, the Fox and White House payrolls actually do overlap. The Hollywood Reporter obtained financial-disclosure forms revealing that Fox has been paying Shine millions of dollars since he joined the Administration. Last year, he collected the first half of a seven-million-dollar bonus that he was owed after resigning from Fox; this year, he will collect the remainder. That sum is in addition to an $8.4-million severance payment that he received upon leaving the network. In December, four Democratic senators sent a letter to the White House counsel\u2019s office, demanding proof that Fox\u2019s payments to Shine don\u2019t violate federal ethics and conflict-of-interest statutes. Shine is only the most recent Fox News alumnus to join the Trump Administration. Among others, Trump appointed the former Fox contributor Ben Carson to be his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the former Fox commentator John Bolton to be his national-security adviser, and the former Fox commentator K. T. McFarland to be his deputy national-security adviser. (McFarland resigned after four months.) Trump recently picked the former Fox News anchor Heather Nauert to be the Ambassador to the United Nations, but she soon withdrew herself from consideration, reportedly because her nanny, an immigrant, lacked a work permit. The White House door swings both ways: Hope Hicks, Shine\u2019s predecessor in the communications job, is now slated to be the top public-relations officer at Fox Corporation. Several others who have left the Trump White House, including Sebastian Gorka, a former adviser on national security, regularly appear on Fox. Gorka recently insisted, on Fox Business, that one of Trump\u2019s biggest setbacks\u2014retreating from the shutdown without securing border-wall funds\u2014was actually a \u201cmasterstroke.\u201d Other former Fox News celebrities have practically become part of the Trump family. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former co-host of \u201cThe Five,\u201d left Fox in July; she is now working on Trump\u2019s re\u00eblection campaign and dating Donald Trump, Jr. (Guilfoyle left the network mid-contract, after a former Fox employee threatened to sue the network for harassment and accused Guilfoyle of sharing lewd images, among other misconduct; Fox and the former employee reached a multimillion-dollar settlement. A lawyer who represents Guilfoyle said that \u201cany suggestion\u201d that she \u201cengaged in misconduct at Fox is patently false.\u201d) Pete Hegseth, the Fox News host, and Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business host, have each been patched into Oval Office meetings, by speakerphone, to offer policy advice. Sean Hannity has told colleagues that he speaks to the President virtually every night, after his show ends, at 10 P.M. According to the Washington Post, White House advisers have taken to calling Hannity the Shadow Chief of Staff. A Republican political expert who has a paid contract with Fox News told me that Hannity has essentially become a \u201cWest Wing adviser,\u201d attributing this development, in part, to the \u201cutter breakdown of any normal decision-making in the White House.\u201d The expert added, \u201cThe place has gone off the rails. There is no ordinary policy-development system.\u201d As a result, he said, Fox\u2019s on-air personalities \u201care filling the vacuum.\u201d Axios recently reported that sixty per cent of Trump\u2019s day is spent in unstructured \u201cexecutive time,\u201d much of it filled by television. Charlie Black, a longtime Republican lobbyist in Washington, whose former firm, Black, Manafort & Stone, advised Trump in the eighties and nineties, told me, \u201cTrump gets up and watches \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 and thinks these are his friends. He thinks anything on Fox is friendly. But the problem is he gets unvetted ideas.\u201d Trump has told confidants that he has ranked the loyalty of many reporters, on a scale of 1 to 10. Bret Baier, Fox News\u2019 chief political anchor, is a 6; Hannity a solid 10. Steve Doocy, the co-host of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d is so adoring that Trump gives him a 12.\n\nIt is hardly unprecedented for American media barons to go beyond their pages to try to influence the course of politics. At the 1960 Democratic National Convention, Philip Graham, the co-owner of the Washington Post, helped broker a deal in which John F. Kennedy selected Lyndon Johnson as his running mate. But now a direct pipeline has been established between the Oval Office and the office of Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born billionaire who founded News Corp and 21st Century Fox. Multiple sources told me that Murdoch and Trump often talk on the phone. A former aide to Trump, who has been in the Oval Office when Murdoch has called, says, \u201cIt\u2019s two men who\u2019ve known each other for a very long time having frank conversations. The President certainly doesn\u2019t kowtow to Murdoch, but Murdoch also doesn\u2019t to him. He speaks to him the same way he would have five years ago.\u201d According to Michael Wolff\u2019s 2018 book, \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d Murdoch derided Trump as \u201ca fucking idiot\u201d after a conversation about immigration. The aide says Trump knows that Murdoch has denigrated him behind his back, but \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to matter\u201d that much. Several sources confirmed to me that Murdoch regales friends with Trump\u2019s latest inanities. But Murdoch, arguably the most powerful media mogul in the world, is an invaluable ally to any politician. Having Murdoch\u2019s\u2014and Fox\u2019s\u2014support is essential for Trump, the aide says: \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the base.\u201d Murdoch may be even closer to Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Well-informed sources say that Kushner, an increasingly valued White House adviser, has worked hard to win over Murdoch, showing him respect and asking him for advice. Kushner has regularly assured Murdoch that the White House is a smooth-running operation, despite many reports suggesting that it is chaotic. Kushner now has an almost filial status with Murdoch, who turns eighty-eight this month, and numerous sources told me that they communicate frequently. \u201cLike, every day,\u201d one said. Murdoch has cultivated heads of state in Australia and Great Britain, and someone close to him says that \u201che\u2019s always wanted to have a relationship with a President\u2014he\u2019s a businessman and he sees benefits of having a chief of state doing your bidding.\u201d Murdoch has met every American President since Kennedy, but, the close associate says, \u201cuntil now a relationship has eluded him.\u201d Still, Murdoch\u2019s coziness with Trump may come at a cost. Roger Ailes, during his final days at Fox, apparently warned Murdoch of the perils. According to Gabriel Sherman, a biographer of Ailes who has written about Fox for New York and Vanity Fair, Ailes told Murdoch, \u201cTrump gets great ratings, but if you\u2019re not careful he\u2019s going to end up totally controlling Fox News.\u201d\n\nTrump became famous, in no small part, because of Rupert Murdoch. After Murdoch bought the New York Post, in 1976, he was introduced to Trump through a mutual acquaintance, Roy Cohn, the infamous legal fixer, who, as a young man, was Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s chief counsel. Cohn saw the potential for tabloid synergy: Trump could attain celebrity in the pages of the Post as a playboy mogul, and Murdoch could sell papers by chronicling Trump\u2019s exploits. In private, Murdoch regarded Trump with disdain, seeing him as a real-estate huckster and a shady casino operator. But, for all their differences, the two men had key traits in common. They both inherited and expanded family enterprises\u2014an Australian newspaper; an outer-borough New York City real-estate firm\u2014but felt looked down upon by people who were richer and closer to the centers of power. As Edward Luce, of the Financial Times, has noted, both men have tapped into anti-\u00e9litist resentment to connect with the public and to increase their fortunes. Trump and Murdoch also share a transactional approach to politics, devoid of almost any ideology besides self-interest. Murdoch could not have foreseen that Trump would become President, but he was a visionary about the niche audience that became Trump\u2019s base. In 1994, Murdoch laid out an audacious plan to Reed Hundt, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President Bill Clinton. Murdoch, who had been a U.S. citizen for less than a decade, invited Hundt to his Benedict Canyon estate for dinner. After the meal, Murdoch led him outside to take in the glittering view of the Los Angeles Basin, and confided that he planned to launch a radical new television network. Unlike the three established networks, which vied for the same centrist viewers, his creation would follow the unapologetically lowbrow model of the tabloids that he published in Australia and England, and appeal to a narrow audience that would be entirely his. His core viewers, he said, would be football fans; with this aim in mind, he had just bought the rights to broadcast N.F.L. games. Hundt told me, \u201cWhat he was really saying was that he was going after a working-class audience. He was going to carve out a base\u2014what would become the Trump base.\u201d Hundt recalled the conversation as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d He said, \u201cI was at this house more expensive than any I could ever imagine. This person\u2019s made a huge mark in two other countries, and he had entered our country and was saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to break up the three-party oligopoly that has governed the most important medium of communication for politics and policy in this country since the Second World War.\u2019 It was like a scene from \u2018Faust.\u2019 What came to mind was Mephistopheles.\u201d Blair Levin, at that time the chief of staff at the F.C.C. and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, says, \u201cFox\u2019s great insight wasn\u2019t necessarily that there was a great desire for a conservative point of view.\u201d More erudite conservatives, he says, such as William F. Buckley, Jr., and Bill Kristol, couldn\u2019t have succeeded as Fox has. Levin observes, \u201cThe genius was seeing that there\u2019s an attraction to fear-based, anger-based politics that has to do with class and race.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, Murdoch hired Roger Ailes to create a conservative TV news outlet. Ailes, who died in 2017, was a master of attack politics and wedge issues, having been a media consultant on several of America\u2019s dirtiest and most divisive campaigns, including those of Richard Nixon. Ailes invented programming, Levin argues, \u201cthat confirmed all your worst instincts\u2014Fox News\u2019 fundamental business model is driving fear.\u201d The formula worked spectacularly well. By 2002, Fox had displaced CNN as the highest-rated cable news network, and it has remained on top ever since. In 2011, at Ailes\u2019s invitation, Trump began making weekly guest appearances on the morning show \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d In a trial run of his campaign tactics, he used the channel as a platform to exploit racist suspicions about President Barack Obama, spreading doubt about whether he was born in America. (In one segment, Trump suggested that Obama\u2019s \u201cfamily doesn\u2019t even know what hospital he was born in!\u201d) As Hundt sees it, \u201cMurdoch didn\u2019t invent Trump, but he invented the audience. Murdoch was going to make a Trump exist. Then Trump comes along, sees all these people, and says, \u2018I\u2019ll be the ringmaster in your circus!\u2019 \u201d Trump\u2019s arrival marked an important shift in tone at Fox. Until then, the network had largely mocked birtherism as a conspiracy theory. O\u2019Reilly called its promoters \u201cunhinged,\u201d and Glenn Beck, who at the time also hosted a Fox show, called them \u201cidiots.\u201d But Trump gave birtherism national exposure, and, in a sign of things to come, Hannity fanned the flames. Hannity began saying that, although he thought that Obama had been born in the United States, the circumstances surrounding his birth certificate were \u201codd.\u201d Fox\u2019s hostility toward the Obama Administration grew increasingly extreme. Its coverage of the Benghazi debacle\u2014a tragic embassy ambush not unlike others that had claimed American lives in previous Administrations\u2014devolved into a relentless attack on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In certain instances, however, Fox executives enforced journalistic limits. The network cancelled Beck\u2019s show, in 2011, because his paranoid rants had become too embarrassing. (Among other things, Beck accused the White House science adviser of having proposed stemming population growth through forced abortions and \u201csterilants\u201d in the water.) At the height of the Tea Party rebellion, Ailes reprimanded Hannity for violating the line between journalism and politics. Hannity had arranged to tape his evening Fox show at a Tea Party fund-raiser in Ohio. When Ailes learned of the plan, only hours before the event, he demanded that Hannity cancel his appearance. According to a former Fox executive, Ailes then blew up at Bill Shine, who had authorized Hannity\u2019s trip. \u201cRoger was livid, and ripped the shit out of Shine,\u201d the former executive says, recalling that Ailes yelled, \u201cNo one at Fox is shilling for the Tea Party!\u201d Afterward, Shine released a statement criticizing Hannity\u2019s actions. And Murdoch, at a panel about the news, expressed a similar view, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be supporting the Tea Party or any other party.\u201d \u201cWe have a stack of your books in our home. They make a lovely decorative feature.\u201d Such niceties no longer apply. In November, Hannity joined Trump onstage at a climactic rally for the midterm elections. Afterward, Fox issued a limp statement saying that it didn\u2019t \u201ccondone any talent participating in campaign events\u201d and that the \u201cunfortunate distraction\u201d had \u201cbeen addressed.\u201d Many Fox News reporters were angry, and provided critical anonymous quotes to the media, but Hannity didn\u2019t apologize, saying that he had been \u201csurprised yet honored\u201d when Trump called him up onstage. This response was dubious: before the rally, Trump\u2019s campaign had advertised Hannity as a \u201cspecial guest.\u201d When Hannity joined Trump, he not only praised him for \u201cpromises kept\u201d; he also echoed the President\u2019s attacks on the press, castigating the rest of the media covering the rally as \u201cfake news.\u201d The evening ended with a high five between Hannity and Shine, who had recently started working at the White House. For Greta Van Susteren, a host on Fox between 2002 and 2016, Hannity\u2019s rally appearance illustrates the difference at Fox since Ailes\u2019s departure. For all of Ailes\u2019s faults, Van Susteren argues, he exerted a modicum of restraint. She believes that he would have insisted on at least some distance from President Trump, if only to preserve the appearance of journalistic respectability embodied in the motto Ailes devised for Fox: \u201cFair and Balanced.\u201d (That motto was retired in 2017.) Van Susteren says, \u201c \u2018Hannity\u2019 is an opinion show, but when he went onstage with Trump he became part of the campaign. That was an egregious mistake. It was way over the line.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ailes paid occasional lip service to journalistic integrity, Fox News was hardly fair and balanced under his leadership. Gabriel Sherman, in his biography, \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room,\u201d reports that Ailes was so obsessed with bringing down Obama in 2012 that he declared to colleagues, \u201cI want to elect the next President.\u201d Yet, during the 2016 campaign, Fox executives were initially uneasy about Trump\u2019s candidacy. Murdoch tweeted that Trump was \u201cembarrassing his friends\u201d and \u201cthe whole country.\u201d An editorial in the Wall Street Journal, Murdoch\u2019s flagship newspaper, called Trump\u2019s candidacy a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d Murdoch, an immigrant himself, bridled at Trump\u2019s xenophobia. In 2015, when Trump claimed that most immigrants coming from Mexico were criminals and rapists, Murdoch corrected him on Twitter, noting that \u201cMexican immigrants, as with all immigrants, have much lower crime rates than native born.\u201d He also tweeted that El Paso was \u201cthe safest city\u201d in America. Murdoch\u2019s views could scarcely be more at odds with Fox\u2019s current diatribes about hordes of \u201cillegal aliens\u201d who are \u201cinvading\u201d the U.S. and killing innocent Americans, leaving behind grieving \u201cAngel Moms\u201d and \u201cAngel Dads.\u201d Van Susteren told me that she wasn\u2019t surprised by this rhetorical turn. \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself about his support for immigration,\u201d she said of Murdoch. \u201cRupert is first about the bottom line. They\u2019re all going out to play to their crowd, whether it\u2019s Fox or MSNBC.\u201d (After leaving Fox, Van Susteren was for a short time a host on MSNBC.) Fox\u2019s mile-by-mile coverage of the so-called \u201cmigrant caravan\u201d was an enormous hit: ratings in October, 2018, exceeded those of October, 2016\u2014the height of the Presidential campaign. Fox\u2019s embrace of Trumpism took some time. Sherman has reported that, when the network hosted the first Republican Presidential debate, in August, 2015, in Cleveland, Murdoch advised Ailes to make sure that the moderators hit Trump hard. This put Ailes in an awkward position. Trump drew tremendous ratings and had fervent supporters, and Ailes was afraid of losing that audience to rival media outlets. Breitbart, the alt-right Web site led by Stephen K. Bannon, was generating huge traffic by championing Trump. What\u2019s more, Ailes and Trump were friendly. \u201cThey spoke all the time,\u201d a former Fox executive says. They had lunch shortly before Trump announced his candidacy, and Ailes gave Trump political tips during the primaries. Ken LaCorte contends that Ailes took note of \u201cTrump\u2019s crazy behavior\u201d; but Trump\u2019s growing political strength was also obvious. According to the former Fox executive, Trump made Ailes \u201cnervous\u201d: \u201cHe thought Trump was a wild card. Someone Ailes could not bully or intimidate.\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, a former Fox Business host who was fleetingly President Trump\u2019s communications director, told me in 2016 that the network\u2019s executives \u201cmade a business decision\u201d to give on-air stars \u201cslack\u201d to choose their candidates. Hannity was an early Trump supporter; O\u2019Reilly was neutral; Megyn Kelly remained skeptical. Trump had hung up on Kelly after she ran a segment about his 1992 divorce from Ivana Trump, which noted that Ivana had signed an affidavit claiming that Trump had raped her. (Ivana later insisted that she hadn\u2019t meant rape in the \u201ccriminal\u201d sense.) Against this strained backdrop, at the debate in Cleveland, Kelly asked Trump a famously tough question. \u201cYou\u2019ve called women you don\u2019t like \u2018fat pigs,\u2019 \u2018dogs,\u2019 \u2018slobs,\u2019 and \u2018disgusting animals,\u2019 \u201d she said. Trump interrupted her with a snide quip: \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell!\u201d The hall burst into laughter and applause. Kelly kept pressing Trump: \u201cYou once told a contestant on \u2018Celebrity Apprentice\u2019 it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect President?\u201d But he\u2019d already won over Republican viewers. (Fox received a flood of e-mails, almost all of them anti-Kelly.) The showdown helped shape Trump\u2019s image as shamelessly unsinkable. It also kicked off a feud between Trump and Fox, in which Trump briefly boycotted the channel, hurting its ratings and forcing Ailes to grovel. Four days after the debate, Trump tweeted that Ailes had \u201cjust called\u201d and \u201cassures me that \u2018Trump\u2019 will be treated fairly.\u201d Trump has made the debate a point of pride. He recently boasted to the Times that he\u2019d won it despite being a novice, and despite the \u201ccrazy Megyn Kelly question.\u201d Fox, however, may have given Trump a little help. A pair of Fox insiders and a source close to Trump believe that Ailes informed the Trump campaign about Kelly\u2019s question. Two of those sources say that they know of the tipoff from a purported eyewitness. In addition, a former Trump campaign aide says that a Fox contact gave him advance notice of a different debate question, which asked the candidates whether they would support the Republican nominee, regardless of who won. The former aide says that the heads-up was passed on to Trump, who was the only candidate who said that he wouldn\u2019t automatically support the Party\u2019s nominee\u2014a position that burnished his image as an outsider. These claims are hard to evaluate: Ailes is dead, and they conflict with substantial reporting suggesting that the rift between Trump and Fox was bitter. A former campaign aide is adamant that Trump was genuinely surprised and infuriated by Kelly\u2019s question. A Fox spokesperson strongly denied the allegations, and declined requests for interviews with employees involved in the debate. Kelly also declined to comment, but she broached the subject in her 2016 memoir, \u201cSettle for More.\u201d She wrote that the day before the debate Trump called Fox executives to complain, saying he\u2019d heard that Kelly planned to ask \u201ca very pointed question directed at him.\u201d She noted, \u201cFolks were starting to worry about Trump\u2014his level of agitation did not match the circumstances.\u201d When this passage stirred controversy, Kelly tweeted that her book \u201cdoes not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did.\u201d Yet her account does suggest that Trump had enough forewarning to be upset, and that he contacted Fox before the debate. Later in the campaign, WikiLeaks posted stolen e-mails from Donna Brazile, then the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee and a CNN contributor. Without CNN\u2019s knowledge, she had alerted Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign about questions that the network planned to ask during a televised event. CNN fired Brazile, and Trump has cited the incident as evidence that CNN is \u201ca total fake.\u201d Last April, in an interview on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d he said, \u201cCan you imagine, by the way, if you gave me the questions to a debate? They would have you out of business.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2016, two weeks before Trump secured the Republican nomination, Gretchen Carlson, the former co-host of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d sued Ailes for sexual harassment. Her suit alleged that he had propositioned her during a meeting, and that he\u2019d spoken of having the power to \u201cmake anything happen\u201d if she \u201cunderstood\u201d him, and that they \u201cshould have had a sexual relationship a long time ago.\u201d Within weeks, Fox had forced Ailes out, giving him a forty-million-dollar severance package. The network apologized to Carlson, and paid her a twenty-million-dollar settlement. Murdoch was slow to see the gravity of the sexual-harassment issue, but his two sons\u2014James, the C.E.O. of 21st Century Fox, and Lachlan, its executive chairman\u2014were more responsive. At a board meeting held after the news of Carlson\u2019s suit broke, James, the more politically independent of the two, pushed for an outside legal investigation. His demand forced the company to take action, since the notes of the meeting created a public paper trail. Fox\u2019s outside law firm, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, began an inquiry, and exposed an appalling culture of sexual harassment, intimidation, payoffs, and coverups at Fox. \u201cIt warms my heart to see their look of hope that we might not just buy it online.\u201d Ailes, meanwhile, joined Trump\u2019s debate team, further erasing the line between Fox and conservative politicians. Ailes also began developing a plan to go into business with Trump. The Sunday before the election, Ailes called Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, and said that he\u2019d been talking with Trump about launching Trump TV, a nationalist competitor to Fox. Ailes was so excited that he was willing to forfeit his severance payment from Fox, which was attached to a non-compete agreement. He asked Bannon to join the venture and to start planning it as soon as Trump lost the election. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Bannon recalls replying. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win.\u201d \u201cStop the bullshit,\u201d Ailes responded. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a blowout. It\u2019ll be over by eight o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\nAny hopes that Fox would clean house after Ailes\u2019s departure vanished on August 12, 2016, when Fox named two Ailes loyalists as co-presidents: Jack Abernethy, an executive who managed Fox\u2019s local stations, and Bill Shine. The opinion side of Fox News, which Shine had run, had won out, as had his friend Sean Hannity. For years, Ailes had been the focus of liberal complaints, and so when Fox pushed him out many people thought that the channel would change. They were right. The problem, Fox\u2019s critics say, is that it\u2019s become a platform for Trump\u2019s authoritarianism. \u201cI know Roger Ailes was reviled,\u201d Charlie Black, the lobbyist, said. \u201cBut he did produce debates of both sides. Now Fox is just Trump, Trump, Trump.\u201d Murdoch may find this development untroubling: in 1995, he told this magazine, \u201cThe truth is\u2014and we Americans don\u2019t like to admit it\u2014that authoritarian societies can work.\u201d Greta Van Susteren believes that Ailes\u2019s departure posed a huge challenge for his successors: \u201cIt\u2019s like what happens when a dictator falls. If you look historically, when you get rid of a Saddam in Iraq, or a Qaddafi in Libya, the place falls apart.\u201d The celebrity opinion-show hosts who drive the ratings became unbridled and unopposed. Hannity, as the network\u2019s highest-rated and highest-paid star, was especially empowered\u2014and, with him, so was Trump. After Ailes was ousted, Murdoch, then eighty-five, assumed the title of acting C.E.O. of Fox News, and moved into Ailes\u2019s corner office on the second floor of News Corp\u2019s Manhattan headquarters. Lachlan and James wanted their father to hire an outsider with journalistic experience to run the channel, but Murdoch, who still thinks of himself as a newsman at heart, couldn\u2019t resist filling the top slot himself. The following winter, Murdoch slipped while on Lachlan\u2019s yacht, seriously injuring his back. For months, people close to the family say, he was in very bad shape, convalescing at home in L.A. Ken LaCorte, the former Fox executive, says that Murdoch shouldn\u2019t be discounted because of his age: \u201cHe\u2019s definitely got all his marbles, and is one hundred per cent sharp. When it came to numbers, like ratings, revenues, G.D.P. growth\u2014you name it\u2014he\u2019s like a savant. If you made a mistake with a number, he\u2019d usually catch and correct it.\u201d But a Fox insider told me that Murdoch \u201cwas gone a lot,\u201d adding, \u201cHe\u2019s old. He likes the idea that he\u2019s running it, but the lunatics took over the asylum.\u201d\n\nWhen Shine assumed command at Fox, the 2016 campaign was nearing its end, and Trump and Clinton were all but tied. That fall, a FoxNews.com reporter had a story that put the network\u2019s journalistic integrity to the test. Diana Falzone, who often covered the entertainment industry, had obtained proof that Trump had engaged in a sexual relationship in 2006 with a pornographic film actress calling herself Stormy Daniels. Falzone had worked on the story since March, and by October she had confirmed it with Daniels through her manager at the time, Gina Rodriguez, and with Daniels\u2019s former husband, Mike Moz, who described multiple calls from Trump. Falzone had also amassed e-mails between Daniels\u2019s attorney and Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen, detailing a proposed cash settlement, accompanied by a nondisclosure agreement. Falzone had even seen the contract. But Falzone\u2019s story didn\u2019t run\u2014it kept being passed off from one editor to the next. After getting one noncommittal answer after another from her editors, Falzone at last heard from LaCorte, who was then the head of FoxNews.com. Falzone told colleagues that LaCorte said to her, \u201cGood reporting, kiddo. But Rupert wants Donald Trump to win. So just let it go.\u201d LaCorte denies telling Falzone this, but one of Falzone\u2019s colleagues confirms having heard her account at the time. Despite the discouragement, Falzone kept investigating, and discovered that Daniels had discussed a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d deal with the National Enquirer, in partnership with Trump, in which the paper would buy the exclusive rights to her story in order to bury it. Falzone pitched this story to Fox, too, but it went nowhere. News of Trump\u2019s payoff to silence Daniels, and Cohen\u2019s criminal attempts to conceal them as legal fees, remained unknown to the public until the Wall Street Journal broke the story, a year after Trump became President. In January, 2017, Fox demoted Falzone without explanation. That May, she sued the network. Her attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, declined to comment but acknowledged that a settlement has been reached; it includes a nondisclosure agreement that bars Falzone from talking about her work at Fox. After the Journal story broke, Oliver Darcy, a senior media reporter for CNN, published a piece revealing that Fox had killed a Stormy Daniels story. LaCorte, who by then had left Fox but was still being paid by the company, told Mediaite that he\u2019d made the call without talking to superiors. The story simply hadn\u2019t \u201cpassed muster,\u201d he claimed, adding, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it to protect Donald Trump.\u201d Nik Richie, a blogger who had broken the first story about Daniels, tweeted, \u201cThis is complete bullshit. Ken you are such a LIAR. This story got killed by @FoxNews at the highest level. I know, because I was one of your sources.\u201d Richie told me, \u201cFox News was culpable. I voted for Trump, and I like Fox, but they did their own \u2018catch and kill\u2019 on the story to protect him.\u201d He said that he\u2019d worked closely with Falzone on the article, and that \u201cshe did her homework\u2014she had it.\u201d He says he warned her that Fox would never run it, but \u201cwhen they killed it she was devastated.\u201d Richie believes that the story \u201cwould have swayed the election.\u201d\n\nShine was liked by most of the on-air stars he managed; they describe him as well organized and forthright. Shine, who is tough-looking, with a doughy, dented face, is the son of a New York City policeman. After a brief period working at a Long Island television station, he went on to be Hannity\u2019s producer and rode his coattails at Fox, becoming Ailes\u2019s deputy, enabler, and enforcer. Colleagues say that Shine knew how to coach talent to look good on TV, and how to drive ratings. In 2001, he put psychics on Fox shows to offer opinions about unsolved murders, and in 2007 he defended Fox against what he called \u201cfalse racism accusations,\u201d after O\u2019Reilly expressed amazement, on the air, that people in Harlem dined at nice restaurants without \u201cany kind of craziness,\u201d just like in \u201can all-white suburb.\u201d Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog group that routinely criticizes Fox News, says that Shine became \u201can expert in collecting and enforcing soft power,\u201d adding, \u201cHe was responsible for on-air contributors to programs, so ultimately you were auditioning for Bill Shine. He was the one who would give you the lucrative contract. He controlled the narrative that way.\u201d Nevertheless, some people at Fox called him Bill the Butler, because he was so subservient to Ailes. A former Fox co-host says, \u201cHe\u2019s perfect for the White House job. He\u2019s a yes-man.\u201d Another Fox alumnus said, \u201cHis only talent was following orders, sucking up to power, and covering up for people.\u201d On the fourteenth floor of the network\u2019s headquarters, the former Fox executive told me, Ailes had a \u201cBlack Ops\u201d room, where he and others collected dirt on perceived enemies. They allegedly compiled a dossier on Gabriel Sherman as he worked on his Ailes biography, and obtained the phone records of another journalist, Joe Strupp, in an effort to find out who was leaking to him. Separately, Ailes and a small group kept a close eye on internal talent. \u201cWe had a file on pretty much everyone,\u201d the former Fox executive said, adding that Ailes talked about \u201cputting hits\u201d in the media on anyone who \u201cgot out of line.\u201d If a woman complained about being sexually harassed, he said, Shine or other supervisors intimidated her into silence, reduced her air time, or discontinued her contract. The former executive recalls, \u201cShine would talk to the woman with a velvet glove, saying, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it\u2019\u2014and, if that didn\u2019t work, he\u2019d warn her it would ruin her career.\u201d Shine\u2019s defenders maintain that he was unfairly tarnished by Ailes\u2019s harassment scandals. \u201cHe was a victim of sexual McCarthyism,\u201d LaCorte told me. Van Susteren notes that Shine \u201cwas never accused of compromising behavior\u2014he was accused of looking the other way.\u201d She adds, \u201cHe\u2019s one of those people in management who put out fires. These people often get burned themselves.\u201d But at least four civil lawsuits against Fox have named Shine as a defendant for enabling workplace harassment. One of these cases, a stockholder lawsuit that Fox settled in 2017, for ninety million dollars, claimed that Ailes had \u201csexually harassed female employees and contributors with impunity for at least a decade\u201d by surrounding himself \u201cwith loyalists\u201d\u2014including Shine. The suit faults Fox for spending fifty-five million dollars to settle such claims out of court. The use of company funds for payoffs prompted a criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. In 2017, Shine was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury, but instead he agreed to be interviewed by prosecutors. The criminal investigation seems to have been dropped after Ailes\u2019s death, but Judd Burstein, an attorney whose client was interviewed by prosecutors, told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think someone can be a serial sexual abuser in a large organization without enablers like Shine.\u201d In 2011, Fox paid a news booker named Laurie Luhn $3.15 million to keep silent about two decades of sexual mistreatment by Ailes. A copy of the confidentiality agreement shows that Shine co-signed it. The day that Ailes left Fox, Luhn broke her silence. She had sexually serviced Ailes for years, she said, in part because he had blackmailed her with compromising videotapes. According to the stockholder suit, Ailes was abetted by \u201cthe direct involvement of Shine,\u201d who scheduled the encounters as work meetings. After Luhn suffered a \u201cmental breakdown,\u201d the suit says, Shine sought a psychiatrist for her. During this period of distress, Luhn claimed, Ailes\u2019s deputies booked her into a New York hotel; Luhn has said that she was required to forward all her e-mails to Shine, for monitoring. A spokesperson for Shine has denied this account, and has said that Shine was unaware that Ailes and Luhn had a sexual relationship. The former Fox executive is dubious that Shine didn\u2019t know, and recalls Shine rolling his eyes and saying, \u201cLaurie Luhn\u2014she\u2019s a problem.\u201d Fox News struggled under Shine\u2019s leadership. In January, 2017, NBC lured away Megyn Kelly. (She has since left NBC.) Three months later, the Times revealed that 21st Century Fox and Bill O\u2019Reilly had paid a total of thirteen million dollars to five female employees who had accused him of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior. At the time, O\u2019Reilly was negotiating a thirty-two-million-dollar payment to a sixth accuser. (He has dismissed all the accusations as \u201ccrap.\u201d) The news sparked advertiser boycotts and street demonstrations, and Fox fired O\u2019Reilly. Shine soon followed him out the door. Hannity had warned that it would be \u201cthe total end\u201d of Fox News if his friend Shine were ousted. But, with O\u2019Reilly and Kelly gone, Hannity was in his strongest position yet: he was now Fox\u2019s top-rated star, and Trump\u2019s highest-profile promoter. He\u2019d taken Kelly\u2019s 9 P.M. slot and was getting even higher ratings\u2014some three million viewers a night. Two months after Shine left Fox, Hannity became a matchmaker, arranging a dinner with the President at the White House, attended by himself, Shine, and Scaramucci, at that time Trump\u2019s communications director. Hannity proposed Shine as a top communications official, or even as a deputy chief of staff. A year later, Shine was both.\n\nBy the time Trump was elected, Murdoch had adeptly improved ties with him. In the summer of 2016, he and his fourth wife, Jerry Hall, joined Trump for a visit to Trump\u2019s golf club in Scotland. Murdoch appears to have been wise in securing a rapprochement. Telecommunications is a highly regulated industry, and under Trump the government has consistently furthered Murdoch\u2019s business interests, to the detriment of his rivals. Hundt, the former F.C.C. chairman, told me that \u201cthere have been three moves that have taken place in the regulatory and antitrust world\u201d involving telecommunications \u201cthat are extremely unusual, and the only way to explain them is that they\u2019re pro-Fox, pro-Fox, and pro-Fox.\u201d Last June, after only six months of deliberation, the Trump Administration approved Fox\u2019s bid to sell most of its entertainment assets to Disney, for seventy-one billion dollars. The Murdoch family will receive more than two billion dollars in the deal, and will become a major stockholder in the combined company. The Justice Department expressed no serious antitrust concerns, even though the combined company will reportedly account for half the box-office revenue in America. Trump publicly congratulated Murdoch even before the Justice Department signed off on the deal, and claimed that it would create jobs. In fact, the consolidation is projected to result in thousands of layoffs. In July, the F.C.C. blocked Sinclair Broadcast Group, a conservative rival to Fox, from combining with the Tribune Media Company. The F.C.C. argued that the deal would violate limits on the number of TV stations one entity can own, upending Sinclair\u2019s hope of becoming the next Fox. The Justice Department, meanwhile, went to court in an effort to stop A. T. & T.\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner, which owns CNN. Time Warner saw the deal as essential to its survival at a time when the media business is increasingly dominated by giant competitors such as Google and Facebook. Murdoch understood this impulse: in 2014, 21st Century Fox had tried, unsuccessfully, to buy Time Warner. For him, opposing his rivals\u2019 deal was a matter of shrewd business. Trump also opposed the deal, but many people suspected that his objection was a matter of petty retaliation against CNN. Although Presidents have traditionally avoided expressing opinions about legal matters pending before the judicial branch, Trump has bluntly criticized the plan. The day after the Justice Department filed suit to stop it, he declared the proposed merger \u201cnot good for the country.\u201d Trump also claimed that he was \u201cnot going to get involved,\u201d and the Justice Department has repeatedly assured the public that he hasn\u2019t done so. However, in the late summer of 2017, a few months before the Justice Department filed suit, Trump ordered Gary Cohn, then the director of the National Economic Council, to pressure the Justice Department to intervene. According to a well-informed source, Trump called Cohn into the Oval Office along with John Kelly, who had just become the chief of staff, and said in exasperation to Kelly, \u201cI\u2019ve been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing\u2019s happened! I\u2019ve mentioned it fifty times. And nothing\u2019s happened. I want to make sure it\u2019s filed. I want that deal blocked!\u201d Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs, evidently understood that it would be highly improper for a President to use the Justice Department to undermine two of the most powerful companies in the country as punishment for unfavorable news coverage, and as a reward for a competing news organization that boosted him. According to the source, as Cohn walked out of the meeting he told Kelly, \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare call the Justice Department. We are not going to do business that way.\u201d A spokesperson for Cohn declined to comment, and Kelly did not respond to inquiries from The New Yorker, but a former White House official confirmed that Trump often \u201cvented\u201d in \u201cfrustration\u201d about wanting to block the A. T. & T.-Time Warner merger. \u201cThe President does not understand the nuances of antitrust law or policy,\u201d the former official says. \u201cBut he wanted to bring down the hammer.\u201d (Last month, a federal court ruled against the Justice Department.) Trump Administration officials say that political considerations did not guide the government\u2019s actions on the three deals. Blair Levin, the former F.C.C. official, told me, \u201cThere may be innocent explanations.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cTrump famously said you\u2019re going to get sick and tired of winning, and that may not be true for the rest of America, but it sure is true of Murdoch.\u201d He says of Murdoch, \u201cHe\u2019s an incredibly cunning political player. He leaves no fingerprints. He\u2019s been in the game of influencing government behavior to his benefit longer than most of us have been alive.\u201d David Axelrod, who was Barack Obama\u2019s chief strategist, believes that Murdoch has long put his business interests above any political concerns. He recalls attending a dinner where Murdoch pushed him to move ahead on immigration reform. Axelrod suggested that it would help if Fox stopped fanning nativist hysteria, and he says that Murdoch responded, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to talk to Roger about that,\u201d as if he had no sway over Fox. Axelrod says, \u201cThere are probably a lot of aspects of Trumpism that he\u2019s uncomfortable with. But ultimately he\u2019s a businessman. And it\u2019s useful to have a friend who\u2019s the President, particularly if there are close regulatory calls, and a President who is untroubled by the rules and norms in that regard.\u201d During a recent dinner with reporters, the incendiary right-wing commentator Ann Coulter, who has been feuding with Trump over his immigration policy, said that the President told her that \u201cMurdoch calls me every day.\u201d She recalled that, \u201cback when Trump was still speaking to me,\u201d she complained to him that Fox was no longer inviting her to appear. She said that Trump told her, \u201cDo you want me to call Murdoch and tell him to put you on?\u201d Coulter accepted Trump\u2019s offer. He may have called Hannity, not Murdoch, she says, but in any case she was invited back on Fox \u201cwithin twelve hours.\u201d\n\nAs Murdoch\u2019s relations with the White House have warmed, so has Fox\u2019s coverage of Trump. During the Obama years, Fox\u2019s attacks on the President could be seen as reflecting the adversarial role traditionally played by the press. With Trump\u2019s election, the network\u2019s hosts went from questioning power to defending it. Yochai Benkler, a Harvard Law School professor who co-directs the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, says, \u201cFox\u2019s most important role since the election has been to keep Trump supporters in line.\u201d The network has provided a non-stop counternarrative in which the only collusion is between Hillary Clinton and Russia; Robert Mueller, the special counsel, is perpetrating a \u201ccoup\u201d by the \u201cdeep state\u201d; Trump and his associates aren\u2019t corrupt, but America\u2019s law-enforcement officials and courts are; illegal immigration isn\u2019t at a fifteen-year low, it\u2019s \u201can invasion\u201d; and news organizations that offer different perspectives are \u201cenemies of the American people.\u201d Benkler\u2019s assessment is based on an analysis of millions of American news stories that he and two co-authors, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts, undertook for their 2018 book, \u201cNetwork Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation and Radicalization in American Politics.\u201d Benkler told me that he and his co-authors had expected to find \u201csymmetric polarization\u201d in the left-leaning and the right-leaning media outlets. Instead, they discovered that the two poles of America\u2019s media ecosystem function very differently. \u201cIt\u2019s not the right versus the left,\u201d Benkler says. \u201cIt\u2019s the right versus the rest.\u201d Most American news outlets try to adhere to facts. When something proves erroneous, they run corrections, or, as Benkler and his co-authors write, \u201cthey check each other.\u201d Far-left Web sites post as many bogus stories as far-right ones do, but mainstream and liberal news organizations tend to ignore suspiciously extreme material. Conservative media outlets, however, focus more intently on confirming their audience\u2019s biases, and are much more susceptible to disinformation, propaganda, and outright falsehoods (as judged by neutral fact-checking organizations such as PolitiFact). Case studies conducted by the authors show that lies and distortions on the right spread easily from extremist Web sites to mass-media outlets such as Fox, and only occasionally get corrected. When falsehoods are exposed, core viewers often react angrily. According to Media Matters, Fox hosts used the word \u201cinvasion\u201d thirty-three times in the thirty days before the midterm elections. After Shepard Smith, the Fox News anchor, contradicted Trump\u2019s scaremongering about immigrants\u2014declaring, \u201cThere is no invasion, no one is coming to get you\u201d\u2014viewers lashed out at him on social media. Sometimes such pushback has a salutary effect. Recently, Chris Wallace told Sarah Sanders that her claim that \u201cnearly four thousand known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally\u201d every year was wildly inaccurate. Showing Fox\u2019s clout, the White House has dropped the talking point. Such breaks with the Trump narrative on Fox are rare, though. Unlike Glenn Beck, Hannity has been allowed to spew baseless conspiracy theories with impunity. For more than a year, Hannity and other hosts spread the lie that the hacking of Democratic Party e-mails during the 2016 campaign was an inside job. Hannity claimed that the hacking had been committed not by Russian cyber-warfare agents, as the U.S. intelligence community concluded, but by a Democratic staffer named Seth Rich, who had been murdered by unknown assailants on a D.C. street. Benkler and his co-authors studied Fox\u2019s coverage, and found that not only did the channel give the Seth Rich lie a national platform; it also used the conspiracy story as a distraction, deploying it as a competing narrative when developments in Mueller\u2019s investigation showed Trump in a bad light. In 2017, after Rich\u2019s parents demanded an apology and advertisers began shunning the network, Fox finally ran a retraction, and Hannity dropped the story. By then, Fox hosts had begun pushing a different conspiracy: the \u201cUranium One\u201d story, which Hannity called \u201cthe biggest scandal ever involving Russia.\u201d On an October, 2017, broadcast, Hannity claimed that Hillary Clinton, when she was Secretary of State, had given \u201cto Vladimir Putin and Russia twenty per cent of America\u2019s uranium, which is the foundational material to make nuclear weapons.\u201d Ostensibly, the deal was in exchange for giant payments to the Clinton Foundation. Hannity also claimed that \u201cthe corrupt, lying mainstream media\u201d was withholding this \u201cbombshell\u201d from Americans, because it was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in a \u201chuge coverup.\u201d More than a year earlier, the Times had run a front-page story about the deal, based on the right-wing book \u201cClinton Cash.\u201d But the story had gone cold, because other reporting had poked holes in it, revealing that multiple government agencies had approved the deal, and that the quantity of uranium was insignificant. Yet Fox kept flogging it as the real national-security scandal involving Russia. On \u201cHannity,\u201d the former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka argued that the Clintons\u2019 crime was equivalent to the Cold War treason of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg\u2014and reminded viewers that the Rosenbergs were executed. Within two days, Trump picked up Fox\u2019s story, tweeting, \u201cUranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn\u2019t want to follow!\u201d\n\nAlisyn Camerota was a co-host on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d for years before joining CNN, in 2014. She says that Fox has solid news reporters, but she became so troubled by the lack of standards on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that she wrote a thinly veiled novel, \u201cAmanda Wakes Up,\u201d about the blurring of journalistic lines at a cable morning show. \u201c \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 was a fun show, but it was not a news show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt regularly broke the rules of journalism. It was basically Roger\u2019s id on TV. He\u2019d wake up in the morning with some bee in his bonnet, spout it off to Bill Shine, and Shine would tell us to put it on TV.\u201d She says that the show\u2019s producers would \u201ccull far-right, crackpot Web sites\u201d for content, and adds, \u201cNever did I hear anyone worry about getting a second source. The single phrase I heard over and over was \u2018This is going to outrage the audience!\u2019 You inflame the viewers so that no one will turn away. Those were the standards.\u201d To the astonishment of colleagues, the Fox co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle often prepared for \u201cThe Five\u201d by relying on information provided to her by an avid fan: a viewer from Georgia named David Townsend, who had no affiliation either with Fox News or with journalism. She\u2019d share the day\u2019s planned topics with Townsend, and then he\u2019d e-mail her suggested content. A former colleague of Guilfoyle\u2019s says, \u201cIt was a joke among the production assistants\u2014they were, like, \u2018Wait till you hear this!\u2019 She actually got research from him! It was the subject of hilarity.\u201d Townsend is a frequent contributor to the fringe social-media site Gab, which Wired has called a \u201chaven for the far right.\u201d (He has promoted the idea that \u201cphysically weak men\u201d are \u201cmore likely to be socialists,\u201d and has argued that it is not anti-Semitic to observe that \u201cthe most powerful political moneybags in American politics are Zionists.\u201d) The server company that hosts Gab removed it from the Internet temporarily after it was revealed to have posted hate-filled rants by Robert Bowers, the gunman who killed eleven people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, last October. When I asked Townsend about his e-mails to Guilfoyle, he said, \u201cMind your own business. I\u2019m just a Fox fan. I\u2019m a keyboard warrior. I\u2019m a nobody.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve sent stuff to various people at Fox for years, and I don\u2019t get a penny for it,\u201d and added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what tree you\u2019re barking up but you better be careful.\u201d Given Fox\u2019s status as a dominant source of information for Trump, some people argue that the network should be especially vigilant about outside influence. Aki Peritz, a former C.I.A. analyst who is an adjunct professor at American University, has written that Fox News has become an inviting target for foreign spy agencies, because \u201cit\u2019s what the President sees.\u201d But a source who spoke to me about Guilfoyle and Townsend says, \u201cIt\u2019s even worse than a conspiracy of the dark Web, or something trying to manipulate Fox. It was just a guy in his underwear in Georgia who had influence over Fox News! And Fox News influences the President!\u201d\n\nOfficially, Trump\u2019s day begins at 11 A.M., with his national-security briefing. But Matt Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters, who has spent more than a year tracking how closely Trump\u2019s tweets correspond to Fox News, told me that \u201cthe real briefing is on \u2018Fox & Friends,\u2019 four hours earlier.\u201d Judging from the timing of Trump\u2019s tweets, Gertz believes that the President records \u201cFox & Friends\u201d and views it from the beginning, often with a slight delay. As Trump watches, he frequently posts about points that he agrees with. Since August, 2018, Media Matters has tallied more than two hundred instances of Trump disseminating Fox News items to his fifty-eight million Twitter followers. \u201cTrump serves as a carnival barker for Fox,\u201d Levin says, giving invaluable promotional help to the channel. Fox hosts sometimes reverse their opinions in order to toe the Trump line: Hannity, who in the Obama era called negotiations with North Korea \u201cdisturbing,\u201d now calls such efforts a \u201chuge foreign-policy win.\u201d But Gertz has come to believe that Fox drives Trump more than Trump drives Fox. During the recent standoff with Congress over funding for a border wall, Fox anchors and guests repeatedly pushed Trump to reject compromises favored by Republicans in Congress and by his own staff, and to pursue instead an extreme path favored by Fox\u2019s core viewers. White House aides confirm that Trump has repeatedly walked away from compromises at the last moment because Fox hosts and guests opposed the deals. Last March, Trump was widely expected to sign an omnibus appropriations bill, thus avoiding a government shutdown. Both Mick Mulvaney, his budget director at the time, and Vice-President Mike Pence had described it as a done deal. But on March 22nd Trump became agitated, a former top aide told me, when the evening hosts at Fox \u201clit him up,\u201d and the next morning, on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d one of the President\u2019s most reliable supporters, Pete Hegseth, \u201cripped him.\u201d At 8:55 A.M., Trump tweeted that he might veto the bill, because it lacked funding for the \u201cBORDER WALL.\u201d The former top aide said of Trump\u2019s sudden reversal, \u201cIt was all Fox.\u201d \u201cLooks like the Huffman divorce is in previews.\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet caused panic in Washington: many members of Congress had left town, and it wasn\u2019t clear that enough were present to pass a stopgap spending bill. Defense Secretary James Mattis rushed to the White House and explained to Trump that, if he vetoed the bill, funding for U.S. troops would run out at midnight. That afternoon, Trump relented and signed the bill. Mattis prevailed in this instance, but former White House aides and other political players in Washington believe that Trump is more influenced by Fox pundits and guests than by his staff, or by the intelligence experts who brief him. Marc Short, who was formerly in charge of congressional relations for the White House, tried to counter the effect by enlisting Republican allies in the House to go on Fox. According to a Senate staffer, one high-profile Republican senator claims that his preferred way of getting the President\u2019s ear is by going on Fox. He calls a friendly host and offers to appear on the air; usually, before he\u2019s taken his makeup off in the greenroom Trump is calling him. \u201cIt\u2019s the way to get into his head,\u201d the Senate staffer says. Gertz is not alone in believing that Fox hosts played a key part in driving Trump\u2019s recent shutdown of the government and his declaration of a national emergency on the southern border. Hannity and Dobbs urged Trump nightly on their shows to make these moves; according to press reports, they also advised Trump personally to do so. On December 19th, with Republicans still in control of both houses of Congress, Trump\u2019s staff indicated that he would sign a spending bill with $1.6 billion earmarked for border security. That night, Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh assailed the deal, and the next morning Fox pounded Trump. Representative Mark Meadows, of North Carolina, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, appeared on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d calling the bill not a \u201cpunt\u201d but a \u201cfumble,\u201d and warning Trump not to \u201ccave.\u201d At 7:33 A.M., Hegseth tweeted at Trump, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to squish advisers. . . . No WALL = SHUT IT DOWN.\u201d By the next day, Trump had refused to sign the spending bill, forcing much of the government to shut down. For the next thirty-five days, Hannity and the other Fox hosts kept cheering Trump on, even as polls showed that the American public was increasingly opposed to the shutdown. Oliver Darcy, of CNN, says that Democrats, rather than negotiating with Trump, \u201cmight as well call Sean Hannity and get him on the phone,\u201d adding, \u201cIt seems we sort of elected Sean Hannity when we elected Trump.\u201d Gertz, of Media Matters, argues, \u201cThe President\u2019s world view is being specifically shaped by what he sees on Fox News, but Fox\u2019s goals are ratings and money, which they get by maximizing rage. It\u2019s not a message that is going to serve the rest of the country.\u201d Blair Levin, the former F.C.C. official, says that Trump and Fox are employing the same risky model: inflaming the base and intensifying its support, rather than building a broader coalition. Narrowcasting may generate billions of dollars for a cable channel, but as a governing strategy it inevitably alienates the majority. The problem for Trump, as one former Fox host puts it, is that \u201che can\u2019t afford to lose Fox, because it\u2019s all he\u2019s got.\u201d Similarly, Fox has a financial incentive to make Trump look good. Cable ratings at both Fox and MSNBC dip when the news is bad for their audience\u2019s side. Van Susteren likens the phenomenon to audiences turning away when their sports team is losing. During the Bush Administration\u2019s disastrous handling of Hurricane Katrina, Fox\u2019s ratings slumped so badly, a former Fox producer told me, that he was told to stop covering it. Since the midterms, in which the Republicans lost the House, the Nielsen ratings for Fox\u2019s evening lineup\u2014Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Laura Ingraham\u2014have fallen by twenty per cent. Few things cause ratings to spike like an exclusive Presidential interview, however, and on February 28th Hannity landed yet another one, during the President\u2019s meeting in Hanoi with Kim Jong Un. At one point in the interview, Hannity addressed the week\u2019s biggest news\u2014Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony before Congress\u2014and assured viewers that, even if Stormy Daniels had been paid off before the 2016 election, the President was innocent of criminal wrongdoing. Cohen, he told Trump, had \u201csaid to me at least a dozen times that he made the decision on the payments, and he didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Trump said. When Hannity lamented that the Cohen hearings had upstaged Trump\u2019s diplomatic effort, intoning, \u201cI thought politics stopped at the water\u2019s edge in America,\u201d Trump called the timing \u201creally inappropriate.\u201d"

    "text": "Body Language and Medical Analysis \u21164221: Why are Donald Trump\u2019s Pupils Intermittently Dilated? \u2014 Nonverbal and Emotional Intelligence (VIDEO, PHOTOS)\n\nDr. Jack Brown Blocked Unblock Follow Following Mar 2, 2018\n\nWhy are Donald Trump\u2019s pupils intermittently so Dilated?\n\nYou probably haven\u2019t noticed, but President Trump\u2019s pupils are intermittently much larger than normal (the intermittent pattern is crucial). From a medical standpoint, this is not at all subtle or to be dismissed \u2014 on the contrary, it is glaring. Sirens Blaring. Red flashing lights.\n\nI write this article with the expertise of both an ophthalmologist as well as a body language expert.\n\nIn the image above Trump\u2019s pupils are approximately 8.0 mm. The dark-adapted eyes of a healthy 12-year-old may have 8.0 mm pupils \u2014 but in an unmedicated 70-year-old with healthy eyes, in a well-lit room \u2014 the statistical odds of such large pupil size approaches zero.\n\nWhy is this significant? Dilated pupils, to this degree, would not occur in a 70-year-old, in a well-lit room unless there is either disease, injury or a pharmacologic cause present. Trump\u2019s pupils are frequently but intermittently this large (sometimes they are indeed within normal size limits).\n\nTrump\u2019s enlarged pupils are much less likely a sign of a significant undiagnosed or undisclosed medical condition \u2014 and much more likely, a side effect of a drug/medication (one of a relatively small group of drugs).\n\nPupils react to both Light and Near Focusing \u2014 but also change with age\n\nMost people know that exposure to light causes the pupils to constrict. However, you may not know that focusing on an object close up (e.g., when reading) will also cause pupils to constrict. These physiologic findings are normal for all healthy eyes. We cannot medically test for these stimuli (response to a bright light or response to focusing at near) on Donald Trump by evaluating available video or photos \u2014 however, at least with response to light, we can make some reasonable estimations.\n\nYou also may not realize that, under equal lighting conditions, pupils will become smaller with age. Thus an infant has much larger pupils than a 70-year-old. This change, generally speaking, isn\u2019t very noticeable (for most casual observers) until a person reaches their 30s or 40s \u2014 and even then it\u2019s not dramatic. But certainly, this difference is much more noticeable in a 71-year-old.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s pupils are very frequently larger (often much larger) than they should be for healthy eyes of his age. His pupils are very often as large as they would be if they were medically dilated by an ophthalmologist (with eye drops, such as Tropicamide and Phenylephrine).\n\nAs a control, we can compare Trump\u2019s pupils to those who have interviewed him, and are under the same light conditions. In the images immediately above and below, we see Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson during a 15 March 2017 interview.\n\nTrump\u2019s pupils are approximately 5.0 mm in diameter while Carlson\u2019s are 3.0 mm. Carlson is 23 years younger than Trump, thus all other things being equal, Carlson\u2019s pupils under equal light conditions should be larger \u2014 not equal, let alone smaller \u2014 than Trump\u2019s pupils.\n\nAre Donald Trump\u2019s Large Pupils a complication Cataract Surgery?\n\nThis is highly doubtful\n\nCataracts are an entirely normal aging process. Virtually all 71-year-old people have at least mild evidence of cataracts (and certainly they may be moderate or advanced) and thus many will have cataract development to a degree for which surgery is indicated. And while it\u2019s not entirely clear if Trump has had cataract surgery, some of the available images online are physically close and with high enough resolution to suggest this is the case.\n\nFor several decades it\u2019s been considered at least a mild-to-moderate surgical complication to have a permanently dilated pupil (or partially/permanently/poorly reactive pupil) after cataract surgery. This complication can be thought of as a form of micro-trauma to the iris. Such findings are often a signal that other complications also occurred during surgery. While even in the best surgeon\u2019s hands, complications do occur, the likelihood that Trump had this complication in both eyes, is extremely unlikely \u2014 because each pupil constricts and contracts \u2014 a healthy quality.\n\nLarge pupils after cataract surgery often cause a lot of unwanted symptoms (e.g., glare, reflection, increased astigmatic effect, photophobia, etc.). It\u2019s possible that Trump has some of these symptoms, but probably not to any significant degree. Indeed, if the iris is damaged \u2014 leaving large pupils after cataract surgery, often a secondary procedure is performed to make the pupil smaller \u2014 thus minimizing any of the above-mention symptoms.\n\nTrump\u2019s pupils are equal (or very closely so). And although they are often larger than normal, they do vary in size and are at times \u201cwithin normal limits\u201d. This finding eliminates surgical complications as a cause of Trump\u2019s often larger pupil size. Pupils damaged as a result of surgery wouldn\u2019t respond in this manner.\n\nIn this image, his pupils are 3.5\u20134.0 mm (the slight difference in his pupil size [known as physiologic Anisocoria] is not significant or medically noteworthy \u2014 although certainly if one pupil was much larger or much smaller, it would be very important). So here we see that his pupils ARE indeed ABLE to contract to a smaller size \u2014 and this is crucial. But the question is \u2014 why are they intermittently so large, so often?\n\nAre Trump\u2019s large pupils due to him deliberate dilating his own pupils with eye drops?\n\nThis is highly doubtful\n\nMedications such as Atropine, Scopolamine, Phenylephrine, Tropicamide, Homatropine, and Cyclopentolate are used to dilate pupils for ophthalmic examinations. These are also used to treat certain medical conditions in the eyes. Most notably these include various inflammatory conditions (Iritis, Uveitis, etc.). These conditions will often be correlated with diseases which frequently have serious ramifications for other parts of the body (thus may represent ophthalmic manifestations of systemic diseases).\n\nOccasionally, people will deliberately dilate their pupils so as to feign a medical condition and thus seek attention (Munchausen syndrome). This is an extremely unlikely cause in the case of President Trump\u2019s pupils \u2014 for he always tries to present himself as extremely healthy.\n\nVery uncommonly to rarely, a person will inadvertently get a bit of medication or a chemical compound in their eye which will dilate a pupil. There are even species of plants, which, upon gardening and then rubbing one\u2019s eye will have this effect. When this occurs, it will almost always effect only one eye \u2014 not both. Again, a long-term observation of Trump\u2019s eyes negates this possibility.\n\nAre Trump\u2019s large pupils due to Trauma?\n\nHighly Doubtful\n\nWhat about trauma? Could eye or head trauma cause a person\u2019s pupils to be large? Yes \u2014 but not in Trump\u2019s case. Since Donald Trump\u2019s pupils change in size over time, and they are round (not irregular in shape) and equal in size \u2014 trauma can be eliminated as a cause.\n\nWhat about a Disease or other Medical Condition?\n\nBelow is a list of medical causes of Enlarged Pupils, none of which applies in Trump\u2019s case, for multiple reasons, but in particular because his pupil size changes over time and also would have multiple other associated symptoms with any of these conditions.\n\nAdie\u2019s Pupils, bilateral\n\nBotulism\n\nCardiac Arrest\n\nCranial Nerve III (Oculomotor nerves), partial and bilateral,\n\nDiabetes Mellitus\n\nDiphtheria\n\nEncephalitis\n\nGuillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome\n\nHypermagnesemia\n\nHypothermia\n\nIncreased Intracranial Pressure\n\nIris scaring (synechia) secondary to injury or inflammatory disease (Iritis/Uveitis)\n\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\n\nSarcoidosis\n\nSylvian Aqueduct Syndrome\n\nSyphilis (Neurosyphilis)\n\nTumors/space occupying lesions\n\nVenom from various poisonous animals (certain snakes, spiders, octopi, and fish)\n\nWernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome\n\nWhat about Medications/Drugs as a Cause of Trump\u2019s Large Pupils?\n\nThis cause is Highly Likely\n\nAre Trump\u2019s large pupils caused by Systemic Drugs? (medications not used in eye drops [as mentioned above], but taken by mouth or by other means) \u2014 From a medical standpoint, this is highly probable. Here\u2019s a of list of the possibilities (of course, anesthesia and those labeled with \u201cpoisoning\u201d and \u201coverdose\u201d don\u2019t apply):\n\n5-HT2A receptor-mediated psychedelic drugs\n\n5-Hydroxytryptophan\n\nAdrenaline\n\nAmphetamine\n\nAnesthesia (deep general anesthesia or near-total spinal anesthesia)\n\nAntidepressants such as (such as TCAs [overdosage], SSRIs, SNRIs, and MAOIs)\n\nAntihistamine overdose\n\nBarbiturates\n\nBretylium intoxication\n\nChlorphentermine\n\nCocaine\n\nCyanide poisoning\n\nDopamine\n\nEphedrine\n\nFenfluramine\n\nGlutathimide overdose\n\nMethanol poisoning\n\nMDMA (Ecstasy)\n\nNoradrenaline\n\nPropranolol overdose\n\nQuinine toxicity\n\nTrimethaphan\n\nTryptophan overdose\n\nSummary: President Donald Trump\u2019s pupils are intermittently and significantly dilated \u2014 from a medical standpoint, this is NOT normal. The ambient light conditions cannot account for such changes. At other times they are within normal limits. This intermittent pattern is NOT due to trauma, complications from surgery, or disease. I have not examined Donald Trump and I have no firsthand knowledge of him \u2014 however, the myriad of photographic evidence available online seems to point strongly to the remaining possible etiology \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s Intermittently Dilated Pupils are due to the side effects of drugs/medications.\n\nRecent reports by journalist Kurt Eichenwald are consistent with this conclusion.\n\nI invite everyone to refute or confirm these medical findings \u2014 particularly those physicians with neuro-ophthalmology expertise.\n\nI also suggest that an independent party set up a publicly available, online photo/video diary to chronologically highlight and monitor President Trump\u2019s pupils.\n\nDr. Jack Brown\n\nBodyLanguageSuccess.com\n\nMedia Inquiries and Group Appearances\n\nJack@BodyLanguageSuccess.com\n\n702.239.8503\n\nSee also:\n\nBody Language Analysis \u21164367: Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer Argue in the Oval Office \u2014 The Border Wall and Government Shutdown\n\n\n\nBody Language Analysis \u21164374: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Clap-Back to Donald Trump during the 2019 SOTU\n\n\n\nBody Language Analysis \u21164219: Ivanka Trump\u2019s Reaction to Question regarding Donald Trump\u2019s Sexual Assault Accusers\n\n\n\nBody Language Analysis \u21164373: Matthew Whitaker\u2019s Press Conference regarding Robert Mueller\u2019s Investigation\n\n\n\nBody Language Analysis \u21164371: \u201cMr. President \u2026 have you ever worked for Russia?

He railed against the Green New Deal and decried Democrats as \u201csocialists.\u201d\n\nHe even embarked on an extensive tangent about a general he says he met on his trip to Iraq, named Raisin Cane, who told him of more efficient ways to launch airstrikes in the region (watch that colorful segment above.)\n\nAt the end of the marathon speech, Trump touched on his summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Vietnam, which ended this week with the U.S. president walking away without a denuclearization deal.

    "authors": [
      "Colin Kalmbacher"
    ],
    "text": "A Republican Party display in the West Virginia statehouse compared freshman Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n\nDesigned like a meme on paper, the display featured two images juxtaposed with one another. The first image showed the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan engulfed in flames just before the towers fell.\n\nThe second image was a picture of Omar\u2014wearing hijab\u2014as she sits and watches testimony during a congressional hearing.\n\nThe two images contained the following combined caption:\n\n\u201cNever forget\u201d \u2013 you said..I am the proof \u2013 you have forgotten\n\nOmar responded to the islamophobic display on Twitter\u2014linking it to the recent capture and indictment of an alleged white nationalist terrorist who had included Omar\u2019s name on his list of potential targets.\n\n\u201cNo wonder I am on the [hit list] of a domestic terrorist,\u201d the Minnesota representative tweeted.\n\nShe also said that \u201cAssassinate Ilhan Omar\u201d was written on local gas stations.\n\nThe anti-Muslim effort was initially spotted by Democratic Delegate and folk singer Mike Pushkin:\n\nThis poster is in your Capitol on a booth sponsored by @WVGOP \u201cWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them\u201d pic.twitter.com/4k566ztHWo \u2014 (((Mike Pushkin))) (@pushkinforhouse) March 1, 2019\n\nAfter several other Democrats became aware of the the display, complaints were lodged with GOP leadership and one GOP delegate eventually resigned after allegedly endorsing the general theme behind the captioned images.\n\nRepublican Delegate\u2014and the West Virginia statehouse\u2019s sergeant at arms\u2014Anne Lieberman is the GOP member in question.\n\nAccording to Democratic Delegate Mike Angelucci, Lieberman said \u201call Muslims are terrorists.\u201d\n\nAngelucci slammed Lieberman in comments to local NBC affiliate WSAZ.\n\nThe sergeant at arms of this body had enough nerve to say to us all Muslims are terrorists. The sergeant at arms of this body that represents the people of the state of West Virginia said all Muslims are terrorists. That\u2019s beyond shameful. And that\u2019s not freedom of speech, that\u2019s hate speech. That has no place in this House, the people\u2019s House, and I am furious. I don\u2019t want to see her representing the people of this great state in this house again.\n\nThe West Virginia Democrat went on to draw a parallel between members of his own faith who engage in violence.\n\n\u201cMuslims are not terrorists,\u201d Angelucci said. \u201cChristians have killed people. That doesn\u2019t mean Christians are terrorists. I am a Christian. I am a proud Christian. I am not a terrorist. There\u2019s no room for that hate in this House.\u201d\n\nLieberman denied making the comment but said little else about the incident when questioned by West Virgina Public Broadcasting. She later took a personal meeting with the speaker of the West Virginia house.\n\nThe West Virginia GOP accepted Lieberman\u2019s resignation later that day and issued a statement denouncing the anti-Muslim signage and condemning hatred and bigotry.\n\n\u201cThe West Virginia Republican Party does not approve, condone, or support hate speech,\u201d the statement from GOP state chair Melody Potter says. \u201cOne of the exhibitors at our West Virginia Republican Party Day at the Capitol displayed a sign that we did not approve, were not aware of before the day started, and we do not support. Upon learning about the sign, we immediately asked this exhibitor to remove the sign.\n\n\u201cOur Party supports freedom of speech, but we do not endorse speech that advances intolerant and hateful views. We have shown that when West Virginians are united, when we respect each other, embrace our differences and focus on moving our state forward what we can accomplish.\u201d\n\nWhile GOP leadership denounced the display, other West Virginia Republicans appeared to defend the Islamophobic message.\n\n\u201cWhile I may not agree with everything that is out there, I do agree that freedom of speech is something that we have to protect,\u201d GOP Delegate Dianna Graves said during a floor speech. Several other Republicans in the Mountain State took the same perspective.\n\nThe Young Turks\u2019 Cenk Uygur later mocked the Republicans who stood by the anti-Omar graphic on freedom of speech grounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny how it only applies when you say racist things,\u201d Uygur noted during a Friday night broadcast.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: this article has been amended post-publication to include additional quotes and for clarity.\n\n[image via KEREM YUCEL/AFP/Getty Images]"

BetterHelp is there whenever you need them - https://www.betterhelp.com/ringoffire/\n\nFordham College has confirmed one of the lesser charges leveled at the Trump administration by Michael Cohen during his testimony by saying that they were contacted by members of the Trump campaign warning them against releasing his college transcripts, grades, or standardized test scores. The question now is how bad were these scores if Trump was willing to launch a legal battle to protect them.

If any of them ever released his transcripts, his grades, or a standardized test scores to the media or to the public. You tell anybody what a crappy student I was and I'm going to sue you into oblivion. That was a weird claim. The Michael Cohen made you know what really wasn't relevant to anything but he was, he was telling us that to show us just how secretive and sneaky and deceitful Donald Trump truly is and you did a good job of painting the picture. But here's the thing, Michael Cohen, as Republican's told us all day long is a liar.\n\n\n\nHow can we believe anything? He says, well, Luckily Fordham University, we're Donald Trump attended for two years, came out immediately and said, Michael Cohen is telling the truth. We got the phone call and then we got a letter warning us that if we ever tell anyone about Donald Trump's grades, we're going to be sued. So that's been confirmed. We know now that Michael Cohen, at least on that particular issue, was telling the truth, but that's not really the issue. Michael Cohen had no reason to lie yesterday. He's not going to get a lighter sentence. He's already been sentenced. He has nothing left to lose, but Donald Trump has plenty to lose and in fact he's had plenty to lose since day one since day one of the campaign. And that's why he called. I mean, he called his fricking high school. It said, don't you dare release my transcripts. This guy must have been one of the worst students imaginable.\n\n\n\nHis sat scores, which he's also threatened people to not release, must have been, I mean God probably in the double digits, not even the triple digits, just the doubles. I don't even know if this man would have been able to get his name right on there. And that's why he doesn't want us to see what's in these. Because if we see them, if we learn that he is in fact not a very stable genius, then that not only does that crumble the facade that he's built as president, it crumbles the entire facade of the Trump organization itself. That whole organization that he built off money his daddy gave him is built around the fact that Donald Trump is the greatest human being to ever live. That is what Trump wants to pour portray to everybody in the world that he's the greatest ever. Nobody's ever as great as him.\n\n\n\n#rof #trofire #theringoffire #progressivenews"

Most of us here in the United States, we're glued to our televisions yesterday, watching Michael Cohen's testimony, uh, we've been preparing for that for the two days prior to the testimony. And today, most people are just talking about what happened yesterday, but at the same time, we're laser focused on Michael Cohen. We also have to remember that Donald Trump has over in Hanoi, wining and dining with a brutal dictator. And we found out late yesterday evening that the Trump administration has decided to just make things so much worse with regards to our relationship with North Korea. Because as part of the negotiations, the Trump administration has gone ahead and immediately cowed down to them and said, all right, hey, here's what we're going to throw out. First and foremost, you no longer have to report or be subject to an audit so that we know exactly how many nuclear weapons you have, what kind of missiles you have, and what kind of other nuclear technology you have.\n\n\n\nWe're not going to check up on you anymore with regards to any of that. And you don't have to tell us what you have. Donald Trump, literally the expert negotiators, stable genius came to the negotiation table and immediately handed Kim Jong on everything he could ever want. He immediately caved before the talks even began, about a decade ago, a similar piece talk with North Korea to get them to denuclearize was taking place. And the reason that North Korea walked away from the a negotiation table is because they wanted the us to stop checking on what kind of technology and missiles they had. The U s said, we're not going to do that. This is part of the deal. If we can't verify that your denuclearized thing, why, why we're even here in North Korea walked away. So Trump comes to the table and says, we won't ever check and see if you've denuclearized. We don't.\n\n\n\nWe don't really care. We don't care. Do whatever. We're not going to check on you. Build your muscles, increase your nuclear capabilities, which we already know you're doing. I'm going to go out there, go to a podium, send out on Twitter that you're such a great guy and we're super best friends now. Oh. And also you told me you didn't kill auto, a warm beer. So I'm gonna to take your word for it because I always side on the side of dictators as opposed to national intelligence from my own, uh, agencies here in the u s I always believe a dictator when they didn't, when they tell me they didn't kill an American citizen, we, we've seen that act before. We saw it actually very recently with Donald Trump. Once again, crapping on the United States is what Donald Trump did. He crept on us, all cited with a brutal dictator who does murder his own people, agreed to never check and see whether or not he's building nuclear weapons and what we going to get in return.\n\n\n\n#rof #trofire #theringoffire #progressivenews"

Who was given her start in every type of business venture I've been involved in. You're going to tell the American people what they want?\" Ana Kasparian said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You got that job at the White House because of all those other jobs you had in politics?\" Cenk Uygur quipped. \"Oh right, you have no other experience in politics at all, it was a gift from your daddy. You say that most of the American people are against minimums, like the minimum wage, presumably for example. Your dad was guaranteed a minimum of $413 million from his daddy, so if you wanted to work hard, and you didn't want that, you just wanted to work hard like the average American, your dad would have just given away the $413 million in charity and started from scratch. But he didn't, he kept it, and lost most of it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Second, when your dad gave you all the money in the world, you would have given it away. But you didn't. Instead, you lead a glamorous lifestyle, and you married someone else who gave you more money, and none of you ever gave it away.\"\n\n\n\n\"I remember Tucker Carlson saying it is hypocritical of progressives to take planes if they care about climate change,\" he continued. \"Ivanka, presumably, not to be a hypocrite, should give away all of her money. It was given to you, Ivanka, you don't want that. You want to earn it!\"\n\n\n\n\"I find it incredibly insulting to Americans to have someone like Ivanka Trump, who has not only had everything handed to her for her entire life, but who has literally outsourced jobs for her previous company to other places in the world, because she didn't want to pay minimum wage to her employees here in the U.S. It is insulting for her to tell them what they want,\" Kasparian added.\n\n\n\n\"You know what $7.25 per hour is?\" Cenk Uygur continued. \"It's a little over $15,000 per year. You work a full-time job and make $15,000. $15,000 is half a bag for Ivanka. She would think, '$15,000 per year? No, that must be a liberal myth.' So, she's laughing at you. 'I do declare,' even though 82% of Americans want a higher minimum wage, 'I've looked into the hearts of Americans and they say they do not want good wages, and they don't want to be handed everything, they want to earn things like I did.' Get the hell out of here.\""

    "title": "The Pill: More Religion Than Science?",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Published on Feb 21, 2019\n\nYou\u2019ve all seen birth control pills, right?\n\n\n\nThis little innocent pack of progesterone became available in the 60s \u2013 and it was the first time women could independently control if they had babies. Before then the best birth control was yelling \u201cRack off Darren, i\u2019ve got a migraine\u201d!\n\n\n\nBut just like those stupid slat blinds with the cord that get jammed every single f*ckin time \u2013 this blister pack has an epic design flaw. And it\u2019s a design flaw that could make women pregnant \u2013when they don\u2019t want to be \u2013 because they\u2019re on birth control.\n\n\n\nWhy did scientists bugger up the science? Well, the problem\u2019s not actually with the science of the pills, it\u2019s the religion they tried to put in \u2018em.\n\n\n\nSo just to get this straight - I\u2019m a big fan of The Pill.\n\n\n\nThis little ripper not only stops you from getting up the duff when you don\u2019t wanna be - it also makes period pain more bearable, regulates period cycles, reduces acne, and generally makes being a women a little less shitty.\n\n\n\nBut the way women have been told to take the pill for the last 60 years is ALL. WRONG.\n\n\n\nHear me out: the standard contraceptive pill has 21 days of hormone pills, followed by 7 days of sugar pills with no hormones.\n\n\n\nThe hormone pills basically trick the body into thinking it\u2019s already pregnant, so it doesn\u2019t release an egg and hey presto! - No baby! After 21 days, you stop taking those hormone pills for 7 days, and your body has a \u201cperiod\u201d.\n\nSweet!\n\nExcept... it\u2019s not sweet.\n\nYou see, a woman\u2019s body is not designed to have a period every month. Women in ye olde caveman days got their period later, spent most of their lives preggo, and probably only had around 100 period cycles in their entire life. Whereas today, many women will hit puberty at about 11, never get pregnant, and have over 400 periods. That\u2019s a lot of bloody periods! Literally.\n\nThat constant cycle of hormones places a big fat, unnatural stress on the human body. Every month, it\u2019s like \u2018Build up a nice baby cave, pop an egg out, oh now wait, get rid of everything, start again\u2019. Over and over. This monthly constant change is exhausting! It\u2019s great that modern women aren\u2019t just baby making machines anymore! - except NOT getting pregnant actually hurts our bodies too.\n\nImagine if we had a way of tricking our bodies into thinking it\u2019s pregnant\u2026\n\n\n\nThe pill has the potential to stop this crazy pregnancy cycle, and make women a whole lot healthier. But it doesn\u2019t. You see that 7 day row of sugar pills. When women stop taking the hormone-filled pills, their body has a \u2018period\u2019. There\u2019s no medical reason why you need to have this period. But there is a religious reason.\n\nThe 7 day period break was designed into the pill in the 1950s as a way to convince the Pope that the pill wasn\u2019t **really** contraception - it was just an extension of a woman\u2019s natural menstrual cycle. Inventors knew, if they could get the Pope\u2019s approval, they\u2019d get more customers! So they designed the pill for the needs of religious MEN, instead of for women. (sounds familiar, huh?)\n\nHaving a period is messy, often painful, and kinda expensive. Period poverty is becoming a big deal, where women who are too poor to buy tampons or sanitary products simply miss school or work whilst having their period.\n\nIf we want to design a pill that\u2019s really in the best interests of women, we don\u2019t need this seven day break. Studies show that having just four days off every few months is plenty of time. I mean, think about other forms of contraception, like the IUD or the implanon. They\u2019re inserted for up to five YEARS and continuously release hormones - no need for breaks ever!\n\nWomen in the know can always just run their packets of pills together, and doctors do often suggest doing this off licence. But right now the design of the pill is unscientific and flawed. It\u2019s time we redesigned the pill so it serves the needs of women \u2013 instead of religious men!\n\n\n\nSCIQ ON TYT\n\nProduced by Jayde Lovell and Bec Susan Gill.

    "text": "Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday escalated her presidential campaign\u2019s battle against big money in politics, announcing that her bid for the Democratic nomination will forgo traditional fund-raising methods meant to cultivate a candidate\u2019s relationships with the wealthy.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator said she would no longer hold the private fund-raisers and one-on-one meetings with big donors that have become typical for Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\u201cThat means no fancy receptions or big money fund-raisers only with people who can write the big checks,\u201d Ms. Warren said in a morning email to supporters. \u201cIt means that wealthy donors won\u2019t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events. And it means I won\u2019t be doing \u2018call time,\u2019 which is when candidates take hours to call wealthy donors to ask for their support.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren made the announcement as the Democratic primary to oppose President Trump\u2019s re-election bid begins to take shape, and candidates in the crowded field are trying to find ways to distinguish themselves. Ms. Warren, who rose to prominence as a harsh critic of big corporations and unrestrained capitalism, has attempted to push the field in that direction, announcing expansive, liberal ideas on money and wealth more than a year before the first votes are cast."

And it's not because there is an actual emergency down there on the southern border, the only emergency down there are the children that we're locking in cages. But Hey, the administration, you know, did that. So that's really their emergency, but they're choosing to not deal with it. So okay. But really the reason this is even happening is because Donald Trump is trying to appease not just his base, because they're kind of secondary right now. What he's trying to do is a ps right wing pundit's. And a story came out from the New York Times this week, kind of showing how bad it got for the president following the government shutdown and his show down with Nancy Pelosi, a showdown that everybody is willing to admit, including Fox News viewers.\n\nAccording to a new poll today that Trump lost spectacularly, Nancy Pelosi made him look like a fool by not giving him what he wanted. He looked like a horrible negotiator. So according to this New York Times report, what did Trump do? He called his favorite buddies over at Fox News, Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs begging them to help him. He was begging them to go on TV and tell the other folks at the network to do the same, to defend the president. It say that, no, no, no, no. He's playing four dimensional, five dimensional chess, whatever it is, the new talking points. Since he can't even manage to play checkers, they've just evolved it into these new dimensions of chess, which is a fancy way of saying the guy keeps losing even though he swore up and down. He was a great negotiator. There's nothing great about Trump's negotiation skills.\n\nHe lost. He lost again this week with the new spending bill that actually gives him even less money. So yeah, not exactly a master negotiator, but he does get his national emergency, which I am assuming at this point came on the advice of people like Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs. They knew the president needed to save face. They knew the president needed to flex a little muscle. So I seriously doubt that either of these men didn't tell him to declare a national emergency Fletcher Authority and see what happens. Then watch those democrats panic and freak out way to trigger the libs by abusing the power of the office of the presidency. The bottom line is this, and this is something again we have said repeatedly for more than a year now, is that Fox News controls the White House, the White House Calls Fox News. The president of the United States is calling Fox News hosts and begging them to help him out, begging them to bail him out, begging them to come up with a plan because he is so powerless against Nancy Pelosi and her sarcastic clap heard round the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n#rof #trofire #theringoffire #progressivenews"

Mike Pence in Mike Pompeo, we're over in Poland in Warsaw, Poland at a u s led conference where they were beating the drums very loudly, trying to get EU leaders to join in with us and start a war with Iran, which honestly, to me, it's kind of interesting because you know, last week it was, it was Venezuela and the week before that it was a ran and then the week before that it was Venezuela. So I guess right now we're back on a rant, but I think the bottom line is that one way or another, one country or the other, we're going to end up in an armed conflict in a foreign sovereign country before the 2020 election.\n\nThat is my prediction and I believe it 100% maybe it'll be a ran, maybe it'll be Venezuela. It will definitely be one of them, possibly be both of them because this administration will not stop beating those drums of war. Now, as for Mike Pence, in his little speech over there in Poland, he was trying to tell the leaders there that are ran. A quote is plotting a new holocaust. That's what he said. Those were his words. They're plotting a new holocaust. Dot. Did he have any evidence to back this up? No. Did he have any information as to what he actually meant? No, he just knows that his boss, John Bolton wants to go to war. And so Mike Pence, the vice president is going to do whatever he has to do to go and convince the rest of the world to go to war with us. You know, we kind of burned out all of our goodwill when we lied to the same countries that pence is lying to today, uh, about Iraq.\n\nI don't think they're going to sign on to another American war of aggression in Iran. They, they've seen this before. They remember it very clearly. It wasn't that long ago. They know how this story ends. And it doesn't end well for anyone. It creates more instability in the Middle East. The United States might get to take a little bit of their oil and then we're going to have other groups move in like we did with Iraq and just create more violence and chaos and terror. It's what the u s is best at. We don't make new democracies. We make new hotbeds for terrorists to arise. That's what we've been great at for decades now. And Mike Pence wants to continue that tradition. Mike Palm Peo, who was also with pence echoed those claims and they even said, you know, listen, we know a lot of you folks out here, you know, maybe you don't want to do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n#rof #trofire #theringoffire #progressivenews"

    "authors": [

    ],
    "text": "CNN announced on Tuesday it has hired longtime Republican operative Sarah Isgur as political editor, charged with shaping its 2020 campaign coverage.\n\nAccording to a CNN spokesperson, Isgur, who most recently worked as the Department of Justice\u2019s main spokesperson under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, will coordinate the network\u2019s political coverage for the 2020 election cycle on TV and on CNN\u2019s website. Isgur starts work next month, and will not be involved in coverage of DOJ. She will occasionally appear on TV.\n\nIsgur\u2019s LinkedIn page indicates she has no journalism experience. She has, however, worked for a variety of right-wing organizations and campaigns, including the Carly Fiorina and Mitt Romney presidential bids, the Republican National Committee, and a Ted Cruz US Senate campaign.\n\nComing as it does in the wake of a presidential cycle in which the mainstream media\u2019s fixation on Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails (among other issues) was widely criticized, news of Isgur\u2019s hiring sparked concerns about the direction CNN is taking heading into 2020.\n\nFlores was:\n\n> Political director of Texans for Ted Cruz in 2009\n\n> A Romney 2012 advisor\n\n> Deputy Comms director for the RNC in 2013/2014\n\n> Carly Fiorina's 2016 deputy campaign manager\n\n> Spokeswoman for Jeff Sessions\n\nAnd @CNN's just putting her in charge of straight news? https://t.co/ofBv93gC07 \u2014 Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) February 19, 2019\n\nThe Washington Post reported that during an early 2017 Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump, Isgur \u2014 who was critical of Trump during the 2016 campaign \u2014 \u201ckowtowed to Trump\u201d and pledged loyalty to his agenda as a condition of getting the job as Sessions\u2019 spokesperson.\n\nIsgur\u2019s hire was first reported by Politico, which noted that \u201cwhile it is common for departing administration officials to join cable news networks as analysts or contributors, it is less common for them to oversee news coverage.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday evening, a CNN spokesperson emailed Vox and said they \u201cjust wanted to be super clear \u2013 Sarah is not leading, overseeing, or running political coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is helping to coordinate coverage across TV and Digital \u2013 she is one of several editors,\u201d the spokesperson added, going on to characterize Isgur\u2019s role as making sure that stories are featured on the right shows and articles get posted online at the right time.\n\nTrump\u2019s favorite target for abuse hands the keys to a former administration staffer\n\nIsgur\u2019s new employer is a favorite target of President Trump\u2019s abuse, including as recently as last Friday, when during a press conference he dismissed CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nWhile the network hasn\u2019t commented on its reasons for bringing Isgur aboard, it stands to reason that CNN sees hiring a conservative as a way to push back on the perception that it\u2019s biased against Trump. Unsurprisingly, news of her hire was applauded by at least one prominent right-wing voice.\n\nHiring a conservative journalist for a political editor role would be one thing. But a dive into Isgur\u2019s social media presence suggests her lack of fitness for her new role goes deeper than mere politics.\n\nIsgur has pushed false claims and conspiracies to demean Democrats\n\nIsgur\u2019s personal Twitter account provides some clues about how she might shape CNN\u2019s coverage. Back in 2013, she took umbrage at the network characterizing a group as \u201canti-gay\u201d and \u201canti-abortion.\u201d\n\nThe next year, she derisively described her future employer as the \u201cClinton News Network.\u201d\n\nIsgur was not a fan of Obama, who she compared to Richard Nixon, and blamed him for problems he had nothing to do with.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Isgur posted tweets comparing abortion to America\u2019s epidemic of gun violence, and pushed Planned Parenthood conspiracy theories that were grounded in misleadingly edited videos.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Isgur did criticize Trump. In October 2016, she tweeted that Trump\u2019s call to prosecute Hillary Clinton \u201cis a scary and dangerous threat.\u201d But she was even more outspoken in her criticisms of Clinton.\n\nIsgur also claimed \u201cself righteous liberals\u201d who criticize Republicans are \u201cno different than Trump.\u201d\n\nWhen she was working for Carly Fiorina in October 2015, Isgur made a false claim about job losses during Obama\u2019s first term to attack Clinton.\n\nIsgur also indicated that she thinks concerns about climate change are overblown.\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn, Isgur started worked as the DOJ\u2019s public affairs director in February 2017. That same month, she posted a tweet attacking \u201cprogressives\u201d for being fake feminists.\n\nAround that same time, Isgur pushed a false equivalency to defend Trump\u2019s first iteration of the Muslim ban, criticized journalists for covering Trump\u2019s tweets, attacked reporters for accurately pointing out that Trump spent years pushing a racist conspiracy theory about Obama\u2019s place of birth, and even praised Kellyanne Conway for \u201cshowing America what real feminism looks like.\u201d\n\nThis is the person CNN is entrusting with coordinating coverage of the 2020 campaign. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nThe news moves fast. To stay updated, follow Aaron Rupar on Twitter, and read more of Vox\u2019s policy and politics coverage."

    "title": "The number of hate groups in the United States has reached a record high",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The number of hate groups in the United States has surged to an all-time high, according to a new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), with numbers rising for the fourth year in a row.\n\nThe SPLC\u2019s annual Year in Hate and Extremism report, released Wednesday, recorded 1,020 hate groups in the United States in 2018. That figure includes neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and anti-government extremists, and represents a rise of seven percent from 2017.\n\nThe report also noted that an increasingly diverse political field, coupled with President Donald Trump\u2019s failure up until now to follow through on promises like the border wall, have left those on the extreme right feeling somewhat disillusioned. This, in turn, creates the possibility that more will launch violent lone wolf attacks in response to that disillusionment.\n\n\u201cThe midterms tended to validate hate groups\u2019 fears for the future. Even more angering to hate groups were the dozens of women\u2026elected to the new U.S. Congress, including two Muslims,\u201d the report read. \u201cFor white supremacists, these newly elected officials symbolize the country\u2019s changing demographics \u2014 the future that white supremacists loathe and fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the SPLC, there is serious concern that disillusioned individuals on the far right will give up on politics and take matters into their own hands.\n\nOne example of this is the case of suspected gunman Robert Bowers who allegedly killed eleven worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,\u201d Bowers wrote on the far right social media Gab, just prior to the shooting, referencing a baseless conspiracy theory about billionaire and liberal philanthropist George Soros supposedly financing a caravan of immigrants headed to the U.S.-Mexico border. Soros is a frequent target of anti-Semites who claim he wields massive influence in progressive politics.\n\n\u201cScrew your optics, I\u2019m going in,\u201d Bowers wrote.\n\nThe SPLC\u2019s concerns are backed up by another report on far right violence released by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in January. According to that report, almost every extremist-related murder committed in the United States in 2018 was carried out by an individual who was either directly linked or affiliated with the far right. In the lone exception, the perpetrator was affiliated with the far right before switching over to Islamic extremism just prior to carrying out a murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SPLC noted that the president himself has been instrumental in helping to elevate certain far right talking points, such as the idea that white farmers in South Africa are facing genocide, a central theme from last November\u2019s National Socialist Movement rally in Arkansas.\n\n\u201cThis president is not simply a polarizing figure but a radicalizing one,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project. \u201cRather than trying to tamp down hate, as presidents of both parties have done, President Trump elevates it.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the report highlighted various tech companies\u2019 reluctance to enforce rigid and consistent policies against the far right on their platforms, often waiting until they are forced to react to an incident before taking action. It was only after the violence at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, for instance, that far right figures were booted off social media and fundraising platforms \u2014 despite them having used those same platforms to spew hate for months beforehand.\n\n\u201cMost of the white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups operating today are no longer traditionally structured organizations led by known figures. Instead, hate groups are now\u2026 almost entirely online,\u201d the report read. \u201cThe increase in white nationalist and neo-Nazi hate group chapters in 2018\u2026 shows that these digitally savvy groups are flourishing in spite of Silicon Valley\u2019s promises to police them.\u201d"

And it is the fact that Saturday night live keeps making fun of him. On Sunday, just nine hours after Saturday night live had aired a, a cold open featuring Alec Baldwin doing his Trump impression. Uh, Trump tweeted out the following, he said nothing funny about tired Saturday night live on fake news. NBC question is, how do the networks get away with these total republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows, very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real collusion. So in Donald Trump's warped a little mind, the producers of Saturday night live, possibly even Lauren Michaels himself, are somehow working with the DNC. Donald Trump's political rivals each week to come up with new skits and jokes just to make fun of Donald Trump and the Republican party.\n\nThat is what Donald Trump believes according to not just this tweet, but he is actually tweeted out in recent months that there's obviously collusion between Saturday night live and the Democratic Party. Now, I'm forced to assume at this point that Donald Trump has never actually seen Saturday night live prior to ever becoming president of the United States because since the show's inception and I believe 1975 they've literally made fun of every single sitting president during their entire tenure on the air. Every single one of them has been made fun of. They have made fun of Democrats. They have made fun of Republicans and not just the presidents, but politicians have higher profiles. They make fun of everyone because it's funny because it's topical because it's the news of the day and that is what they're supposed to do. Sometimes it is funny. A lot of times it's actually not that a clever nonetheless, there's no investigation needed here.\n\nJust because you got your little feelings hurt because you're giving rambling press conferences that are very easy to make fun of. That doesn't mean that SNL is actively working with the DNC or any of your political rivals. You know, a couple of days ago, Trump tweeted out that the democrats need to lighten up. You know, they need to chill out a little bit. Everything's going great. Why so angry all the time? And then here he is, just four or five days later, getting triggered by an episode of Snl to the point where he actively called for an investigation to make sure that that program is not working for the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\n#rof #trofire #theringoffire #progressivenews"

These farmers also happen to be part of the backbone of Trump country, and if he continues to squeeze them financially they will be far less likely to support his reelection bid in 2020.

Has Your Life Gotten worse under Donald Trump? You know, I mean, at the end of the day when you look at everything with your life, has anything actually changed since trump became president? And I know there's lots of people in this country who say yes, but to be perfectly honest, most people in this country, the answer would be no. I guess technically no. My Day to day life, you know, has not been impacted yet so far by Donald Trump being president of the United States, which even that is not true because we are being exposed to higher levels of corporate toxins in our drinking water, toxins in the air, you know, abuse by corporations.\n\nYou know, the deregulation that does affect all of us. It's just that people don't necessarily notice it right away, but there are groups of people in this country who immediately got slammed by this administration and their ass backwards policies and one of the biggest groups, one of the groups have seen the most impact on their daily lives since trump came to office and started doing all these awful things. American farmers, ironically enough American farmers in red states in the reddest counties in the red states that voted overwhelmingly for Donald trump. Those people have been hit harder financially than virtually any other group in this country by Donald Trump's policies specifically. His trade wars have absolutely decimated American farmers in three states, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. In 2018, the number, a number of farmer bankruptcy's doubled in those three states. States like Arkansas, so the number of bankruptcies amongst farmers increased by 96 percent.\n\nFarmers all over this country are going bankrupt because of Donald Trump's trade wars and some of the ridiculous trade deals that he worked out that actually hurt American farmers. More so what's happening right now across the globe is that American goods, because of trade wars, tariffs, whatever it is, and decreased demand is part of it. American goods are no longer the most attractive. We're not the best price, we're not the best quality, so they're turning elsewhere and actually Australia has been one of the huge beneficiaries of trump's trade wars because now instead of countries looking to us to buy our produce, they're actually buying it from Australia who's making a ton of money while our farmers, the people who put Donald Trump in office or help to put them in office, they're losing their livelihoods. You know, farms that have been in families for generations gone, their future gone and they have no idea what to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#rof #trofire #theringoffire #progressivenews"

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) on Sunday called for expanding Medicare to people who are 50 years and older rather than pushing for 'Medicare for all,' a popular option for many potential Democratic 2020 nominees.\n\n\n\nBrown, who is considering running for president and who has said Medicare for all isn't practical, said Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union' that he wants to 'help people now.' His proposal would create a voluntary buy-in to Medicare for people who are 50 and older.\n\n\n\n'I want to expand Medicare to 50,' he added. 'Now, if we get enough people, we will see a lot of people get in \u2014 in that plan, 58-year-olds and 62-year-olds that have lost their insurance, lost their jobs. We will see the success of that, and that will end up continuing to broaden and expand coverage for so many Americans.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHost: Cenk Uygur\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

That call reported triggered the lockdown.\n\nHowever, the suspect did not have a gun and never entered the Sunset Boulevard offices of the streamer, police tell Deadline.\n\nLaw enforcement officials say they received a call at 3:53 PM PT claiming that an individual with a gun was on the Netflix lot at Sunset Bronson Studios at Sunset and Bronson Avenue. Officers immediately were deployed to what quickly became a very tense situation.\n\nYouTube\n\nHowever, despite evacuations of employees from Netflix and the KTLA-TV studios next door, there was no risk, the LAPD confirms.\n\n\u201cWe received a tip about a potential law enforcement incident,\u201d Netflix said in a statement that went out to staffers as the situation was still being assessed. \u201cPolice are conducting a sweep of the lot out of an abundance of caution. There is no immediate danger or threat to our employees. Feel free to share this information with your loved ones.\u201d\n\nPolice are wrapping up their sweep and now leaving the area. Sunset is reopening to traffic on this rainy Thursday.\n\nUPDATED: Tense situation at Netflix headquarters. Sources close to the situation said no one can get in or out, and word is a person with a deadly weapon is the reason the building has been locked down.\n\nKTLA-TV, which is right nearby the Sunset Bronson Studio, just went up with a report. The word we are getting is that there is a report of an active shooter on a nearby rooftop, and security smartly locked it down. Awaiting clarity, but haven\u2019t heard back from Netflix with anything official yet.\n\nThey are now evacuating Netflix headquarters. Cop cars are everywhere, and the SWAT team is on the premises, looking for the shooter."

    "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFeb. 13, 2019, 9:39 PM GMT / Updated Feb. 14, 2019, 8:15 PM GMT By Erik Ortiz\n\nThe family of a young Bay Area rapper who was killed when police officers opened fire after he had fallen asleep in his car is demanding the release of police bodycam footage and questioning whether deadly force was justified.\n\nPolice in Vallejo, California, said in a news release that the six officers shot \"multiple rounds\" at the driver \u2014 identified by his family as Willie McCoy, 20 \u2014 in the span of four seconds Saturday night in a Taco Bell parking lot. It's unclear how many bullets struck McCoy, but his family said they believe at least 20 may have hit his car based on the number of holes that witnesses counted at the scene.\n\n\"It seems like an execution,\" David Harrison, McCoy's cousin and manager, said Wednesday. \"It looks like my baby cousin was executed by a firing squad.\"\n\nWillie McCoy was fatally shot by Vallejo, California, police on Feb. 9, 2019. Courtesy of David Harrison\n\nThe Vallejo Police Department said it is working with the Solano County District Attorney's Office to investigate the shooting \u2014 the latest in a department that in recent years has been criticized for excessive use of force and has been the subject of civil rights complaints.\n\nIn a statement, Vallejo Police Chief Andrew Bidou said a review of the shooting is in its early stages, although \"any loss of life is a tragedy.\" The department did not identify McCoy in its statement.\n\nOfficials also declined further comment about any plans to release video from the incident and questions regarding police protocol. The department's police union did not immediately respond to an email Wednesday.\n\nHarrison said he's not happy about a lack of information that has come out about his cousin's death and is awaiting the results of an autopsy and toxicology report.\n\n\"It doesn't take six officers to pump bullets through a car that's not going anywhere,\" he said.\n\nVallejo police said two patrol officers were first called to the Taco Bell after 10:30 p.m., when employees reported a driver slumped over in a car at the drive-thru.\n\nUpon arrival, the officers said, they noticed a handgun in the driver's lap and called for backup.\n\n\"The two officers decided to hold their position and did not attempt to wake the driver,\" police said.\n\nThe officers discussed trying to remove the gun from the driver, but found his door locked. They also noticed the car was actually in drive, so additional units helped to position a marked patrol car in front of McCoy's car \"to prevent forward or erratic movement,\" police said.\n\nAs a second car was being placed behind McCoy's car to prevent him from making sudden movements, he woke up.\n\nWillie McCoy, right, with his cousin, David Harrison. Courtesy of David Harrison\n\nPolice said he was given \"several commands\" to put his hands up, but he did not comply and appeared to \"quickly\" move his hands down to the firearm.\n\nThe officers began \"fearing for their safety,\" and fired their weapons, police said. They continued to yell commands at the driver and then reached through a broken window to unlock his door and begin lifesaving efforts. McCoy was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nHarrison said he has questions about where the officers were positioned when they shot his cousin and whether they saw him reach for a gun. A preliminary investigation found a fully loaded .40 caliber semiautomatic handgun with an extended magazine, which had been reported stolen out of Oregon, authorities said.\n\nHarrison said the officers could have been more strategic and remained behind the car and used a loudspeaker if they feared for their lives since they didn't know how startled McCoy would become.\n\n\"I don't think he even had time to react,\" Harrison added. \"If you're just waking up from sleep, you don't know what you have around you and who's talking to you.\"\n\nHarrison said McCoy \u2014 known by his stage name Willie Bo \u2014 had been in the recording studio in recent days and was on tour with his group, FBG. He had also been splitting time between family in Vallejo and Oakland. On the night he was killed, Harrison added, McCoy may have gone to the Taco Bell for a bite to eat and was so exhausted that he fell asleep.\n\nHe said he didn't know McCoy to own a firearm.\n\nLawmakers in California have pursued legislation that would set rules for when police can use deadly force and instead seek nonlethal alternatives to deescalate a situation \u2014 coming after the high-profile shooting last year of Stephon Clark, a black Sacramento man who police later confirmed was unarmed. Law enforcement groups, however, argue that officers make split-second decisions in potentially deadly situations, and that lethal force may need to be an option.\n\nPolice in Vallejo, a bedroom community north of San Francisco with a racially diverse population, have been under scrutiny in the past over officers' actions.\n\nLast August, the police department defended the use of force after video showed officers holding down a man and striking him outside of a restaurant.\n\nIn January, a police officer was seen tackling and handcuffing a black Marine veteran in a video that went viral. That officer was placed on leave.\n\nThe department has paid more per officer in civil rights cases than other local departments, the East Bay Express reported last year.\n\nHarrison said his family is pained thinking about McCoy's final moments and his likely bewilderment when police came upon him.\n\nMcCoy, the second youngest of five siblings, lost his parents to cancer at a young age and was raised by his cousins and a sister. He used music as an outlet to rap about family ties and the inequities in life.\n\n\"He was always talking about being able to escape in his music because a lot of experience living in the Bay Area is police brutality and racial profiling,\" Harrison said. \"It's tragic that Willie didn't escape it himself.\""

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?\n\nProgressives were on the march in 2018. They weren\u2019t just resisting Trump; they were outlining the alternative to Trumpism. They weren\u2019t just winning the battle of ideas by moving Medicare for All and Fight for $15 proposals into the mainstream; they were winning battles at the ballot box as well. The fight for the future is far from over, but 2018 offered signs that it can and will be won. The Nation\u2019s 2018 Progressive Honor Roll recognizes the dissidents and the strategists, the veteran campaigners and the next-gen leaders who are charting the course.1 Ad Policy\n\nMost Valuable Progressives2\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar,\n\nand Ayanna Pressley\n\nDemocrats took back the House of Representatives on November 6, restoring the system of checks and balances that had failed to function for the first two years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. But this was not a traditional transition of power: The winning Democrats were younger, more diverse, more aggressively progressive\u2014and so many of them were women.3\n\nA week after the election, at the VoteRunLead Women and Power Town Hall, newly elected congressmembers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (New York), Rashida Tlaib (Michigan), Ilhan Omar (Minnesota) and Ayanna Pressley (Massachusetts) were snapped in a now-iconic photo showing the fab four, smiling, in their \u201cseats at the table.\u201d They were not the only groundbreaking victors in a year that saw a historic number of women secure Democratic nominations for the House, the Senate, and state posts. But this particular foursome had arrived with a sense of solidarity and shared purpose, having won with backing from Justice Democrats, the group that promised \u201ca new type of Democratic majority in Congress.\u201d4\n\nOmar announced that the newcomers\u2014two of whom had defeated Democratic congressmen in the primaries, two of whom had won crowded primary contests for open seats\u2014\u201cdid not come to play.\u201d Fox News disapproved; it featured an image of the quartet with the headline \u201cRadical New Democratic Ideas: Free College for All, Free Health Care for All, Abolish ICE, Green New Deal.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez replied: \u201cFox News discovered our vast conspiracy to take care of children and save the planet.\u201d5 Progressives Rising A New Generation of Activists Is in the House John Nichols\n\nThat wasn\u2019t just rhetoric on her part. The youngest woman ever elected to Congress and her colleagues got started by calling for the creation of a select committee to create a Green New Deal. That unsettled some senior committee chairs. But young activists from the Sunrise Movement flooded the Capitol to lobby veteran Democratic lawmakers to follow the lead of their caucus\u2019s newest members. The teenage protesters carried signs that read: No More Excuses. Now they have a nucleus of Democrats who share their sense of urgency.6\n\nMost Valuable Senator7\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nA senator serving in the minority in Mitch McConnell\u2019s chamber of legislative horrors has a duty to object. And few senators have objected so consistently in 2018 as Bernie Sanders did to the Senate\u2019s transformation into a rubber stamp for the Trump administration and Wall Street. But what made Sanders so valuable\u2014and effective\u2014was his determination to promote an alternative politics and policies. Throughout the year, he introduced major bills that drew national attention: a \u201cToo Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist\u201d measure, with California Congressman Brad Sherman, to break up the nation\u2019s biggest banks and risky financial institutions; a Workplace Democracy Act, with Wisconsin Congressman Mark Pocan, to restore the right of workers to organize unions and bargain collectively by repealing Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act and upending so-called right-to-work laws in the states; an Opioid Crisis Accountability Act of 2018, with Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, to penalize drug manufacturers who illegally market or distribute opioid products; and a comprehensive plan to save the US Postal Service.8 Current Issue View our current issue\n\nSanders, Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy, and Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah built a bipartisan coalition that voted 56\u201341 to reject the Trump administration\u2019s support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s genocidal assault on Yemen. When he couldn\u2019t get the Senate to act, Sanders used his bully pulpit: he organized live and online town-hall meetings\u2014with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, filmmaker Michael Moore, actress Shailene Woodley, author Bill McKibben, and others\u2014that attracted millions to discussions on climate change, inequality, and corporate welfare. In September, Sanders introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (or \u201cStop BEZOS\u201d) Act, named for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, to pressure trillion-dollar corporations to pay fair wages. The proposal, wrote Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist Michael Hiltzik, \u201cset the policy world ablaze.\u201d In October, Bezos announced that Amazon would pay its 250,000 US employees\u2014and 100,000 seasonal workers\u2014at least $15 an hour.9\n\nMost Valuable House Member 10\n\nRo Khanna\n\nCalifornia Democrat Ro Khanna spins out more ideas in a week than most House members produce in a congressional career. In his freshman term, he emerged as the chamber\u2019s most ardent and courageous advocate for a new approach to foreign policy by promoting engaged diplomacy as an alternative to ever-expanding Pentagon budgets. To that end, Khanna worked with Mark Pocan to end US support for the Saudi war on Yemen, and with California Democrat Barbara Lee to scrap the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which presidents have routinely used as justification for military interventions since 9/11. He also urged his colleagues to take risks in supporting the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.11\n\nThat would be sufficient to earn him a place on this year\u2019s honor roll. But Khanna has also stepped up as the savviest advocate on communications and technology issues in the House, circulating a pitch-perfect Internet Bill of Rights. And he moved to the forefront of the fight for corporate accountability, sharing credit with Sanders for getting Amazon to raise wages and declaring: \u201cI am not in the House to appease special interests, so it\u2019s fine if Big Pharma and defense contractors don\u2019t like me. I don\u2019t work for them. I work for ordinary Americans who can\u2019t afford a lobbyist.\u201d12\n\nMost Valuable Champion of Checks and Balances 13\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nThe Senate failed the American people when it put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, even after Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s courageous testimony to the Judiciary Committee. The crudest moment in the meltdown of the advice-and-consent process came when Kavanaugh made a second appearance before the Republican-controlled committee and responded venomously to questions from Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. Even as he demanded to know whether Klobuchar\u2014who\u2019d spoken poignantly about her father\u2019s struggles with alcoholism\u2014had ever blacked out from drinking, the senator remained firmly focused on the questions that needed to be answered. Her dignity under fire confirmed Klobuchar as the ablest defender of the system of checks and balances at a moment when the Senate was losing sight of its responsibility to the Constitution.14\n\nMost Valuable Policy Intervention 15\n\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus Center\n\nAs Democrats prepare to take charge of the House, the Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairs for the 116th Congress, Mark Pocan (Wisconsin) and Pramila Jayapal (Washington), have launched a bold initiative to get progressive lawmakers working on strategy and messaging with policy and advocacy groups outside Congress. The Congressional Progressive Caucus Center, with a budget in excess of $1.5 million and a staff of at least eight, will coordinate progressive policy development and messaging. Their mission, says Jayapal, is to leverage \u201cthe power of the progressive movement to enact strong progressive legislation and really build our movement for change across the country.\u201d16\n\nMost Valuable State Official 17\n\nMaura Healey\n\nMassachusetts\u2019s Maura Healey is the bane of Donald Trump\u2019s existence: a whip-smart state attorney general leading a skilled team that has joined (and frequently led) legal challenges to the president. Pick an issue\u2014climate change, immigrant rights, predatory lending, the ban on transgender people in the military\u2014and Healey has battled and often beaten the Trump team. \u201cAs attorney general, if I won\u2019t stand up for the Constitution and against the abuse of power, then who will?\u201d she asks.18\n\nHealey is just as tough on corporate abuses of power. As The Boston Globe notes, \u201cHer aggressive action in regard to utilities, insurers, lenders, landlords, and dubious business practices has resulted in hundreds of millions in savings or money returned or rebated to taxpayers, workers, and ratepayers. Stories about her success on that front have become so regular as to be almost routine.\u201d The voters were impressed, too: Healey was just reelected with 70 percent of the vote.19\n\nMost Valuable State Legislator 20\n\nPamela Powers Hannley\n\nIn her years as a blogger and activist, Pamela Powers Hannley often heard Arizona Democrats bemoan their party\u2019s minority status. But she didn\u2019t want to complain; she wanted to help fight for women\u2019s rights, criminal-justice reform, strong unions, public banking, and her vision for democratic renewal. So she ran for a seat in the state House of Representatives, beat a Democratic incumbent in the 2016 primary, and joined eight newly elected Democratic women in the state legislature.21\n\n\u201cThis is a really intelligent, assertive group of freshmen,\u201d noted Arizona House minority leader Rebecca Rios, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Phoenix. With a boost from Powers Hannley, an experienced communications consultant, the new legislators used Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and podcasts to drum up attention\u2014and support. \u201cThe people back in Tucson, they expect me to speak up,\u201d Powers Hannley told the Arizona Capitol Times. \u201cThat\u2019s why I persist.\u201d Persistence paid off: In November, she was reelected with ease, as Arizona Democrats had their best finish in state House races since 1966.22\n\nMost Valuable Judges 23\n\nTexas\u2019s \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d Slate\n\nThe movement for criminal-justice reform has increasingly focused on the election of local prosecutors who recognize that new approaches are necessary. But it\u2019s also vital to elect judges who understand the need for equal justice under the law. A huge step in that direction was taken on November 6, when 17 African-American women were elected to judgeships in Texas\u2019s Harris County, which includes Houston. Aided by the excitement over Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate run and a smart social-media campaign that urged people in the state\u2019s largest county to \u201cmake history\u201d by voting for the \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d slate, these candidates spurred a record turnout that changed the face and the focus of the local judiciary.24\n\n\u201cI hope that our election will usher in courts that ensure an equal opportunity for justice for all,\u201d said Latosha Lewis Payne, one of the new judges. \u201cWe talked about\u2026being more compassionate, more understanding of the poor and disadvantaged that come into the judicial system.\u201d25\n\nMost Valuable Mayor 26\n\nMichael Tubbs\n\nTwo years ago, at age 26, Michael Tubbs defeated a Republican incumbent to become the first African-American mayor of Stockton, California, a city of 310,000 that, after the 2008 financial crisis, was the second-largest community in the United States to file for bankruptcy protection. Leading a majority-minority city where one in four people lives in poverty, Tubbs has sought transformational change. He\u2019s embraced a test project that will make Stockton the first city in the country to implement a universal basic income (UBI), providing 100 residents with payments of $500 a month for 18 months.27 Honor Rolls Past The 2017 Progressive Honor Roll John Nichols The 2016 Progressive Honor Roll John Nichols\n\n\u201cWe have a bunch of folks starting off life already behind, born into communities that don\u2019t have a lot of opportunity,\u201d says Tubbs, who recognizes that the \u201clooming threat of automation and displacement\u201d could make their circumstances dramatically worse. Tubbs isn\u2019t suggesting that a UBI will address every challenge of the future; rather, the Stanford grad is working with some of the savviest thinkers in the country to make sure that his city generates cutting-edge responses to inequality.28\n\nMost Valuable Advance for Voting Rights 29\n\nThe Florida Voting Restoration Amendment\n\nFour years ago, Floridians for a Fair Democracy drafted the Florida Voting Restoration Amendment. It became Amendment 4, a proposal to restore \u201cthe eligibility to vote of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete all terms of their sentence including parole, probation, and restitution.\u201d The group gathered 1.1 million signatures to put the measure on the November 2018 ballot, betting that a campaign based on common decency and common sense would earn broad support for returning voting rights to roughly 1.5 million disenfranchised Floridians. And it did: The amendment was passed with 65 percent of the vote.30\n\nMost Valuable Protest 31\n\nLove Knows No Borders\n\nThere have been many objections to the horrific treatment of migrants at the US-Mexico border. Particular credit goes to Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley, who traveled to South Texas in June and demanded access to hundreds of migrant children who had been grabbed from their parents under orders from the Trump administration. Video of Merkley\u2019s stand went viral and played a critical role in forcing a debate that ultimately caused the president to declare that families should be kept together. But Trump\u2019s policies continue to create chaos at the border.32\n\nThat is why it is so important that faith groups have maintained a vigilant moral presence. The role played by groups like the American Friends Service Committee has been essential, especially as the president has demonized Central American migrants who have traveled by caravan to the border. AFSC supported a powerful \u201cLove Knows No Borders\u201d week of action in December, which saw more than 100 faith leaders from across the country participate in nonviolent direct action in the border region near San Diego. The campaign\u2019s purpose: \u201cdemanding an end to border militarization and calling for humane immigration policies that respect the rights and dignity of all people.\u201d33\n\nMost Valuable Multimedia Maker 34\n\nLaura Flanders\n\nIf our media spent less time obsessing about Trump and more time focusing on the construction of a new economy, examining the abuses of the military-industrial complex, getting real about racial justice, and embracing the promise of intersectional feminism, there would be a lot more hope for the future. Laura Flanders knows this. Her focus on the work of visionary social critics, artists, and activists has, over the past decade, made The Laura Flanders Show\u2014on television, radio, podcasts, and the Internet\u2014essential media for our times. As the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II says: \u201cLaura Flanders is the real deal.\u201d35\n\nMost Valuable Documentary 36\n\nDark Money\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that my home state of Montana would be the only state to fight back against Citizens United in the Supreme Court, everything changed. As a fourth-generation Montanan\u2026I knew I could tell a compelling story of campaign finance through the eyes of real people. I grabbed the best camera I could get my hands on and started filming,\u201d recalls director Kimberly Reed. Her documentary, Dark Money, is a riveting story of how money corrupts our politics, and of courageous challenges to that corruption. It also makes a powerful argument for why grassroots journalism (as practiced by reporters like John S. Adams, founder of the Montana Free Press and one of the \u201cstars\u201d of Dark Money) remains our essential defense against the abuses of corporate and political elites.37\n\nMost Valuable Biography 38\n\nHarvey Milk: His Lives and Death\n\nThe 2018 election results prove that we are still in the era of \u201cfirsts\u201d: the first Native American women (Kansas\u2019s Sharice Davids and New Mexico\u2019s Deb Haaland) and the first Muslim American women (Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar) elected to Congress; the first openly gay man elected as governor (Colorado\u2019s Jared Polis). As the barriers to the full realization of America\u2019s democratic promise were being broken down, historian Lillian Faderman released a brilliant rumination on the revolutionary political journey of Harvey Milk, the openly gay San Francisco supervisor who was assassinated 40 years ago. \u201cFrom his earliest campaigns, Harvey had argued that gay people had to make coalitions with all dispossessed people,\u201d she writes. \u201cNot only did they have common enemies: the \u2018them\u2019s that kept the poor and minorities in positions of powerlessness; but [it was also] the morally right thing to do.\u201d These coalitions matter now more than ever, as Faderman so ably reminds us in a book that recalls the whole of Milk\u2019s activism.39\n\nMost Valuable Autobiography44\n\nThe Hard Stuff: Dope, Crime, the MC5 and My Life of Impossibilities,\n\nby Wayne Kramer\n\nFor five decades, from the founding of the MC5 in the 1960s to the present, no one has rocked harder than Wayne Kramer. And few have done so much to link the vital energy of music with radical demands for economic and social and racial justice. At 70, Kramer\u2019s back on the road with an \u201cMC50\u201d tour and an edgy autobiography that combines \u201ckick out the jams\u201d history with perspectives that, notes The Guardian, are \u201cas suited to the sociology section as the music aisle.\u201d What distinguishes Kramer is his determination to use every note he plays as a musician and every word he writes as an author to make a change-especially on the criminal-justice issues that have been the focus of his brilliant campaign to get musical instruments into the hands of people in prison: Jail Guitar Doors USA.45\n\nMost Valuable Local Radio46\n\nKPFA\n\nBerkeley\u2019s KPFA, the first community-supported radio station in the United States will turn 70 in 2019\u2014and it remains a multicultural treasure that produces some of the finest arts and music programming in the country. At the same time, KPFA has become an essential source for news programming in California and nationally (thanks to podcasts, the Internet, and collaborations with Pacifica stations). The station\u2019s morning news show, Upfront, is a sharp and smart digest of local, national and international news that provides a perfect lead in to Amy Goodman\u2019s Democracy Now!47\n\nMost Valuable Music 40\n\nFandango at the Wall\n\nGrammy Award\u2013winning jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader Arturo O\u2019Farrill crossed borders and musical genres to create a stunning challenge to the politics of distrust and division that Donald Trump has amplified with his constant attacks on immigrants and refugees\u2014and his obsessive advocacy for a wall along the US-Mexico border. O\u2019Farrill drew together 50 artists for five recording sessions\u2014several of them at the Tijuana\u2013San Diego border\u2014that produced 30 songs influenced by Latin jazz, hip-hop, classical, world, Broadway, and son jarocho music.41\n\nThe resulting album is stunning, and the vision\u2014as described in an essay by executive producer Kabir Sehgal\u2014is a strikingly hopeful one: \u201cMobilizing a small army of musicians, producers, staff to stage a concert was a significant amount of work. But it was worth it.42\n\n\u201cHere is the moment that struck me: the border wall was behind us, the sun was setting over the Paci\ufb01c Ocean, the crowd was yelling \u2018Epa\u2019 and Otra!\u2019, and the band was grooving. Many of us were in tears as we took everything in. For a moment, we had helped to turn a symbol of division into a common space of peace and harmony.\u201d43"

    "text": "In this edition: The centrists enter the Democratic primary, the official debate rules are out, and the Young Turks wants to interview the 2020 field.\n\nUnless you're spending tonight at a reception for state Democratic Party chairs, you're not honoring the true spirit of Valentine's Day. This is The Trailer.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper speaks at a house party in Manchester, N.H., on Wednesday. (David Weigel/The Washington Post)\n\nHENNIKER, N.H. \u2014 At every stop of his latest trip to New Hampshire, John Hickenlooper got the same question. On Thursday, it came from a student at New England College, who wanted to know how the former governor of Colorado would bring the country together.\n\n\u201cI look at what we were able to achieve in Colorado, and in every case it was because we were able to sit down with people who were feuding and at each other\u2019s throats,\u201d said Hickenlooper, who is expected to announce his presidential plans next month. \u201cWe were able to get them to put down their weapons.\u201d\n\nIn Henniker, Hickenlooper\u2019s example was a compromise on emissions standards; at a house party in Manchester, it was the story of passing gun-safety laws after a 2012 mass shooting. Neither crowd was the size of the ones Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) or Cory Booker (N.J.) has begun to draw, but each was full of Democrats who did not consider themselves part of the far left. Every candidate, from Warren to Hickenlooper, is getting asked about togetherness.\n\nWith the exception of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the next wave of candidates likely to announce Democratic presidential bids is far closer to the center than the wave of the past six weeks. Hickenlooper, who has been discussed as a potential president or vice president since he first was elected governor in 2010, is one of at least 10 candidates arguing that the party can't win by just exciting its base \u2014 and that if tacks a bit closer to the center, it can win in a rout.\n\nMost of the Democrats making this argument, like Hickenlooper, Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg, have yet to declare their candidacies. But the Democrats showing up at town halls look much like the ones who powered the party's massive 2018 gains in the House \u2014 generally liberal, frustrated with Trump and fretful about \u201cdivisiveness,\u201d not wearing candidates down with policy demands.\n\nOver a week of town halls across Iowa and New Hampshire, with four different candidates, the concept of \u201chealing\u201d the country came up more frequently than Medicare-for-all, or even the Green New Deal that was making national news. Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, John Hickenlooper and John Delaney got the same sorts of questions, about how they could win, and how they could then deliver.\n\nIn-person campaign events are just one way of taking an electorate's temperature. But they are heady for candidates, who often come away with feedback that contradicts conventional assumptions about the primary. Former Maryland congressman John Delaney, the first Democrat to declare his candidacy, has been absent from many national conversations but has plugged away with small town halls where he argues that a centrist could actually be in the best position to deliver for all Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe need to be a party that basically appeals to the progressives in our party, who want change; we need to appeal to the moderates in our party, who are kind of solutions-oriented folks; and we ought to appeal to some of these disaffected Republicans,\u201d Delaney said Wednesday, at a town hall in Andover, N.H. \u201cIf we build a big tent, we will win, and we will big. And we'll be able to govern.\u201d\n\nMost of the Democrats who piled into the race after Delaney did so as populists, or with records of endorsing popular left-wing legislation. There are five senators in the race so far, and four have endorsed Medicare-for-all.\n\nThe Democrats still testing the waters don't have the same ties to the party's left and can be judicious about which policies they endorse. In the past week, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) has hinted that he might run, suggesting that the party could use another center-left voice; Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) delivered a foreign policy speech and confirmed that he might run; Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) warned that he was not hearing from the rest of the field the sort of message that could win. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who\u2019s seen as a figure from his party\u2019s left, has not signed onto Medicare-for-all legislation; it did not stop him from speaking to receptive crowds in New Hampshire.\n\nBoth the party and the bulk of its voters have moved markedly to the left since 2016, on issues including health care and the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cThe idea that the Democratic base is super far left is just wrong,\u201d said Lucas Meyer, the leader of New Hampshire Young Democrats, which has been holding receptions for any potential Democratic candidate who's willing to come. \u201cWe're really organized, so maybe that's what Howard Schultz is afraid of. But I don't hear many litmus tests.\u201d\n\nSchultz is the former Starbucks chief executive who\u2019s considering an independent presidential run. His media tour, which included a prime time CNN town hall this week, is predicated on the theory that only far-left candidates would be able to make it out of a Democratic primary and would then lose to Trump.\n\nSchultz\u2019s advisers have said that the data backs up his decision to explore a run, and Schultz himself points to \u201cextreme\u201d positions \u2014 he used the word six times on CNN \u2014 as proof that he\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats want to abolish ICE, more or less,\u201d Schultz said on CNN. \u201cI have nothing against the Democratic Party. I just don't feel represented.\u201d In fact, just one declared candidate (Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand) has called for abolishing ICE; others have called for restructuring it to deprioritize the deportation of undocumented immigrants and to focus on criminals.\n\nSchultz, whose rollout has been light on policy substance, has said that a left-leaning Democratic nominee would create a path for him; more quietly, he has suggested that if someone not seen as left-wing wins the nomination, he has no path. The \u201cbillionaire's veto,\u201d as some commentators have described it, could shape the incentives for Democrats even if Schultz does nothing.\n\nBut a bigger factor than that is the mood of Democratic voters, who are not making specific policy demands of candidates so far. At his stops in New Hampshire, Hickenlooper was asked not to take a firm stand on each plank of the Green New Deal; he was asked what he thought of the concept.\n\n\u201cWe definitely need some kind of New Deal, and it better be green,\u201d Hickenlooper said in an interview before his Manchester event. \u201cI think the key is really looking at the sequence in which you do things. What are the priorities? What's the maximum bang for the buck?\u201d Later, talking to a group of reporters, he said that he could probably support \"99 percent\u201d of what's in the Green New Deal resolution but wanted to start any green policy by limiting methane emissions.\n\nAsked whether he considered himself a progressive, Hickenlooper said he was; asked whether he was one of the more centrist candidates looking at the presidency, Hickenlooper said that might end up being how voters see it.\n\n\u201cI'll just quote Winston Churchill,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans will always do the right thing after they\u2019ve exhausted all the other possibilities.\u201d\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\nDo you support or oppose Trump using emergency powers to build a border wall (Washington Post/ABC News, 788 Adults)\n\nOppose \u2014 66%\n\nSupport \u2014 31%\n\nJust when the president seemed to be benefitting from squabbling inside the Democratic Party, he is taking a step that will unite it again: declaring an emergency as a way of moving money toward the construction of a border wall. This is, and always has been, a less popular idea than the border wall itself. Look for every Democrat running for president to denounce it.\n\nDo you have a generally favorable opinion of . . . (Fox News, 1,004 registered voters)\n\nCapitalism \u2014 57%\n\nMelania Trump \u2014 47%\n\nObamacare \u2014 47%\n\nThe Republican Party \u2014 45%\n\nThe Democratic Party \u2014 45%\n\nDonald Trump \u2014 43%\n\nMike Pence \u2014 42%\n\nNancy Pelosi \u2014 36%\n\nThe 2017 tax cut \u2014 34%\n\nSanctuary cities \u2014 33%\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 26%\n\nMitch McConnell \u2014 25%\n\nSocialism \u2014 25%\n\nHoward Schultz \u2014 12%\n\nThe upshot of this poll: People identified with the new wave of democratic socialism (Ocasio-Cortez) and with the old wave of centrism (Schultz) are opposed more than they're supported; the vast majority of voters still don't know Schultz. A separate question, however, finds voters split 47-47 on whether they would favor national health insurance.\n\nDEBATE SEASON\n\nThe DNC has begun to roll out rules for its debates, which begin in June and may end up being the most crowded in the history of presidential politics. The gist:\n\nThe first two debates will take place over two nights each. Democrats announced this previously, but it's official: A June debate anchored by NBC News and a July debate anchored by CNN will unfold over consecutive prime time evenings, as a way of including more candidates without shunting any into little-watched \u201cundercard\u201d debates.\n\nThe debates will be capped at 20 candidates. That might end up being higher than the number of declared candidates, especially once lesser-known Democrats such as Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson are counted. But that's the rule.\n\nCandidates polling above 1 percent in three polls will get a shot at the stage. Those polls can be in primary states or nationally. At the moment, there's not much difference between the front-runners in either sort of poll.\n\nCandidates lower in polls can make the stage if they have 65,000 individual donors, at least 200 each from 20 states. That's the most radical new rule; in the past, it could have kept multiple candidates, such as 2008 also-ran Mike Gravel, off the stage entirely, as he never hit the old polling threshold or the new donor threshold.\n\n2020\n\nBill Weld. The former Massachusetts governor and 2016 Libertarian Party vice-presidential nominee is delivering remarks tomorrow morning in New Hampshire; Republicans expect him to mount a primary challenge to President Trump.\n\nJohn Delaney. He's being endorsed by the Demcoratic chair of Lucas County, Iowa, the fourth county chair endorsement of his campaign so far. (Delaney is the only Democrat who has visited all 99 Iowa counties.)\n\nKamala Harris. She won the endorsement of Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who represents her birthplace of Oakland and is the first member of the House leadership team to weigh in. Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) was the first member of Congress to back Harris, but Lee is the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to weigh in \u2014 a big deal, as Cory Booker is also aggressively courting the CBC.\n\nEric Holder. The former attorney general told reporters in Des Moines that he will decide in March whether he's running for president.\n\nBill de Blasio. He has postponed a trip to New Hampshire, which was supposed to start tomorrow, after the shooting death of a police officer.\n\nMichael Bennet. The senator from Colorado keeps sitting for interviews about what a 2020 bid might look like and is looking at an Iowa trip next weekend.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand. She has reintroduced the Family Act, her paid-leave plan that, thanks to the Democratic House, may get its first markups and votes. (It differs from the plan pushed by Ivanka Trump and Republicans in that it would be paid for with a new, small payroll tax, not from diverted Social Security funds.)\n\nElizabeth Warren. She's heading to four states over the weekend, including two \u2014 California and Georgia \u2014 that vote shortly after the first four big primary states. (The trip includes her first stops as a candidate in Nevada and South Carolina, too.)\n\nBernie Sanders. He talked to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) to offer support during the days when she was being accused of anti-Semitism.\n\nEVERYBODY IS WRONG\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) listens during a news conference last week. (Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE)\n\nWhether they like it or not, the dominant story of the week for House Democrats was Sunday night tweets by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) about Israel's influence in American politics. On Monday, Omar and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) released statements saying that the freshman Democrat would work to combat anti-Semitism. On Wednesday, Republicans got every Democrat to vote to condemn anti-Semitism, putting the language in a historic resolution to cut off American support for Saudi military operations in Yemen.\n\nThe Yemen vote, which tees up another Senate vote to end the Yemen intervention, could have long-term political implications. But as Politico's Heather Caygle and Sarah Ferris report, the GOP's anti-Semitism language got a lot of the buzz; it's part of a mostly successful strategy to introduce \u201cmotions to recommit,\u201d getting a vote on Republican priorities even while Democrats run the House. Each of those motions have attracted a rump of Democratic support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember a few weeks ago when talking about a united House Democratic conference was all the rage,\u201d joked National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack, passing the Politico story on to reporters.\n\nThe anti-Semitism measure was actually watered down substantially; a previous version condemned both Rep. Rashida Tlaib (R-Mich.) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) by name and had no chance of passage. But Democrats can't deny that the Republican votes, even when they fail, are revealing divisions in their conference. The question is whether it matters \u2014 and who it helps.\n\nNone of these votes are materially disrupting the Democratic agenda. Instead, they're putting some swing-district Democrats, like Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), on record, repeatedly, against Pelosi. The speaker has not lost substantive Democratic support on must-pass bills; she has lost them on nonbinding language meant to embarrass Democrats.\n\nThat isn't to say that cracks in the party being repeatedly revealed is a plus for House Democrats. But when Republicans pointed out that the anti-Semitism language was the first successful legislative maneuver by the opposition party in a decade, they accidentally revealed something about the risks of party discipline.\n\nThe last Republican majorities denied oxygen to Democratic bills and resolutions and prevented breakaways such as the 2018 attempt to force an immigration reform vote that wasn't supported by GOP leadership. One result was the biggest Republican electoral defeat since 1974, with endangered Republicans unable to point to many substantial votes against their party.\n\nBut any analysis of how these votes will play in elections assumes that advertising and campaign rhetoric match up to reality. There's no guarantee of that; the first two attack ads launched at Democrats over the Green New Deal focused on two Democrats who did not, in fact, co-sponsor it.\n\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\n\nCONCORD, N.H. \u2014 The rules for choosing the next Democratic presidential nominee keep changing, though not as fast as reformers might like.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the campaign to radically change New Hampshire\u2019s primary with ranked-choice voting was throttled in a small committee room near the state capitol. A bill that would have introduced the system by early 2020 \u2014 allowing Democrats to rank their favorite candidates, with ballots added up until one candidate has a majority \u2014 was quickly debated and tabled.\n\nThat won\u2019t stop Democrats, who run both houses of the state\u2019s General Court, from introducing the bill later this year. But the reform\u2019s supporters acknowledged that they might not get another bite at the apple until this autumn, just a few months before the primary. And even then, they\u2019d need buy-in from some skeptics in their party.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely,\u201d said Ellen Delena Reed, a second-term state legislator and main sponsor of the legislation. \u201cTheoretically, we could attach it to a different bill, but it\u2019s hard to do that without the blessing of leadership.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the DNC meeting unfolding in the District this week, the leaders of state parties are submitting their delegate selection plans for 2020. The next big changes on that are really up to state legislatures, and the march of states from caucuses to primaries is continuing at a steady pace. Washington, which has been under total Democratic control since early 2017, is on pace to bind its delegates to a primary, not a caucus.\n\nIt would be the single largest transfer of delegates from the latter system \u2014 which usually helps grass-roots candidates \u2014 to the former. And it would move the primary to March 10, one week after the first Super Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThat would make Washington state more interesting \u2014 let\u2019s say that,\u201d said Tina Podolowski, the state party chair.\n\nFor years, Washington has held both a caucus, paid for by the state party, and a later, nonbinding primary, concurrent with state primary elections. In the 2016 caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won 72.7 percent of the vote, giving him one of his biggest pledge delegate margins over Hillary Clinton. Months later, Clinton won 52.4 percent of the vote in the nonbinding primary, which neither candidate campaigned to win.\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nThe Young Turks, the left-leaning online news channel that has built a serious following with Democratic voters, is launching a new interview and debate series designed to put every presidential candidate, and many legislative candidates, on record on issues that they don\u2019t see other media asking.\n\nThe guests won\u2019t be limited to potential presidents \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will be one of the first guests, but so will Adam McKay, the director of \u201cVice\u201d and \u201cThe Big Short.\u201d Nonetheless, the long-term plan of Cenk Uygur, the founder of the TYT network and host of its flagship show, is to carry out \u201cthe most substantive conversations on the planet\u201d with candidates.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the media has an establishment perspective, and we have a progressive perspective,\u201d Uygur said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s very important, in a Democratic primary, that there be a conversation centered around that. I\u2019m going to ask different questions than Jake Tapper is. He\u2019s going to ask questions skeptical of Medicare-for-all; I\u2019m going to ask questions skeptical of the current system. That\u2019s already a massive difference.\u201d (In a town hall with Kamala Harris, Tapper asked if \"Medicare for All\" would eliminate private insurance; Harris implied that it would, partially reversing that position one day later.)\n\nUygur, a former MSNBC host who said that the CNN town hall format was better than much of cable news, suggested that the big networks nonetheless deferred to voters to ask many policy questions. The TYT series would keep the microphone in the host\u2019s hand; part of the point would be seeing who is and isn\u2019t rattled by that.\n\nTYT, which has hosted Democrats including Joe Manchin and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has nearly 4.3 million YouTube subscribers and a committed audience that sees its hosts as more credible than cable news reporters.\n\nIn Washington, where TYT has beefed up its presence since 2016, the network is known for strongly favorable coverage of Sanders. It has been a media partner for the senator from Vermont 's national town hall meetings; in 2016, Uygur repeatedly appeared on the campaign trail at Sanders rallies. But any candidate willing to appear in 2019, he said, would get a fair hearing.\n\n\u201cWe did not pick Bernie last time because he was anybody\u2019s uncle,\u201d Uygur said. \u201cThat primary was the most binary choice that anybody\u2019s ever had, between the establishment and a progressive. And now, there are lots of choices. If you think you can make a better progressive case than Bernie Sanders, then you should come on tomorrow. I\u2019d argue that Hillary Clinton made a giant mistake by not coming on TYT and telling a progressive audience why they should come out and vote. That made all the difference in the world.\u201d\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\"Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign decision: Quietly agonizing as months go by,\u201d by Matt Viser and Michael Scherer\n\nThe Biden guessing game is, as the man might say, no joke \u2014 the reason some confidants have been wrong about his start date is that he really does keep studying the field and changing his mind.\n\n\u201cOn El Paso\u2019s Shelter Place, an American divide over immigrants and immigration,\u201d by Jenna Johnson\n\nThe city most affected by debates over border security looks nothing like the fortress that border security hawks imagine for the country.\n\n\u201cThe Ocasio-Cortez Effect: Wave of Challenges Hits Entrenched N.Y.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told TMZ on Thursday that she would have no issue with a president of the United States who recreationally smokes marijuana, arguing that \u201cthere\u2019s really no difference\u201d between THC and alcohol.\n\n\u201cWe need to accept that there is nothing more inherently damaging about marijuana than say legal substances, like alcohol or anything else,\u201d she told the outlet, while walking through the Capitol. \u201cSo, I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re moving towards a more just position as a party and that we\u2019re moving to legalize marijuana but not just legalize marijuana but to really make up for the damages done by the war on drugs and the people who were unjustly incarcerated by the war on drugs.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by the reporter if she would \u201cbe OK to have a president who say that they do smoke,\u201d the Democratic socialist lawmaker said, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me. You\u2019re not hurting anybody, you know,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are plenty of people who drink. They\u2019ll go out to happy hour, they\u2019ll go out, have one, two, three [drinks]. How is that different?\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez has frequently pushed for marijuana legalization, even getting support from a Republican House colleague for tweeting, \u201c#LegalizeIt, and demand justice for communities ravaged by the War on Drugs.\u201d\n\nWatch above, via TMZ.\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Over a quarter of federal workers tapped into their retirement savings during the 35-day partial government shutdown, according to a survey of federal employees, contracts and their spouses released Tuesday by Prudential Financial.\n\nAbout 26 percent of respondents said they used funds for their retirements to pay bills or manage other expenses during the shutdown, during which about 800,000 federal workers were furloughed or required to work without pay.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStories of struggling federal employees flooded the media during the shutdown, highlighting just how many people working for the government were living paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\nMembers of Congress rushed to propose cutting off congressional salaries during shutdowns and either asked for their pay to be forfeited or vowed to donate their income during the closure.\n\nAbout 49 percent of federal workers said they fell behind paying bills, with 27 percent missing a mortgage or rent payment, 13 percent missing a student loan payment and 10 percent falling behind on tuition payments.\n\n\u201cSome federal workers may find that missing these payments has compromised their credit score, for example, which could make it harder to secure financing for a big purchase like a house or car, or simply make the cost of borrowing to do so higher. In turn, that could make it harder to save for long-term goals like retirement or manage other day-to-day expenses,\u201d the surveys authors wrote.\n\nTo help cover the costs of the shutdown, 42 percent of federal workers took on new debts. About 40 percent borrowed money from friends or family, 20 percent borrowed from a bank or credit union and 10 percent borrowed from an alternative lender. About 25 percent went to a food bank during the shutdown.\n\nThe hardships were reported even though federal employees, on average, are better prepared for financial hardships than the general population.\n\nSixty-one percent of the federal workers surveyed reported they entered the shutdown with $1,000 or more in emergency savings, while only 46 percent of the population at large can say the same. Only 11 percent of federal workers said they had no emergency savings ahead of the shutdown, versus 40 percent of the general population.\n\nIn spite of their higher financial security, 62 percent of federal workers said they depleted all or most of their emergency savings, with only 8 percent saying they didn\u2019t tap into their savings at all.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the government shutdown on federal workers and their families serves as a stark reminder that many Americans are ill-prepared to navigate even a brief disruption in their income,\u201d the survey's authors concluded.\n\nThe authors added that while many respondents said they intend to rethink their savings plan after the shutdown, employers also have \u201cample self-interest\u201d in providing aid in times of hardship.\n\nThe Prudential Financial survey polled 352 furloughed or unpaid federal workers or contractors and spouses from Jan. 29-31 and has a margin of error of +/- 5 percent."

    "authors": [
      "Feb"
    ],
    "text": "The CNN town hall from former Starbucks CEO and potential 2020 candidate Howard Schultz on Tuesday was revelatory: It showed he has no agenda beyond blaming the \u201cextreme left\u201d and \u201cextreme right.\u201d Asked repeatedly to explain his policies for fixing America\u2019s biggest problems, Schultz proved himself entirely incapable of proposing new ideas or specific solutions.\n\nHis policy answers were exercises in vacuity, less showcases for a potential president and more giant televised sucking sounds.\n\nOne audience member asked Schultz what he would do to fix the health care system. His response: \u201cThis gives me another opportunity to talk about the extreme left and the extreme right.\u201d CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow asked him for specifics two more times, to explain what exactly he would do to overhaul American health care. Schultz had no plan.\n\nA Houston resident, citing his city\u2019s damage from Hurricane Harvey, asked Schultz what his plans would be to address climate change. Schultz responded by bashing the Green New Deal and complaining about the federal debt.\n\nA third audience member asked Schultz, a billionaire, how he felt about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposed 70 percent marginal tax rate on top earners and what his alternative would be. Schultz called AOC\u2019s proposal \u201cpunitive\u201d but admitted he personally should pay more in taxes. Then he refused to say how much: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the number should be.\u201d\n\nAnd when asked about a high-profile incident of racial profiling at a Starbucks, Schultz responded with a line straight out of a Stephen Colbert skit: \u201cI didn\u2019t see color as a young boy and I honestly don\u2019t see color now.\u201d\n\nSo it went, on topics ranging from veterans to gun control. Schultz\u2019s inability to speak about policy or ideas in any level of detail led political scientist Seth Masket to dub him \u201cthe Trump of the center.\u201d\n\nThe event demonstrated that Schultz\u2019s candidacy is premised on a lie (or, more precisely, a series of falsehoods): He apparently believes a secret majority of Americans are yearning for a centrist candidate to save them from the two parties. But that majority doesn\u2019t exist. What Schultz calls \u201ccentrism\u201d is a vague repackaging of what centrist Democrats have been proposing for years, a vacuous ideology that makes sense to a small subset of elites but has no mass constituency.\n\nMany of Schultz\u2019s answers were terrible in part because he, personally, is clearly unprepared to be president. But it\u2019s also because the set of ideas he claims to represent, a sort of generalized \u201ccentrism\u201d untethered to either party, does not exist outside of an echo chamber made up of a small number of America\u2019s wealthy, educated elite.\n\nThe false promise of elite \u201ccentrism\u201d\n\nThe credo of elite centrism, inasmuch as it exists, is the slogan \u201csocially liberal, fiscally conservative.\u201d It\u2019s a kind of light libertarianism, unconcerned by same-sex marriage but deeply worried about the federal debt.\n\nVery few Americans actually subscribe to this belief structure. Check out this chart, from a 2017 Democracy Fund survey, that plots Americans on a quadrant system. The further to the right, the more economically conservative you are; the further down, the more socially liberal. The bottom right is the elite \u201csocial liberal, fiscal conservative\u201d quadrant \u2014 potential Schultz voters. There are basically none of them:\n\n\u201cCentrist\u201d ideas are the province of the educated, wealthy elite. Perhaps the single best predictor of social liberalism in America, aside from Democratic Party membership, is education: The more educated you are, the more likely you are to be open to things like same-sex marriage and immigration. At the same time, America\u2019s elites are wealthy, and thus more likely to be leery of significant tax hikes that would hurt their bottom line.\n\nBecause elites tend to socialize with other elites, they can talk themselves into thinking that their ideas seem like common sense \u2014 and even that people like Howard Schultz can run for president on an independent ticket and win.\n\nBut these ideas have little in common with most of the electorate, and the town hall demonstrated the delusion at the root of this belief. When asked to explain which centrist ideas can solve the problems that really preoccupy Americans, Schultz had next to nothing.\n\nSchultz is considering a run as an ideological entrepreneur, an independent who would bring a new set of ideas into American politics. That would be really hard even if he had a new set of ideas to offer: There are deep structural reasons for the party duopoly, with both the setup of America\u2019s electoral system and powerful interest groups supporting the status quo. Political polarization has sorted most Americans into one of the two political parties, with the number of true independents vanishingly small. It would be very, very difficult to dislodge this system even if you had popular ideas to offer.\n\nTrump succeeded as a billionaire politician because he found a seam in the Republican coalition \u2014 the party\u2019s primary voters were crying out for a more nakedly racial politics \u2014 and exploited it. But he didn\u2019t run as an independent: After winning the primary, he enjoyed the backing of a major party, and won primarily thanks to support from Republican partisans.\n\nSchultz, in this respect, compares unfavorably to the president. He has none of Trump\u2019s dark charisma and none of his political instincts for what\u2019s popular. He has a set of ideas that seem obvious to him and a small number of people like him but have no grounding in an American intellectual tradition or mass politics. The result is an embarrassing night on national television \u2014 one that should cause Schultz to rethink what he\u2019s doing."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "As a child in the Congo-Brazzaville, Therese Patricia Okoumou loved climbing things, particularly houses. No one else, not even her brothers, joined her in these escapades; feats that decades later came in handy as she scaled New York City\u2019s revered Statue of Liberty on July 4, 2018, in protest of President Donald Trump\u2019s zero-tolerance immigration policy.\n\nBy doing this, Okoumou became the first woman in history to successfully climb Lady Liberty\u2019s pedestal but she could spend up to 18 months behind bars for doing so.\n\nLast December, a federal district court in Manhattan found Okoumou guilty of three misdemeanors: disorderly conduct, trespassing, and interfering with government agency functions. Each charge carries a sentence of up to six months in prison. Ruling in The United States of America v. Therese Okoumou, Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein asserted that Okoumou\u2019s political motivations did not override the law.\n\nThe prospect of jail time, however, hasn\u2019t curbed her activism.\n\nLast month, Okoumou, 45, testified at City Hall on behalf of the Campaign for an Elected Civilian Review Board to better scrutinize the New York Police Department. More recently, she launched a Valentine Day\u2019s card campaign that offers postcards to people to sign and show solidarity with migrant families at the border. On Feb. 14, she and other activists will travel to El Paso, Texas, to deliver the cards.\n\n\u201cFamily separation is hard on children,\u201d Okoumou says of the zero-tolerance policy. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that children don\u2019t have a sense of time, especially young ones. And when the Trump administration rips these children, some of them from nursing mothers, the damage they\u2019re inflicting is long-term psychological damage.\u201d\n\nHer activism, she says, is driven less by her journey to America and more by humanistic principles. \u201cI\u2019m fighting not because I\u2019m an immigrant, but because I\u2019m Patricia Okoumou. It\u2019s immoral to put children in cages,\u201d she said.\n\nReuters/Jeenah Moon Therese Patricia Okoumou makes a speech during the \u201cNo One is Above the Law\u201d protest in New York City, Nov. 8, 2018.\n\nWhile her immigrant experience might not be the driving force for her work, it is still one that many immigrants across the U.S. can relate to. Growing up in Congo-Brazzaville, Okoumou was enamored by America. It was the music and Hollywood, all the\u2014as she has described it\u2014\u201cfalse advertisement\u201d that reeled her in like most immigrants. She remembers enjoying Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston, and had posters of MC Hammer.\n\n\u201cI really visualized America to be the land of the free and the home of the brave,\u201d she said. \u201cI had that false notion of diversity and inclusiveness.\u201d\n\nOkoumou left the Republic of the Congo in 1994 on a temporary visa, and became \u201cundocumented\u201d when it expired. In 2010, she received a green card under the U-1 nonimmigrant status and was naturalized as a citizen in 2016.\n\nIn the pre-Trump years, she lived a quiet, apolitical life as a personal fitness trainer. But since Trump\u2019s presidential win in November 2016, Okoumou has taken to the streets in protest, often alone. One of her solo demonstrations was documented by The Young Turks\u2019s host, Cenk Uygur, outside the Trump Tower in Manhattan. By April 2017, she had joined the New York-based activist group, Rise and Resist.\n\n\u201cI love being independent and having my own mind,\u201d Okoumou said, sporting her signature cobalt-green dress emblazoned with the words: \u201cSeeking Asylum is NOT a Crime.\u201d It was that free-spiritedness that spurred her to clutch the hem of the \u201cMother of Exiles\u201d on America\u2019s 242nd birthday.\n\nEarlier that day, she had participated in a protest with Rise and Resist at the Statue of Liberty. At the stone pedestal of the monument, ten RAR members unfurled a banner saying, \u201cAbolish ICE.\u201d While NYPD officers were arresting some of the protesters, Okoumou slipped away and scaled more than 20 feet of the statue\u2019s base, reaching the top of the pedestal. She was rescued after a three-hour standoff with law enforcement.\n\nScreenshot/ABC video Patricia Okounou being arrested by police rescuers on the Statue of Liberty\n\nSince the stunt, Okoumou has received widespread coverage from the media. Elle magazine recognized the act as \u201cone of the most powerful events for women in 2018\u201d; she was featured in a photo shoot with Teen Vogue, and even immortalized in street art.\n\nAccording to one of Okoumou\u2019s attorneys, Ron Kuby, Okoumou\u2019s protest hearkens back to an earlier generation of people who engaged in civil disobedience where their actions had the potential to have real consequences, like the civil rights marches or the anti-war protests.\n\n\u201cToday, in New York City, protests are often a more elaborate form of choreography,\u201d Kuby said, \u201cwhere everybody knows their role; everybody knows their part, everybody plays their part and there aren\u2019t any real consequences. But Patricia goes back to a much earlier tradition of protest.\u201d\n\nOkoumou\u2019s protest was also reminiscent of a similar event in November 2000 by Puerto Rican activist, Tito Kayak, who, along with five other protesters, draped the Puerto Rican flag from the Statue of Liberty\u2019s crown.\n\n\u201cThe feds didn\u2019t prosecute, they just referred [Kayak] to the state court for prosecution for disorderly conduct and he was found not guilty of that,\u201d Kuby said. \u201cThey could have done that [in Patricia\u2019s case], but they chose not to. That was a decision made by the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nLast summer, an executive order overturned the policy of separating children from their parents upon crossing the border unlawfully, but the Trump administration quietly continues to do so, including instances where children are placed in temporary foster care and shelters with little or no indication that they arrived at the border with their parents.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to determine if Okoumou\u2019s feat made an impact, but \u201cthe action itself received a tremendous amount of attention,\u201d Kuby said. \u201cWhile people may not know her name, they remember the protest.\u201d\n\nOkoumou pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charges. She will be sentenced on Mar. 5.\n\nSign up to the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here for news and analysis on African business, tech and innovation in your inbox"

One immediate way of doing that is through drastic wealth redistribution and that starts with banning billionaires. Part of the point of having a society, of having government is to \"promote the general welfare.\" Welfare -- it's literally right there in the preamble in the Constitution.\n\n\n\nYet for some reason, we've been propagandized into believing that the purpose of the government is to clear the path for individuals to acquire and hoard ungodly amounts of wealth, regardless of the consequences to the rest of us or the health of the society as a whole. And now people all around the world are waking up. They are coming to the realization that this is no way to run a society and perhaps that's why 'billionaire' is becoming a bad word.\n\n\n\nLook, this may scare you. But a more equitable distribution of wealth is coming, whether it is by policy or by pitchforks. So it's up to you guys. Which one is it going to be?\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "title": "No thank you, Mr. Pecker",
    "authors": [
      "Jeff Bezos"
    ],
    "text": "No thank you, Mr. Pecker\n\nSomething unusual happened to me yesterday. Actually, for me it wasn\u2019t just unusual \u2014 it was a first. I was made an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse. Or at least that\u2019s what the top people at the National Enquirer thought. I\u2019m glad they thought that, because it emboldened them to put it all in writing. Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I\u2019ve decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\n\nAMI, the owner of the National Enquirer, led by David Pecker, recently entered into an immunity deal with the Department of Justice related to their role in the so-called \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d process on behalf of President Trump and his election campaign. Mr. Pecker and his company have also been investigated for various actions they\u2019ve taken on behalf of the Saudi Government.\n\nAnd sometimes Mr. Pecker mixes it all together:\n\n\u201cAfter Mr. Trump became president, he rewarded Mr. Pecker\u2019s loyalty with a White House dinner to which the media executive brought a guest with important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia. At the time, Mr. Pecker was pursuing business there while also hunting for financing for acquisitions\u2026\u201d\n\nFederal investigators and legitimate media have of course suspected and proved that Mr. Pecker has used the Enquirer and AMI for political reasons. And yet AMI keeps claiming otherwise:\n\n\u201cAmerican Media emphatically rejects any assertion that its reporting was instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise.\u201d\n\nOf course, legitimate media have been challenging that assertion for a long time:\n\nMystery Grows Over Pro-Saudi Tabloid: Embassy Got Sneak Peek\n\nI didn\u2019t know much about most of that a few weeks ago when intimate texts messages from me were published in the National Enquirer. I engaged investigators to learn how those texts were obtained, and to determine the motives for the many unusual actions taken by the Enquirer. As it turns out, there are now several independent investigations looking into this matter.\n\nTo lead my investigation, I retained Gavin de Becker. I\u2019ve known Mr. de Becker for twenty years, his expertise in this arena is excellent, and he\u2019s one of the smartest and most capable leaders I know. I asked him to prioritize protecting my time since I have other things I prefer to work on and to proceed with whatever budget he needed to pursue the facts in this matter.\n\nHere\u2019s a piece of context: My ownership of the Washington Post is a complexifier for me. It\u2019s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy.\n\nPresident Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets. Also, The Post\u2019s essential and unrelenting coverage of the murder of its columnist Jamal Khashoggi is undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles.\n\n(Even though The Post is a complexifier for me, I do not at all regret my investment. The Post is a critical institution with a critical mission. My stewardship of The Post and my support of its mission, which will remain unswerving, is something I will be most proud of when I\u2019m 90 and reviewing my life, if I\u2019m lucky enough to live that long, regardless of any complexities it creates for me.)\n\nBack to the story: Several days ago, an AMI leader advised us that Mr. Pecker is \u201capoplectic\u201d about our investigation. For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve.\n\nA few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker\u2019s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer. They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn\u2019t stop our investigation.\n\nMy lawyers argued that AMI has no right to publish photos since any person holds the copyright to their own photos, and since the photos in themselves don\u2019t add anything newsworthy.\n\nAMI\u2019s claim of newsworthiness is that the photos are necessary to show Amazon shareholders that my business judgment is terrible. I founded Amazon in my garage 24 years ago, and drove all the packages to the post office myself. Today, Amazon employs more than 600,000 people, just finished its most profitable year ever, even while investing heavily in new initiatives, and it\u2019s usually somewhere between the #1 and #5 most valuable company in the world. I will let those results speak for themselves.\n\nOK, back to their threat to publish intimate photos of me. I guess we (me, my lawyers, and Gavin de Becker) didn\u2019t react to the generalized threat with enough fear, so they sent this:\n\nFrom: Howard, Dylan [dhoward@amilink.com] (Chief Content Officer, AMI)\n\nSent: Tuesday, February 5, 2019 3:33 PM\n\nTo: Martin Singer (litigation counsel for Mr. de Becker)\n\nSubject:. Jeff Bezos & Ms. Lauren Sanchez Photos\n\nCONFIDENTIAL & NOT FOR DISTRIBIUTION\n\nMarty:\n\nI am leaving the office for the night. I will be available on my cell \u2014 917 XXX-XXXX.\n\nHowever, in the interests of expediating this situation, and with The Washington Post poised to publish unsubstantiated rumors of The National Enquirer\u2019s initial report, I wanted to describe to you the photos obtained during our newsgathering.\n\nIn addition to the \u201cbelow the belt selfie \u2014 otherwise colloquially known as a \u2018d*ck pick\u2019\u201d \u2014 The Enquirer obtained a further nine images. These include:\n\n\u00b7 Mr. Bezos face selfie at what appears to be a business meeting.\n\n\u00b7 Ms. Sanchez response \u2014 a photograph of her smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene.\n\n\u00b7 A shirtless Mr. Bezos holding his phone in his left hand \u2014 while wearing his wedding ring. He\u2019s wearing either tight black cargo pants or shorts \u2014 and his semi-erect manhood is penetrating the zipper of said garment.\n\n\u00b7 A full-length body selfie of Mr. Bezos wearing just a pair of tight black boxer-briefs or trunks, with his phone in his left hand \u2014 while wearing his wedding ring.\n\n\u00b7 A selfie of Mr. Bezos fully clothed.\n\n\u00b7 A full-length scantily-clad body shot with short trunks.\n\n\u00b7 A naked selfie in a bathroom \u2014 while wearing his wedding ring. Mr. Bezos is wearing nothing but a white towel \u2014 and the top of his pubic region can be seen.\n\n\u00b7 Ms. Sanchez wearing a plunging red neckline dress revealing her cleavage and a glimpse of her nether region.\n\n\u00b7 Ms. Sanchez wearing a two-piece red bikini with gold detail dress revealing her cleavage.\n\nIt would give no editor pleasure to send this email. I hope common sense can prevail \u2014 and quickly.\n\nDylan.\n\nWell, that got my attention. But not in the way they likely hoped. Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because there\u2019s a much more important matter involved here. If in my position I can\u2019t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can? (On that point, numerous people have contacted our investigation team about their similar experiences with AMI, and how they needed to capitulate because, for example, their livelihoods were at stake.)\n\nIn the AMI letters I\u2019m making public, you will see the precise details of their extortionate proposal: They will publish the personal photos unless Gavin de Becker and I make the specific false public statement to the press that we \u201chave no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI\u2019s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.\u201d\n\nIf we do not agree to affirmatively publicize that specific lie, they say they\u2019ll publish the photos, and quickly. And there\u2019s an associated threat: They\u2019ll keep the photos on hand and publish them in the future if we ever deviate from that lie.\n\nBe assured, no real journalists ever propose anything like what is happening here: I will not report embarrassing information about you if you do X for me. And if you don\u2019t do X quickly, I will report the embarrassing information.\n\nNothing I might write here could tell the National Enquirer story as eloquently as their own words below.\n\nThese communications cement AMI\u2019s long-earned reputation for weaponizing journalistic privileges, hiding behind important protections, and ignoring the tenets and purpose of true journalism. Of course I don\u2019t want personal photos published, but I also won\u2019t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJeff Bezos\n\nFrom: Fine, Jon [jfine@amilink.com] (Deputy General Counsel, AMI)\n\nSent: Wednesday, February 6, 2019 5:57 PM\n\nTo: Martin Singer (Mr de Becker\u2019s attorney)\n\nSubject: Re: EXTERNAL* RE: Bezos et al / American Media et al\n\nMarty -\n\nHere are our proposed terms:\n\n1.

Singer\n\nLaveley & Singer\n\nRe: Jeff Bezos / American Media, LLC, et al.\n\nDear Mr. Singer:\n\nI write in response to your February 4, 2019, letter to Dylan Howard, and to address serious concerns we have regarding the continuing defamatory activities of your client and his representatives regarding American Media\u2019s motivations in its recent reporting about your client.\n\nAs a primary matter, please be advised that our newsgathering and reporting on matters involving your client, including any use of your client\u2019s \u201cprivate photographs,\u201d has been, and will continue to be, consistent with applicable laws. As you know, \u201cthe fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies . . . for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting . . . is not an infringement of copyright.\u201d 17 USC Sec. 107. With millions of Americans having a vested interest in the success of Amazon, of which your client remains founder, chairman, CEO, and president, an exploration of Mr. Bezos\u2019 judgment as reflected by his texts and photos is indeed newsworthy and in the public interest.\n\nBeyond the copyright issues you raise, we also find it necessary to address various unsubstantiated defamatory statements and scurrilous rumors attributed to your client\u2019s representatives in the press suggesting that \u201cstrong leads point to political motives\u201d1 in the publication of The National Enquirer story. Indeed, you yourself declared the \u201cpolitically motivated underpinnings\u201d of our reporting to be \u201cself-evident\u201d in your correspondence on Mr. de Becker\u2019s behalf to Mr. Howard dated January 31, 2019.\n\nOnce again, as I advised you in my February 1 response to your January 31 correspondence, American Media emphatically rejects any assertion that its reporting was instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise. Simply put, this was and is a news story.\n\nYet, it is our understanding that your client\u2019s representatives, including the Washington Post, continue to pursue and to disseminate these false and spurious allegations in a manner that is injurious to American Media and its executives.\n\nAccordingly, we hereby demand that you cease and desist such defamatory conduct immediately. Any further dissemination of these false, vicious, speculative and unsubstantiated statements is done at your client\u2019s peril. Absent the immediate cessation of the defamatory conduct, we will have no choice but to pursue all remedies available under applicable law.\n\nAs I advised previously, we stand by the legality of our newsgathering and reporting on this matter of public interest and concern. Moreover, American Media is undeterred from continuing its reporting on a story that is unambiguously in the public interest \u2014 a position Mr. Bezos clearly appreciates as reflected in Boies Schiller January 9 letter to American Media stating that your client \u201cdoes not intend to discourage reporting about him\u201d and \u201csupports journalistic efforts.\u201d\n\nThat said, if your client agrees to cease and desist such defamatory behavior, we are willing to engage in constructive conversations regarding the texts and photos which we have in our possession. Dylan Howard stands ready to discuss the matter at your convenience.\n\nAll other rights, claims, counterclaims and defenses are specifically reserved and not waived.\n\nSincerely,\n\n1 https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-investigators-question-the-brother-of-his-mistress-lauren-sanchez-in-national-enquirer-leak-probe(Attributed to your client Gavin de Becker)"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "In the early 2000s, Frederick Uku found himself in D.C. on an expired student visa with no degree. He calls the decade he was undocumented in the U.S. the \u201cDark Years,\u201d and points to one of his most desperate attempts to support himself financially\u2014donating his bone marrow for $250. Uku had the procedure done in Rockville. \u201cI was sitting in a wheelchair in the most excruciating pain until I could walk to the bus and the Metro,\u201d he says. \u201cI did that all by myself.\u201d\n\nHe likens the \u201cDark Years\u201d to the experience of the protagonist in Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The story chronicles the life of a Nigerian woman named Ifemelu who immigrated to the U.S. to go to college.\n\n\u201cI cried when I read that book because I remember some of the demeaning, soul-crushing shit I had to do to survive,\u201d Uku says. \u201cThe thing that kept me going was knowing if I quit and went home that\u2019s ball game. I would go home with nothing to show for it\u2014just a broken kid moving home to be with his parents.\u201d\n\nUku currently works at The Red Hen in Bloomingdale. On most nights, the stools that crowd the bar he mans are taken by 5:30 p.m. He\u2019s the gregarious, hospitable bartender everyone\u2019s there to see. And now he has an immigrant story of hardship and resilience that culminates in triumph: Uku became a naturalized U.S. citizen on Dec. 11, 2018.\n\nLike Ifemelu in Americanah, Uku came to the U.S. in 1998 to attend Howard University. The Lagos, Nigeria, native was only 16. While most Americans are attempting to grasp precalculus at that age, Uku was ready to enroll in college. \u201cNigerians are chronic over-achievers,\u201d he explains.\n\nUku so yearned to come to the U.S. that he didn\u2019t sit for the Nigerian national college entrance exam. Instead, he struck a deal with his parents. They would pay for his first year of tuition at Howard, but after that it was on Uku to land a full scholarship. \u201cA younger version of myself and a younger version of my parents thought that sending a 16-year-old to a foreign country to start university with no real financial of familial support was a good idea. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAfter his first year, Uku says, he successfully landed a scholarship to continue pursuing a degree in electrical engineering, but that scholarship wasn\u2019t active long. Uku says he was among a group of international students who lost their financial aid. He believes the program was in danger of losing its accreditation and needed to make cuts. (A Howard University representative tells City Paper that they cannot confirm any details related to student scholarships due to Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act guidelines.)\n\nAt this point Uku was a junior and needed to pay his way to graduation. But when you\u2019re a student on an F-1 Visa, there are rules governing where you can work. Off-campus employment was off limits, and he was only allowed to work certain on-campus gigs that paid as little as $9 an hour.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough hours in the week to pay tuition,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I tried anyway. I did that for as long as I could stand it.\u201d He needed help, but his parents were thousands of miles away and had fulfilled their financial obligation. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that would break anyone \u2026 It definitely broke me.\u201d\n\nHopelessness and loneliness begot depression and even a suicide attempt. Uku did not finish school. His F-1 Visa expired on Dec. 31, 2003. The date is as permanent in Uku\u2019s mind as a tattoo would be on his body.\n\nThose who remain in the U.S. on expired visas are known as \u201coverstays,\u201d and are considered \u201cout of status.\u201d Consequences of being discovered in the early 2000s included forced departure from the U.S. and barred reentry for three years.\n\nWhen overstays seek employment, they become vulnerable, as many businesses utilize E-Verify. The website operated by the Department of Homeland Security tells employers whether an applicant is eligible for employment based on immigration status, positioning them to avoid penalties for hiring unauthorized workers.\n\n\u201cYou have three choices,\u201d Uku says. \u201cYou find a way to get back into school. You go back to whatever country you\u2019re from. Or you go underground. I chose door number three.\u201d He gambled on the riskiest path because \u201cjob prospects for college dropouts in Nigeria aren\u2019t the best \u2026 If I stayed here, I\u2019d at least have a fighting chance at something.\u201d\n\nUku worked where he could. He tried to become a taxi driver; manned the door at night clubs; participated in paid clinical trials; and managed the books for a financial planner in Landover. He slept on friends\u2019 couches at first, but eventually found a room in a group house on Capitol Hill. Uku lived with two men, both of whom are now deceased.\n\nWhile one roommate, Chris Babor, was still alive, he introduced Uku to the industry that would save him. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Let me teach you, train you on how to wait tables. It\u2019s a much better way of earning money and if you find the right restaurant, the owner will look the other way.\u2019\u201d The pair worked at La Brasserie on Capitol Hill. \u201cChris gave me a skill set that I\u2019ve now traded off of for 15 years.\u201d\n\nLa Brasserie closed in 2005. Uku\u2019s next big break was at Left Bank in Adams Morgan, which is also closed. \u201cThat\u2019s where I figured out that I\u2019m good at this,\u201d he says. \u201cMy strength is talking to people and figuring out some small way to make their day much better. If someone comes in and sits at your table or your bar, for a split second you get to parachute into their world.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes [bartending] personable and really tries to connect with his customers,\u201d says Peyton Sherwood, who co-owns The Midlands Beer Garden and first met Uku in 2004. The men are close friends.\n\nThe hospitality industry started as a means to an end for Uku, but became his calling. \u201cI love this business,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I needed it the most, when I needed to survive, this industry and only this industry gave me an opportunity to have a life.\u201d\n\nBut while Uku was at Left Bank finding his professional footing, he faced another setback. In October 2004, Uku\u2019s father visited him in D.C. \u201cI knew the first time I saw him, I knew he was sick,\u201d Uku says. They spent time together and then on an emotional bus ride to the airport, it became obvious Uku\u2019s father intended the visit to be a farewell. \u201cHe said things on that bus ride that he never said before\u2014telling me how he met my mom,\u201d Uku says. He escorted his father to the escalator leading to departures. \u201cI thought he\u2019d turn around and wave, but he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nUku was between a double shift at Left Bank on Dec. 4, 2004 when he got the call that his father had died. \u201cI was the only member of my family who wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you go rogue there are certain things you can\u2019t do. You can\u2019t leave the country and come back, so I missed my father\u2019s funeral. My sister got married and I couldn\u2019t go to her wedding. I missed my kid brother\u2019s entire adolescence. I couldn\u2019t vote for Barack Obama the first or second time.\u201d\n\nUku remained \u201cOut of Status\u201d from 2003 to 2013. \u201cThat\u2019s 10 years of being scared. Of living in the shadows,\u201d he says. \u201cAny undocumented person in this industry will tell you that you learn to live very carefully.\u201d\n\nBecause Uku married in 2012, he was eligible to apply for a temporary green card that lasts two years, followed by a permanent green card, which is valid for 10 years. Even though Uku and his wife divorced, his permanent resident status positioned him to apply for citizenship.\n\n\u201cMy time to apply for naturalization coincided with Donald Trump being elected,\u201d Uku recalls. \u201cMy immigration lawyer called me and said, \u2018Apply for your citizenship right now.\u2019 He predicted that the number of people applying for naturalization was going to skyrocket, which it did.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported a sharp spike in the number of permanent residents applying for naturalization in August 2018, noting a resulting \u201cgrowing backlog of citizenship applications at a time when Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown has made even permanent residents feel like they may be at risk.\u201d According to U.S. Customs and Immigration Services, as of March 2018 there were 20,485 pending applications in Maryland, 16,564 in D.C., and 4,762 in Virginia.\n\nUku completed the application process, which involved paperwork, fingerprinting, an exam, and an interview. USCIS publishes about 100 questions in advance for applicants to study. \u201cSome of them are harder than others,\u201d he says. When his examiner asked, \u201cWho writes the laws in this country?\u201d Uku says it \u201ctook every fiber in me not to answer, \u2018Lobbyists on K Street.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe passed the exam and was assigned a ceremony date of Dec. 11, 2018. Uku was among more than 100 people who became citizens that day at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. He hedges that the U.S. currently has its challenges, but calls his new country the only place where his story is possible. \u201cThat\u2019s what naturalization means to me,\u201d he says.\n\nSeveral friends were in the courtroom, including Sherwood and Uku\u2019s partner Andrea Tateosian, who heads the DC Craft Bartenders Guild. \u201cIt was great seeing him stand up and have his name called out,\u201d Sherwood recalls. \u201cI\u2019ve watched him go through trial and tribulation with this country. It wasn\u2019t easy for him. It wasn\u2019t an easy thing for him to do.\u201d\n\nTateosian adds, \u201cIt\u2019s been incredible to watch it come to the correct conclusion.\u201d When she first heard her boyfriend\u2019s story, she says it sounded like a movie plot. \u201cThe ceremony had special significance to me because about 33 years ago, my father was sitting in the same place when my mother got naturalized.\u201d\n\nShe admires Uku\u2019s lovable candor and talent behind the bar, but notes that he\u2019s not a \u201cstartender\u201d looking for a squeeze of the limelight. \u201cHe makes eye contact with the people he\u2019s meeting, smiling, offering a good handshake,\u201d Tateosian says. \u201cAll these little things that people take for granted.\u201d Though he wore a flashy American flag onesie to his citizenship party at The Crown & Crow, Tateosian says he\u2019s never sought the public eye.\n\nAfter all, he couldn\u2019t be the face of anything for 10 years. \u201cI used to resent what I called \u2018doers,\u2019\u201d Uku explains. \u201cPeople who would be in newspaper articles, start bar programs, or create things, because I couldn\u2019t be one of those people. I spent 10 years doing a fairly visible job in the shadows.\u201d Now Uku is timidly reaching for his dreams. \u201cI\u2019ve had to relearn that I can do things. I can build things. I can create things.\u201d"

    "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFeb. 7, 2019, 10:59 AM GMT By Josh Lederman\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Semi-automatic weapons, flamethrowers and even some grenades will become easier for U.S. weapons manufacturers to export overseas under new rules being put in place by the Trump administration and obtained by NBC News.\n\nUnder the new rules, set to take effect in just under a month, gun-makers will no longer need licenses from the Department of State to sell dozens of types of weapons to other countries, including semi-automatic assault weapons such as the AR-15 that has been employed in many of America\u2019s worst mass shootings. Instead, sellers will need only a no-fee license from the Department of Commerce, which has a less onerous licensing process and a smaller global footprint, making it harder to track how the weapons are ultimately used overseas.\n\nThe new rules come as efforts to strengthen gun control in the United States, a key priority in the Obama administration, have stalled under President Donald Trump despite continued mass shootings. Democrats have signaled they plan to use their newfound control of the House of Representatives to revisit the issue, starting with a House Judiciary Committee hearing held Wednesday \u2014 the first in about eight years.\n\nThe Trump administration first floated the changes last year, rejuvenating a campaign to simplify export rules that had been contemplated by the administration of President Barack Obama but then dropped after the mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012. The State Department sent the final version of the rules to key lawmakers Monday as part of the mandatory \u201ccongressional notification\u201d process. The rules will take effect 30 days later unless Congress takes the unlikely step of passing a resolution to block them.\n\nA copy of the new regulations, marked \u201cOnly for State internal use,\u201d says that supervision for exports of any semi-automatic firearms that don\u2019t use caseless ammunition will move from the State Department to the Commerce Department. The same applies to shotguns, other than those that are fully automatic.\n\nThose who want to export flamethrowers that project a stream of fire up to 20 meters (about 66 feet) will no longer need a State Department license. A new paragraph in the rules states that grenades, too, will now fall under the Commerce Department if they contain \u201cnon-lethal or less lethal projectiles.\u201d Most parts, components and ammunition for firearms are also being moved to the Commerce Department.\n\nPart of Trump\u2019s push to reduce regulations governmentwide, the new rules aim to assist American gun manufacturers by making it simpler to export products that the administration says are already \u201cwidely available for retail sale in the United States.\u201d Exports of weapons deemed to have an \u201cinherently military function\u201d or to provide the U.S. with a military advantage will remain controlled by the State Department.\n\nBut gun control advocates and many Democrats have voiced concerns about the proliferation of weapons in places where, unlike the United States, deadly weapons aren\u2019t readily available at sporting goods stores or retailers like Walmart.\n\n\u201cIn most countries, it is much more difficult to obtain any kind of firearm, much less a semi-automatic rifle or a flamethrower,\u201d said John Lindsay-Poland, a gun trafficking expert at the human rights group Global Exchange. \u201cIn a context where such weapons aren\u2019t available to ordinary people, they become weapons of war, whether we\u2019re talking about insurgencies or terrorist organizations or organized crime. They use those weapons to control territory, carry out acts against civilians and to contest state power.\u201d\n\nThe changes also mean that sales of less than $1 million in arms will not require advance notification to Congress, which allows lawmakers a period of time to block a potential sale. That process has in the past been used to stop sales of firearms to countries of concern.\n\nIn 2017, opposition from lawmakers thwarted a Trump administration proposal to let Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s bodyguards buy $1.2 million in U.S. guns, following violence against protesters during his visit to Washington, D.C. A similar process stopped the U.S. from selling tens of thousands of assault weapons to the Philippines\u2019 national police in 2016.\n\nUnder the new rules, exporting guns will also cost less. Unlike the State Department, which charges an annual $2,240 fee for licenses to export firearms, the Commerce Department's licensing process doesn\u2019t require a fee.\n\nAlthough some Democratic opposition is expected to the new rules, they are likely to take effect anyway. New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate\u2019s foreign relations panel, plans to put a hold on the rules, The New York Times has reported. But to block the rules permanently, Congress would have to pass a resolution disapproving them, a maneuver that has been rarely attempted and even less frequently successful.\n\nA State Department official, speaking anonymously because the final rules haven\u2019t been publicly released, stressed that all firearm exports will still be monitored by the U.S. government, via the Commerce Department.\n\nThe official said the changes would \u201csignificantly reduce the regulatory burden on the U.S. commercial firearms and ammunition industry, promote American exports, and clarify the regulatory requirements for independent gunsmiths, while at the same time prioritizing national security controls and continuing our ability to restrict exports where human rights, illicit trafficking, and related issues may be of concern.\u201d\n\nIn public comments submitted to the Federal Register after the Trump administration first proposed the rules in May, the National Rifle Association voiced its support, arguing that the Commerce Department is fully capable of regulating gun exports.\n\nStill, the Institute for Legislative Action \u2014 the gun group\u2019s lobbying arm \u2014 encouraged the administration to tweak the rules by removing even more categories of items from the State Department\u2019s control, including silencers and high-capacity magazines.\n\n\u201cThe NRA believes that, on the whole, the proposal correctly balances the imperatives of national and global security, allocation of oversight resources, and promotion of American industry, innovation, and competiveness,\u201d Christopher Zealand, the group\u2019s senior research attorney. wrote.\n\nYet many of the almost 3,000 comments received by the government argued against the easing of the export rules, warning of the risk of increasing gun trafficking and needlessly enriching the gun manufacturing industry.\n\n\u201cTo cite just a few reasons, it will make it easier for dictators, organized crime, and terrorists to obtain guns in large quantities,\u201d one of them, Marilyn Guterman, commented. \u201cPlease, in the name of peace and sanity do not allow this to happen.\u201d"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The federal agency managed by Neomi Rao, the nominee to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, has been stalling a critical employer guidance on workplace sexual harassment for over a year.\n\nRao, who is the director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, is already reported to be on the Trump administration\u2019s shortlist for a future Supreme Court position, should one open up, and faces senators in confirmation hearings on Tuesday.\n\nOIRA is a division of the Office of Management and Budget, which evaluates regulations from across the federal government. In November 2017, just a month after the Harvey Weinstein revelations kicked off the #MeToo movement, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an independent agency, delivered the new harassment guidelines to OIRA. The federal government hasn\u2019t updated its workplace guidance, which helps set human resources policy across the country, since the 1990s. A January 2017 proposed draft, issued just before President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, was the product of a bipartisan task force and subject to months of public comment. But it has fallen into a black hole under Rao.\n\nRecently, writings of Rao\u2019s while at Yale University have been unearthed. \u201cA good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober,\u201d Rao wrote in 1994. \u201cAnd if she drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice. \u2026 Implying that a drunk woman has no control of her actions, but that a drunk man does strips women of all moral responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe cache of writings included an essay from 1994 in which she stated, \u201cTrendy political movements have only recently added sexuality to the standard checklist of traits requiring tolerance.\u201d Rao added: \u201cNo one knows whether sexuality is a biological phenomenon or a social construct. The truth may lie somewhere in the middle.\u201d In a separate piece, she chided \u201chomosexuals\u201d for wanting \u201cto redefine marriage and parenthood.\u201d\n\nNow, as OIRA administrator, Rao\u2019s office has sat on the most important federal response to the #MeToo movement, which would clarify to workers and employers what the EEOC considers workplace sexual harassment. \u201cI absolutely think it\u2019s relevant to considering her record when it comes to civil rights,\u201d said Maya Raghu, director of Workplace Equality and senior counsel at the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\nDebra Katz, the sexual harassment lawyer who represented Christine Blasey Ford in her allegations against Kavanaugh last year, told Bloomberg Law last June, \u201cIn a moment where we have a huge cultural and societal reckoning, this administration is showing it\u2019s not going to take a leadership role in preventing sexual harassment.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Intercept, EEOC spokesperson Kimberly Smith-Brown described a \u201cnormal course\u201d of back and forth on the content of rules and regulations with OIRA. \u201cAt this point, the ball is back in our hands here at the EEOC, and we\u2019re evaluating it internally,\u201d Smith-Brown said.\n\nBut experts in the regulatory process claim that the situation is unusual. As an independent agency, the EEOC is not required to send guidance to OIRA for review; the agency submitted it voluntarily. The normal timeline for guidance review is 90 days; the EEOC guidance is at 15 months and counting. And the guidance does not appear on any list of documents under review at OIRA, making it impossible for stakeholders and the public to track its status.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t find it on the website,\u201d said Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen. \u201cThey are using OIRA to keep this stuck.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration, as part of its deregulatory agenda, has waged a kind of war on agency guidance, which attempt to clarify or interpret statutes for regulated entities without having the force of law. Rao herself has said that the administration wants to limit agency guidance documents, saying that it relies on a \u201cthinner constitutionality\u201d standard, and \u201cif there\u2019s a guidance document that imposes significant costs \u2014 it\u2019s economically significant, or otherwise significant from a policy perspective \u2014 we should be taking a look at that.\u201d\n\nThe EEOC has not updated its sexual harassment guidance for employers since the 1990s. According to a 2016 task force report co-chaired by Democratic commissioner Chai Feldblum and Republican Victoria Lipnic, nearly one-third of the 90,000 charges received by the EEOC in fiscal year 2015 involved allegations of workplace harassment. Charges have spiked since then, as the #MeToo movement has only widened awareness of the realities of sexual misconduct in the workplace. The agency unanimously approved the guidance on a bipartisan basis when sending it to OIRA.\n\nFeldblum\u2019s proposed re-nomination to the commission was seen at one point as a major stumbling block in getting the guidance approved. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, put a hold on the nomination of Feldblum, who is openly gay, for another term, blocking two Republican nominees for EEOC in the process. Feldblum eventually chose to exit the EEOC at the end of 2018, leaving the agency with only two of five commissioners, not enough for a quorum.\n\nEven with the political dispute out of the way, the guidance has been stalled at OIRA under Rao\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe guidance accomplishes what conservatives often regard as an important function: providing clarity to businesses. Consolidating several earlier guidance documents under a single legal analysis, the EEOC lays out what types of harassing workplace conduct it would consider as violating federal equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination statutes. \u201cAn updated guidance would be important for employers, so they know what the law is,\u201d said Raghu, of the National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cIt\u2019s especially important for small businesses, many of whom don\u2019t have HR directors or legal counsel to interpret the law for them.\u201d\n\nWhile not legally binding, EEOC defines in the guidance when it believes an employer is specifically liable, how it can limit liability through prevention and prompt corrective action, and what protected classes are covered.\n\nThe latter appears to be the sticking point with the administration. The guidance included gender identity and sexual orientation as covered under the interpretation of sex-based harassment. This has been EEOC policy since at least 2012, but it diverts sharply from the Justice Department\u2019s views throughout the Trump presidency."

We have a pipeline of potential projects and have spoken with several of the key agencies that will direct these efforts. There are other groups forming but none that can currently match the relationships or resources that we possess,\" the memo reads.\n\nA Colony spokesman told ProPublica in a statement that the memo \"was simply an outline of a proposed potential business plan which was never acted upon or implemented.\"\n\n\"Colony at no time has maintained a DC office,\" the spokesman added."

    "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 2, 2019, 3:06 PM GMT By Reuters\n\nNearly 30 drugmakers have taken steps to raise the prices of their medicines in January, ending a self-declared halt to increases made by a pharma industry under pressure from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe hikes, as seen in documents viewed by Reuters, will pose a new challenge to Trump's pledge to lower the costs of prescription medications in the world's most expensive pharmaceutical market.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has proposed a slew of policies aimed at lowering prices and passing more of the discounts negotiated by health insurers on to patients. Those measures are not expected to provide relief to consumers in the short-term, however, and fall short of giving government health agencies direct authority to negotiate or regulate drug prices.\n\nTwenty-eight drugmakers filed notifications with California agencies in early November, disclosing that they planned to raise prices in 60 days or longer. Under a state law passed last year, companies are required to notify payers in California if they intend to raise the list price on any drug by more than 16 percent over a two-year period.\n\nThe details were provided to Reuters in response to a public records request to California Correctional Health Care Services, which provides healthcare services to the state's corrections department. The department spends more than $3 billion annually on drugs for inmates, more than any other state.\n\n\"Requests and public shaming haven't worked\" to lower drug prices, said Michael Rea, chief executive of RX Savings Solutions, which helps health plans and employers seek lower cost prescription medicines. \"We expect the number of 2019 increases to be even greater than in past years.\"\n\nPfizer rolled back planned price increases in July after President Trump said in a tweet that the drugmaker \"should be ashamed\" and that his administration would respond to the hikes.\n\nPfizer said it would defer hikes until January 2019 to support the administration as it pursued its new pricing policies. Pfizer's move prompted many of its industry peers, including Bayer, Novartis, Allergan, AstraZeneca and Amgen, to follow suit.\n\nDrug price increases implemented by the 20 biggest drugmakers did slow down during the second half of 2018, with those companies raising prices on just over half the number of drugs as in 2017, according to data compiled by consultancy RX Savings Solutions.\n\nPfizer has already announced plans to hike prices on 41 of its drugs in mid-January.\n\nNovartis is planning to raise prices on more than 100 indications of over 30 different drugs in January, the documents show, with increases ranging from 4.5 percent to 9.9 percent. Drugs on the list are expected to account for more than $20 billion of Novartis' revenue this year and include multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, psoriatic arthritis treatment Cosentyx, and leukemia treatment Tasigna.\n\nThe list also includes Diovan, the brand name version of blood pressure treatment valsartan, generic versions of which are currently in shortage after a potential carcinogen was detected in active ingredients made in China, prompting widespread recalls.\n\nNovartis spokesman Eric Althoff said the company plans to raise list prices on 14 percent of the medicines it sells in the country in 2019, for an average increase of 4.7 percent on those drugs.\n\n\"Our rebates and discounts, however, continue to grow even faster,\" Althoff said. As a result, the company expects a net price decrease of nearly 5 percent across the whole U.S. portfolio, he said.\n\nOver the last three years, net price decreases for its U.S. business have ranged from 2 percent to 2.6 percent, the company said.\n\nBayer filed notifications with California agencies to increase prices on six of its drugs in January, many of which are birth control products. Most of these price increases are 5 percent.\n\nBayer said that the wholesale price of its products is not representative of what most consumers pay and that \"list price increases are expected to be offset by higher rebates and discounts paid to insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers.\"\n\nAmgen did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca and Biogen declined to comment for this story.\n\nGSK would not give details about its specific price increases. Allergan said that all of its price increases will be aligned with its pledge made in 2016 to limit drug price increases on its products to less than 10 percent annually.\n\nLowering prescription drug prices was a top priority in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Rival Democrats are expected to step up congressional scrutiny of drug price hikes this year now that they have control of the House of Representatives."

    "text": "The Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian tore into President Trump on Monday by arguing that many of his policies are little more than a costly waste of resources.\n\nThe comments came while Uygur and Kasparian addressed the news that Trump sending thousands of additional troops down south to fortify the border while he continues to fight with Congress over funding for a border wall. As they took note of people in the government who call the move a waste of money, Uygur asked why U.S. troops are being allocated this way if they aren\u2019t even legally clear to act in the same capacity as border security law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWhy are we sending them there? They\u2019re there to put up wires? Couldn\u2019t we hire people at minimum wage to put up wires? Why do you need the military to put up wires or a fence? That makes no sense at all. The only reason you would do that is for political theater. So, Trump, as usual, is hiding behind the troops and using them as a political gimmick. You MAGA guys must be so proud.\u201d\n\nKasparian agreed, calling it \u201cdisgusting\u201d for Trump to use troops as \u201cprops.\u201d The conversation continued with an analysis of Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical theater\u201d on immigration and a possible national emergency, during which, Uygur characterized the wall as \u201ca physical manifestation of conservative voters\u2019 cowardice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re definitely afraid of everything,\u201d Uygur said. \u201cTrump knows his voters are cowards, so he just keeps pressing on that nerve.\u201d\n\nKasparian noted that most Americans don\u2019t believe that a border wall will solve the problems of illegal immigration, and she concluded that Trump keeps pushing for it anyway because \u201call he cares about is constructing his hate monument\u201d and appeasing his base.\n\nWatch above, via The Young Turks.\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Ken Meyer (@KenMeyer91) on Twitter\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com"

A fringe conservative minority is holding Congress hostage, extracting radical policy concessions over the will of the majority. And it\u2019s leading the nation to fiscal, environmental and moral ruin.\n\nMaybe you haven\u2019t heard this part: These dangerous conservatives are Democrats.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI am talking about the radical conservatives in the Democratic Party,\u201d said Saikat Chakrabarti. \u201cThat\u2019s who we need to counter. It\u2019s the same across any number of issues\u2014pay-as-you-go, free college, \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d These are all enormously popular in the party, but they don\u2019t pass because of the radical conservatives who are holding the party hostage.\u201d\n\nNot long ago, this would have been an outlier position even among American liberals. Today, it\u2019s the organizing principle of a newly empowered segment of the Democratic Party, one with a foothold in the new Congress.\n\nChakrabarti is chief of staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the closest thing to a new celebrity Congress has had in years\u2014a 29-year-old former activist and bartender who, on the most recent Martin Luther King Day, sat on the same New York stage as the rapper Common, Black Panther director Ryan Coogler and MacArthur \u201cgenius award\u201d winner Ta-Nehisi Coates.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s Ocasio-Cortez who gets all the headlines, she arguably wouldn\u2019t be in Congress in the first place without the group Chakrabarti founded: Justice Democrats, a new, central player in the ongoing war for the soul of the Democratic Party. It was the Justice Democrats who recruited her in a quixotic campaign early on, providing a neophyte candidate with enough infrastructure to take down a party leader. And it is the Justice Democrats who see Ocasio-Cortez as just the opening act in an astonishingly ambitious plan to do nothing less than re-imagine liberal politics in America\u2014and do it by whatever means necessary.\n\nIf that requires knocking out well-known elected officials and replacing them with more radical newcomers, so be it. And if it ends up ripping apart the Democratic Party in the process\u2014well, that might be the idea.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be a war within the party. We are going to lean into it,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, the group\u2019s spokesman.\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

But they also find themselves with real anxieties about their left flank for the first time in memory. Justice Democrats is one of a handful of groups that represent a new and restive spirit in the party, a Tea Party-like populist coalition of voters awakened by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 cannonball run in 2016 and united by their superprogressive politics and a millennial disdain for the establishment.\n\nNot all of their efforts have been successful\u2014of the slate of 2018 candidates Justice Democrats recruited, only Ocasio-Cortez won\u2014but they\u2019ve been undeniably disruptive, and unafraid to go after people on their own side of the aisle. Nervous members of the Democratic establishment and leadership are watching, asking: Could they hurt the party as it tries to leverage its first majority in years and defeat Trump in 2020? And do they even care?\n\n\n\n***\n\nFour years ago, Ocasio-Cortez was waitressing at a Union Square taqueria, Donald Trump was the host of a fading reality-TV franchise, and Chakrabati was a digital entrepreneur who had nothing at all to do with politics. He was living in the San Francisco Bay Area and working for a digital payment processing company when he suddenly, unexpectedly found himself electrified by a 73-year-old presidential candidate named Bernie Sanders. \u201cI liked what he was saying. He seemed like he was one of the people,\u201d Chakrabarti says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that he was a progressive, but that he really cared about building a movement around these ideas.\u201d\n\nHe reached out to Claire Sandberg, the digital organizing director of the Sanders campaign, who was arranging \u201cBernstorms\u201d around the country, getting previously apolitical activists together to host phone banking and door-knocking parties.\n\nEventually, it became clear that Bernie wasn\u2019t going to win. But it felt clear to Chakrabati that the political revolution Sanders had stoked was close to coming to fruition. He began meeting with a small group of his fellow Sandersistas to figure out how to channel that energy in the next election.\n\nLike Chakrabarti, they were entirely from outside government, and mostly outside politics altogether. Corbin Trent was a political neophyte who\u2019d been volunteering for Sanders in Knoxville, Tennessee; when the food truck he owned burned down, he left Knoxville and joined the campaign in Vermont. Alexandra Rojas was a student in community college in Orange County, Calif., when Sanders announced his run \u2014 \u201cIt was the first time I got excited about politics,\u201d she said \u2014 and started volunteering on campus.\n\nToday, she\u2019s the executive director of Justice Democrats, and Trent, the group\u2019s co-founder and former communications director, is Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman. The group\u2019s current communications director and perhaps fiercest firebrand is Shahid, the only member in its leadership who had any experience in politics before the Sanders campaign.\n\nAs the 2016 primary got underway, Shahid was working at an immigrants rights legal aid group in Philadelphia; people would come in\u2014asylum seekers, undocumented immigrants\u2014and Shahid recalls telling them, day after day, to just keep watching CNN because Obama was bound to pass something clarifying their status sooner or later. \u201cIt was the most demoralizing, uninspiring time of my life,\u201d he said.\n\nDisappointed with Obama, Shahid got a job with the Working Families Party, which was all-in for Sanders, and after the election began trying to figure out how to make big systemic changes in politics, or \u201ccultureshifts\u201d\u2014not just winning arguments, but changing the terms of the whole debate.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that you bring moral questions to the public\u2019s attention, and have the public rally around it,\u201d he says. \u201cReframe the issue so that the choices are stark, and let the public decide rather than people in power.\u201d He points to how the \u201c99 percent\u201d became a buzzword after Occupy Wall Street; how Obama and Hillary Clinton eventually came to oppose the Keystone Pipeline after supporting it; how \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d quickly went from a fringy Twitter slogan to one embraced by mainstream Democrats. Either you favor ripping kids from their homes, or you don\u2019t. And if you don\u2019t, suddenly the policy choices aren\u2019t incremental: They\u2019re rather stark.\n\nThe group started meeting up even before the 2016 primary was over, and its members began looking ahead to the 2018 midterms\u2014figuring that any Democratic president would need a very different Congress to get anything done. Along with Cenk Uygur, the progressive activist and founder of the liberal media company The Young Turks, they started a group called Brand New Congress.\n\nThe original idea was thrilling in its ambition, if absurdly unworkable: They would create a slate to replace Congress entirely, recruiting 435 people across both parties to run for the House, while BNC would serve as the back office for all of them, handling mail, digital, and press.\n\nChakrabarti, Uygur and others saw the effort begin to founder under its own weight. And in the wake of Trump\u2019s shocking win, the notion of a nonpartisan effort to replace every member of Congress with some nonpolitical person didn\u2019t seem as important as creating the sharpest possible counterweight on the left. And so after the election, Chakrabarti, Trent, Rojas, Uygur and others split off to found Justice Democrats.\n\nThis time, the goal was far more modest: Push the Democratic party closer to Sanders\u2019 politics by challenging centrist Democrats in their primaries. The idea was to recruit 12 working-class candidates to confront incumbents, muster some of that Sanders-style populist energy on a local level and push incumbents to the left. If a couple of breaks went their way, they might even score an upset or two.\n\n\u201cAfter the election, was I mad at Donald Trump? I guess, kinda,\u201d said Uygur, who ended up leaving the group when a series of previously deleted misogynistic blog posts were unearthed. \u201cBut mainly I was mad at the Democratic Party for blowing it. How could you lose to this guy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to realize Democrats are never going to learn,\u201d he said, \u201cand that the only way to make a difference is to defeat the corrupt corporate Democrats. They get paid to lose. The corporate donor pays them to be weak, and pays Republicans to be strong.\u201d\n\nThe group didn\u2019t have many litmus tests for candidates they were willing to support, but they drew a few red lines. One was a ban on all corporate PAC money, something that soon became standard fare for 2018 candidates. On policy, if you weren\u2019t for Medicare for all, \u201cit usually meant you weren\u2019t our type of candidate,\u201d said Uygur.\n\nEven now, Justice Democrats is a shoestring operation. It has no headquarters, no major benefactors and raised less than $3 million in the 2018 cycle, mostly small dollar donations from people not used to much political giving. But it built a 300,000 strong email list by engaging with young activists on the ground and online.\n\nA typical \u201cbig donor\u201d to the group is Arden Buck, an 84-year-old retired research engineer in Colorado who gave $10,000 after receiving a windfall insurance payout. I found him through public fundraising records; when I asked him how he found about Justice Democrats, he said he saw them mentioned on MSNBC and that he was driven by concern about greenhouse gases and wanted to give money to groups that could use it the most. \u201cI am focused on climate change. If we don\u2019t take care of the environment, social justice is beside the point,\u201d he told me.\n\nFor all its passion, the group might have been just another voice in the political wilderness if it hadn\u2019t been for the success of Ocasio-Cortez. She had come to the founders\u2019 attention in 2016 when her brother, Gabriel, who had heard about Brand New Congress, nominated her to be one of its candidates. Chakrabarti was still with BNC, and he told Business Insider earlier this month that the group didn\u2019t really see her district as a likely target: It was occupied by Joe Crowley, the powerful 10-term incumbent from Queens, and seemed unwinnable. But after a few phone calls and a meeting, he had a different thought: \u201cHoly Crap. You are an incredible candidate.\u201d\n\nAs her race heated up, and it became clear that this 28-year-old was actually gaining ground on one of the most powerful Democrats in the House, Shahid encouraged the entire leadership of Justice Democrats to momentarily abandon their other efforts and go all in on running her campaign.\n\nThe challenge of running a young, underfunded working-class candidate became apparent early on. When Shahid joined Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign, she was still working four nights a week as a bartender in Manhattan. He would set up meetings with community leaders only to have Ocasio-Cortez say that she couldn\u2019t do them because they interfered with her work schedule.\n\n\u201cI would get so frustrated with her. \u2018You can\u2019t do this full-time bartending thing and run for Congress!\u2019 And she would say, \u2018What do you want me to do? I have to work.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey thought they were going to get 30 percent of the vote. Ocasio-Cortez would text Shahid excitedly whenever there was a report that Crowley had moved a little to the left\u2014embracing Medicare for all, for example. That was proof, as they saw it, that their mission was advancing. Shahid says he felt more than a twinge of regret for leading people on.\n\n\u201cWe would go to these fundraisers in the Bronx, and there would be ex-cops in the room and they would have tears in their eyes. It was a double thing for me. I had just come off the Bernie campaign and here AOC was, she was so fucking inspiring and so charismatic that grown men are crying and I would think to myself, \u2018We just have no chance here. Everyone is going to be so disappointed!\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nAt one level, Justice Democrats\u2019 strategy failed. Their original goal was to recruit 12 candidates, provide them with media, field and fundraising help as needed, and try to pick off a few vulnerable seats. Of those candidates, 11 lost.\n\nBut they also notched a success beyond anything they\u2019d planned for. Ocasio-Cortez took on one of the most powerful congressional Democrat not named Nancy Pelosi, and by a decisive margin, she unseated him\u2014shaking the party\u2019s power structure and getting nationwide attention for a democratic socialist newcomer who embodied nearly everything that thrilled young movement voters. Several other candidates they\u2019d endorsed, but weren\u2019t as closely involved with, also won, including Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar.\n\nThe Crowley defeat brought to mind Dave Brat\u2019s surprise 2014 victory in Virginia, taking out Republican majority leader Eric Cantor by primarying him from the right. Shahid looks back at the power of what a single race can do, recalling the Politico headline that ran at the time: \u201cEric Cantor Loss Kills Immigration Reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just one fucking race,\u201d he said. \u201cOne fucking race and suddenly immigration reform was dead.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders race had established the existence of a populist Democratic base eager to vote against its own party\u2019s establishment. Now there was an organization willing to lead the charge. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which started a decade ago as a liberal alternative to what it saw as its stodgy counterparts in Washington. \u201cEverybody is so concerned about clout and about relationships, and they have no relationships, so they just go for it, taking big chances.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Ocasio-Cortez, and for that matter Pressley, Tlaib and Omar don\u2019t hail from the traditional background in a body in which the median wealth is over $1 million is very much part of the point. As Ocasio-Cortez faces criticism for her bank account, her wardrobe and her supposed lack of knowledge of the details of policy, the strategy from Justice Democrats and her team has been to face it head on.\n\n\u201cOur theory is that when a working-class person wins, when a person without a political background wins, there is going to be a backlash\u2014you don\u2019t have experience, you don\u2019t know anything, you are dumb,\u201d said Shahid. \u201cAll of this happened with Ocasio.\u201d\n\nThis, as he sees it, is the culture shift, a way of turning the lens around to reveal the now stark choices. \u201cThat is an awesome story for people to see, because the way the D.C. media and the conservative media in particular tear into AOC around being a working-class person or a person of color or a Puerto Rican, I don\u2019t think the public likes it very much,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public sees a Cinderella story, a bartender who goes against the machine and wins. And you see the way she is dragged by the D.C. establishment and the media, we lean into it, as if to say, \u2018If that\u2019s what they think about her, what do you think they think about you?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Congress, fellow Democrats don\u2019t know quite what to make of AOC or the Justice Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s bark may not be as serious as her bite; although she livestreamed a sit-in of Pelosi\u2019s office, she also voted for her for Speaker and has been supportive of her fellow Democrats. It\u2019s not lost on her colleagues, however, that the group that helped vault her into place\u2014and who have two founders leading her office\u2014is the sworn enemy of the establishment she needs to work with.\n\n\u201cIn person, she is lovely and is trying to get along with her colleagues,\u201d said the House Democrat. \u201cBut she is going to have to navigate the fact it was the Justice Democrats who brought her to prominence, and their currency is going to be continue to shake up what they call the establishment and run primaries against people.\u201d\n\nDavid Hopkins, a professor of political science at Boston College, says systematically targeting fellow Democrats really crosses a line in American politics. \u201cI mean, even the Freedom Caucus doesn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sort of know how stuff happens in Congress. It requires a lot of negotiation and compromise. Starting a bunch of internal fights within your party is not usually step one.\u201d\n\nSome people in Congress closely aligned with the group have publicly distanced themselves from any effort to cast a wide net of insurgent challenges. Ro Khanna, a second-term congressman from Silicon Valley who himself defeated an eight-term Democrat in a primary in 2016, sent Justice Democrats a direct message on Twitter to join the cause soon after they formed. The group considers him, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, to have been their closest allies in the last Congress; Khanna was the only sitting member of Congress to endorse Ocasio-Cortez. But today he said the party needs for all of its component parts to keep their eyes on the real prize. \u201cOur primary focus has to be stop Donald Trump, to defeat the Republicans, particularly in the Senate. That is the single most effective thing we can do to advance progressive politics,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cI have been encouraging our party to save our fire for Republicans rather than on intraparty disputes.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez herself has sent mixed messages on this score. According to a report in POLITICO, New Jersey Representative Frank Pallone, a moderate Democrat, fought with Ocasio-Cortez on her idea for a select committee on a Green New Deal in a closed-door meeting of Democrats in November. Rather than embrace the narrative of being a firebrand, Ocasio-Cortez, who hadn\u2019t yet been sworn in, denied the story was true. A few weeks later, POLITICO also reported that Ocasio-Cortez and allies were eyeing a primary challenge to Hakeem Jeffries, a young Brooklyn lawmaker who angered progressives in part for taking Joe Crowley\u2019s position in the leadership over the more liberal Barbara Lee in California. Ocasio-Cortez took issue with the story on Twitter, without denying it, lamenting that the article was \u201cprinted + distributed to **Congressional offices**\u201d and only later, when pressed by one of her followers, saying it wasn\u2019t accurate.\n\nJeffries\u2019 camp noted, pointedly, that the story didn\u2019t include an on-the-record denial from Ocasio-Cortez herself. They also told me she hadn\u2019t reached out to Jeffries herself to deny it. Jeffries himself was quoted citing the lyrics of Notorious B.I.G: \u201cSpread love, it\u2019s the Brooklyn way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat quote was sending a message,\u201d said one Jeffries supporter in New York. \u201cI am from Brooklyn. Don\u2019t fuck with me.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nFor now, it is still unclear where Justice Democrats will fit in among the various groups that emerged in big numbers out of the 2016 election, including Democratic Socialists of America, Indivisible, Brand New Congress, Swing Left and the Sunrise Movement, just to name a few. Justice Democrats made a bet that a single giant felled would rewrite the political landscape, and so far they have been proven right.\n\nThe Green New Deal, a joint production of Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement, has 45 co-sponsors and is embraced by several Democrats running for president. Justice Democrats helped galvanize support, getting 150 people to sit in at Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office just after the midterms.\n\nShahid, the group\u2019s spokesman, predicted that, besides further agitation on the Green New Deal, the group would attempt to push for free college and an end to mass incarceration. And to force some support, they won\u2019t be afraid to threaten primary challenges against anyone unwilling to sign on.\n\n\u201cWe already are a pariah in Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s about attention. Either it helps you gain leverage because people are scared of you or you lose leverage because people are annoyed with you. We will see.\u201d\n\nSo far, the results of this aggressive outside game are mixed, at best. Despite the group\u2019s success attracting support for the Green New Deal, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denied calls for a select committee on the idea. And 45 co-sponsors is a long way from the 218 needed to actually pass something.\n\n\u201cYou are not going to make 218 people in one session of Congress afraid,\u201d said Hopkins. \u201cHow much leverage does Ocasio-Cortez have? If she can wave her hand and endanger the reelection prospects of even pretty liberal members, then that is one thing. They may not like it, but they will be forced to get in line. But does she have that kind of power? If you take a shot and miss, you are very much likely going to be worse off than even if you didn\u2019t take a shot at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI view these outside groups like this skeptically. Are they trying to build a movement or start a riot?\u201d said Colin Strother, a Texas operative and an adviser to Representative Henry Cuellar, one of Justice Democrats\u2019 top targets in 2020. \u201cI never heard anything about Justice Democrats until a few weeks ago. Are the people running it political professionals? Groups like them, they come along for a cycle or two, they disappear and something else crops up in their place. Democrats do best when we keep our disagreements around the kitchen table instead of in the front yard where everybody can see.\u201d\n\nBuck, the Colorado donor, says he is thrilled with Ocasio-Cortez\u2014\u201cShe is fabulous\u201d\u2014but wary of what Justice Democrats want to do next. \u201cIt is little tricky. People without experience can shake things up, but I worry that they will be sitting ducks for the Republicans.\u201d\n\nAs they move into the next election cycle, their hope is that Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley, Tlaib and Omar form more of a unit, one in which they share staff, best practices and strategy, and care less about personal brand-building. Justice Democrats plans to provide cover with its 350,000-person email list and active social media feeds.\n\nLimited resources mean that playing in the presidential primary will be difficult, but the energized new left has already seen some of what were once considered its most outr\u00e9 ideas\u2014the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, Abolish ICE and free college\u2014become a central part of several likely presidential campaign platforms. Next cycle, members of the group plan to target from five to 10 House Democrats who occupy safe blue seats. Some names of the targets have already been floated out, like Henry Cuellar, but Sean McElwee, a liberal activist and co-founder of Data for Progress, where he works closely with Justice Democrats, listed a handful more who are vulnerable to a Crowley-sized challenge, including Kathleen Rice of Long Island, Jim Cooper of Nashville and Dutch Ruppersberger of Baltimore. (Shahid, asked if they were targets, declined to list any names.)\n\nStrother, the Texas operative, said people from outside Cuellar\u2019s South Texas district\u2014a place where guns and gas drilling are a way of life and an economic driver\u2014don\u2019t understand the absolutism. How, he asked, could a party that prides itself on being welcoming now try to kick apostates out of the tent?\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party went through a lot of these same fights after they won in 2010, and they were not well-served by them,\u201d he said, \u201cand the Democrats should learn that lesson.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiversity is one of the values of our party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have Muslims in our party, we have Buddhists in our party, we have Baptists in our party, we have everything under the sun in our party. We say you can worship what you want, you can love what you want and you can be what you want. Then how is it that we are going to tell people you can\u2019t think what you want?\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Politics"

    "text": "On Friday night, a painting by the anonymous street artist known as Banksy sold at Sotheby\u2019s auction house in London for $1.4 million. But as soon as the auctioneer dropped the gavel, something unexpected happened: a beeping alarm went off and the frame began eating the painting, spitting half of it out the bottom in what may be the first instance of a self-destructing painting, reports Scott Reyburn at The New York Times.\n\nThe piece was a classic Banksy motif known as \u201cGirl with Balloon,\u201d created using spray paint on canvas back in 2006. In a video posted after the incident, Banksy shows how he built a custom shredding device into the large gilt frame in case the work was ever sold at auction. He also posted an Instagram quoting Picasso, \u201cThe urge to destroy is also a creative urge.\u201d\n\nThe painting\u2019s sale coincides with Frieze Week, one of London\u2019s most significant art fairs. The staff of Sotheby\u2019s denies any prior knowledge of the shredding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been Banksy-ed,\u201d Alex Branczik, Sotheby\u2019s head of European Contemporary art said in a press conference after the incident. \u201cI\u2019ll be quite honest, we have not experienced this situation in the past, where a painting is spontaneously shredded upon achieving a record for the artist.\u201d\n\nHowever, Reyburn reports that there is some evidence the auction house was in on the gag, despite their denials. First, a man operating an electronic device inside a bag was spotted in the auction house, presumably someone turning on the remote control shredder, as seen in a post from the chairman of Sotheby\u2019s Switzerland, Caroline Lang\u2019s private Instagram account, Reyburn reports. He was later said to have been removed by security. Doubters point out that Sotheby\u2019s does not allow people to carry bags into their auctions.\n\n\u201cIf it had been offered earlier in the sale, it would have caused disruption and sellers would have complained about that,\u201d says Morgan Long, head of the art investment company the Fine Art Group who witnessed the shredding from the front row. \u201cAnd Sotheby\u2019s let a man with a bag into the building. They must have known.\u201d\n\nThe painting\u2014just a piece of canvas on a wooden backing\u2014would have also been much wider and heavier than normal, raising suspicion, especially during any condition report, or routine examination of a high-dollar artwork.\n\nThe most suspicious element is the placement of the painting and timing of the sale. The piece was hung on the wall instead of being placed on a podium like other paintings up for sale. And it was the last piece in the auction, meaning the shredding would not disrupt the rest of the sale.\n\nIt\u2019s not known what the anonymous buyer of the shredded artwork thinks about the piece or whether Sotheby\u2019s will discount or cancel the sale. Sebastian Smee at The Washington Post reports that there is some talk that the shredding incident will actually increase the value of the artwork.\n\nHe also points out the mixed message of the shredding. The self-destructing \u201cGirl with Balloon\u201d is believed to be a comment on capitalism and the art market. However, if Banksy wanted to make a real statement, Smee points out, he would have totally destroyed the art. Instead, what remains could conceivably be put back together or kept in its shredded state to later be displayed or even sold again, raising the idea that the work was less of a social commentary and more of a self-promoting publicity stunt.\n\nThat\u2019s in contrast to truly destructive artists, like Michael Landy. In 2001, he created an installation called Break Down. Over two weeks, he placed all 7,227 of his worldly belongings, including his passport, birth certificate and the pieces of his Saab car, on a conveyor belt and ran them through an industrial shredder, finishing the project with nothing but the clothes on his back."

In fact, most people are sick and tired of billionaires like Schultz who want to take away our privileges and safety nets while hoarding billions of dollars in cash for themselves, but that is EXACTLY what Schultz\u2019s platform is shaping up to be.

Howard Schultz was brave enough and responsible enough to say that he wants to run for president. He's hired Steve Schmidt, John Mccain's 2008 campaign manager, just to give you a hint of how effective that guy is. He's hired him to run this campaign and Howard Schultz promises that he is going to rescue us all because as a self made billionaire, he knows exactly what the American public wants and according to shults himself, what the public wants is don't raise taxes on me and my fellow millionaires and billionaires. Let's cut entitlement programs to let's, let's cut social security and Medicare because obviously, yeah, that's what people want a medicare for all is, is a huge threat to democracy.\n\nSo we won't even pursue that. Let's not even talk about it. According to Sholtz and of course the budget deficit, the national debt, that is the greatest threat to the United States that exist today. I mean, I'm sure you understand that, right? I mean everybody, you talk to your friends, you texting with each other. It's all about the national debt, right? That's the only conversation we're having. That's the only issue any of us have ever really cared about. You know, screw healthcare, screw medicare for all, screw the fact that he wants to take your grandparents and your parents and cut their entitlements that they're trying to live off of, to have some kind of a meager retirement. No, we've all been worried about the national debt at $21,000,000,000,000. Oh God. It's awful. What are we gonna do? We're gonna do the same thing we've always done as a country. It just kind of keep going forward. Sometimes you pay it down. Sometimes we add to it. That's what happens. Everything works out fine. I am sick and tired of billionaires. I'm tired of it. I am tired of these egotistical, narcissistic assholes coming in telling us that they're going to take stuff away from us\n\ns who are struggling to live paycheck to paycheck.\n\n\n\n#rof #trofire #theringoffire #progressivenews"

    "title": "How Trump is Bribing Big Ag & Costing Americans",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Published on Jan 31, 2019\n\nThe Farm Bill was created during the Great Depression to help struggling farmers. But now the industry is dominated by big farming corporations \u2013 are farming handouts anymore than just a bribe to Big Ag? Jayde Lovell gives the lowdown.\n\n\n\nScript\n\nWith all the news focused on spending bills that Trump won\u2019t sign, you might not have noticed one bill Trump did sign, right before the shutdown began.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s called the US Farm Bill, a bill that\u2019s been going since 1933 and gives away almost a trillion dollars of your taxpayer money.\n\n\n\nNow, in 1933 the Farm Bill was created to protect vulnerable farmers who mostly looked like this.\n\n\n\nBut today, many farmers look like this: huge Agriculture companies that own thousands of acres and make billions of dollars.\n\n\n\nSo why do we still even have a Farm Bill, and where\u2019s all that money going?\n\n\n\nNow, before we get started, let me just say that the latest US Farm Bill does loads of good things, like guarantee food stamps for the poor, legalize hemp, and outlaw the farming of cats and dogs for meat. Which I thought was already a thing in the US, but anyway, the Farm Bill was supported by both parties and passed almost unanimously.\n\n\n\nBut like a golden beachy glow that might also be malignant skin cancer, the farm bill does two things that are pretty sh-thouse:\n\n\n\nONE - it sneaks billions of dollars into the pockets of Big Agriculture companies\n\nand\n\nTWO - It destroys the environment.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with number one: The US Farm Bill was created during the Great Depression, to keep family farms afloat and ensure a stable national food supply in rough times. Sounds pretty Fair Dinkum to me!\n\n\n\nBut see, the thing is \u2013 farming technology has come a bl--dy long way since the Great Depression \u2013 and because of this rampant industrialization, most farms are owned by Big Ag.\n\n\n\nBecause of the US Farm Bill, in 2017, these big companies received an average of $18.2 million in subsidies from Uncle Sam. Even billionaire businessman Glen Taylor \u2013 the owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves \u2013 received over one hundred thousand dollars in subsidies a year.\n\n\n\nNow, the Timberwolves rankings aren\u2019t that hot \u2013 but does Glennie Boy really need government handouts? Nup. Did we just pass a bill to keep giving him money? Yep.\n\n\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it. Iowa\u2019s Republican Senator Chuck Grassley is one of only two farmers in the Senate. And he voted against the Farm Bill.\n\n\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed ...\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to make sure the people who get the subsidies are real farmers. \u2026 I\u2019ve been trying for three years, and it gets worse and worse and worse.\u201d\n\nNow, why aren\u2019t more politicians like Chuck p-ssed about this?\n\n\n\nWell, just like taking money from our troops, taking money from our farmers has never been a good way to win votes. Especially right now \u2013 because of Trump\u2019s trade war with China, farmers have been losing billions. That\u2019s true for both these kinds of farmers, and these.\n\n\n\nSo rather than do something unpopular and get nailed by the Agriculture lobby, both political sides are happy to keep handing out checks.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the Farm Bill is also making a dog\u2019s breakfast out of America\u2019s environment... because of a thing called \u2018crop insurance\u2019.\n\n\n\nNow again, crop insurance was created to protect ye olde Depression era farmers from droughts and floods and hurricanes. If their crops were destroyed, the government would give them a few bucks so they wouldn't go bankrupt, and could survive to farm again in the next season. Kind of like a \u2018thank you, next\u2019 situation.\n\n\n\nBut today, crop insurance is a bit like a rich parent who keeps bailing their kid out of the slammer. Big agriculture companies know, if they make bad choices and their farm fails, the government will just bail them out with a nice fat insurance check.\n\n\n\nA 2017 study shows that crop insurance means less sh-ts given towards planting the right crops, especially by Big Ag corporations. Sure, it might be a bit risky to plant thirsty cotton in the New Mexico desert, or rice in in the Hurricane Alley \u2013 but you know what \u2013\u2013 if it doesn\u2019t work, we get paid anyway! Give it a burl!\n\n\n\nAnd another thing about crop insurance: it incentivizes farm owners to get bigger crop yields \u2013 even if it means destroying the environment. If they grow loads of crops this year, they make loads of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForbes: https://bit.ly/2RwheDO https://bit.ly/2DM7P7q\n\nWashington Post: https://wapo.st/2DOuvUL https://wapo.st/2WyaLfu https://wapo.st/2DLFeiR https://wapo.st/2DOuvUL\n\nUnion of Concerned Scientists: https://bit.ly/2MsnZZ3 https://bit.ly/2MsnZZ3\n\n\n\nEWG: https://bit.ly/2RZh0Kx https://bit.ly/2SfYvRz\n\n\n\nhttps://farm.ewg.org/crop_insurance_a...\n\nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/700/691864...\n\n\n\nSCIQ ON TYT\n\nProduced by Jayde Lovell and Bec Susan Gill.

For websites made easy at 10% off, head to https://www.squarespace.com/TYT.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump will most likely declare a national emergency to ensure he gets his wall. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.politico.com/story/2019/0...\n\n\n\n\"The White House is finalizing details of a potential national emergency declaration to secure President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall, even as lawmakers are trying to broker an immigration deal that could avert another shutdown in just over two weeks.\n\n\n\nTrump met with his budget chief, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Jared Kushner and other top officials, including White House lawyers, on Tuesday to walk through the logistics of such a move. And White House aides have been quietly meeting with outside conservative political groups to build support for the president to take such an action. Those talking points, which emphasize Trump\u2019s legal authority, have begun to show up in such conservative media outlets as Breitbart News.\n\n\n\nThe behind-the-scenes maneuvers indicate that the administration wants to be poised to quickly declare a national emergency, should Trump choose to do so, by the time Congress hits its Feb. 15 deadline to strike a deal before government funding again runs out. And it signals that White House officials may not have much faith in congressional Republicans to secure the funding in the coming weeks that Trump seeks to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump himself has said the odds of a congressional deal are 'less than 50-50.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

That meant Democrats and Republicans could get back to disagreeing about basically everything \u2014 beginning with the litany of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms in the Democrats\u2019 first major bill of 2019.\n\n\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee held an initial hearing on H.R. 1, the For The People Act. Tuesday\u2019s hearing focused largely on the bill\u2019s voting rights provisions, which fall under the committee\u2019s jurisdiction. These measures aim to expand automatic voter registration, early voting and felon re-enfranchisement. The bill also endorses a restoration of the Voting Rights Act pre-clearance provisions that were gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013.\n\n\n\nThe hearing essentially encapsulated the modern fight to vote in America. Democratic lawmakers, pointing to numerous recent examples of long lines at the polls, voter purging and excessive gerrymandering, described a system that is shutting out too many Americans and needs reform. Republican lawmakers, aided by their witnesses, suggested claims of suppression were exaggerated and accused Democrats of wanting to change voting laws for their own political benefit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

In an interview with Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti, Maduro said, 'Donald Trump gave the order to kill me, told the Colombian government, the Colombian mafia to kill me. If something happens to me once, Donald Trump and Colombian President Ivan Duque will be responsible for everything what happens to me.'\n\n\n\nMoscow has been one of Maduro's staunchest supporters, providing his regime with loans and weapons and accusing the Trump administration of backing a coup with its early backing of Venezuelan opposition leader and self-declared 'interim president' Juan Guaid\u00f3.\n\n\n\nSome two dozen nations, including the United States and most Latin American countries, have backed Guaid\u00f3, who is demanding Maduro hold a new election. He won a second term late last year in a vote condemned by the U.S. and its allies as illegitimate. Maduro barred, through a court system stacked with his allies, all serious opposition candidates from running in the election.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Published on Jan 28, 2019\n\nFox News has released a new poll that likely didn\u2019t give them the outcome that they had expected. According to their poll, a majority of Americans, including a plurality of Republicans, are actually in favor of increasing taxes on the wealthiest American citizens, directly contradicting the talking points that the people at Fox News have been putting out for years. This poll shows that public attitudes are shifting, and voters are tired of getting screwed over while the wealthy get all the benefits. Ring of Fire\u2019s Farron Cousins discusses this.\n\n\n\nLink \u2013 https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-...\n\n\n\nBecome a member today!: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWI...\n\n\n\nSupport us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire\n\n\n\nSpread the word!

You See Fox News conducted this poll where they were asking people, what do you think about the plan to tax the wealthy more? Should we be taxing people more? Who make $1,000,000? Should we be taxing people even more? If they make over $10,000,000 a year? Should we follow these crazy plans laid forth by people like Senator Elizabeth Warren and representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? These are bad ideas. So what do you think? Well, according to the results of this Fox News poll, majority of voters in this country said, hell yeah, that's a great idea. When can we start? So Fox News, who has been planting the seeds of our horrible these tax increases are how undemocratic they are, how unfair they are.\n\nThey've been doing it for months. They found out that their own viewers are like, no, I actually, I like that. I think millionaires and billionaires shouldn't be taxed more. They should be contributing more to the United States, how they benefited the most from this society, from this country, so they should be paying more to protect it more, to make it better. The more you benefit from something, the more you owe to. It is essentially the mentality in the United States today, and this Fox News poll actually echoes what other polls in recent weeks have found. Yes, and majority of people in this country love the idea of higher marginal tax rates. They love the idea of the wealthy elite not getting their tax breaks that they got last year. They want them to pay their fair share. Now, here's the actual numbers. All right, voter support tax increase on families making over 10 million annually by a 46 point margin.\n\nSeventy percent in favor to 24 percent oppose and they support a hike on those making over $1,000,000 by 36 points. Sixty five percent for 29 percent against more voters disapprove, 50 percent then approved. Thirty nine percent of just leaving tax rates as they are for everyone. So half the country already. He's not even happy with the tax rates that we currently have. They want them changed. They the working class, the people who are living paycheck to paycheck want to pay a little bit less and you can't fault them for that. The wealthy elite who take advantage of the system, who used tax tax loopholes to screw the government out of more money and they hide it off shore when they can. They do whatever they can to not pay more. People want them to pay more. They want them to have to fork over more money to Uncle Sam because in addition to finding out that people want more tax hikes for the wealthy, the poll also found that majority of people also want more government spending on things like infrastructure in health care and it's Kinda hard to do those things when the federal government is starved for cash.\n\n\n\n#rof #trofire #theringoffire #progressivenews"

Hours after his comments aired, Brokaw apologized online.\n\n\n\n'I am sorry, truly sorry, my comments were offensive to many. The great enduring American tradition of diversity is to be celebrated and cherished,' he wrote on Twitter, part of a flurry of posts backtracking on his earlier remarks. 'I am sorry - I never intended to disparage any segment of our rich, diverse society which defines who we are. ...

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wants to curb spiraling inequality in the United States and make the rich pay, according to a scoop from Jeff Stein and Christopher Ingraham at the Washington Post.\n\n\n\nThey report that the UC Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman are working with the presidential candidate on designing a proposal to levy a wealth tax on Americans with fortunes worth over $50 million.\n\n\n\nMost Americans currently pay property taxes to their local government, a form of a wealth tax. The majority of middle class assets are property. Rich people of course own real estate, but they tend to mostly own shares of stock and other financial assets that largely evade taxation. The French economist Thomas Piketty put wealth taxes back on the intellectual agenda with his influential 2014 book Capital in the 21st Century. Many Democrats have talked about the theme of runaway inequality in recent years, but Warren is the first politician to actually adopt Piketty\u2019s proposed solution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, Nomi Prins, John Iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, Nomi Prins, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

A recently a judge convicted for volunteers from the group. No more deaths. Do you know what their crime was there? Crime was leaving out water and food and the Sonoran desert near the border between the US and Mexico, leaving out food and water so that immigrants crossing over could find it, get it, get a little bit of sustenance and maybe not die from exposure in the desert. That's what they were doing. They left out food and water and this judge in this case decided to convict them and now those four volunteers for this group are facing up to six months in prison for doing nothing more than trying to make other people not die and now they're going to go to jail. There's actually five others that are currently awaiting trial, and if they're going before the same judge, you can pretty much guarantee that those five will also be going to prison for an undetermined amount of time.\n\nBut here's the thing, we have seen too many people die after being taken into custody. People crossing the border and I don't want to hear, well, they crossed illegally. They shouldn't do that. That doesn't matter. Does it? Does it really because that's a misdemeanor. I mean, you know, it's Jay walking essentially and we want them to just die in the desert. We want their kids to just die, drop dead before they can even be taken into custody or when they get taken into custody and then ignored by the guards. Ignored by the medical staff. Parents losing their children, children losing their parents. Is that who we are? The answer is yes it is. This is 100 percent who we are as a country now. This is what we do and it's disgusting. It's despicable in. It has to change and so far up to this point, we had seen the court system's working in favor of humanity against the harsh policies of the trump administration, but apparently those days might've been numbered because here we have four people whose only crime was trying to help other human beings get a little bit of water or get a little bit of food.\n\nMy question from this point forward is, what's next? You know what's next from here? If you stop with the panhandler on the sidewalk and give him a dollar, are you gonna? Go to jail now you're going to get arrested for that. If you hand them a sandwich, is that a felony or are you gonna go to jail for the next year of your life because you were trying to help a human being. Where do we draw the line? Is it only with immigrants or is it with anybody who needs help? You know, for, for people who like to claim that, oh, this is a Christian nation, even though it's not, we certainly don't act very Christian like dewey, you know? I'm pretty sure the overall takeaway from the Bible is be a good human being to other human beings and that's all these people with this no more deaths group we're trying to do. They were trying to help people. They were trying to prevent death and now they're on their way to prison for it because that's apparently what we do in the United States today."

Sometimes watching her do these linguistic gymnastics when answering your question is quite remarkable. Sure. We know she's lying and we know she's deflecting and trying to change the subject and go down a different path. But the way she does it, I mean, you got to admire it just a little bit. Take for example, what happened earlier this week when Kellyanne Conway was asked by the White House press corps, uh, about the status of trump's wall. The government shut down and all that they wanted to know about the wall and this is what Kellyanne Conway had to say.\n\nDo you have the poll? Do you have the poll question now? But I just want to see the question. The question was, is the wall or the government shut down? And so why would that be the question? Why is that a good question? I'm asking you why you're still saying, well, when the president has said, I'm asking why you and the polling questions respectfully are still saying, well, when the president said you can call it whatever you want, call it steel slab barriers called well, I was in the situation room when he said to, when he said to leader Schumer, minority leader Schumer that you can see that he has. That's a great slogan, builds a wall and crime will fall. We know that's true. Again, are we afraid of that? Right? He calls it wall seals, slot barrier, physical barrier, anything. In other words, we need a physical barrier that you can't crawl under.\n\nClimb over, drive through, or walk around. That's why I have doors in my house. I assume you do also and they actually have locks on them. In other words, it's. It's to protect the people and the inside and so I don't understand why it's so difficult to get beyond what you all want to make. We'll make was do you want to make a four letter word wall? When the president said to Chuck Schumer very specifically, and the president has said many times since publicly call it what you want to call it, but let's secure our border\n\nso it's not a wall except it is a wall and Donald Trump says don't call it a wall, but also trump says, call it whatever the hell you want to call it. But Kellyanne says, don't call it a wall. Call it a steel barrier. Steel slots, a border barrier. Uh, you know, an invisible fence who gives a shit what you call it. Just don't call it a wall, right? That's what she's telling us here. None of that even makes any sense because she does on multiple occasions in that little minute long diatribe contradicts herself with every other thing that she says like, this is different than this, which is different than this, which contradicts that. It's insanity. This woman has no idea what she is talking about. All she is trying to do is redirect the conversation to something else you want to ask me about policy, but I want to talk to you about semantics. That's what she did there, and now we're on the thing like where your home has doors. So why not a border wall? That's how desperate and stupid this administration has gotten. You have doors in your house, so why not have a border wall? Well, for starters, my house is my personal property."

Ted Cruz -- over the partial government shutdown on the Senate floor Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"These crocodile tears that the senator from Texas is crying for first responders are too hard for me to take,\" Bennet said, responding to remarks made by Cruz.\n\nBennet noted that he \"seldom\" takes the floor to contradict a member because of his efforts to work in a bipartisan manner.\n\nHowever, Bennet recalled when Cruz previously helped shut down the government. Cruz in 2013 notably worked to protest the Affordable Care Act, and in turn inspired votes that shut down the government for 16 days.\n\n\"When the senator from Texas shut this government down in 2013, my state was flooded.

Bernie Sanders is making another run for the White House.\n\n\n\nTwo sources with direct knowledge of his plans told Yahoo News that Sanders, an independent and self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d plans to announce his presidential bid imminently. While Sanders has been mulling a bid for months, one of the sources said he was emboldened by early polls of the race that have consistently showed him as one of the top candidates in a crowded Democratic primary field. In particular, the source said Sanders was heartened to see numbers indicating he is one of the leading candidates among African American and Latino voters, two groups he was perceived as struggling with in 2016.\n\n\n\nThe source also alluded to a spate of recent polls that show Sanders as the most popular politician in the country. They attributed Sanders\u2019 strength in the polls to the base and name recognition he built with the prior presidential bid.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the senator has this time that he didn\u2019t have last time is he is the most popular elected official in the country right now,\u201d the source said. \u201cThat\u2019s light years away from 2016 when very few people knew who he was.\u201d\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, Steve Bramucci\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, Steve Bramucci\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Mueller III, revealed on Friday the most direct link yet between the Trump campaign\u2019s and WikiLeaks\u2019 parallel efforts to use Democratic Party material stolen by Russians to damage the election campaign of Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nIn an indictment unsealed Friday, the special counsel disclosed evidence that a top campaign official in 2016 dispatched Roger J. Stone, a longtime adviser to President Trump, to get information from WikiLeaks about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails. The effort began well after it was widely reported that Russian intelligence operatives were behind the theft, which was part of Moscow\u2019s broad campaign to sabotage the 2016 president election.\n\n\n\nThe indictment makes no mention of whether Mr. Trump played a role in the coordination, though Mr. Mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached: A senior campaign official 'was directed' by an unnamed person to contact Mr. Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases that might damage the Clinton campaign, according to the court document.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, Nomi Prins, John Iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, Nomi Prins, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

    "text": "Published on Jan 25, 2019\n\nRichard Ojeda suspends his 2020 Presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n#Breaking #News #Politics\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nToday I want to thank from the bottom of my heart all the people who have supported and believed in this campaign. The indications were very positive from an overwhelming response to our videos, to thousands of volunteers, and a level of grassroots fundraising support that grew every day. However, the last thing I want to do is accept money from people who are struggling for a campaign that does not have the ability to compete. So today I am announcing that I am suspending this campaign.\n\n\n\nWhen I was a child my grade school teachers told us all that anyone in America could grow up and become President. I now realize that this is not the case. Unless someone has extreme wealth or holds influence and power it just isn\u2019t true. Especially if you dare to step out of line and challenge the powers that be. The big donors won\u2019t take your calls, the media won\u2019t say your name, and the establishment will do everything they can to crush you.\n\n\n\nI want you to know though that my fight does not end! I may not have the money to make the media pay attention but I will continue raising my voice and highlighting the issues the working class, the sick and the elderly face in this nation. I expect to have an announcement very soon about what my next steps will be. But know this, this campaign was never about me but about the issues we care about, checking big pharma, ending corruption and elevating the working class citizen. Nothing and no one can stop me from fighting for what\u2019s right. Sappers clear the way. Airborne all the way."

As many science-related agencies try to operate on skeleton staff \u2013 research is being disrupted, astronomy is suffering and scientific progress is grinding to a halt. Jayde Lovell gives the lowdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nScript\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen shutdown stories about the TSA employees working without pay, because TSA employees are the federal employees that most people actually see. Especially when they stop giving a sh-t and start blasting dirty Kanye and Drake tracks over the loudspeakers at JFK.\n\n\n\nBut the vast majority of employees copping it sweet because the shutdown aren\u2019t in border security - they\u2019re in science.\n\n\n\nScience organizations have been hit hardest by the shutdown -\n\n\n\nNASA has furloughed almost 90% of its staff.\n\nNOAA has given half of its workers the temporary boot\n\nSame for most of those on payroll at the U.S. Geological Survey\n\nOh, and all 19 Smithsonian museums are closed\n\n\n\nSure, \u201cessential\u201d science is still happening. USGS is still sending earthquakes alerts, and NOAA is still sending out weather forecasts \u2013 that said, they can\u2019t update the forecasting models of hurricanes and stuff like that \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t seem that could cause any major issues.\n\n\n\nBut right now, most U.S. science is as dead as this lab skeleton \u2013 part of the skeleton stuff that\u2019s now running the NIH.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s been so many tragic victims of this shutdown, but clearly, the most tragic is the loss of Panda Cam. Smithsonian scientists have turned off the live feed of the National Zoo, so right now, you cannot watch Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and Bei Bei being adorably ridiculous in real time!\n\n\n\nWhat am I paying my g-dd-m taxes for!?! Trump, you can take my tax return, but don\u2019t you dare take my panda cam.\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, shutting down pretty much all U.S. science has some pretty bl--dy serious effects. A lot of research is time sensitive, so if you don\u2019t capture that data now, the research will be lost forever.\n\n\n\nOnce we start paying TSA workers, they\u2019ll stop playing Kanye mixtapes, and we can go back to the standard clusterf-ckery of TSA line-ups \u2013 but it\u2019s not the same for scientists \u2013 we\u2019ll never be able to go back and get the time-sensitive data that they\u2019ve lost.\n\n\n\nFor example: California\u2019s seafood levels have been painstakingly monitored every winter for more than 70 years, so we know how to set fishing quota. But like last year\u2019s Fyre Festival, this year\u2019s California Fisheries seafood expedition was cancelled moments before liftoff. Why? Well, surprisingly, neither Ja Rule or unpaid salaries were to blame \u2013 it\u2019s because their bl--dy research ship is owned by the government, and the government is, well \u2013 you can guess the rest.\n\n\n\nLook, in all seriousness, this isn\u2019t just about my sushi. The world\u2019s longest running study of wolves has been going on continuously for more than 50 years \u2026 until now. Researchers want to do the work, but because the National Park Service is shut down, scientists can\u2019t actually get into the park, ya know, where the wolves live.\n\n\n\nBecause of Trump, this will be the first winter since 1958 that we haven\u2019t recorded information on the wolves. We will never know how many wolves there were in the winter of 2019. Never.\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just data here on earth being lost.\n\n\n\nAmerican Taxpayers like you paid about five billion bucks to build the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Now \u2013 it\u2019s basically floating space junk, because the people trained to operate the thing are based at the Smithsonian. And you remember what happened there!\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d4158...\n\nhttps://www.space.com/26612-nasa-chan...\n\nhttps://www.sfchronicle.com/science/a...\n\nhttps://eos.org/articles/federal-gove...\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/weathe...\n\nhttps://www.schumer.senate.gov/contac...\n\n\n\nFor more on science & the shutdown, check out Emily Atkin: https://newrepublic.com/article/15291...\n\n\n\nSCIQ ON TYT\n\nProduced by Jayde Lovell and Bec Susan Gill.

Chafuen, a lanky Argentine-American, had spent his adult life working to undermine left-wing social movements and governments in South and Central America, and boost a business-friendly version of libertarianism instead.\n\n\n\nIt was a lonely battle for decades, but not lately. Chafuen was among friends at the 2017 Latin America Liberty Forum. The international meeting of libertarian activists was sponsored by the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, a leadership-training nonprofit now known simply as the Atlas Network, which Chafuen has led since 1991. At the Brick Hotel, Chafuen was reveling in recent victories; his years of work were starting to pay off, thanks to political and economic circumstances \u2014 but also because of the network of activists Chafuen has been working for so long to cultivate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

It could also, however, put them at cross purposes with federal prosecutors, who have relied on Cohen as a witness and may want to restrict his public testimony.\n\n\n\nCohen\u2019s announcement Wednesday came in a statement by his spokesman, Lanny Davis. It said Cohen, who has been at the center of criminal investigations involving the president, was withdrawing from a Feb. 7 hearing of the House Oversight Committee over threats from Trump and the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudolph W.

Or so the latest round of polling on the president\u2019s handling of the government shutdown suggests.\n\n\n\nFifty-nine percent of voters disapprove of Trump\u2019s overall job performance in CBS News\u2019 latest survey, the highest that figure has been since the president took office. That finding is buttressed by a new Politico\u2013Morning Consult poll, which puts Trump\u2019s disapproval rating at 57 percent, the highest it has ever been in that pollster\u2019s research.\n\n\n\nNotably, these figures aren\u2019t drastically worse than the president\u2019s typical poll numbers. A majority of Americans disliked Trump on the day he was elected, and have continued to dislike him ever since. Nonetheless, even marginal declines in Trump\u2019s base of support would likely be enough to nullify his hopes of reelection, given how narrowly he eked out an Electoral College majority in 2016.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

One agent, speaking anonymously, said his unit had 'lost several sources who have worked for months, and years, to penetrate groups and target subjects' due to the inability to pay confidential sources. 'These assets cannot be replaced,' the agent said. 'Serving my country has always been a privilege, but it has never been so hard or thankless.'

It's there, shutdown at the Pelosi shutdown, the shuberts shut down. Whatever clever Hashtag he wants to tweet out that day, but the American public doesn't buy it. They understand that the fault lies with Trump and the Republican party. This is they're shut down. Not the Democrats. Poll after poll after poll at this point has shown that, but here's the thing. At this point of the government shutdown, it is no longer find enough just to say that it's Trump. Shut down. At this point, Mitch McConnell deserves at least half the blame for it. This has officially become mostly Mitch McConnell's. Shut down, and here's why. On at least three different occasions at this point, it may have already changed since I've sat here talking to you, but three times Mitch McConnell has refused to even bring to the floor a bill that would reopen the federal government without border wall funding.\n\nThree times Mitch McConnell had the chance to bring legislation to a vote that could have ended the shutdown and thrice he hath refused it. That's telling you something. You've got bipartisan support. Not overwhelmingly, but there are some Republicans in the house who were willing to say, we've got to reopen the government. Things have to keep working. We have very real problems. We can't even inspect our food right now. Air traffic controllers and TSA agents are being forced to work without getting paid for it. The governments facing massive law suits over that fact. We're losing money as an economy. Government workers are turning to food kitchens, taking on second jobs, trying to pay their bills right now and during this shut down, something has to change. At least a few Republicans in the house understand that they voted with Democrats on these bills to reopen it, and I guarantee you if we had them in the Senate and they weren't being blocked by Mitch McConnell, we'd see Republicans jumped ship and vote to reopen, but Mitch McConnell won't do it.\n\nEven in spite of the fact than last week. Federal workers, furloughed federal workers showed up at his office in Kentucky protesting, demanding that he at least let these bills come to a vote, the manning, that he just reopened the government and deal with the border wall situation later, or preferably not at all because the majority of people don't even want it, but he wouldn't do it. Mitch McConnell is up for reelection in 20 slash 20. By the way, Mitch McConnell has been serving in the Senate for 34 years. Thirty four years. This man is more powerful than Donald Trump. He has more sway. He has more pull. He has more authority at this point and there's no better case for term limits for senators than Mitch McConnell himself. Thirty four years, he has been serving in that chamber for himself and that's what his constituents were trying to tell us last week."

Instead of paying an extra five or $10 for one thing, they could have spent that five or $10 on a second thing. I know that seems crazy and it seems a little too simple, but that is how the economy works.\n\n\n\nThe more you spend on one good, the less you have to spend on a second or third good. That is basic economics. One hundred one right there folks, but somebody never took that course and I am assuming that, that somebody happens to be sitting in the White House right now unless he's out playing golf. But here's the thing, Trump is tanking our economy. Trump has intentionally and repeatedly sabotaged economic growth and economic development here in the United States since becoming the president. And these trade wars are about the worst economic sabotage that we have seen coming from this administration. We know now as a public and we, most of us knew at the time the Republican tax cuts, they're not benefiting us. You know, you've got millionaires and billionaires saving millions of dollars every year. The rest of us lucky to get 50 to 100 bucks a month off these tax cuts that just went into effect for the bottom tax brackets starting at the start of this year.\n\n\n\nUm, that's not much. It helps a little, but it's not enough to spur on economic growth. And more importantly, that trickled down, you told us was going to happen, didn't happen. So we got screwed out of a decent tax cut and now we're getting screwed out of more money because of the duties that we now have to pay on these foreign goods coming in because of Donald Trump's tariffs. That's what's happening in the United States today. Donald Trump has not made a single economic decision that has benefited American consumers. Not One. He hasn't even made a lot of economic decisions that have even benefited the wealthy elite other than the tax cut. We're all kind of suffering from this because believe it or not, even the wealthy or having to pay more they can it. They don't notice the money's gone, but we do. We're the ones who are suffering from this.\n\n\n\nAnd the worst part is much like George W dot Bush with Iraq. Uh, Donald Trump has no exit strategy for his trade war. There are no actual talks going on between him in China. They have said this, so no matter what he tweets that all talks are going good. We're going to figure this out. No, you're not. No, you're not. You got to send to a situation. You backed yourself into it, you don't know how to get out of it, and we're the ones who are quite literally paying the price for it and that price just so happens to be $13,000,000,000 in the span of eight short months."

    "text": "Published on Jan 20, 2019\n\nFINALLY. John Iadarola, Mark Thompson, and Brooke Thomas, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/...\n\n\n\n\"On Wednesday, a coalition of congressional Democrats introduced legislation that would raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour by 2024.\n\n\n\n'Just a few short years ago, we were told that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour was \u2018radical,\u2019' Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who sponsored the legislation in the Senate, said in a statement. 'But a grassroots movement of millions of workers throughout this country refused to take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer.' He added, 'The current $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage.'\n\n\n\nFor the past two years, Sanders has introduced similar versions of the bill to raise the federal floor to $15. But this time, the legislation is bolstered by steadily increasing public support and the work of groups like Fight for Fifteen that have helped raise the minimum wage in cities and states across the country. While the bill has a good chance of passage in the Democrat-controlled House, it faces an uphill battle to get through the Republican-led Senate and off the president\u2019s desk. (In November, top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow called a federal minimum wage 'a terrible idea.')\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: John Iadarola, Mark Thompson, Brooke Thomas\n\n\n\nCast: John Iadarola, Mark Thompson, Brooke Thomas\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Executives attributed much of that to growing ad revenues, with video ad dollars more that doubling year-over-year.\n\n\u201cThe Roku Channel is super important,\u201d said Roku CEO Anthony Wood in an interview with Variety following the company\u2019s earnings report. \u201cA material percentage of our advertising now flows through the Roku Channel.\u201d\n\nWood added that the company had plans to add more content to the channel over time. \u201cThere is a huge amount of library content around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cFree content is a big opportunity.\u201d\n\nOther publishers added in this week\u2019s update include People Are Awesome, the Pet Collective, esports-centric Wham network and Stadium, a sports publisher that is bringing five daily shows as well as select live games and other sports content to the channel."

But memories of many Americans\u2019 Mexican heritage have been lost in the haze of history.\n\n\n\nTo persuade more U.S. residents to visit Mexico, AeroMexico has launched a creative ad campaign, which has already gone viral, that offers \u201cDNA discounts\u201d on the airline for Americans with Mexican heritage.

    "text": "Published on Jan 18, 2019\n\nR. Kelly\u2019s record label has officially dropped him and his manager has turned himself into police. Brett Erlich, Mark Thompson, and Helen Hong, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/r-k...\n\n\n\n\u201cSony Music has decided to dissolve its working relationship with R. Kelly, Variety has learned.\n\n\n\nNo external announcement of the move is planned in the immediate future, says a source, who added that the company took its time to wade through the issues \u201cresponsibly\u201d and avoid legal ramifications. R. Kelly was removed from the RCA Records website, which lists the label\u2019s signed artists, shortly after 10 a.m. PT on Friday, Jan. 18.\n\n\n\nKelly\u2019s back catalog will remain with RCA/Sony. Kelly\u2019s last release with the label was a Christmas-themed album in 2016, although he has released several songs independently since that time, presumably with Sony\u2019s consent, and Tweeted earlier this year that he has a new album on the way.\n\n\n\nContacted by Variety, reps for both RCA Records and its parent company, Sony Music, declined comment. His current adviser, Don Russell, told Rolling Stone that several record labels are \u201cvery interested\u201d in working with Kelly. \u201cWe understand RCA\u2019s position: they have to remain transparent for the sake of the other artists that they represent and generate wealth for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not in the position of dealing with the kind of stuff that has come about with R. Kelly. He has no issue with RCA. I think he\u2019s outgrown RCA. He\u2019s ready for the next level of life, anyway.\u201d TV journalist Jawn Murray tells Variety that he learned from a Sony Music source that Kelly was informed of the label\u2019s decision to part ways with him last Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nHosts: Brett Erlich, Mark Thompson, Helen Hong\n\n\n\nCast: Brett Erlich, Mark Thompson, Helen Hong\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

    "text": "Will TSA end the shutdown?\n\nWith help from Tanya Snyder and Stephanie Beasley\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This edition of Morning Transportation is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Transportation subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro\u2019s comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPROGRAMMING NOTE: Morning Transportation will not publish on Monday, Jan. 21. Our next newsletter will publish on Tuesday, Jan. 22.\n\nQUICK FIX\n\n\u2014 The shutdown enters Day 28. TSA and FAA are still working to manage the impact on their workforces as the deadlock drags on with no resolution in sight.\n\n\u2014 Developers of the Gateway project want the Trump administration to put new permitting guidelines to work in a way that could expedite an approval for the project, which has been stalled by the shutdown.\n\n\u2014 Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate announced their transportation subcommittee leaders, tapping experienced legislators to lead the minority parties on their respective committees. The Pro Transpo team tracked down a few new members and subcommittee leaders to ask about their priorities for the year.\n\nIT\u2019S FRIDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports. Get in touch with tips, feedback and song lyric suggestions at smintz@politico.com or @samjmintz.\n\n\u201cEast bound and down, loaded up and truckin' / We gonna do what they say can't be done / We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there / I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run.\u201d (h/t Matt Barron)\n\nLISTEN HERE: Follow MT\u2019s playlist on Spotify. What better way to start your day than with songs (picked by us and readers) about roads, rails, rivers and runways?\n\nSHUTDOWN WATCH\n\nTSA PRESSURE POINT: Our Stephanie Beasley has an update on the situation at TSA, which is facing a new test of its stretched staff with a long weekend looming. \u201cAs the shutdown continues with no end in sight, some lawmakers have begun to suggest an unlikely savior in the form of TSA, whose baggage screeners, forced to work without pay, have begun to quit. Will public pressure over ballooning airport security lines force regulators to come to a deal?\u201d Stephanie writes. Worry about the agency\u2019s workforce is bipartisan, even if the two parties don\u2019t agree on who's to blame for the shutdown. \"I think TSA is an important agency, and they know it,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.).\n\nTHE DREADED REPLY-ALL: Over at FAA, which is also dealing with tens of thousands of unpaid workers, officials are keeping an eye on what employees say. The left-leaning news outlet The Young Turks reported that FAA leaders wrote to staff earlier this month to remind them about agency guidelines and federal law surrounding public speech, during the \u201cchallenging\u201d time of uncertainty that \u201cmay inspire opinions some want to share publicly.\u201d Reporter Ken Klippenstein also got ahold of a reply-all from one employee, which went out to thousands of FAA staff: \u201cIsn\u2019t there also guidance about getting paid to work and forcing folks to work without pay being illegal?\u201d\n\nDRONE ZONE: In another corner of the aviation world, there's growing concern about the shutdown's effect on the drone industry, with rulemakings delayed and pilot registrations and operational waivers backlogged. \u201cFor every day that goes by that people aren\u2019t able to get the daily work of the government done, it\u2019s gonna take more time for them to dig out,\u201d Joshua Ziering, founder of drone operations and management company KittyHawk, told our Brianna Gurciullo. The lapse in appropriations has also limited the FAA in implementing its five-year reauthorization passed by Congress late last year, including new requirements for drone hobbyists.\n\nSPEED UP THE PROCESS: The chief backer of the Gateway project will try to get around a shutdown delay by using the new One Federal Decision permitting guidelines that the Trump administration has pushed, our Tanya Snyder reports. The Gateway Program Development Corporation wants DOT to apply FRA\u2019s approval of the project\u2019s environmental impact statement to FTA, which is largely shuttered. \u201cFRA finished its review and forwarded the Gateway EIS to FTA Dec. 10, less than two weeks before the shutdown began,\u201d Tanya writes. Jerry Zaro, the group's chairman, is sending a letter laying out the request to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao today.\n\nA SIDE GIG FOR CHAO: President Donald Trump tapped her to co-chair the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\nIN CONGRESS\n\nNEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS: House Transportation ranking member Sam Graves (R-Mo.) announced his subcommittee leaders Thursday, which includes some surprises. Rodney Davis (Ill.) will be the top Republican on the Highways and Transit Subcommittee. Rick Crawford (Ark.) will be ranking member of the railroads subpanel. Mark Meadows (N.C.), a staunch Trump ally, will lead the Economic Development and Emergency Management Subcommittee \u2014 making him the Republican point-person on the fight over the GSA\u2019s role in overseeing Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel lease.\n\nFrom my cold, dead hands: Garret Graves (La.), who will be ranking member on the Aviation Subcommittee, didn\u2019t give up his Water Resources gavel lightly. \u201cThere is nothing you could do to pry that out of my hands, in terms of being a space where I want to continue working,\u201d he told POLITICO Thursday. But seeing that Sam Graves was moving around \u201cchess pieces,\u201d Garret Graves said he made an offer: \u201cI said, \u2018Look, I love Water, that\u2019s where I want to be, but if there\u2019s something that makes more sense to you based on what you\u2019re doing and your vision, I\u2019m happy to play whatever role.\u2019\"\n\nThe money quote: \u201cWith the [Army] Corps of Engineers, we\u2019re probably 50 years behind where we need to be,\u201d Garret Graves said. \u201cWith aviation, I think we actually have an opportunity to be ahead of where we need to be.\u201d\n\nNEW TRANSPORTATION MEMBERS SPEAK OUT: Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (D-Texas), who ousted Republican John Culberson in November, said she \u201creally advocated\u201d for a seat on the committee, as Houston is a hub for virtually every mode of transportation and, having been hit hard by three 500-year floods in the three years, understands disaster recovery and FEMA better than just about anyone. She wants to focus on \u201crebuilding communities like mine to be more resilient\u201d and said her constituents \u201chave had experiences with FEMA that I think we all should learn from.\u201d\n\nPence in the House: MT caught up with another new committee member, Rep. Greg Pence (R-Ind.), a freshman who also happens to be the vice president\u2019s brother, for a brief hallway interview. \u201cTransportation\u2019s very important to the state of Indiana, we\u2019re the crossroads of America,\u201d he said.\n\nHighway widening on the menu: Freshman Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) noted that her state \u201chas some safety issues with our bridges,\u201d undoubtedly referring to the I-35 bridge collapse in 2017. On her list of projects: highway widening and better bridge access to the Twin Cities, and she wants to \u201cbring in that private sector investment\u201d to make it happen.\n\nIN THE SENATE: Commerce Committee Democrats also named their subcommittee ranking members Thursday: Tammy Duckworth (Ill.) will lead the minority on the reconstituted aviation and space subcommittee; Gary Peters (Mich.) will be ranking member of the transportation and safety subcommittee; and Ed Markey (Mass.) will be ranking member on the new security subpanel.\n\nSecurity\n\nTIGHTEN UP: TSA needs to improve its reporting on security-related technology acquisitions certifying the benefits of the equipment, according to a GAO report released Thursday. TSA anticipates spending \u201ca significant portion\u201d of its $3.6 billion acquisition budget on bag and passenger screening technologies, GAO noted along with its recommended changes.\n\nTHE AUTOBAHN\n\n\u2014 \u201cDriverless cars tap the brakes after years of hype.\u201d Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u2014 \u201cJudge extends block of congestion pricing plan through Jan. 31.\u201d CBS New York.\n\n\u2014 \u201cGov.

    "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has warned its employees regarding \u201crestrictions on partisan political activity,\u201d an internal FAA email obtained by TYT reveals.\n\n\u201cEmployees are responsible for acquainting themselves with restrictions on partisan political activity and for not engaging in prohibited actions,\u201d the email states. \u201cIt is important to ensure that remarks made in any forum regardless if made in connection with work or by a person identified as an FAA employee, comport with governing rules and regulations.\u201d\n\nThe email was sent on January 9 by an FAA administrator, according to an FAA contractor who requested anonymity in order to avoid retribution. The subject line reads, \u201cInternal Management Guidance Re: Expression of Views Reminder.\u201d\n\nAt the time of this writing, the government shutdown is on its fourth week, representing the longest in U.S. history. President Trump has threatened to maintain the shutdown for \u201cmonths or even years\u201d if he does not obtain $5.6 billion for his southern border wall. He has also asserted that federal workers actually like the shutdown, despite its having left some 800,000 without pay.\n\nIn a separate email, another FAA administrator references the guidelines, saying, \u201cPlease be mindful of this guidance to avoid any unnecessary scrutiny.\u201d This was a veiled threat to employees that they would be scrutinized for speaking out, TYT\u2019s source said.\n\n\u201cThese people are not allowed to speak out. They are expected to work without pay, though,\u201d the source said.\n\nIn response to the previous FAA email, one disgruntled FAA employee replied sarcastically, \u201cIsn\u2019t there also guidance about getting paid to work and forcing folks to work without pay being illegal?\u201d The response took the form of a reply-all email, also obtained by TYT, and went out to thousands of FAA employees, the source said."

She knew the names of many workers and their kids, always sharing smiles and small talk.\n\n\n\nWith a teenager and 8-month-old at home, recent months had been an exhausting blitz for Tate. That morning, she told some of the other kitchen workers she had a headache and felt weak. She figured it was because of a new medication for her back pain.\n\n\n\nShortly after 8 a.m., as Tate and a group of workers came off a break, she felt worse. Tate asked for a piece of bread with honey. A co-worker hustled to get it. She returned to find Tate leaning against a counter, supporting herself with one hand. The left side of Tate\u2019s face drooped; she was slurring her words.\u201d\n\n\n\nHosts: Ana Kasparian, Jayar Jackson, Mark Thompson\n\n\n\nCast: Ana Kasparian, Jayar Jackson, Mark Thompson\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

    "text": "Roku\u2019s ad-supported free streaming channel is expanding. No, not to more platforms \u2014 it already did that. But rather, it\u2019s expanding its content lineup. While before the channel offered free-to-stream movies and news, it will now feature live and linear sports and entertainment content, the company says.\n\nAs of earlier this year, The Roku Channel added live news from ABC News, Cheddar, Newsmax, Newsy, People TV, Yahoo and, most recently, The Young Turks, from the TYT Network.\n\nIt will now add entertainment content from partners including TMZ, AFV, FailArmy, People Are Awesome, Pet Collective and more. As with the channel\u2019s other offerings, none of these streams will require a subscription.\n\nMeanwhile, the channel will also begin to stream live sporting events from the Adventure Sports Network, COMBT GO, EDGEsport, Stadium and Wham Network, among others.\n\nThe additions come on the heels of Roku\u2019s Q3 earnings, which saw the company beat Wall Street expectations on hardware, but saw platform revenue falling short \u2014 causing the stock to drop.\n\nThe company has been trying to move beyond being only a hardware device maker selling TVs and streaming players, to grow its platform business and advertising revenues. A key part of that strategy is The Roku Channel, which opens up Roku\u2019s platform to a wider audience, and allows the company to sell ads against content.\n\nThe plan may work in the long run, but it\u2019s taking time to ramp up, it seems.\n\nHowever, Roku did report a growing user base with 23.8 million active users, streaming 6.2 billion hours in the quarter. That was ahead of expectations of 23.1 million users and 5.8 billion hours."

    "title": "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 William Arkin and the US media's 'Trump circus' | The Listening Post (Lead)",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Published on Jan 14, 2019\n\nWhen William Arkin, a veteran national security reporter with NBC news and MSNBC, wrote his resignation email last week, he shared it with his colleagues. It was then leaked to other news outlets.\n\n\n\nAmong Arkin's criticisms of his former employer and other mainstream media outlets: that by incessantly covering the presidency of Donald Trump, the network is being held hostage by Trump; that in its reflexively anti-Trump coverage, it has become even more pro-military; that NBC and MSNBC are now captives of the security state.\n\n\n\nAmong Arkin's criticisms of his former employer and other mainstream news outlets in the US is that it's become pro-military and suffers from the perils of 'Trump Derangement Syndrome', which is the impulse to oppose any and all the president's policies, regardless of their merit.\n\n\n\n\"Everything's just so anti-Trump, there's no conversation about whether or not these are actually positions that have merit,\" points out Anoa Changa, host of The Way with Anoa. \"There is no conversation about whether or not we should have even gone into Syria whether or not it's even legal. We don't see like actual coverage of what's happening except for to condemn the president for not wanting to be there.\"\n\n\n\nColumnist Eric Alterman believes that \"everything about Bill Arkin's critique with regard to the mainstream media's treatment of Donald Trump is false. The idea that they are anti-Trump. Well, no. They are in the business of telling the truth and Trump is in the business of lies. In the past month alone, according to The Washington Post, he has told an average of 15 lies a day.\"\n\n\n\nLike all three US 24-hour news channels, MSNBC hires ex-military and intelligence figures, many of them now employed by the defence and security industries. The networks call them 'analysts', which is misleading because many of them are advocates.\n\n\n\nAccording to Arkin, the preponderance of those voices and how much airtime they are given on stories such as Trump's recent decision to pull out of the Syrian conflict, are evidence that US news networks have become captives of the security state.\n\n\n\nIn his early days on television, many commentators \"were from the academic world,\" explains Arkin. \"There were others who were activists. Now, all we hear are retired generals and admirals and high-level government officials ... And all we hear is a kind of partisan analysis of how bad Trump is because he's breaking with past administration policy or whatever. The American public suffers.\"\n\n\n\nCenk Uygur, creator and host of The Young Turks, says \"The corporate media is massively pro-war. So when you combine those two forces of being against Donald Trump and pro-war when he announces withdrawal they hate it and they fight him with a passion that you haven't seen in a long time.\"\n\n\n\nMSNBC can live with the criticism and just point to the ratings, which show a clear appetite for anti-Trump TV. Viewers clearly don't mind the pro-war bias and happily take in political talking points from former Trump officials who have left the administration.\n\n\n\nLast month, for the first time in 17 years, MSNBC won the ratings war with Fox, attracting more viewers in the key demographic that advertisers want.\n\n\n\nContributors\n\n\n\nEric Alterman - Columnist, The Nation\n\nWilliam Arkin - Former defence reporter, NBC News\n\nAnoa Changa - Host, The Way with Anoa\n\nAaron Mate - Journalist\n\nCenk Uygur - Creator & host, The Young Turks\n\n\n\n\n\n- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe\n\n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n\n- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n\n- Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/"

Kirsten Gillibrand entered the 2020 presidential race on Tuesday, telling Stephen Colbert that she was forming an exploratory committee just days before she heads to the critical state of Iowa.\n\n\n\n'I am filing an exploratory committee for president of the United States tonight,' the New York Democrat said, adding that she is 'going to run for president of the United States because as young mom I am going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I will fight for my own, which is why I believe health care should be a right, not a privilege. It is why I believe we should have better public schools for our kids because it shouldn't matter what block you grow up on. And I believe anybody who wants to work hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way into the middle class.'\n\n\n\nGillibrand, who was elected for her second full term in the Senate in 2018, rose to national prominence in recent years as a forceful proponent of the #MeToo movement and fierce critic of President Donald Trump. People close to Gillibrand have indicated the senator will run a campaign centered on gender issues, something she has championed in the House and Senate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down. https://go.tyt.com/h5flGHn2bMA\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us...\n\n\n\n\"Agents and senior F.B.I. officials had grown suspicious of Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign but held off on opening an investigation into him, the people said, in part because they were uncertain how to proceed with an inquiry of such sensitivity and magnitude. But the president\u2019s activities before and after Mr. Comey\u2019s firing in May 2017, particularly two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the Comey dismissal to the Russia investigation, helped prompt the counterintelligence aspect of the inquiry, the people said.\n\n\n\nThe special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, took over the inquiry into Mr. Trump when he was appointed, days after F.B.I. officials opened it. That inquiry is part of Mr. Mueller\u2019s broader examination of how Russian operatives interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Trump associates conspired with them. It is unclear whether Mr. Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter, and some former law enforcement officials outside the investigation have questioned whether agents overstepped in opening it.\n\n\n\nThe criminal and counterintelligence elements were coupled together into one investigation, former law enforcement officials said in interviews in recent weeks, because if Mr. Trump had ousted the head of the F.B.I. to impede or even end the Russia investigation, that was both a possible crime and a national security concern. The F.B.I.\u2019s counterintelligence division handles national security matters.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Counterintelligence investigators had to consider whether the president\u2019s own actions constituted a possible threat to national security. Agents also sought to determine whether Mr. Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unwittingly fallen under Moscow\u2019s influence.\n\n\n\nThe investigation the F.B.I. opened into Mr. Trump also had a criminal aspect, which has long been publicly known: whether his firing of Mr. Comey constituted obstruction of justice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

    "text": "Published on Jan 13, 2019\n\nAround 1.4 MILLION people can now register to vote in Florida. Ana Kasparian and John Iadarola, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://theintercept.com/2019/01/08/f...\n\n\n\n\"More than 1 million Florida residents will become eligible to vote on Tuesday as the newly amended state constitution restores voting rights to most of its previously disenfranchised felons. That\u2019s the largest number of people to gain access to the ballot all at once since American women won the right to vote in 1920.\n\n\n\nLast November, Florida residents voted in favor of an amendment to the state constitution, known as Amendment 4, that restores voting rights to roughly 1.4 million felons in the state who have completed their sentences. (Individuals convicted of murder or sex offenses were excluded from the amendment.) But while the measure was approved by nearly 65 percent of the state\u2019s voters, some Republicans \u2014 including Gov.-elect Ron DeSantis \u2014 have sought to sow confusion about its immediate validity.\n\n\n\nDeSantis, who opposed the amendment during the campaign, indicated that its implementation would be delayed until lawmakers can write it into law during the next legislative session. 'They\u2019re going to be able to do that in March,' he told the Palm Beach Post. Some local elections in Florida are scheduled for as early as February, before the next legislature meets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Ana Kasparian and John Iadarola, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/busine...\n\n\n\n\"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) will unveil legislation Wednesday mandating two weeks of paid time off for workers in the city, a move that would guarantee paid time off for an additional 500,000 people.\n\n\n\nThe proposal, which would have to win approval from the City Council, would make New York a pioneer in labor law. No U.S. city or state requires paid time off for workers, while Puerto Rico does require employers to pay for time off. The law would exempt firms with fewer than five employees from the requirement.\n\n\n\nAt least 20 countries \u2014 including New Zealand, Ireland and Greece \u2014 mandate at least 10 days of paid vacation, making the United States an outlier in not offering these benefits. Several states and cities have adopted mandatory paid sick leave since 2011 but not paid vacation.\n\n\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s push comes one day after he announced an initiative to guarantee health care for all city residents, including undocumented immigrants, pledging $100 million and a commitment to extend health insurance to an additional 600,000 New York residents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Henry Cuellar, a seven-term congressman from a strongly Democratic district who\u2019s one of the few anti-abortion-rights voices in the party\u2019s House conference.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the group compared Texas\u2019s 28th Congressional District, which gave the president just 38.5 percent of the vote in 2016, to other districts where left-leaning candidates have unseated incumbents. It is launching a 'primary Cuellar fund' to encourage any potential candidate that there will be resources if he or she jumps into the race.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Michael Shure\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Michael Shure\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Others simultaneously warn Ocasio-Cortez is destined for a lonely, ineffectual career in Congress if she continues to treat her own party as the enemy.\n\n\n\n'I\u2019m sure Ms. Cortez means well, but there\u2019s almost an outstanding rule: Don\u2019t attack your own people,' said Rep.

    "text": "Ed. note: After this article was published, a Fellowship spokesperson notified us that the Fellowship is preparing a response. In the event of a response, this article will be updated.\n\nA Christian charity with ties to the National Prayer Breakfast reported unspecified expenses associated with having Russian guests attend the event in 2017 and possibly other years, federal tax documents show.\n\nThe guests may have included people picked by convicted Russian agent Maria Butina as part of a plan to create back-channel connections with U.S. policy-makers, many of whom attend the breakfast. One leader of the charity appears to match details the FBI has given about an unnamed breakfast organizer who aided Butina.\n\nIn her plea agreement, Butina admitted to acting as an agent of the Russian government without registering with the Justice Department.\n\nThe FBI says that Butina and her handler \u2014 widely reported to be Alexander Torshin, a Russian official said to be close to President Vladimir Putin \u2014 attended the breakfast to influence U.S politics. The tax records reviewed by TYT represent the first indication they may have received direct financial support in their efforts.\n\n\u201c[I]n furtherance of the conspiracy,\u201d Butina\u2019s plea deal says, \u201cButina helped [Torshin] organize a Russian delegation to the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast\u2026 [Torshin] directed Butina to include certain people.\u201d\n\nButina wrote in 2015 that the best way to influence U.S. policy toward Russia was not through official channels. \u201cAs an alternative,\u201d her plea deal says, \u201cButina suggested that Russia could use unofficial channels of communication to the same end.\u201d\n\nThe National Prayer Breakfast, an annual ritual for Washington\u2019s elite, was targeted by the two Russians to build those channels, according to the FBI. For decades the event has drawn every president from each party, as well as top members of Congress. In 2003, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) called the breakfast\u2019s patriarch, Doug Coe, \u201ca genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide to anyone, regardless of party or faith.\u201d\n\nThe breakfast is run by the Fellowship Foundation, sometimes known as The Family, a secretive Christian group led by Coe for decades before his death in 2017.\n\nEvery year, the breakfast is co-chaired by one member from each party. This year\u2019s, on Feb. 7, is being co-chaired by Sens. Chris Coons (D-DE) and James Lankford (R-OK). Coons co-chaired the 2017 breakfast with Sen. John Boozman (R-AR).\n\nA July 2018 FBI affidavit said that an unnamed organizer of the breakfast helped Butina and Torshin get Russian guests into the breakfast.\n\nIn addition, federal tax filings show that a Seattle nonprofit called Leadership Development Seminars (LDS) reported expenses connected to guests from Russia and other former Soviet bloc nations attending the breakfast from at least 2014 through 2017, the most recent year for which tax records are available.\n\nLDS \u2014 which says it is dedicated to leadership focused on Jesus \u2014 has strong ties to the Fellowship Foundation, including personnel, cooperation on the breakfast, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding.\n\nMost notably, Doug Burleigh has been a leader at both the Fellowship and at Leadership Development Seminars. Tax forms indicate he served as LDS\u2019s executive director from at least 1999 through 2012. Since then, state filings list Burleigh as one of LDS\u2019s three highest-paid employees. Burleigh also appears in LDS videos and speaks at their events.\n\nBurleigh\u2019s connections to the Fellowship include family ties: He is Coe\u2019s son-in-law. And Burleigh was provided housing valued at $15,000 by the Fellowship as recently as 2016, tax forms show.\n\nAs a central figure at the breakfast, Burleigh has already been the subject of speculation about the unnamed organizer who helped Butina. Burleigh himself appeared to confirm details of the FBI affidavit to the Christian news outlet, WORLD Magazine, last summer.\n\nThe affidavit says that, \u201cThe organizer of the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast promised BUTINA he would provide ten seats at the 2017 event.\u201d\n\nAccording to WORLD Magazine, Burleigh described a virtually identical exchange in person with Butina and Torshin:\n\nBurleigh recalled talking about plans for the 2017 breakfast with Torshin over dinner, with Butina translating for Torshin (Burleigh said Torshin doesn\u2019t speak English). Burleigh asked whom Torshin would bring if he had 10 invites, and Torshin said he would bring top Russian leaders. Torshin got the 10 spots\u2026\n\nIn an email about Russian guests for the 2017 breakfast, Butina wrote, \u201cPeople in the list are handpicked by [Torshin] and me and are VERY influential in Russia. They are coming to establish a back channel of communication.\u201d\n\nExpenses listed in Leadership Development Seminars\u2019 2017 tax returns include one line for $421,644. Those expenses, the form says, included, \u201cWork in the former Soviet Union: We had 65 people from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan attend the National Prayer Breakfast in early February.\u201d"

The long-run fiscal, nonsustainability of the U.S. federal government isn\u2019t really something that plays into the medium term that is relevant for our policy decisions.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, \u201cit\u2019s a long-run issue that we definitely need to face, and ultimately, will have no choice but to face,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nThe Fed chief\u2019s comments came as the annual U.S. deficit reaches new sustained highs above $1 trillion, a fact many economists worry could spell trouble for future generations. Annual deficits have topped $1 trillion before, but never during a time of sustained economic growth like now, raising concern about what would happen if a recession hits.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Ana Kasparian, Nomi Prins, Maytha Alhassen\n\n\n\nCast: Ana Kasparian, Nomi Prins, Maytha Alhassen\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Ana Kasparian and John Iadarola, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://splinternews.com/finally-some...\n\n\n\n\"Between President Trump struggling to read his racist bile off the teleprompter in the Oval Office and a stultifying 'rebuttal' by our leading Democratic crypt keepers, Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, you would think that being past retirement age with brain fluid slowly leaking out of your ears is a requirement for public office.\n\n\n\nSchumer and Pelosi may be on the right side, but their speech was perfunctory at absolute best, and harmful at worst. Schumer even admitted that the Democrats agree with Trump on the need for 'stronger border security.' Their total lack of energy, along with their stern expressions and the comically small podium, looked depressingly like a political movement in decline. Over on Facebook, even the often riled-up Sen. Bernie Sanders looked and sounded exhausted.\n\n\n\nThankfully, someone in our government is still a living, breathing human being. Yes, we\u2019re talking about the dancing menace, the nightmare of GOP tweeters, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who tore down Trump\u2019s fear-mongering over the invented 'border crisis' in her first appearance on Rachel Maddow\u2019s MSNBC show, bringing desperately-needed charisma to the fight over the government shutdown and border wall funding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

No surprise here. The idea of deregulation has this going on every day. The latest is they want to see how they can pack in more people into one and you know, into an air airplane, make it as uncomfortable while they're raising prices. The other thing you see is that when you're on the phone with them and you're saying, or you're online and you're saying, I want to buy a ticket from here to San Francisco, and if you wait five minutes, that goes up $200. What they're doing is they're seeing that you're online wanting to buy that ticket. You understand what I'm saying? Now the words they they see, okay, we see activity and because of that activity went to raise prices and it literally sometimes as you're going to buy the ticket itself and as you're trying to buy the ticket, the price is jumping up because it is, as you might imagine, a deregulation scam.\n\n\n\nSo now they're caught. You know, now they're caught, but there's nothing going to change that they're making more money than they've ever made in this business because of deregulation. That means deregulation in America is do what ever you want to to consumers because they can't sue you because of arbitration. You'd have to go one at a time. I want my $200 back. I want my $300 back in to do that for an arbitration, you're going to spend about $10,000 to get your $200 back. So isn't that where we are right now with the airline deregulation? It really is. And when you look at this suit, because it's both an antitrust and a, you know, kind of collusion to, to raise the prices. It's because there are so few airlines left in this country that once they get together and start saying, okay, you know, we're going to eliminate this flight, which is kind of what this law says.\n\n\n\nWe're going to eliminate this flight from Houston to Phoenix. Not gonna have that. So that's going to be an exclusive Delta thing. Delta can then jack up the prices on that. And then Delta in exchange was and say we're not going to do this when, so there are so few that it became one airline basically is what this lawsuit alleges. And now American Airlines says they're cooperating with the investigators and they're going to start turning over the dirt on what Delta and United did as well. And Southwest airlines had already settled their part of this because they were involved too. I think they were $28 million and then American is 45 pennies compared to what they have $28 million and $45 million is cost of doing business. Okay. That's no hit to them at all. But what's important about these lawsuits is your once discovery takes place, once you get into the files, once you have, especially private lawyers.\n\n\n\nI mean if you're counting on the government lawyers to solve this problem, forget it. If your counting on the Department of Justice to go in there and solve it, it'll never happen. But once you have private industry getting involved, private lawyers saying, you know, this is pretty good class action. I think we can do something with this. Once you get there, that's when you start seeing all of the dirty laundry coming out. That's they start taking depositions and then they find out about this scam and then that scam. And then the next scam. There are so many of these stories coming out about airlines right now. I, it's just almost, it's almost a monthly. There's some new thing and, and really the latest thing is, and I, I got to do this just for the fun of it, just to see what I'm talking about. Go online and say I want to buy a ticket between Florida and San Francisco."

It\u2019s not a bill to open the government. Instead, according to multiple sources involved in the legislative process, S.1 will be a compendium containing a handful of foreign policy-related measures, the main one of which is a provision \u2014 with Florida\u2019s GOP Sen. Marco Rubio as a lead sponsor \u2014 to defend the Israeli government. The bill is a top legislative priority for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Ana Kasparian, Adrienne Lawrence, Jayar Jackson\n\n\n\nCast: Ana Kasparian, Adrienne Lawrence, Jayar Jackson\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Cenk Uygur, Mona Shaikh, Jayar Jackson, and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politi...\n\n\n\n\"A former kitchen employee at one of President Trump\u2019s golf clubs in New Jersey said her superiors kept her name and those of other undocumented workers off a list of people to be vetted by the Secret Service before a Trump visit to the club in 2016.\n\n\n\nEmma Torres, 43, an immigrant from Ecuador, said that she informed a human resources official at the club that she did not have papers to live legally in the United States when she was asked to submit her information for a clearance check. She said the names of undocumented workers were then excised from a list turned over to the Secret Service.\n\n\n\nTorres could not recall the name of the person who modified the list or the exact date of the incident. But she said she continued in her job at the club and was later working in the kitchen when Trump visited the club under Secret Service protection.\n\n\n\nTorres\u2019s account, first reported by the New York Times, suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.\n\n\n\nTrump Organization officials and White House officials declined to comment.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, Mona Shaikh, Jayar Jackson\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, Mona Shaikh, Jayar Jackson\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Indeed, the whole idea of offsetting the budgetary cost of decarbonization with taxes is somewhat at odds with the main currents of thought in the Green New Deal universe, which lean more toward the idea that deficits don\u2019t matter and the costs shouldn\u2019t be paid for at all.\n\n\n\nSeventy percent is a lot higher than the current rate and will doubtless fuel the conservative effort to paint AOC as a know-nothing, but the number is in line with one prominent strain of recent economics research and is at least moderately well supported by America\u2019s historical experience.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola, Nomi Knost\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola, Nomi Knost\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

    "authors": [

    "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s enormous appetite in the Democratic Party and among all Americans for major public investment to tackle our nation\u2019s major crises: deepening inequality and structural racism and climate disaster,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats, in a statement to The Intercept. \u201cPelosi and the Democratic Party leadership\u2019s support of Paygo makes actually solving these crises all but impossible. The Democratic Party leadership is unilaterally disarming and shooting themselves in the foot.\u201d\n\nPresumptive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will be sworn in on Thursday, has promised for months to restore the pay-go rule, which she instituted when first taking over the speaker\u2019s gavel in 2007. She ran into resistance from progressives, who believe that the rule would make it more difficult for Democrats to pass a host of liberal agenda items, from \u201cMedicare for All\u201d to a Green New Deal to tuition-free public college. Critics also argue that pay-go creates an unlevel playing field, where Republicans get to blow giant holes in the tax code, as they did with the 2017 tax cuts , while Democrats must pay fealty to the deficit.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will be sworn in this week to represent a district in New York, will vote against the package, her spokesperson told The Intercept. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., announced Wednesday that he would oppose it.\n\nDespite pressure from progressive Democrats, the House rules package for the 116th Congress will include a pay-as-you-go provision, requiring all new spending to be offset with either budget cuts or tax increases, a conservative policy aimed at tying the hands of government.\n\nThe pay-go rule House Democrats will institute is actually an improvement on what House Republicans put into place in 2011. They created a rule called \u201ccut-go,\u201d which required any new spending to only be offset with budget cuts instead of tax increases. The rule didn\u2019t apply, of course, to the Trump tax cuts. \u201cIt is terrible economics. The austerians were wrong about the Great Recession and Great Depression. At some point, politicians need to learn from mistakes and read economic history,\u201d Khanna wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe Democratic leadership replaced that rule with the 2007 version. The new rule establishes a point of order against any bill that increases the deficit within a 10-year budget window, based on figures from the Congressional Budget Office. The House could attach an \u201cemergency\u201d designation to legislation to get around the pay-go rule: Congress did this in 2009 to pass the economic stimulus package under President Barack Obama. The point of order could be waived by a majority vote of the House. But this gives the Democratic leadership another lever of control on what legislation can advance, as their assent would be critical to exempting bills from the pay-go rule. And members of Congress tend to resist voting to waive the rule, as they worry it creates readymade attack ads.\n\nThere is also a Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act, passed in 2010 under pressure from Blue Dog Democrats, which allows the president to enforce across-the-board cuts if Congress violates pay-go. But the prospect of a president implementing such an unpopular policy is remote. So the House rule looms large by constraining new spending at its source.\n\nLiberals, of course, have plenty of ideas for how to raise revenue. The Trump tax cuts alone offer nearly $3 trillion in potential offsets simply by restoring corporate tax rates, \u201cpass-through\u201d rules on individuals, and inheritance taxes. But the pay-go rule forces Democrats to propose tax increases that Republicans gleefully broadcast. Meanwhile, Republicans, unconcerned with deficits, get to play Santa Claus, freed from having to match tax cuts with anything unappealing.\n\nWith Republicans in control of the Senate and the White House for the next two years, major Democratic agenda items won\u2019t be passing, muting the near-term impact of the pay-go rule. But eliminating hurdles to activist legislation that increases public investment may matter in the future, should Democrats take the presidency and Senate in the next election. Progressives have been thinking strategically about how to maximize power since the midterms, focusing on relatively arcane subjects like the rules package and committee assignments.\n\nThey didn\u2019t come away completely empty-handed. House Democrats\u2019 rules package includes a series of provisions demanded by the Progressive Caucus. For example, there\u2019s the reinstatement of the \u201cGephardt rule,\u201d which eliminates the need for a standalone House vote to raise the nation\u2019s debt limit. Under the rule, named for former House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, every time the House passes a budget resolution, the debt limit increase necessary to accommodate that budget will be deemed as passed.\n\nThe rules package also eliminates the mandate on the CBO to include \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d in their assessment of legislation. This means that they don\u2019t have to model the economic impact of legislation and the impact on federal revenues, a pseudoscientific conceit that was used by the Republican majority to make tax cuts look more like they pay for themselves.\n\nAnnual ethics training for all members is now mandatory. Nondisclosure agreements can no longer be used to prohibit current or former staff from reporting wrongdoing to relevant authorities. The rules package also bans members of Congress from sitting on corporate boards, a response to the insider trading indictment of Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., who was a board member of a drug company when he received inside information about a failed clinical trial and leaked the information to his son.\n\nHouse members will also apparently be required to pay for their own discrimination and sexual harassment settlements (although enforcement of that rule is a bit unclear), and House Democrats will be allowed to intervene in the lawsuit attempting to rule the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. On a more symbolic front, Democrats changed the name of the \u201cCommittee on Education and the Workforce\u201d back to its original title, the \u201cCommittee on Education and Labor.\u201d\n\nFinally, the rules include the re-establishment of a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, seen by progressives as a vehicle to develop a Green New Deal legislative package. This 15-member committee \u2014 nine Democrats and six Republicans \u2014 can hold hearings and issue policy recommendations, but those recommendations must go through the committees of jurisdiction, and the committee will not have subpoena or deposition authority.\n\nHouse leaders claimed in their release of the rules package that they worked with numerous stakeholders and took into consideration all the viewpoints of the caucus. But like the somewhat defanged climate committee, Pelosi\u2019s pay-go provision has rankled progressives.\n\nLast month, the Economic Policy Institute put out a damning paper arguing that during the Obama administration, pay-go led to unnecessary shrinking of ambitions in areas like health care and an unsuitable response to the Great Recession. \u201cIt is terrible economics to view federal budget deficits as always and everywhere bad,\u201d wrote report author Josh Bivens, pointing out that pay-go stunted the economic recovery: \u201cIf \u2026 public spending following the Great Recession had followed the average path of the recoveries of the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, a full recovery with unemployment around 4 percent would have been achieved by 2013.\u201d\n\nAt least one congressional power broker wants progressive Democrats to fight the rules package. \u201cIn order for #PayGo to go into effect, it needs to pass the House,\u201d wrote Bernie Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels on Twitter on Tuesday night. \u201cIf some 18 Dems vote no, it fails. The vote will take place on Thursday. Will enough progressives have the courage to vote no on the first roadblock to #MedicareForAll, #GreenNewDeal & #CollegeForAll? Let\u2019s see.\u201d"

    "text": "Published on Jan 2, 2019\n\nIncoming Senator Mitt Romney went IN on Trump for his first two years in office. Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, and Jayar Jackson, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinio...\n\n\n\n\"The Trump presidency made a deep descent in December. The departures of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, the appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president\u2019s thoughtless claim that America has long been a 'sucker' in world affairs all defined his presidency down.\n\n\n\nIt is well known that Donald Trump was not my choice for the Republican presidential nomination. After he became the nominee, I hoped his campaign would refrain from resentment and name-calling. It did not. When he won the election, I hoped he would rise to the occasion. His early appointments of Rex Tillerson, Jeff Sessions, Nikki Haley, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster, Kelly and Mattis were encouraging. But, on balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions last month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\n\n\n\nIt is not that all of the president\u2019s policies have been misguided. He was right to align U.S. corporate taxes with those of global competitors, to strip out excessive regulations, to crack down on China\u2019s unfair trade practices, to reform criminal justice and to appoint conservative judges. These are policies mainstream Republicans have promoted for years. But policies and appointments are only a part of a presidency.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Jayar Jackson\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Jayar Jackson\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

The range of candidates will also force Democratic voters to consider which electoral approach is best suited to defeat Mr. Trump, balancing questions of ideological purity with how to appeal to a wide range of demographic groups like white rural voters, suburban women, college students, and black and Latino Democrats in the South and Sun Belt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Help build the Home of the Progressives http://tyt.com/JOIN\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/...\n\n\n\n\"Amid credible allegations of election fraud in North Carolina, Democratic leaders announced Friday they will not seat Republican Mark Harris, who ran in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District, and will instead leave the House seat vacant.\n\n\n\n'Given the now well-documented election fraud that took place in NC-09, Democrats would object to any attempt by [Mark] Harris to be seated on January 3,' incoming House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a statement to The Washington Post. 'In this instance, the integrity of our democratic process outweighs concerns about the seat being vacant at the start of the new Congress.'\n\n\n\nThe announcement comes the day North Carolina dissolved its elections board without certifying the November elections results and just days before the start of the new Congress.\n\n\n\nEvidence of election fraud swaying the vote in favor of Harris has mounted in the weeks since the election.

However, a Capital & Main review of congressional votes shows that even as O\u2019Rourke has represented one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the entire country, he has in many instances undermined his own party\u2019s efforts to halt the GOP agenda, frequently voting against the majority of House Democrats in support of Republican bills and Trump administration positions.\n\n\n\nCapital & Main reviewed the 167 votes O\u2019Rourke has cast in opposition to the majority of his own party in the House during his six-year tenure in Congress. Many of those votes were not progressive dissents alongside other left-leaning lawmakers but were instead votes to help pass Republican-sponsored legislation. In many cases, Democratic lawmakers said that those measures were designed to help corporate interests dismantle Obama administration programs and regulations.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Upon arriving at a dining hall, the president received a standing ovation from the troops. He posed for selfies and signed several red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats that service members had brought.\n\n\n\nWhile speaking to the troops the president also defended his move to pull out the more than 2,000 military members the U.S. has in Syria. That decision led to last week\u2019s resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump said he rejected requests by U.S. military commanders for more time to defeat the last remnants of the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria.\n\n\n\n'I said, \u2018Nope,\u2019' Mr. Trump told the troops. 'You can\u2019t have any more time. You\u2019ve had enough time. We\u2019ve knocked them out. We\u2019ve knocked them silly.'\n\n\n\nHe reiterated his frustration that other countries weren\u2019t doing more to tackle terrorist groups in the region.

Support the Majority Report's video content by going to http://www.Patreon.com/MajorityReport\n\n\n\nOriginally aired April 6, 2018\n\n\n\nJulie Wilson is an Associate Professor of Communication Arts at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. She joins us today to discuss her new textbook, \u2018Neoliberalism.\u2019\n\n\n\nWhat \u201cneoliberalism\u201d is and how it differs from classical liberalism. The role of the state in promoting neoliberalism via policy that privileges \u201cfree markets.\u201d The different versions of neoliberalism advanced by Democrats and Republicans. The rise of neoliberalism in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s and how every president since Reagan has advanced it. The four D\u2019s: dispossession, dis-imagination, de-democratization, and disposability. How social media and austerity train kids to think of themselves as market commodities who must compete with one other. How neoliberalism used the individualistic 1960s counter-culture for its own nefarious ends. How neoliberalism seeps into every aspect of our lives while simultaneously rendering itself invisible. The privatization of politics and what it means to be a neoliberal citizen. What we can do to resist neoliberalism in our everyday lives and become more communal and less alienated.\n\n\n\nJan 8 Republican Responds To Harassment Allegations In The WORST Way Possible\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpa3r...\n\n\n\nFeb 8 Jordan Peterson's Countdown To Total Meltdown Begins On Fox and Friends\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N67oy...\n\n\n\nMarch 6 Friend Of The Show Jordan Peterson Calls In\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbGpn...\n\n\n\nWatch the Majority Report live M\u2013F at 12 p.m. EST at youtube.com/samseder or listen via daily podcast at http://Majority.FM\n\n\n\nDownload our FREE app: http://majorityapp.com\n\n\n\nSUPPORT the show by becoming a member: http://jointhemajorityreport.com\n\n\n\nLIKE us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/MajorityReport\n\n\n\nFOLLOW us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/MajorityFM\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to us on YouTube: http://youtube.com/SamSeder"

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://thehill.com/homenews/house/42...\n\n\n\n\"The House passed a stopgap government funding measure Thursday night in a 217-185 vote that includes $5.7 billion for President Trump\u2019s wall on the Mexican border and additional security \u2014 raising the odds that a shutdown will begin Friday at midnight.\n\n\n\nPassage of the measure over united Democratic opposition passes the hot potato to the Senate, which is set to consider the bill Friday. The bill is not expected to pass the Senate, where Democrats have rejected money for Trump\u2019s wall.\n\n\n\nEight Republicans voted against the bill, which was approved by the House a day after the Senate approved a similar measure that also funds the government through Feb. 8 but does not include the money for Trump's wall. That bill was approved by voice vote.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, shrinking the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent and cutting taxes on private businesses by about 20 percent.\n\n\n\nWhen Trump signed the bill that morning in the Oval Office, he boasted about the gains it would provide for all Americans. He claimed that corporations were already 'giving billions and billions of dollars away to their workers' as a result of the $1.5 trillion tax cut package and pointed to a handful of big companies that promised to raise wages and give employees $1,000 cash bonuses \u2014 among them Walmart, Bank of America, and Comcast.\n\n\n\nA year later, economic data shows that the tax bill\u2019s benefit to workers was largely a mirage.\n\n\n\nThe left-leaning Economic Policy Institute recently crunched compensation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showing that the much-touted bonuses did little to boost workers\u2019 paychecks. In the past 12 months, cash bonuses only gave workers an extra 2 cents in average hourly compensation, adjusted for inflation. (This does not include bonuses tied to productivity goals.)\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

He dismissed claims of Russian interference abroad, from a nerve agent poisoning in Britain to an alleged effort to infiltrate the U.S. National Rifle Association.\n\n\n\nInstead he sought to paint himself as the world\u2019s protector.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Tucker Carlson has found an unlikely supporter amidst the sturm and drang around his show: The Young Turks host and champion of the \u201cfighting left\u201d Cenk Ugyur.\n\nThe Fox News primetime host finds himself losing advertising support over what many see as inflammatory comments on America\u2019s complex immigration problems. At least fifteen advertisers have pulled their spots after Carlson claimed on his primetime show last week that immigration \u201cmakes our own country poor and dirtier and more divided.\u201d\n\nBut Uygur believes that a social media-fueled advertiser boycott is the not the way to go.\n\n\u201cWe all have to work harder to address the root causes instead of trying to put a band-aid on it by banning things,\u201d Cenk Uygur said on The Young Turks Tuesday evening. \u201cI think as odious as Tucker Carlson\u2019s comments are, he gets to make that and we get to make the counterargument. It\u2019s not a First Amendment issue\u2026\u201d Uygur explained, pointing out that advertisers influencing commentary, \u201cshuts down all conversation in the country.\u201d\n\nCo-host Ana Kasparian disagreed, \u201cIn the case of Tucker Carlson, it\u2019s an extreme example because his rhetoric has real consequences,\u201d before adding, \u201cI\u2019m tired of advertisers being the gatekeepers of what is and is not appropriate on news shows.\u201d\n\nUygur explained he believes in a \u201cMarketplace of ideas,\u201d citing past defenses of allowing Ben Shapiro and others speak on college campuses and instead, \u201clet the audience make that decision.\u201d\n\nDespite a different take on the ad boycott, Uygur and Kasparian did agree on their criticism for how Carlson described immigrants and for trying to pin the country\u2019s division on them.\n\n\u201cHe used the words \u2018poorer,\u2019 \u2018dirtier,\u2019 and \u2018more divided,\u2019 It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s people like him who actually divide the country through his rhetoric,\u201d Kasparian said.\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, also make the country poorer by insisting on tax cuts for the rich and corporations that actually rob us\u2026\u201d Uygur responded.\n\n\u201cTucker, that\u2019s what you do every single night, is divide the country,\u201d Uygur pointed out in reference to Carlson insisting immigrants divide the country, \u201c\u2026and then you turn around and you blame immigrants for it.\u201d\n\nUygur then criticized Carlson for using the word, \u2018dirtier,\u2019 about immigrants and said, \u201cIt\u2019s in a teleprompter. It wasn\u2019t off the cuff. We\u2019re unscripted and we get passionate sometimes. He wrote that down and then read it, \u2018dirtier.'\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s using this as a way of slandering migrants,\u201d Kasparian said.\n\nWatch the segment above courtesy of The Young Turks.\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com"

Dialing the number brings callers to a fundraising hotline, according to Ali and the Post.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

But it will almost certainly make its way to the Supreme Court, threatening the survival of the landmark health law and, with it, health coverage for millions of Americans, protections for people with pre-existing conditions and much more.\n\n\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Reed O\u2019Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth said that the individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance 'can no longer be sustained as an exercise of Congress\u2019s tax power.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Now, obviously last Friday when we had those court filings that listed Donald Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator, of course, assuming he is individual one which he 100 percent is individual one, Republicans had been freaking out ever since all of that because they understand that the walls are closing in on Donald Trump. He lost his chief of staff. That guy's going to be out the door and just a few weeks, nobody else wants to take that position. Overall, the White House itself is grossly understaffed and the few people they have their do not have the talent and the wherewithal to actually do the jobs that they've been hired to do.\n\n\n\nIn fact, according to a recent report in the Washington Post, uh, Republicans had been advising the president to set up basically a war room. They want them to set up a war room to deal with the Mueller investigation and all the reports that keep coming out of that as well as all of the other investigations into Donald Trump. The emoluments clause lawsuit is moving forward rapidly and that's going to be a huge headache for the president, as is the lawsuit and investigation in the state of New York with them misusing their charitable fund money. He doesn't have a way to deal with this. He doesn't have a war room as Republicans call it, to sit down, talk about this, strategize and come up with a plan. He doesn't even have the staff to have a proper war room of people coming up with responses and helping the president craft intelligent, well thought out talking points.\n\n\n\nInstead, according to this Washington Post piece, Republicans are saying the president is just trying to wing it. They have this quote bunker mentality and they're all kind of huddled down. They're terrified, scared. Not knowing what's going to happen, but assured that they're going to be able to handle whatever is thrown at them and they have already proven in the last week that they cannot. I mean Donald Trump gets on twitter and freaks the hell out anytime any new information comes out from the special prosecutor's office. Anytime a new lawsuit is filed against him or anytime a senator says they disagree with him on something, this man cannot be trusted to properly handle the crises that he is created. On top of that, the trade wars are wreaking havoc on global markets. We have Americans losing their jobs. Job creation for November was a hell of a lot lower than they thought it would be.\n\n\n\nPeople are losing their jobs. Uh, bankruptcies among farmers are skyrocketing. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing with no, uh, nothing on the horizon to indicate are gonna go down. Prescription drug prices continue to rise. There's no wall. So he led his base down with that, thank God, but nonetheless, this man has no accomplishments to show for it. The only thing he has is that massive Republican tax cut that benefited the top one percent. That's not enough for Republicans right now because they understand within the next six months we're going to have a very clear idea if not a finalized idea of who is running for president on the democratic side."

The two reports, one from Axios in one from CNN say that some of the most ardent Donald Trump's supporters in this country are starting to believe that these investigations are bad news for the president and not because it's giving him bad publicity, but because they're starting to think that he may have actually committed the crimes that they're saying he committed. As I said a few seconds ago, they don't believe his cries of witch hunt any more. Now, here's the thing, and this is why we have to take these kinds of reports with a grain of salt. It is possible that Axios and CNN and whoever else is reporting this. They went out there and they managed to find the two or three hardcore Trump supporters who are starting to say, you know what?\n\n\n\nMaybe there is something to these investigations so they could have cherry picked their people. That's always a possibility. What is also a possibility is that cracks are starting to surface in the facade of Donald Trump's base. I believe that is happening here. I believe we're starting to see some of that. It's not going to be on a large scale, but if you start with one or two people and they start telling their hardcore, Donald Trump supporting friends. You know what though? You know what though? There's something to this, that law suit up in New York that investigation up in New York that has nothing to do with the Russians. That's the big one and that's actually what a lot of these Donald Trump's supporters are out there saying right now. They're worried about that one. They're worried about Mueller now too, but they're more worried about what's happening in New York and the fact that Donald Trump is very clearly individual one.\n\n\n\nIt's getting harder and harder for the president to convince people that he did not break the law, especially with regards to the campaign finance violations that are at this point crystal clear from the testimony of Michael Cohen, the tapes from Michael Cohen and everything else that has been uncovered in that particular investigation. Now whether or not they believe that that warrants removal from office is another animal entirely, and that's not necessarily something that these other reports we're talking to these people about, and to be honest, it's not even time to start having those conversations just yet. That is still the thing we have got to be very patient on. It has to be crystal clear. It has to come from one of these bodies that is investigating the president. If people in the house try to go too soon, try to move on the president, like he said, he used to move on people in that access Hollywood tape, but if they move on them too soon, they're going to blow it."

James Inhofe (R-OK), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, reported purchasing tens of thousands of dollars of stock in one of the nation\u2019s top defense contractors.\n\n\n\nAfter The Daily Beast asked about the purchase, Inhofe\u2019s office said the senator had contacted his financial adviser to cancel the transaction and instructed him to avoid defense and aerospace purchases going forward.\n\n\n\nInhofe, who took over the top spot on Armed Services after the death of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in August, has repeatedly pressed President Donald Trump to dramatically scale up the Pentagon\u2019s annual budget, which currently stands at $717 billion. Last week, after Trump hinted he would like to scale back parts of that budget, Inhofe met with the president and Defense Secretary James Mattis, after which it was announced that the administration would seek even more defense funding: a record $750 billion in spending for fiscal year 2020.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

He claimed his replacement of the North American Free Trade Agreement would cause Mexico to pay the barrier 'just by the money we save.' It is unclear how the new trade deal would fund the wall, which carries a price tag of up to $25 billion.\n\n\n\nWith just over a week until funding for parts of the government lapses, Democratic leaders aimed to turn the president\u2019s statement against him.

When is a crime not a crime? Well, it's actually not a riddle because a crime is always a crime. Even when the president does it to contradict Nixon's old saying that it's not a crime when the president does it. Um, no, it 100 percent is a crime is always a crime, but apparently the Republicans in Washington dc still don't quite understand that. And in the last couple days they have been essentially tripping over themselves, trying to come up with excuses for those damming a court documents filed by molar and the southern district of New York last Friday. First and foremost, we have Kevin McCarthy, the current House majority leader and the incoming house minority leader who went on Fox News recently and he said, you know, we have to understand that this is small potatoes, right? I mean, if we're going to start investigating every campaign finance violation, than a lot of members of my own caucus would have to go.\n\n\n\nFantastic. That's the point. That's exactly what we're getting at here. Kevin McCarthy. I think maybe you understand it, except you also have to understand that it is illegal campaign finance is a problem, but not the laws. It's the lack of the laws. It's the lack of enforcement and it's the fact that corporations have all of the power. What we're talking about here though, doesn't even involve corporations. It's just the president authorizing an illegal payment to aid his campaign that is now and always has been illegal. So you can spin it however you want that. Oh, we'd lose a lot of Republicans if we investigated stuff like this. And I think from the public, both the left and the right would probably say, well then that sounds like we need more investigations, doesn't it? Senator Rand Paul, the alleged libertarian slash republican slash, he has no idea what he believes or stands for.\n\n\n\nUh, went out there and basically said something similar on a Sunday. He told Chuck Todd, he said, I don't know what's illegal about building a hotel in Russia. We have to decide whether or not criminal penalties or the way we should approach criminal finance. So you say you don't know that it's illegal to build this thing, but we have to also look the laws when we're talking with criminal finance. Um, so are you saying that this is criminal finance? Paul also went on to talk about campaign finance and you know, how we, we, you know, over criminalize campaign finance. That's what I said over criminalize campaign finance. Again, we should be, we should be getting money out of politics and we should be taking a closer look at every single one of you. And as for the hotel in Russia, that, that's not even what any of this is about.\n\n\n\nLike why are you bringing that up? Rand Paul? Nobody's worried about that at the moment. We're talking about the president authorizing an illegal payment to a porn star. So she didn't take his campaign. And then finally we have Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, the guy who was adamant that Bill Clinton be held accountable for his lying under oath. Orrin Hatch says, Democrats will do anything to hurt this president is what he told a CNN the other day. Then when asked by the host, you know that the president have been implicated in the crime on Friday, Orrin Hatch responded by saying, okay, but I don't care. All I can say is he's doing a good job as president. Okay, so at least Orrin hatch out of the three here is being a little honest. He doesn't care."

    "text": "In this edition: The 2020 Democrats struggle to define themselves, anti-Trump conservatives commence their kvetching, and North Carolina Republicans try to legislate an election that they could win.\n\nI wish every high-stakes congressional negotiation played out in front of TV cameras, and this is The Trailer.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks at American University on Nov. 29. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nThe forces that take away candidates\u2019 control of their own narratives are stronger than ever \u2014 a reality that some in the Democrats\u2019 presidential farm team are already running into, hard. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California discovered that in the past week, as criticism from the media was amplified by their opponents across the left and right.\n\nFor Warren, it was an editorial in the Boston Globe urging her to shelve any plans she might have made for 2020, warning that she'd become too \u201cdivisive.\u201d Rolling Stone, HuffPost and the Daily Beast all ran coverage. The Sacramento Bee asked Harris to explain how a longtime aide had remained in her office even after settling a six-figure harassment claim. This splashed across conservative media, with coverage asking whether Harris had dealt herself out of the #MeToo movement.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the worst week for either \u2014 but it was a clear demonstration of how skeptics in their party\u2019s liberal base or critics on the right can jump on pieces of reporting or opposition research to shape narratives around candidates.\n\nRepublicans running for the 2016 nomination didn\u2019t face the same challenges, instead benefiting from the growing distrust that the party\u2019s base holds toward the media. That's not a factor on the left. According to Pew Research, just 38 percent of Republicans believe that media criticism of politicians \u201ckeeps them from doing things they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d while 82 percent of Democrats think that. The president's attacks on \u201cfake news,\u201d usually defined as any coverage critical of him and his administration, have had the effect of making rank-and-file Democrats even more trusting of what they see in the media.\n\nDemocratic candidates have acted accordingly, responding to bad press by trying, and sometimes failing, to answer it. Warren's decision to take a DNA test and publicize the results was seen as a response to the president's mockery of her claim to Native American heritage \u2014 and to her camp\u2019s view that the media is responsive to Trump. The DNA test was approached as a binary choice: whether to do it and absorb damage in 2018, or whether to be peppered with questions about it by the media throughout 2019 whenever Trump raised it. The result: Six weeks of criticism from Democrats who believe that she blew it, and not all of them saying so because they prefer another candidate.\n\nThe model held up for any Democrat trying to short-circuit a negative story is Barack Obama's handling of questions about his birth certificate; first, by releasing a short-form version in 2008, then by releasing a long-form one in 2011. But in both circumstances, Obama was already the presumptive nominee of his party, and the scandal itself was based on a conspiracy theory spread by, among others, the current U.S. president. The Democrats now trying to navigate around bad story lines don't have that advantage; they can be piled on by not just the other party but by the many supporters of other candidates. This has already happened to Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.) as he's taken calls about a run for president and been welcomed by left-wing commentary about his refusal to commit to Medicare-for-all or a ban on energy-industry donors.\n\nIn 2015, led by the opposition research group America Rising, Republicans took full advantage of Democratic infighting \u2014 and their trust in the mainstream media \u2014 by finding and promoting story lines about how Hillary Clinton had betrayed her party's left-wing base. She never escaped that dynamic, and a super PAC set up to help her out, \u201cCorrect the Record,\u201d mostly backfired, with her opponents on the right and left assuming that any pushback on scandals was politically motivated. (The PAC closed after the 2016 election.)\n\nSome on the left doubt that any Democrat is as vulnerable to negative coverage as Clinton. Eric Boehlert, a media critic formerly at the left-wing watchdog Media Matters, said that Clinton had suffered from an impression that both parties had nominated \u201cflawed\u201d candidates and that one of them, Donald Trump, could not possibly win.\n\n\u201cFox News and conservative media had been working to define Hillary Clinton for 20 years, and that's just not the case for any candidate who's looking at 2020,\u201d Boehlert said.\n\nFor the past year, the Republican National Committee assigned three analysts to research the more than 30 Democrats seen as potential presidential candidates. After the midterms, they added eight more analysts, with a mission to pore over the records of top Democrats, file requests for public information and then figure out how to get the information in the right hands.\n\nIn the current media climate, that could mean anything from cable news to conservative Twitter to left-leaning media such as the Intercept or the Young Turks. RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens pointed to Joe Biden\u2019s long-ago advocacy for tougher drug laws and sentencing as the sort of information already collected by Republicans that could resonate in liberal outlets.\n\n\u201cThe criminal justice stuff would never have been a vulnerability in the past,\u201d Ahrens said. \u201cThose positions are unpalatable to a Democratic primary electorate now.\u201d\n\nAlone in the Democratic lineup, one candidate already has a base that ignores or discounts negative coverage: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont.\n\nA critique of the media is in Sanders\u2019s political DNA. At speeches, he regularly recalls how the media did not take him seriously; in his new book \u201cWhere We Go From Here,\u201d he recounts, in detail, how he thinks the \u201cmainstream media\u201d treated him and his ideas unfairly. In a riff that he still makes in some speeches, Sanders jokes that if he made the most brilliant speech of his career then tripped over a banana, no one would hear about anything but the pratfall.\n\nSanders\u2019s media criticism bears little resemblance to the one made by most Republicans. To them, the media cannot be trusted because its representatives hold conservatives in contempt. To Sanders, the media covers \u201ctrivia\u201d and ignores life-or-death issues because it is focused on what sells. Every other potential candidate pays attention and sees a voter base that cares about what is being said about them.\n\nRIGHT\n\nRep. Mia Love (R-Utah) speaks during the sixth annual Women Rule Summit in Washington on Tuesday. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFor the first time, some Republicans are beginning to discuss the midterm elections as if they lost them. On Tuesday, two events on different sides of Washington were full of hard thinking for the party \u2014 one where Republicans envisioned a party that could compete where it had lost in 2018, one where the idea of burning down the party was beginning to seem attractive.\n\nAt Politico's annual \u201cWomen Rule\u201d summit, two members of the party's shrinking female membership in the House in large part blamed the president for alienating potential voters. Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah), who was narrowly defeated last month, said President Trump \"obviously\" did not understand how his behavior alienated women; Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), who is hoping to use an enhanced recruiting role with the party to elect female candidates, urged him to \u201ctweet less.\u201d RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who has generally echoed the president in playing down 2018's losses, said the party needed to dig into data and see why Democrats won.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at why we're losing with women,\u201d McDaniel said.\n\nMeanwhile, at the full-day \u201cStarting Over\u201d conference, organized by the center-right Niskanen Center, the mood was grimmer. Gov. Larry Hogan (R-Md.) kicked off the event by describing how he'd defied partisan trends in a blue state and governed pragmatically \u2014 while recalling how his father, a congressman, had called for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon.\n\nNo other elected Republican appeared onstage. In hallways and over a series of panels, the older-skewing crowd of conservatives discussed a future in which the Trump-led party could not possibly win another election and did not deserve to.\n\n\u201cNo one has repealed the demographic trends happening in this country,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who urged Republicans to revisit the pro-immigration \u201cautopsy report\u201d that the RNC put together after its 2012 defeats.\n\nA panel about the electoral future of the \u201ccenter-right\u201d imagined two scenarios. In one, advanced by strategist Mike Murphy, the party would lose and voters would eventually return to it when they grew frustrated with a left-wing Democratic Party. In another, from PR strategist Juleanna Glover, the center-right would invest in a third party that, if Democrats nominated an unpopular left-wing candidate in 2020, could win the presidency. The GOP itself was probably unsalvageable, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen you do reclaim it, it's going to be such a shrunken party that I don't know what it will be worth,\u201d Glover said. \u201cI have no hope that it'll be something anyone with a college or master's degree would want to be part of.\u201d\n\nEven that was too much for some in the audience. Jonathan Chait, a liberal columnist for New York magazine, suggested to the panel that the conservative movement could survive only if the current Republican Party were \u201cburned to the ground\u201d and replaced with one that, like the conservative parties of Europe, trusted the science on climate change and favored some kind of universal health care.\n\nThat was one opinion. More popular was an idea that didn't involve the Republican Party changing: that Democrats needed to moderate to become a safe haven for voters alienated by Trump, something that could happen if Mike Bloomberg ran for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cIt would be great for America if they nominate him,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nLEFT\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's analysis of the 2018 midterms is finished, and here's the gist: Their winning candidates defined themselves positively for swing voters who weren't all that inclined to vote for Democrats.\n\nAccording to polling conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, shared first with The Washington Post, voters in 45 battleground districts backed Donald Trump for president by two points; on average, they ended up favoring Democrats by six points. Voters viewed the average Democratic candidate more favorably than the average Republican candidate by 16 points.\n\n\u201cWe were able to overperform the national environment in districts where the president was relatively popular,\u201d said Dan Sena, the DCCC's executive director. \u201cIf you look at the persuadable voters, and fact that president is net positive, it\u2019s a huge testament to these candidates.\u201d\n\nAccording to the survey, Democrats grabbed control of the midterms more than 18 months ago, during the fight over whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBy far, the No. 1 issue cited for voters' support of Democrats was health care; 44 percent of them said that they wanted their vote to \u201clower the cost of health care and prescription drugs.\u201d Among voters who decided whom to support in the final week of the campaign, 53 percent said they were opposing Republicans because they might \u201cincrease the cost of health care.\u201d Just a fraction of voters said that they were voting to stop the president; most cited an issue they wanted action on.\n\nThat coalition was not on board with everything Democrats might do. By a 33-point margin, \u201cpersuadable\u201d voters who had not backed Democrats in 2016 said they wanted to see the new Congress \u201cwork with Trump,\u201d not against him.\n\nWhy did those voters reject Republicans? According to the poll, Democratic challengers simply blew Republicans off the map with positive messaging. By a 24-point margin, battleground district voters said they saw more positive ads about Democrats than about Republicans. That comports with what some Republicans have begun to say in the midterm's aftermath, that the surge of funds into GOP super PACs largely financed repetitive negative advertising that never dealt with the weaknesses of Republican candidates and never sold voters on a positive reason to keep Republicans in control, even though the economy was growing.\n\n\u201cIt was the validation of how important the Democratic messaging was,\u201d Sena said. \u201cYou can see how much more of the positive messaging broke through than how much of the GOP's negative messaging broke through. We knew the entire time that these candidates had the ability to get and stay positive. The Republicans jettisoned their positive messaging, and I'm still surprised that they did so.\u201d\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\nBeto O'Rourke holds a mobile device while speaking to voters outside a polling station in El Paso, Tex., on Election Day. (Sergio Flores/Bloomberg News)\n\n2020 Democratic presidential nomination (MoveOn straw poll via NBC News)\n\nDon't know: 28.8 percent\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke: 15.6 percent\n\nJoe Biden: 14.9 percent\n\nBernie Sanders: 13.1 percent\n\nKamala Harris: 10 percent\n\nElizabeth Warren: 6.4 percent\n\nSherrod Brown: 2.9 percent\n\nAmy Klobuchar: 2.8 percent\n\nMichael Bloomberg: 2.7 percent\n\nCory Booker: 2.6 percent\n\nMoveOn, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this year and has grown to millions of members, asked them to vote in an early straw poll of potential candidates for president. It was never going to decide who got MoveOn's official endorsement, something that requires a supermajority of the vote.\n\n\n\nBut it revealed how little this particular pool of voters is fixated on ideology right now. In December 2014, MoveOn members voted to support a \u201cDraft Warren\u201d effort, eventually spending more than $1 million on an unsuccessful attempt to get the senator to run for presidency. In January 2016, 78 percent of MoveOn members voted to give the group's endorsement to the Sanders primary campaign.\n\nWAIT, WHAT?\n\nYes, North Carolina, again. Republicans are no closer to a resolution in the contested race for North Carolina's 9th District, but they have come up with a solution for one nagging issue: What to do about Mark Harris, the Republican who appeared to have won the seat on the basis of an absentee ballot suppression scheme?\n\nUnder current law, if the state calls for a new election in a contested race, it must be run with the candidates who appeared in the previous election. In the 9th District, that would mean that a special election sometime in early 2019 would pit Harris against Dan McCready, the Democrat who nearly won. Democrats have remained 100 percent behind McCready, but Harris, who narrowly ousted Rep. Robert Pittenger (R) to become the nominee, was never popular within the party. That was even before a scandal that might have made him toxic.\n\nThe solution? Republicans, who for just 20 more days have a veto-proof legislative supermajority, are proposing a bill that would change election law and require a primary in the event of a new election. While McCready had a fringe primary challenger of his own, he would be in a strong position to take his party's nomination again.\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nAs first reported by Daniel Marans, the Democratic National Committee is setting new rules that require employees of the party to remain neutral ahead of the 2020 primary. \"Employees are prohibited from providing DNC services to any Presidential campaign other than through that process or unless explicitly authorized by the CEO or her designee,\" the party's chief executive, Seema Nanda, wrote in a Monday memo.\n\nThis is the umpteenth time since 2016 that the party has codified something that rankled the losing side of the past presidential primary. The DNC's bylaws have long required neutrality in primaries, up to the point when the party has officially picked its nominee. But the hack and release of internal emails, which revealed some staffers viewing Bernie Sanders with contempt toward the end of the primary, has haunted Democrats ever since.\n\nWorth noting: There is a large faction of Democrats who are sick and tired of these sorts of concessions. Last month, the Congressional Black Caucus cast a nonbinding \u201cno confidence\u201d vote against DNC Chairman Tom Perez, stemming from anger at the party's elimination of the power of \u201csuperdelegates\u201d to vote on the first ballot of a presidential nomination. Even in victory, the DNC has struggled to catch up with the RNC in fundraising.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\"Emmer, NRCC Start to Rebuild for 2020,\u201d by Ally Mutnick and Kyle Trygstad\n\nA look inside the thinking of the Republican who wants to win back the House and whose first big idea is \u201cregionalizing\u201d his committee. One revelation here: Emmer may be the first Republican in leadership who says that the 11th-hour campaign focus on immigration hurt the party.\n\n\u201cHow the Left Can Win in 2020: Primary Centrist Democrats in Blue Districts,\u201d by Sean McElwee\n\nA clinical look at where the Democrats' left flank can build power, inspired by the strategy that has worked well for conservatives since 2010.\n\n\"\u2018Election Night\u2019 Is an Outdated and Dangerous Relic of the Past,\u201d by Ed Kilgore\n\nA rebuttal to the idea that something is wrong with democracy if we can't call a winner within a day of polls closing.

Democrats, in fact, have done this in the past to Republican governors in lame-duck sessions in other states.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Todd failed to provide a single example of Democrats taking comparable action, simply shifting to start his interview with incoming Wisconsin Gov.-elect Tony Evers.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

A band of supportive lawmakers stood ready to vote her into the position.\n\n\n\nBut there was one major problem: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy didn\u2019t want her leading the NRCC. The California Republican called Wagner to express his preference for a far less prominent male lawmaker, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, according to three sources familiar with the conversation. Wagner could have defied McCarthy \u2014 some lawmakers and aides thought she\u2019d win if she would have \u2014 but she realized doing so would create tension and would be counterproductive as the party tried to pivot toward 2020.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Now in a series of tweets, the president first acknowledged that the caravan, certainly 100 percent was forming and was headed to the United States, but they're not anymore. I'm allegedly according to the president because they couldn't get through our makeshift fences and our border patrol. What actually happened was that a lot of them never made it here to begin with. As most of us suspected, they wouldn't. They either went to other places, they were accepted into Mexico and yes, some were down at the border. Those are the people that were tear gassed. So yeah, kind of hard to get through walls of tear gas when you're three, four years old. Nonetheless, Donald Trump says that it's time to build that wall. And He, uh, tweeted out that he's going to have a meeting with Pelosi and Schumer coming up very soon, and hopefully he will get his funding from them.\n\n\n\nNow, I want to come back to that point in just a moment, but here's an even bigger one that the president tweeted out the final tweet of this five tweet tirade. People do not yet realized how much of the wall, including really effective renovation has already been built. If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country, the military will build the remaining sections of the wall. They know how important it is. Now, first and foremost, uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Mexico is supposed to pay for this thing. I mean, we're. We promised that every couple months we were told that Mexico's going to pay for this wall. Mexico's paying for it, Mexico's paying for it, and now this man is basically on his knees begging Democrats to give him the money he wants for his wall. And if they don't give it to them than hell, he's going to take it out of the military budget, which is already bloated and overblown and could easily pay for it.\n\n\n\nAnd then he's going to have members of the military actually build the thing. Now that's a scary thought because yeah, the military certainly has enough money in their overblown budget to go and pay for this thing. They've got the personnel and the staffing to easily construct a concrete and brick wall, but if that happens, that kind of puts us in an awkward place as a country, right? Suddenly we're this country with a big wall on our southern border. We are the closed off isolationist. We hate foreigner country. At that point it sends a horrid message to the rest of the world and it's a message that many people are going to start using against us. It's not something that a lot of Republicans have put any at all of thought into as to what other countries are going to do to us if we do this to the people below our southern border."

Mr. Ayers, 36, the chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, is returning to Georgia with his wife and three young children, according to people familiar with his plans.\n\n\n\nThe decision leaves Mr. Trump to contend with fresh uncertainty as he enters the 2020 campaign amid growing danger from the Russia investigation and from Democrats who have vowed tougher oversight, and could even pursue impeachment, after they take over the House next month.\n\n\n\nAs the president hastily restarted the search process, speculation focused on a group that was led by Representative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican who is the hard-edge chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, but also included the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin; Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney; and the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola, Mark Thompson\n\n\n\nCast: Ana Kasparian, John Iadarola, Mark Thompson\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

It\u2019s a striking move for two big reasons: No new coal plants are being built in the US, and the EPA itself (along with 12 other federal agencies) recently put out a sweeping report detailing the need to reduce emissions from fossil fuels because of the grave threat of climate change.\n\n\n\nThe agency is loosening Obama-era restrictions on how much carbon dioxide new coal power plants can emit. Known as the New Source Performance Standards, a provision under the Clean Air Act, the rule established in 2015 said coal plants couldn\u2019t emit more than 1,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Bush\u2019s attorney general, will replace former Attorney General Jeff Sessions if the Republican-controlled Senate approves Trump\u2019s nomination. (Matthew Whitaker is currently serving as acting attorney general.)\n\n\n\nMuch of the attention is focused on what Barr\u2019s nomination may mean for the Russia investigation, given his previous remarks that he thought it was okay for Trump to fire FBI Director James Comey and that Hillary Clinton should be investigated.\n\n\n\nBut as head of the US Department of Justice, Barr would also have a lot of control over the federal criminal justice system more broadly. Ames Grawert, senior counsel at the Brennan Center, which supports criminal justice reform, tweeted, \u201cBarr is one of the few people left in policy circles who could reasonably be called as bad as, or worse than, Jeff Sessions on criminal justice reform.\u201d And make no mistake: Sessions had a very bad record on criminal justice reform.\u201d\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Nick Hanauer\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Nick Hanauer\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Trump has denied those claims.\n\n\n\nCohen was subsequently charged last week by the special counsel's office with one count of lying to Congress.\u201d\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Nick Hanauer\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Nick Hanauer\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.mediaite.com/online/tarif...\n\n\n\n\"As President Donald Trump continues to defend the use of tariffs amid trade disputes with America\u2019s international trading partners, indications are that the national trade deficit is about to see its highest point in 10 years.\n\n\n\nWall Street Journal reports that the Commerce Department has announced a $55.5 billion foreign-trade gap for goods and services. Imports for goods like foreign vehicles saw record numbers in October while exports seem to be in decline.\n\n\n\nThe Journal notes that the U.S.\u2019s trade deficit comes from the fact that the country typically imports more goods than it exports. Some economists say this is because Americans often consume more products than they produce compared to other international economies, and that trend could go up if economic growth leads to continued spending.\n\n\n\nTrump recently suggested that there could soon be a ceasefire in trade wars with China.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

So she did: \u201cFirst you drive up and the doorman takes your car.\u201d For the daughter of a Boston power lawyer, the Four Seasons Hotel seemed as sensible a homework topic as the basics on winter, spring, summer and fall.\n\n\n\nPatrick loves this joke. He has been telling it to audiences since at least 2007. It\u2019s in his memoir, it pops up in radio interviews, and this fall he deployed it to charm a crowd at a Washington think tank. The key to the story isn\u2019t his easy smile but who he is. Coming from Mitt Romney, the same narrative would be a crass celebration of inherited wealth. But from a black man who can remember his mother cashing welfare checks on the South Side of Chicago, it\u2019s inspirational stuff \u2015 a symbol, as Patrick says, of what makes America an exceptional country.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

In response, Trump noted that the data suggested the debt would reach a critical mass only after his possible second term in office.\n\n\n\n'Yeah, but I won\u2019t be here,' the president bluntly said, according to a source who was in the room when Trump made this comment during discussions on the debt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

(This is a notable contrast to the positively scathing memo Mueller\u2019s team wrote about George Papadopoulos, in which they said he did not provide 'substantial assistance' and complained that he talked to the press.)\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Published on Dec 3, 2018\n\nNow that China has banned foreign waste... America\u2019s plastic trash is homeless. But \u2013 our recycling is still getting recycled, right? Right??\n\n\n\nTranscript\n\nG'Day you! Yeah, I\u2019m talking to you mate. What are you doing to save the environment?\n\n\n\nOh, you recycle.\n\n\n\nGood for you! It\u2019s a pain in the ass, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\n\nRinsing those yogurt tubs and then keeping them under the sink, all stinky like a dunny in summer?\n\n\n\nBut it gives you a good feeling, right?\n\n\n\nWell, it may be giving you a good feeling, but I\u2019m here to tell all you happy recyclers of the world \u2013 you ain\u2019t doing sh*t for the environment.\n\n\n\nIn fact, this whole recycling thing \u2013 it\u2019s a big. Fat. scam.\n\n\n\nRight now you\u2019re probably thinking \u2013 fair go Jayde, \u201cWhat about all the recycling labels and the recycling plants\u2026?!\u201d\n\n\n\nWell \u2013 you\u2019re right \u2013 recycling did actually used to help\u2026 in some way.\n\n\n\nBut let\u2019s cut to the chase: Recycling waste in the US is expensive. That\u2019s why America used to only recycle about one third of its plastic domestically. We\u2019d ship all our plastic sh*t to China, who\u2019d buy it, melt it down and cheap plastic Chinese shit. In fact, China was the world\u2019s dumping ground \u2013 importing two-thirds of the world\u2019s plastic waste.\n\n\n\nThis arrangement was working just dandy \u2013 til China realized it didn\u2019t need our trash anymore. They make plenty of it themselves, thank you very much. At the start of this year, they officially closed their border to America\u2019s trash.\n\n\n\nSo now, America\u2019s trash is homeless. A study published in Science Advances predicts over 100 million metric tons of plastic waste is now in limbo \u2013 and just to visualize that \u2013 its as much as if you stacked up all the plastic as high as the empire state building, and then covered all of Manhattan with it.\n\n\n\nWhere is limbo?\n\n\n\nWell, some of our trash ends up in Vietnam, Malaysia, India, and Thailand. But they don\u2019t manufacture anywhere near as much plastic cr*p as China does, so they wont be buying up all our trash. These countries often don\u2019t even have effective waste management for their own citizens, and the Science Advances study shows much of that plastic ultimately ends up in the ocean.\n\n\n\nBut wait \u2013 don\u2019t we have recycling plants in America?\n\n\n\nYes \u2013 but that costs money.\n\n\n\nCities have to collect, sort, clean, melt. After all that \u2013 it\u2019s not even worth much. Say it cost you 10 bucks to make a tonne of recycled plastics \u2013 but you can only sell it for 5 bucks. So the city loses money on every bit of plastic it recycles.\n\n\n\nNow, while the govt isn\u2019t averse to pissing money down the drain \u2013 oftentimes it\u2019s just easier for them to dump all those carefully-separated plastics into landfill.\n\n\n\nWondering where *your* plastic yoghurt tub goes? The website www.wastedive.com/ found if you live in Any of these states[..1] , - your \u201crecycling\u201d might be going to the same place you throw the rest of your trash.\n\n\n\nDepressing, right?\n\n\n\nBut here\u2019s an idea: Instead of recycling, how about not buying plastic in the first place?\n\nGet yourself one of those fancy aluminum bottles and grocery bags with baby owls on it \u2013 and turn your nose up at plastics like a true tree-hugger!\n\n\n\nSo, recycling: better than littering\u2013 but definitely not all its cracked up to be!\n\nDisagree with me? Let me have it, in the comments below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOURCES\n\n\n\nChina Statistics:\n\nhttp://advances.sciencemag.org/conten...\n\n\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articl...\n\n\n\nRecycling Effects\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2017/12/09/568797...\n\n\n\nhttps://www.waste360.com/business/wha...\n\n\n\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/...\n\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/cl...\n\n\n\nhttps://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013...\n\n\n\nUS Recycling Stats/Revenues\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/goatsand...\n\n\n\nhttps://www.joc.com/maritime-news/us-...\n\n\n\nhttps://www.joc.com/breakbulk/us-expo...\n\n\n\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIQ ON THE YOUNG TURKS\n\nProduced by Jayde Lovell and Bec Susan Gill.

When the smoke cleared, Chairman Fred Hampton and party member Mark Clark were dead; four others lay seriously wounded.\n\n\n\nToday in Chicago, seven years after the raid, the facts are slowly emerging, as a civil trial crawls through its tenth month. The families of Hampton and Clark, along with the seven who survived the foray, have filed a $47.7 million damage suit. Edward Hanrahan, three former and present FBI agents, an ex-FBI informant, and twenty-six other police personnel stand accused of having conspired to violate the civil rights of the Panthers, and then of covering it up. In essence, the plaintiffs and their lawyers are out to prove that the FBI/police conspired to execute Fred Hampton.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Brett Erlich, Brooke Thomas\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Brett Erlich, Brooke Thomas\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/whit...\n\n\n\n\"White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Monday the Trump administration wants to end subsidies for electric cars and other items, including renewable energy sources.\n\n\n\nAsked about plans after General Motors Co (GM.N) announced U.S. plant closings and layoffs last week, Kudlow pointed to the $2,500-to-$7,500 tax credit for consumers who buy plug-in electric vehicles, including those made by GM, under federal law.\n\n\n\n'As a matter of our policy, we want to end all of those subsidies,' Kudlow said. 'And by the way, other subsidies that were imposed during the Obama administration, we are ending, whether it\u2019s for renewables and so forth.'\n\n\n\nAsked about a timeline, he said: 'It\u2019s just all going to end in the near future. I don\u2019t know whether it will end in 2020 or 2021.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

When you look at this story they really are no more than human robots, automatons. What's happening here is you have Amazon selling this efficiency idea, we're gonna put a wristband on our workers and then we're gonna send our workers through miles and miles of warehouse, they're gonna get a code, the codes gonna say send this product to this address in Somewhere, America. The worker then goes, gets the product, boxes it up, gets it sealed up. As a matter of fact they have to do that what is it every 33 seconds?\n\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\n\nThey're supposed to be ... every 33 seconds they're supposed to be filling a new order and this wristband is gonna even make it worse. What's your take on this story?\n\n\n\nIt's absolutely disgusting here, these wristbands, let's keep in mind too they have patented it.\n\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\n\nSo this is something that they're most likely going to be selling to other employers who are interested in finding this out.\n\n\n\nNo question.\n\n\n\nBut for Amazon specifically when your job is to basically be moving every second of the day they're gonna find out they can look at your little wristband tracking and say like, well this person hasn't moved for 15 seconds, let's call worker number 892 into the office and find out why he thought that taking a 10 second breather was a problem.\n\n\n\nUsing the restroom.\n\n\n\nRight. They become the property of the company, they're no longer employees that deserve to be treated like human beings, they are robots.\n\n\n\nYeah let's talk about more specifically. Here's what happens, you've got these massive warehouse, when I say miles the average worker at the end of the day has walked 11 to 15 miles, that what they've walked everyday filling these orders. Now what's happening is the wristband is even, the term that they us is it's a system to where it actually tells the hand where to move. The wristband is showing that I'm getting closer to this item and basically what they're doing is moving through the warehouse with their wristband telling them where to go.\n\n\n\nThere really is no differences from ... it's a robotic process that may as well have robots doing it and I'm sure that's the next step. You know I read this article and when I took a look at what has happened when we no longer have unions in this country. I mean this is on the border of inhumane, yeah we want our orders, we want our orders filled. If you order something from Amazon you want it to get there, you want it filled, but then we have to be willing to say there's a human side to it.\n\n\n\nIt's just like we don't want to pay big prices, we don't want to pay an extra three cents for something but then we're the first people to be complaining oh my god we're shipping the jobs to China or India. Well you know you can have it one way or the other, you can't have it both ways. You either have to believe that we are on this planet together and we have some responsibility to workers and yeah we can save a few pennies by having it made in India or China or maybe we're gonna save an extra hour by having this wristband slapped onto the wrist of this worker like a robot. Isn't that kind of the dichotomy of rationale here?\n\n\n\nAbsolutely and when we, as a country back in the 80s we started busting up all the unions, union membership declined I think today it's well below 12%, wages started decreasing, benefits started decreasing, workers got abused and used by their employers, we've got regulatory agencies OSHA, the Department of Labor that are doing nothing to protect these workers and they let people like Jeff Bezos come in, slap these wristbands on their employees, treat them like robots, pay them about as low as you can possibly go in terms of wages."

    "text": "Published on Dec 3, 2018\n\nOn Wednesday of last week, the Trump administration sent out a memo to 2 million federal workers warning them that it will be \u201cillegal\u201d for them to talk about the possibility of Trump\u2019s impeachment while at work. They were also warned that they cannot use the word \u201cresist,\u201d a reference to the growing anti-Trump movement from the left.

That memo told those 2 million federal employees they were not allowed to discuss the possibility of Donald Trump's impeachment. While at work, the federal government, the Trump administration, sent out a memo to 2 million federal workers restricting their free speech, telling them that they can't basically talk about a worst case scenario for President Donald Trump. They also told them that they can't use the word resist, you know, like the Hashtag resist the anti-Trump movement there. Um, this is full blown fascist dictatorship in the United States today. We're literally telling federal workers what they can and cannot say while they're at work. We're dictating their speech for them. And now here's the thing, the administration is claiming that because Donald Trump is running for president again, if you're out there talking about these kinds of things, then that would be a violation of the hatch act.\n\n\n\nYou know, because you're sitting there advocating for or against a politician. Um, unfortunately, that's not actually what the Hatch Act covers. What the hatchet covers is if you're using your official position as your megaphone to go out there and advocate for or against a politician political party or an issue, you cannot do that, but if you're sitting in your cubicle at work and you lean over and you say, Hey, have you seen the news of the day? It looks like Donald Trump may be impeached. That's not political speech. That's just speech that's not advocating for or against a particular politician that's talking about the news of the day, but to this administration that is a threat and that is a danger and they're going to put an end to it. Now according to the memo, it's actually illegal. They're saying it's illegal for federal employees to engage in these kinds of discussions while at work, but to me it's not just.\n\n\n\nYou're not allowed to talk about impeachment because that's illegal and God knows what we're going to do to you. If we find out you are not being able to use the word resist, that's what takes this to the next level. That's what puts this into full blown. It's not about the hatch act. It's not about anything else. This is fully about Trump getting pissed off, getting scared, being cornered right now, seeing the walls closing in on him and wanting to lash out at somebody, and unfortunately it is those 2 million federal employees who are going to pay the price for this. Hopefully we're not going to see stories start emerging. We're federal employees are fired for mentioning Donald Trump's impeachment, but if we do see those stories, I hope those federal workers understand that they have a pretty much slam dunk case against the federal government for wrongful termination and violation of their freedom of speech."

Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/ar...\n\n\n\n\"In a lengthy Facebook post on Saturday, the well-known astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson disputed accounts that he had behaved inappropriately with three women, a day after the broadcasters of his show 'Cosmos' said they were investigating his conduct.\n\n\n\n'Accusations can damage a reputation and a marriage,' he wrote. 'Sometimes irreversibly. I see myself as loving husband and as a public servant \u2014 a scientist and educator who serves at the will of the public.'\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Fox Broadcasting and National Geographic, which air the popular science program 'Cosmos,' said they would investigate the allegations, which were first reported on the website Patheos. On Saturday, the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where Dr. Tyson directs the Hayden Planetarium, said it was looking into the accusations as well.\n\n\n\nDr. Tyson, 60, remains in his positions with the show and the planetarium. But the women\u2019s accounts show how more than a year after the #MeToo movement swept into the public consciousness, accusations continue to emerge about the behavior of powerful and high-profile men.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Republican Gov. Scott Walker was ousted in the process. Now, GOP state lawmakers in a lame-duck session are trying to force through a series of bills to limit the powers of Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers and incoming Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul.\n\n\n\nThe state lawmakers announced the package of bills on Friday. They plan to hold a single hearing on the proposals on Monday, and then quickly move to a vote on Tuesday. Wisconsinites should be outraged.\n\n\n\nIn addition to limiting the powers of some of Wisconsin\u2019s key newly elected leaders, Republican lawmakers hope to restrict early voting; change the 2020 presidential primary election date to ensure a far-right justice remains on the state\u2019s Supreme Court; block the governor-elect from fulfilling a pledge to withdraw the state from a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act; and replace the attorney general with taxpayer-funded private lawyers chosen by GOP lawmakers in cases involving state laws.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

It describes an unnamed Israeli Ministry of Defense official expressing concern about any attempts to cut funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).\n\n\n\n'Speaking off the record, our contact cited particular concern with any move to reduce UNRWA funding in Gaza,' the document states. 'He said that while the existence of UNRWA was a political poke in the eye to Israel, it nonetheless provided valuable humanitarian relief in Gaza.'\n\n\n\nThe cable also suggests that worsening the Palestinian economy could exacerbate violence. 'COGAT has long held the view that economic stability in Gaza is linked to its political and security stability,' the document also states.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, John iadarola\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Average life expectancy in the country dropped for the third year in a row, according to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s the longest downturn since the Spanish flu wiped out more than 50 million people a century ago.\n\n\n\nThe grim trend stems from a toxic mixture of more drug- and alcohol-related deaths and more suicide in many parts of the country. And it puts Americans at a higher risk of early death compared to their counterparts in other wealthy countries.\n\n\n\nBut what\u2019s often lost in the conversation about the uptick in mortality in the US is that this trend isn\u2019t affecting all Americans. In fact, there\u2019s one group in the US that\u2019s actually doing better than ever: the rich.

President Donald Trump vowed to outlaw the devices soon after the tragedy, and some lawmakers on Capitol Hill urged him to back a permanent legislative fix.\n\n\n\nBut opposition from lawmakers and the National Rifle Association ultimately made a regulatory change the only realistic path forward to accomplishing the President's goal.\n\n\n\nThe devices make it easier to fire rounds from a semi-automatic weapon by harnessing the gun's recoil to 'bump' the trigger faster -- an operation that caused officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives during the Obama administration to conclude that it's merely a gun accessory or firearm part, not subject to federal regulation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts:Ben Mankiewicz, John Iadarola, Jayar Jackson\n\n\n\nCast: Ben Mankiewicz, John Iadarola, Jayar Jackson\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

This potentially deadly advice is contrary to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) guidelines, which advise people in an active shooter situation to first attempt to escape, then hide and make barricades if escape is not possible, and finally \u201cas a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent danger, attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate\u201d the gunman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the November 27 edition of NRATV\u2019s Relentless, host and National Rifle Association spokesperson Dana Loesch highlighted a Northwestern University training video based on the DHS guidelines that urges students and faculty to first run if they hear gunshots, to hide if running isn\u2019t feasible, and to fight \u201cas a last resort.\u201d Loesch specifically focused on the \u201cfight\u201d portion of the video, criticizing the suggestions of using \u201canything you can use as a weapon,\u201d such as a fire extinguisher, during a \u201clast resort\u201d situation.\n\n\n\nHolton took particular issue with the \u201clinear thinking\u201d of run, hide, fight and called it \u201crun, hide, and die,\u201d arguing that victims will be waiting for their \u201cturn to get a bullet to the head.\u201d (Holton, in fact, misrepresented the guidelines, which do call for physically confronting the gunman as a last resort when other better options are exhausted and do not advocate waiting around to die.) He claimed, \u201cIt says a lot about our culture that we\u2019re not training our sons that you need to be the hero\u201d and instead suggested, \u201cYou find the guy that is hurting other people, you go after him, and you take him out.\u201d Holton also added that if \u201cyou are a capable male in the American population, then your mindset should not be run, hide, and then fight. It should be find, fix, and finish,\u201d apparently excusing women from his erroneous advice.\u201d\n\n\n\nHosts: Brett Erlich, Aida Rodriguez, Helen Hong, Adrienne Lawrence\n\n\n\nCast: Brett Erlich, Aida Rodriguez, Helen Hong, Adrienne Lawrence\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

A vast majority of Americans want to get the influence of money out of politics, and want Congress to pass laws to do so, according to a 2018 Pew Research survey.

Sanders himself will gave a keynote speech.\n\nAnd before you ask: No, this is not about whether the independent senator from Vermont will run for president.\n\n\u201cThis is a discussion about policy, about facts, about how we work together as progressives to shift the framework of debate and effect real change,\u201d said Jane O'Meara Sanders, the senator's wife, who founded the think tank last year. \u201cIt is not about electoral politics or campaigns.\u201d\n\nYet the campaign is coming, with a crowded and unsettled Democratic field that looks nothing like the one Sanders competed in two years ago. No coronation is expected for Sanders \u2014 not that he wants one.\n\nSanders, who released a memoir this week of his \u201ctwo years in the resistance,\u201d has given every impression that he will run for president again. But after galvanizing voters by running against the party's \u201cestablishment,\u201d and given the perception that Democrats teed up a nomination for Hillary Clinton, he has not locked up early endorsements or blocked the path for another candidate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be wide open, with multiple lanes,\u201d said James Zogby, a DNC member and Sanders ally who helped win changes to the party's primary process. \u201cThere's going to be billionaire lane, a moderate-centrist lane, an establishment lane, and then I think Bernie keeps one lane to himself. He has capacity to mobilize progressives as no one else does, and he\u2019s a proven fundraiser.\u201d\n\nSanders is careful to be clear that there's no real effort to keep other liberals or left-wing candidates out of the primary.\n\n\u201cI'm talking to people all over the country to get an assessment of whether I am in fact the strongest candidate,\u201d Sanders told an audience at George Washington University on Tuesday night. There are \u201ca number\u201d of serious candidates, he added, and some are his friends; when pressed, in any setting, he refuses to make a negative case against them.\n\nIf there's a \u201cprogressive lane\u201d in the 2020 race, it will probably be the busiest. Since winning reelection Nov. 6, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) has, for the first time, said he is talking to his family about whether to run for president. On Thursday afternoon, while Sanders was en route to Vermont, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered a high-profile foreign-policy speech, warning against \u201cthe combination of authoritarianism and corrupt capitalism\u201d gaining political strength in other countries. That's a theme Sanders himself had been making in big-picture speeches.\n\nJust four members of Congress endorsed Sanders before their states held primaries or caucuses; two of those Democrats, Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), are exploring presidential bids of their own. So is Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who in 2016 Sanders considered for a potential running mate. Booker and Merkley are also co-sponsors of Sanders's universal health-care bill, as are Warren and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who has been making her own moves toward a run.\n\nIn interviews before the Gathering, Sanders's supporters said that the choice in 2020 remained simple. Plenty of candidates were adopting Sanders's views; none had put them forward first. Cenk Uygur, the founder of the Young Turks news network, singled out Booker as a candidate who had climbed on board with liberal agenda items but had once criticized Democratic rhetoric about Wall Street and had taken money from business interests who were anathema to liberals.\n\n\u201cThe question is, why would we pick someone who is barely acceptable, when we have a much better alternative?\u201d Uygur asked. \"Can someone overcome the hurdle of being less progressive than Bernie? He's been fighting for these policies for 40 years, so if someone else comes out and says, 'Hey, me too,' they better not think they're going to pull a fast one on us.\"\n\nWithout the binary choice that faced liberal voters in 2016, however, Democratic activists and voters are happy to shop around. That doesn't matter for the organization of Sanders's campaign or finance network; it will have an impact on how outside groups mobilize. Many labor unions require a supermajority vote from their leadership to endorse, something that was more possible in a Clinton-Sanders contest than it would be in a crowded one.\n\nThe same is true for liberal groups; MoveOn and Democracy for America, to name just two national groups that backed Sanders, make endorsements based on a supermajority vote of their membership, and in a conversation this week DFA leaders said it was hard to see that happening quickly in the race for 2020. Instead of rallying early behind Sanders, the most successful vote-getter of any recent left-wing candidate, \u201cprogressive\u201d organizations are planning to hold more forums and vetting events to see how much they can make the entire field commit to an agenda.\n\nThe conservative movement pioneered that process, succeeding in 2012 and turning Mitt Romney from a supporter of health insurance mandates to a candidate who promised to repeal the ACA. What it did not have, that year, was a dedicated following for one candidate. Sanders has what no other 2020 hopeful does: millions of supporters, some of whom refuse to consider any other candidate for president and who cite polls to argue that no other candidate on the left is so popular. Like Sanders, they dismiss the idea that he is vulnerable to negative attacks \u2014 just one negative ad, from a pro-Martin O'Malley super PAC, was run against him in 2016 \u2014 by suggesting he has been vetted in a way no other would-be candidate has been.\n\nSanders, who speaks often of his disdain for \u201cgossip\u201d reporting about 2020 and candidate jockeying, said Tuesday that his campaign had moved Democrats toward a populist agenda that no one was rolling back: a $15 minimum wage, universal health care, massive infrastructure investments and tuition-free public college. He discussed all of that as if it had become immutable, part of the party's agenda no matter who became a nominee.\n\n\u201cWe kind of busted the discussion open,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cMaybe that was the most important accomplishment of the campaign.\u201d\n\nTURNOUT WATCH\n\nA volunteer takes a seat at one of the busier intersections in north Jackson, Miss., on Tuesday. (Rogelio V. Solis/AP)\n\nRepublicans won the year's last federal election Tuesday, securing two more years in Washington for Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi. While Hyde-Smith's 7.8-point win was the narrowest in any Mississippi Senate race since 1988, it was a win, and it defied some Democratic expectations about whether the new senator could excite the party's base.\n\nIt was also a revealing look at how the demographic changes that are re-sorting the parties have come even to states that aren't seeing their populations change much. Mississippi has added just 100,000 new residents since the start of the century; Georgia, by contrast, has added about 2.2 million. Yet the patterns seen in Georgia played out in Phil Ochs's least favorite state, too.\n\nBlack voters are mobilizing. Mike Espy, the first black congressman from Mississippi since Reconstruction, ended up getting more raw votes than any Democratic candidate for governor or Senate in decades. That was in large part thanks to blockbuster turnout in the state's 25 majority-black counties; Espy got more votes in losing his race (410,693) than Republican Thad Cochran got in winning his final term in the Senate four years ago (370,208).\n\nRural whites keep moving toward the GOP. Hyde-Smith struggled more than most Republicans to turn out the party's base. She won Lee County (Tupelo) and Harrison County (Biloxi), the two places where President Trump campaigned Monday, by just half the margin that Trump won them in 2016.\n\nBut in northeast Mississippi, the counties in the old Tennessee Valley Authority region, Hyde-Smith continued the trends visible in the Nov. 6 Senate race in Tennessee, with ancestral Democrats abandoning the party for good. In 2008, the closest Mississippi Senate race until this year, Sen. Roger Wicker (R) carried the counties northeast of Tupelo with 66.4 percent of the vote; Hyde-Smith, who ran two points behind Wicker's statewide margin, carried those counties with 79.8 percent of the vote.\n\nSuburbs keep moving toward Democrats. Mississippi, so distinct from the rest of the South in many ways, was no exception here. While modern Democrats always win the state's majority-black counties, they tend to lose the greater Jackson area, composed of Hinds County (Jackson itself) and the suburban counties of Madison and Rankin. In 2008, Democrat Ray Mabus won just 49.2 percent of the vote across those counties. On Tuesday, Espy won them with 55.2 percent of the vote. In 2008, Mabus had run four points behind his statewide margin in Madison County; Espy, who lives in that county, ran slightly ahead of his statewide margin there.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nLouisiana Governor. Democrats are defending just one governor's mansion in 2019: This one, captured by the socially conservative and economically progressive Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) in 2015. The pro-JBL Gumbo PAC is out with a web ad deriding the ambitions of Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R), who has said he'll decide Monday whether to run for governor. \u201cIn Washington, he talks, and talks, and talks, because that's what Washington is good at,\u201d says a narrator, before running down JBL's record; like most governors, he has presided over strong economic growth.\n\nKennedy told The Post's Seung Min Kim on Thursday that he was considering a run and talking to his family. \u201cIf you believe the polls today, I\u2019d probably win, but it\u2019s more than just winning,\" he said. \"You know, it\u2019s where I think I can do the most good and what do I want to do and what\u2019s best for my family. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\n2020\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell speaks in May 2017. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nMike Bloomberg. He spent part of Thursday in Jackson, Miss., announcing a grant with the city's popular left-wing Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba.\n\nTulsi Gabbard. She's speaking Saturday at the Sanders Institute Gathering, then heading to New Hampshire on Sunday for at least one meet-and-greet with Democrats.\n\nEric Garcetti. The Los Angeles mayor told reporters in Washington on Thursday that he will decide on a run in the first months of 2019.\n\nJohn F. Kerry. He told interviewers at Harvard's Institute of Politics that he was still thinking about a run for president, 16 years after his narrow defeat at the hands of George W. Bush. \u201cI'm not taking anything off the table,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I haven't been running around to the most obvious states laying any groundwork.\u201d\n\nJohn McAfee. The potential 2020 libertarian presidential candidate has been getting freelance advice on how to make anime memes.\n\nBeto O'Rourke. He's been invited to speak in New Hampshire by that state's Young Democrats, who have been holding high-profile meet-and-greets for would-be candidates.\n\nEric Swalwell. The California congressman will keynote Progress Iowa's holiday bash in Des Moines next month. Previous keynoters include Bernie Sanders and Bill De Blasio.\n\nWAIT, WHAT?\n\nTechnically speaking, the 2018 election is not over until every state certifies its vote totals, and North Carolina is taking its time to do so in the 9th District. The reasons, laid out by Kirk Ross, are confounding: Rogue activists may have persuaded hundreds of voters to apply for absentee ballots and offered to deliver them, which they then failed to do.\n\nFew states are as divided over election management as North Carolina, where Republicans capitalized on 2011 wins to draw a friendly map and used a subsequent supermajority to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's vetoes of voter ID and other election-related bills. But the board governing the 9th District voted unanimously to delay certification of that race until more became known about what happened.\n\nIt's within the board's power to call a new election if the last one appears to have been fatally flawed. It's unclear if that will happen in North Carolina. But the state is going to remain a battlefield for the voting wars in 2019 and 2020; the Republican-drawn map was overturned by courts yet kept in place for the 2018 election. Democrats, having padded their majority on the state's court, are looking at the potential of a 2020 election fought on a new map, one likely to put Harris in a far less friendly district.\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nRep. Barbara Lee, with, from left, fellow California Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters, Jackie Speier, and Mark DeSaulnier, walks from Democratic caucus leadership elections on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nIt was overshadowed by the fight over whether to give Nancy Pelosi the speaker's gavel again, but the race for Democratic conference chair was galvanizing, and ultimately bitter, for the party's left. Rep. Barbara Lee (Calif.) fell just 11 votes short of securing the position, which she began seeking five months ago. She lost it to Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), a favorite of party leaders and a frequent TV spokesman for the party, who has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that could not clash more with that of the California congresswoman: a corporate lawyer who supports education policy unpopular with the left and opposes efforts to boycott Israel.\n\nThe irony, Democrats say, is that Jeffries's chance of winning a leadership job grew after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, the outgoing conference chairman, in a primary. With Crowley gone, the New York delegation, now up to 21 members, had no representation in the conference's top jobs. Lee, 72, also blamed \u201cageism\u201d for her loss to a 48-year-old party star; had she won, all of the conference's top jobs would have been held by members of Congress in their 70s.\n\nBut the possibility of putting Lee into party leadership had tantalized the left, which has lionized her ever since she cast the sole vote against authorizing military force in Afghanistan after Sept. 11, 2001. (That authorization is still in effect, used to justify interventions in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d without new congressional approval.) Just as the cycle began with a near miss for a party leadership position by the left (Keith Ellison's defeat in the DNC chair race), it ended with that wing of the party failing to put one of its own in the new House leadership.\n\nWhat will the repercussions be? We know that liberal groups such as Justice Democrats and Democracy for America were, in the weeks since the election, talking to potential challengers to incumbent Democrats in safe seats. We have also seen Indivisible and other pressure groups created or expanded since the 2016 election, protesting some of the Democrats who have resisted Nancy Pelosi's bid for speaker. The Lee defeat, if followed by any perceived moves by Jeffries to undermine the left, is going into the cocktail of reasons activists will continue to mobilize against politicians they see as \u201ccorporate\u201d Democrats.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\"Republicans didn't learn anything from the midterms,\u201d by Ronald Brownstein\n\nHas any party lost a midterm and asked so few questions about why? Brownstein investigates. Worth noting: In an interview today with The Post's Paul Kane, retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan said that on election night, it looked like the party had lost \u201conly\u201d less than 30 seats. That still would have been the party's worst House midterm since 2006.\n\n\u201cDemocrats blame Kirsten Gillibrand for Al Franken's fall,\u201d by Christina Cauterucci\n\nA corrective to the donors who say that New York's senator ended Franken's career to help her own: \u201cWomen who\u2019ve been moved for the first time to progressive activism by the #MeToo movement and the presidency of an accused sexual abuser could easily be disillusioned by a party without principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cPro-Bernie group hacked in quarter-million-dollar email scam,\u201d by Scott Bland\n\nOur Revolution, founded by Sanders but not involved with him day-to-day, got taken by a complicated con.\n\n\u201cThe suburbs may not be as progressive as Democrats like, but they could be,\u201d by Sara Jones\n\nAn answer to a series of left-wing election analyses that speculated that the Democrats' gains in formerly Republican suburbs would prevent the party from embracing policy radicalism.\n\nCOUNTDOWN\n\n... four days until Sen.

But Fox News accidentally aired an unscheduled moment of clarity on Monday, when Jesse Watters tried to set up Geraldo Rivera for another round of bashing other media outlets' coverage of the migrant caravan on The Five.\n\n\n\nRivera, however, did not take the bait. Talking through Watters' attempts to interrupt him, Rivera made a passionate plea, presumably to Fox News itself, to cover these immigrants as though they were actually human beings. The show continued to run footage of the chaos that unfolded at the border as families ran from the Border Patrol's tear gas as Rivera delivered a monologue that's worth quoting in full.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Brooke Thomas\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Brooke Thomas\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Some legal experts speculated that it was a bid by Mr. Manafort for a presidential pardon even as he worked with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in hopes of a lighter sentence.\n\n\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president\u2019s personal lawyers, acknowledged the arrangement on Tuesday and defended it as a source of valuable insights into the special counsel\u2019s inquiry and where it was headed. Such information could help shape a legal defense strategy, and it also appeared to give Mr. Trump and his legal advisers ammunition in their public relations campaign against Mr. Mueller\u2019s office.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Brett Erlich\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Brett Erlich\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Jeffries, 48, sought the position by arguing that he was best-equipped to represent the multitude of viewpoints in the Democratic Caucus.

So yesterday on twitter, Donald Trump came up with the brilliant idea. Maybe we should just create a state run propaganda outlet to show the world how great Donald Trump truly is. Here is what Donald Trump tweeted over a series of tweets. While CNN doesn't do great in the United States based on ratings outside of the US, they have very little competition throughout the world. CNN has a powerful voice portraying the United States in an unfair and false way.\n\n\n\nSomething has to be done, including the possibility of the United States starting our own worldwide network to show the world the way we really are. Great. Um, okay. First and foremost, aside from this being a ridiculously stupid idea, there actually already is a state run media outlet. It's called Voice of America. Uh, the government funds it to the tune of about $220,000,000 every single year. So we already have what you're talking about Donald trump. The problem is their coverage of you is also not completely, uh, you know, great. Why? Because they're talking about what's actually happening in this country. So if you wanted to start a different worldwide network, as you call it, to show the United States the rest of the world, actually how great that United States is. What are you going to talk about? You can talk about the fact that we have people who are dying because they can't afford prescription drugs.\n\n\n\nPeople who are being given rejection letters because they can't afford a organ transplant. Uh, people in Alabama living in what the UN has called extreme poverty on fewer than $4 per day. You're going to show them all of the, uh, homeless veterans that we have that all the administrations in recent years of just kind of turned their back on. You got to show them images of us border agents, gassing children. Is that what makes America great? Are you going to show them footage of the Georgia election where the Republican literally stole the election from Stacey Abrams? You're going to show them that. What are you going to show him? Donald, you're going to show them the fact that you're still out there riling up these disgusting human beings in your rally who were chanting, lock her up while ignoring the fact that your very own daughter and many other members of your administration did the exact same thing that you want Hillary Clinton locked up for.\n\n\n\nIs that what you're going to show them? What exactly do you want your worldwide network to show? Donald? Tell us. Tell us what this programming is going to be. Because I can promise you, if you want to show the rest of the world what America is really like, all it's going to do is lower their opinion of us here in the United States. We are running out of things to be proud of right now. Again, people are dying because they can't afford their prescription drugs. We have an administration. You Mr Trump, who says that climate change doesn't exist. We have Republicans in Congress who in spite of the massive climate change report, we just got say it doesn't exist. You are out there insulting the state of California after they suffered the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. You neglected Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria just left them to die."

Now, in case you're not familiar with it, a New York attorney general, Barbara Underwood, she spent two years investigating this case. Uh, you know, even before she became the age of New York, now that she is the age she is going forward, they have filed the suit against trump and his children, Ivanka, Don Junior, and Eric. And basically what happened was they took money into the trump foundation, millions of dollars. They then used it. Some of it was used to actually pay off lawsuits for Mara Lago. Some of it was used to benefit donald trump's presidential campaign and other parts of that big pot of money.\n\n\n\nWe're just used to pay people from the trump organization. Very little of it went to charity. And while that part's not illegal, using it to benefit a presidential campaign or using that money to pay off other lawsuits and settlements is 100 percent illegal. Donald trump and his lawyers had been trying to get this lawsuit thrown out, trying to argue that this judge overseeing the case does not in fact have jurisdiction over Donald Trump because he is a sitting president of the United States. Well, this judge, as well as the judge earlier in the summer, both ruled, yeah, we definitely have jurisdiction over you. This happened in New York. Were judges in New York, not sure where the disconnect is, but yes, we have jurisdiction over you and this case is going to move forward. The best thing about this case, other than the fact that multiple judges have now ruled that it's going forward because we have jurisdiction, is the fact that this is state law.\n\n\n\nSo if Donald Trump or any of his children are convicted, they can't be pardoned. You can't be pardoned for violating a state law. Only a federal law. So say for example, Donald Trump junior goes to prison for the misuse of charitable funds. There's literally nothing his father can do to get him out of prison. That would be legal. I'm sure there's plenty of things he could do that would be illegal, but you get what I'm saying. He can't save his children. He couldn't save himself if this thing goes to criminal proceedings right now it's just a civil suit, but if this civil suit goes the way that the prosecutor thinks said, well, it will 100 percent open up criminal liability against Donald trump and his children and if they go down for this, there is nothing that anyone can do to save them from going to prison and that's why this particular investigation lawsuit has the biggest potential out of all of the Donald Trump lawsuits or investigations to actually take him down and in his presidency. That is a long shot. It is not likely to happen, but there is still that glimmer of hope in there that maybe this particular investigation and lawsuit and potential criminal proceedings could possibly take down the trump administration. I'm not usually an optimistic person, but in this case I'm going to set aside a little bit of optimism and a little bit of hope that Barbara Underwood could be the hero that we desperately need in this country right now."

Nobody could come into this country seeking asylum. Last week, a federal judge ruled that, yes, yes, they can because Donald Trump does not have the authority to ban asylum seekers from coming into the United States, and the reason that Donald Trump does not have the authority to ban asylum seekers according to the judge's ruling, is that it was an act of Congress that approved the asylum program. In fact, there've been three different laws from Congress, I think, dating back to the early 19 fifties all the way through the nineties that mentioned refugees, asylum seekers, things like that that we have to let them in or we have to have a process by which they can come into the United States. All three of those at least, were approved by Congress and signed by the sitting president for Donald trump to come out in end of the program.\n\n\n\nThat would be a president overriding an act of Congress, which he does not have the authority to do. That's the issue here. That's what the judge ruled on and she said, no, you cannot do this. This is not within your realm of presidential powers. Here's the problem with this. First and foremost, we know that the trump administration is not listening to the judge. Instead of allowing asylum seekers to come in, we're shooting them with tear gas. Seeking asylum is not illegal. It is not a crime. Hell, even crossing the border illegally is not a federal crime. It's a misdemeanor, and yet the Donald Trump administration is treating these people as if they are already convicted felons by denying them asylum. So according to this judge, the asylum process has to be put back in place and then I think around December 19th, they're going to have another hearing to decide whether or not she has to permanently put a ban on trump's asylum ban in place.\n\n\n\nThe administration has said they're going to appeal this particular ruling and here's what could possibly happen. Either it goes all the way to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court says, no, Mr Trump, you cannot override an act of Congress. You can't ban asylum seekers. That's the best case scenario. Another possible scenario if that happens, is that trump could say, okay, I can't ban people from seeking asylum, but I do have the authority to set the number, so I'm setting the number each year at one one person. That's it. Unfortunately, he does have the authority to do that. He's already lowered the number since he came into office. It has lowered a, I think by about 20 to 30,000 people from last year to this year and that's what he could do. The even worse scenario is if the Supreme Court hears this case and comes back and says, yes, Mr. President, you have the authority to override an act of Congress.\n\n\n\nThat's going be the most damaging thing to ever happen to the United States of America. It will give Donald Trump a blank check to override any particular thing that he wants to do and not just trump. We're talking about any president down the line. I mean the very role, the limitation of powers of the US president could potentially go in front of this conservative majority Supreme Court. That's not gonna end well for anyone left or right, because eventually republicans aren't gonna have power anymore. Then what happens when you get a democratic person in there who says, I'm going to override these acts of Congress."

Now, in case you're not familiar with it, a New York attorney general, Barbara Underwood, she spent two years investigating this case. Uh, you know, even before she became the age of New York, now that she is the age she is going forward, they have filed the suit against trump and his children, Ivanka, Don Junior, and Eric. And basically what happened was they took money into the trump foundation, millions of dollars. They then used it. Some of it was used to actually pay off lawsuits for Mara Lago. Some of it was used to benefit donald trump's presidential campaign and other parts of that big pot of money.\n\n\n\nWe're just used to pay people from the trump organization. Very little of it went to charity. And while that part's not illegal, using it to benefit a presidential campaign or using that money to pay off other lawsuits and settlements is 100 percent illegal. Donald trump and his lawyers had been trying to get this lawsuit thrown out, trying to argue that this judge overseeing the case does not in fact have jurisdiction over Donald Trump because he is a sitting president of the United States. Well, this judge, as well as the judge earlier in the summer, both ruled, yeah, we definitely have jurisdiction over you. This happened in New York. Were judges in New York, not sure where the disconnect is, but yes, we have jurisdiction over you and this case is going to move forward. The best thing about this case, other than the fact that multiple judges have now ruled that it's going forward because we have jurisdiction, is the fact that this is state law.\n\n\n\nSo if Donald Trump or any of his children are convicted, they can't be pardoned. You can't be pardoned for violating a state law. Only a federal law. So say for example, Donald Trump junior goes to prison for the misuse of charitable funds. There's literally nothing his father can do to get him out of prison. That would be legal. I'm sure there's plenty of things he could do that would be illegal, but you get what I'm saying. He can't save his children. He couldn't save himself if this thing goes to criminal proceedings right now it's just a civil suit, but if this civil suit goes the way that the prosecutor thinks said, well, it will 100 percent open up criminal liability against Donald trump and his children and if they go down for this, there is nothing that anyone can do to save them from going to prison and that's why this particular investigation lawsuit has the biggest potential out of all of the Donald Trump lawsuits or investigations to actually take him down and in his presidency.

JOIN THE HOME OF PROGRESSIVES: https://go.tyt.com/Bfz-Ue6nA_w\n\n\n\nRead more here:\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/science/a...\n\n\n\n\"On Friday afternoon, the U.S. government published a major and ominous climate report. Despite being released on a holiday, when it seemed the smallest number of people would be paying attention, the latest installment of the National Climate Assessment is, as told to my colleague Robinson Meyer, full of \u201cinformation that every human needs.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead: A grave climate warning, buried on Black Friday\n\n\n\nThe report traces the effects climate change has already wrought upon every region of the United States, from nationwide heat waves to dwindling snowpacks in the West.

The border was reopened later Sunday evening.\n\n\n\nThe episode comes at a time of growing tension on both sides of the border and promised to become the newest flash point in the story of a caravan that was the target of President Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rallying cry during the midterm elections.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

    "text": "Ecosystems and the benefits they provide to society are being altered by climate change, and these impacts are projected to continue. Without substantial and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, transformative impacts on some ecosystems will occur; some coral reef and sea ice ecosystems are already experiencing such transformational changes.\n\nMany benefits provided by ecosystems and the environment, such as clean air and water, protection from coastal flooding, wood and fiber, crop pollination, hunting and fishing, tourism, cultural identities, and more will continue to be degraded by the impacts of climate change. Increasing wildfire frequency, changes in insect and disease outbreaks, and other stressors are expected to decrease the ability of U.S. forests to support economic activity, recreation, and subsistence activities. Climate change has already had observable impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, and the benefits they provide to society. These impacts include the migration of native species to new areas and the spread of invasive species. Such changes are projected to continue, and without substantial and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, extinctions and transformative impacts on some ecosystems cannot be avoided in the long term. Valued aspects of regional heritage and quality of life tied to ecosystems, wildlife, and outdoor recreation will change with the climate, and as a result, future generations can expect to experience and interact with the natural environment in ways that are different from today. Adaptation strategies, including prescribed burning to reduce fuel for wildfire, creation of safe havens for important species, and control of invasive species, are being implemented to address emerging impacts of climate change. While some targeted response actions are underway, many impacts, including losses of unique coral reef and sea ice ecosystems, can only be avoided by significantly reducing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases."

    "text": "Published on Nov 24, 2018\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker loves accepting political bribes. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down. JOIN THE HOME OF PROGRESSIVES: https://go.tyt.com/4x0Fhgo-kA0\n\n\n\nRead more here:\n\nhttps://tyt.com/stories/4vZLCHuQrYE4u...\n\n\n\n\"A new lawsuit by Senate Democrats is challenging Pres. Trump\u2019s appointment of Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker on its constitutionality, but details from a 2004 disclosure form suggest that Whitaker might not have been qualified for the job that actually launched his Justice Department career in the first place.\n\n\n\nWhitaker became U.S. attorney for Iowa\u2019s Northern District in June 2004 at the recommendation of Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), now the Judiciary Committee chair. Whitaker\u2019s appointment came at a time when the Justice Department was secretly rating federal prosecutors on their loyalty to Pres. Bush.\n\n\n\nAs TYT previously reported, the Justice Department has refused to release documents that could address accusations at the time that Whitaker put partisan politics above his duties as a federal prosecutor. And the experience that got Whitaker his position as U.S. attorney for Iowa\u2019s Southern District has not been closely examined.\n\n\n\nAs part of his Senate confirmation process, Whitaker submitted a disclosure form and questionnaire in which he gave relevant details about his background. Specifics supplied by Whitaker portray an attorney with no civil-rights experience and a minuscule number of criminal or federal cases under his belt.\n\n\n\nWhitaker was nominated for the position in February 2004, less than nine years after receiving his law degree from Iowa Law School in 1995. In the intervening period, he worked as a lawyer at three different private firms and as corporate counsel for a grocery chain, SuperValu. In the years leading up to his nomination, he said, he also pursued multiple business deals, serving as president or executive for at least three companies unrelated to the legal field.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more here:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/us...\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

More TYT: https://go.tyt.com/vCFq2kd3BHA\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/...\n\n\n\n\"But evidently, Trump still felt he had to do more to show voters that their lives were in grave danger, and to really drive home the point that he and his fellow Republicans were the only thing standing between them and Democrats enacting a new policy wherein for every migrant allowed to stay in the country, three U.S. citizens have to go live in Honduras. So he pulled out the big guns: he deployed some 6,000 active-duty troops to the southern border, which from the get-go was a patently obvious political stunt given that (a) the military couldn\u2019t even make arrests while they were there, and (b) the caravan was hundreds of miles away (and traveling on foot). Obviously, the whole thing failed to stop Democrats from flipping the House. But one would think that even this administration would understand it should see the stunt through a little while longer, so that it wasn\u2019t, like, completely crystal clear that the president of the United States had turned members of the military into pawns in one of his cheap tricks.

The remaining $6 billion is expected to be made available in December.\n\n\n\nThe Times writes that the program has been plagued by \u201cbureaucracy as well as practical challenges\u201d since its inception. Farmers are often told they must wait until they complete their harvests before applying for bailout funding, a process that\u2019s been slowed by poor weather conditions, and even then, receive far less than they might get during normal years.\"\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

So, we asked John to come on to Pineal Express and detail some of these trends. Our discussion covers how to influence voters' behavior and attitudes. Relatedly, it also covers how to understand the shape of American political media in light of an increasingly fast paced news cycle and ongoing Trump administration malfeasance."

    "text": "Adam Green is co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and the Progressive Change Institute.\n\nAmericans marched to the polls last week and validated a Democratic message that is a sea change from where the party stood just a few election cycles ago. The center of gravity within the Democratic Party and the general electorate has dramatically shifted in the direction of bold economic populism.\n\nUp and down the ballot, Democrats won by positioning themselves as advocates for working people \u2014 willing to challenge power and shake up a rigged political and economic system in order to make a tangible difference in the lives of their constituents. This reveals a clear path to victory for any Democrat thinking about running for president in 2020.\n\nGone are the days of 2013, when a respected Democratic president could propose cutting Social Security benefits by decreasing promised cost-of-living adjustments for seniors. Gone are the days when the Democratic solution to the disastrous Citizens United decision was merely a Disclose Act that would make more transparent the corporate buying of our democracy. And gone are the days when those proposing to fundamentally challenge Big Insurance company power were laughed out of the room.\n\nResearchers from the Progressive Change Institute analyzed how every winning Democratic candidate for the House campaigned in 2018 \u2014 including their campaign ads, websites, social media and many debate performances. The resulting data shows that 65 percent of the incoming House freshman class embraced some version of Medicare-for-all or expanding Social Security benefits. Almost 80 percent embraced lowering prescription drug costs by challenging Big Pharma. And 82 percent favored challenging corporate power in our political system by rejecting corporate PAC money, passing a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United or passing campaign finance reform such as public financing of elections.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias reported, this stands in stark contrast to \u201cwhat a moderate Democrat looked like in the very recent past.\u201d In 2014,a typical moderate Democrat \u201cbragged about voting with John Boehner a majority of the time, and ran against cap and trade and the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nNothing better encapsulates this change than the shifting Democratic consensus on Social Security.\n\nIn 2013, President Barack Obama proposed a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Republicans that would reduce future Social Security payments to seniors in exchange for higher taxes on the wealthy. Many congressional Democrats were willing to go along, despite the fact that the Republican positions on both Social Security and taxes were unpopular.\n\nProgressives realized that if the entire scope of debate on Social Security was cutting benefits or doing nothing, the most we would ever win is nothing. So instead, we worked with former senators Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Mark Begich (D-Alaska) on legislation that would expand benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered a shot in the arm for the idea in November 2013 with an impassioned speech that endorsed expanding Social Security.\n\nCorporate-backed Democrats immediately lashed out. Leaders at Third Way, a think tank predominantly funded by Wall Street executives, took to the pages of the Wall Street Journal to warn Democrats not to follow Warren \u201cover the populist cliff.\u201d They called expanding Social Security \u201cexhibit A of this populist political and economic fantasy.\u201d\n\nBut they were too late \u2014 a seismic shift was happening. Warren partnered with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on legislation to expand Social Security benefits in March 2015 that won support from 42 of 44 Democratic or Independent senators who voted. In 2016, Hillary Clinton called for expanding Social Security in debates and in her national convention speech \u2014 and many House and Senate Democratic candidates followed suit.\n\nThis year, Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) was perceived as a \u201cmoderate\u201d when he won a special election in a nearly 20-point Trump district. But his TV ads focused on protecting Social Security and Medicare from cuts, rejecting corporate PAC money and fighting for workers. In September, he led 150 congressional Democrats in launching the Expand Social Security Caucus \u2014 serving as co-chair with Warren and others.\n\nEven Third Way did an about-face \u2014 recently calling for the government to supplement Social Security with private savings accounts. (Of course, this proposal helps Wall Street, but this nonetheless cedes the shift from cuts to expanded benefits.)\n\nThe trajectory is clear, and corporate Democrats are in denial, arguing in a Post op-ed that progressive populism was \u201cclose to shut out\u201d in last week\u2019s midterms and that \u201cmainstream Democrats\u201d won. They are right about one thing, though: Mainstream Democrats did win in 2018.\n\nCandidates who promised to stand up for working people, challenge powerful interests and shake up a rigged political and economic system won up and down the ballot \u2014 including more than 300 candidates supported by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Bold, progressive, economic-populist ideas are the mainstream. They won. And they are key to defeating President Trump in 2020."

With support from an LGBTQ advocacy organization, this group of about 80 mostly-LGBTQ people split off from the rest of the group after experiencing discrimination both from the communities along the way and from fellow travelers.\n\n\n\nDuring a news conference Sunday, Honduran migrant Cesar Mejia explained, 'Whenever we arrived at a stopping point the LGBT community was the last to be taken into account in every way. So our goal was to change that and say, \u2018This time we are going to be first.'' That mistreatment reportedly included being denied food and access to showers, even by local groups providing aid to others in the caravan.\n\n\n\nAccording to Mejia, advocacy groups reached out after they arrived in Mexican territory and helped bus them ahead to the border.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Rep.-elect Rashida Tlaib of Michigan joined the protesters in a rally at the Spirit of Justice Park near the Capitol on Tuesday morning, but she did not continue on to Pelosi\u2019s office. \u201cThis is the most American thing you can do,\u201d Tlaib said of the protest. Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib also attended an event with the Sunrise activists on Monday night.\n\nBut this was no ordinary protest for the Sunrise activists, who typically stand on the opposite side of politicians. This time, they were joined by Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is just weeks away from being sworn into office.\n\nProtesters with the environmental group Sunrise marched on Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office on Tuesday. The group, made up of young people pushing for urgent action on climate change, planned to send a clear message to party leadership just one week after Democrats regained control of the House.\n\nMembers of the progressive political group Justice Democrats also joined the protest, which was attended by more than 150 people. \u201cNancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party leadership must get serious about the climate and our economy,\u201d said the group\u2019s communications director, Waleed Shahid, in a statement. \u201cAnything less is tantamount to denying the reality of climate change. The hopeful part is that we\u2019re ushering in a new generation of leaders into the Democratic Party who understand the urgency and will help build a movement to create the political will for bold action.\u201d\n\nA recent United Nations report found that catastrophic effects of climate change, some of which are already upon us, could become widespread as early as 2040. To stave off the crisis, the globe\u2019s economy would have to be put on the equivalent of a war footing, scientists involved with the study concluded.\n\nThe protesters, including Ocasio-Cortez, are calling on Pelosi to create and give teeth to a new select committee on climate change.\n\nThe proposed committee, called the Select Committee for a Green New Deal, would be similar to something Pelosi established as House speaker in 2007, but with more authority. Back then, Pelosi created the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, and assigned her ally, then-Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., who has a strong environmental record, to chair it. The committee held dozens of hearings over the course of four years, until the tea party-led Congress, which took over in 2010, mothballed it. (The Republicans also got rid of the renewable plates and utensils Pelosi had introduced and replaced them with Styrofoam.)\n\nThe problem with that committee, Ocasio-Cortez and the Sunrise activists argue, was that it wasn\u2019t funded well enough and didn\u2019t have the true ability to write legislation. In 2009, Pelosi pushed through cap-and-trade legislation, meant to reduce emissions. But even that package moved largely through the Energy and Commerce Committee \u2014 not the select committee Pelosi had created. Markey, who chaired a subcommittee under Energy and Commerce, played a lead role in pushing through the bill, which became known as the Waxman-Markey bill, but it never came to a floor vote in the Senate. Some activists argued that it wasn\u2019t robust enough to meet the threat of climate change, while defenders argued it was the best the chamber could do \u2014 and, as it turned out, it was far better than the Senate could do.\n\nPhoto: Briahna Gray/The Intercept\n\nSince then, the global climate situation has only deteriorated, with once-in-a-century storms taking place with harrowing frequency, and drought conditions sparking war and mass migration. Dozens of people have died in still-raging fires in California that are the deadliest in the state\u2019s modern history, and hundreds more are missing. \u201cResting on our laurels won\u2019t bring back the 42 lives lost,\u201d said Sunrise activist Varshini Prakash, referring to the deaths in California.\n\nThe proposed committee would, among other things, establish a 10-year plan to transition the U.S. economy to become carbon neutral, according to draft legislation that the activists presented to Pelosi\u2019s office. The activists are also pushing Democratic leaders to reject campaign contributions from fossil fuel industry groups. \u201cWe need every person who is going to claim the mantle of Democratic leadership to take the no fossil fuel money pledge,\u201d Prakash said at the sit-in outside Pelosi\u2019s office.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s decision to join the protesters and march on her own House leader sets a tone of urgency and combativeness that is rare on Capitol Hill. Walking into the Cannon House Office Building, she told The Intercept something new had to be tried. \u201cThe way things are done has not been getting results. We have to try new methods,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi may need Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support to win a second shot at the speakership. The California Democrat can only lose roughly 20 votes on the House floor, and already at least 10 Democrats, largely moderates and conservatives, have said they will not back her. Pelosi has expressed \u201c100 percent\u201d confidence that she\u2019ll be elected speaker."

American intelligence agencies have assessed that Russia hacked the emails of Democratic groups, including Hillary Clinton's campaign, and provided that material to WikiLeaks for release.\n\n\n\nCorsi was formally the Washington bureau chief of the conspiracy theory outlet InfoWars.\""

Those four defeats come after five other Republicans on the committee already left mid-term or decided to retire.\n\n\n\nWith three more committee members running for other offices, come January, half of the 24 Republicans who wrote the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will no longer be in Congress.\n\n\n\nThose tax cuts, designed to create jobs, have widely been viewed as President Trump\u2019s signature legislative achievement. Nonetheless, their emphasis on business taxes tended to favor the wealthy over the middle-class \u2014 and proved broadly unpopular in the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s election.\u201d\n\n\n\nHost: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, breaks it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation...\n\n\n\n\u201cKellyanne Conway doesn\u2019t think the controversial video shared by the White House of CNN reporter Jim Acosta refusing to let go of the microphone during President Trump\u2019s news conference last week was altered. The widely criticized clip was merely \u201csped up,\u201d she said Sunday.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace, the White House counselor known for coining the term \u201calternative facts\u201d was trying to defend the administration\u2019s decision to promote a video experts say was edited to make Acosta\u2019s actions toward a White House intern seem more aggressive than they were. The video, which at first looks authentic, shows Acosta\u2019s arm swiftly coming down on the arm of the young female aide who is trying to take the microphone from him. Missing from the seconds-long clip is Acosta saying, \u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am,\u201d as he maintains a firm grip on the microphone and continues peppering Trump with questions.\n\n\n\nWallace asked Conway on Sunday about the White House\u2019s responses to what he described as the \u201cnow infamous confrontation\u201d that disrupted Trump\u2019s post-midterms news conference.

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, breaks it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://theintercept.com/2018/11/11/r...\n\n\n\n\u201cRICHARD OJEDA IS running for president. Ojeda, a West Virginia state senator and retired U.S. Army major, lost his congressional bid in the state\u2019s 3rd District on Tuesday, but saw the largest swing of Trump voters toward Democrats in any district around the country \u2014 overperforming 2016 by more than 35 points. Still, in a district that Donald Trump carried by 49 points, Ojeda, who rose to prominence because of his support for teachers strike in West Virginia, lost by 12 points.\n\n\n\nOjeda\u2019s case for his candidacy is straightforward: The Democratic Party has gotten away from its roots, and he has a unique ability to win over a white, black, and brown working-class coalition by arguing from a place of authority that Trump is a populist fraud. He\u2019s launching his campaign with an anti-corruption focus that draws a contrast with Trump\u2019s inability to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis authority \u2014 and one of his greatest liabilities \u2014 would come, in part, from his own previous support of Trump in the 2016 general election. After backing Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary, Ojeda refused to support Hillary Clinton, seeing her as an embodiment of the party\u2019s drift toward the elite.\u201d\n\n\n\nHost: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

However, Trump was in Paris commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\n\n\nTrump made a number of blunders in Paris, including canceling a visit to an American military cemetery near Paris because it was raining. The White House claimed Trump canceled the visit because the Marine One helicopter cannot fly in rain, but at another ceremony on Sunday, the president made a comment about how a World War II veteran was being kept dry under shelter as he stood in the rain giving a speech.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHost: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Cenk Uygur, Adrienne Lawrence, and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here:\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/n...\n\n\n\n\"A Texas judge who lost re-election released almost all the juvenile defendants that appeared before him Wednesday, a move that drew criticism from local prosecutors.\n\n\n\nJudge Glenn Devlin, a juvenile court judge in Harris County, Texas, simply asked his defendants whether they planned to kill anyone before approving their release, the Houston Chronicle reported.\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many defendants were released, but the Chronicle reported at least seven.

Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, and Joe Sanberg, hosts of The Young Turks, breaks it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-...\n\n\n\n\"But for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the explanation was simple. The candidates who underperformed weren\u2019t progressive enough; those who didn\u2019t shy away from progressivism were undone, in part, by \u201cracist\u201d attacks.\n\n\n\n'I think you know there are a lot of white folks out there who are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an African-American,' Sanders told The Daily Beast, referencing the close contests involving Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia and ads run against the two. 'I think next time around, by the way, it will be a lot easier for them to do that.'\n\n\n\nSanders wasn\u2019t speaking as a mere observer but, rather, as someone who had invested time and reputation on many of the midterm contests. The Vermonter, who is potentially considering another bid for the presidency in 2020, mounted an aggressive campaign travel schedule over the past few months and endorsed both Abrams and Gillum. He also has a personal political investment in the notion that unapologetic, authentic progressive populism can be sold throughout the country and not just in states and districts that lean left.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHost: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Joe Sanberg\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Joe Sanberg\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, breaks it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us...\n\n\n\n\"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a critical liberal voice on the Supreme Court, was hospitalized on Thursday morning with three broken ribs after falling in her office the day before.\n\n\n\nJustice Ginsburg, 85, went home after her fall on Wednesday evening and experienced discomfort during the night, a Supreme Court spokeswoman, Kathy Arberg, said in a statement. She was admitted to George Washington University Hospital on Thursday morning for observation and treatment. Doctors found three broken ribs on her left side.\n\n\n\nThe next sitting of the Supreme Court begins Nov. 26, and Justice Ginsburg\u2019s history suggests the injuries are not likely to keep her away. She broke two ribs in 2012, without missing work. And she returned to work quickly after undergoing a heart procedure in 2012. She is also a cancer survivor and returned to work less than three weeks after having surgery.\n\n\n\nJustice Ginsburg is the linchpin of the four-member liberal minority on a Supreme Court that has shifted ideologically to the right under President Trump. In less than two years in office, he has appointed two justices, and he has vowed to fill any further openings with more staunch conservatives.

Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, breaks it down.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://www.npr.org/2018/11/08/665875...\n\n\n\n\"The Trump administration is taking steps to stem the flow of Central American migrants crossing the U.S. border from Mexico.\n\n\n\nThe administration issued a new rule Thursday designed to prohibit migrants who cross the border outside of designated entry points from seeking asylum in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe measure is almost certain to face legal challenges. Advocates say federal law allows anyone on U.S. soil to petition for asylum, even if that person crossed the border illegally.\n\n\n\nThe administration wants to get around that provision by using the president's broad authority to exclude any immigrant \u2014 or class of immigrants \u2014 deemed 'detrimental to the interests of the United States.' That's the same authority the president used when he issued his travel ban on a variety of mostly Muslim countries. That ban was initially blocked by the courts but after several revisions was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHost: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.

'There are so many people at that location, if they converge on the shooter, it\u2019ll stop it.'\n\n\n\n'Granted, someone may get shot,' he said.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Published on Nov 8, 2018\n\nAmerica has always been hugely influential in the international community. In 2015, Obama & Hillary led the charge at the Paris Climate Summit \u2013 and made caring about your neighbors and the environment cool again.\n\n\n\nFast-forward to 2018, America doesn\u2019t seem to care about it\u2019s future anymore - they\u2019re kind of like that kid in college that started out real well... but then started ditching classes and going drinking Fosters at 11.30 in the morning\u2026\n\n\n\nNow, the Paris Climate Agreement would still work if every country except America stuck to it. But America\u2019s bad example is leading lots of young influential nations astray.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a few examples my country\u2026 Australia.\n\n\n\nWhich signed the Paris Agreement and promised to build a 100 billion dollar fund to help developing countries transition to a low-carbon economy... buuuut after Trump, the right wing Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was thrown out in favor of an even MORE right wing Prime Minister Scott Morrison - who just declared Australia\u2019s NOT going to contribute anything at all, and also they\u2019re going to keep burning coal and they\u2019re not gonna stick to their climate targets and also they\u2019re not, and I quote: \u201cspending money on global climate conferences and all that nonsense.\u201d\n\n\n\nOr Brazil - for the last 20 years they\u2019ve been making dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and in 2017 bragged about how it was going to plant more than 70 million trees to help reforest the Amazon.\n\n\n\nBut Brazil they\u2019ve just had their first round of their presidential elections, and bloke with the most votes, Jair Bolsonaro, aka Brazil\u2019s Donald Trump says he\u2019ll pull Brazil out of the Climate Agreement and open up the rainforest to agribusiness. GOOD STUFF.\n\n\n\nOr in Turkey, which signed the Paris climate agreement, but after Trump pulled out, their president said \"the position that we adopt is in the direction of not passing it in parliament,\"\n\n\n\nTurkey is one of the few countries that STILL hasn\u2019t ratified the agreement, since Trump pulled out, they\u2019ve basically said \u2018screw it\u2019 on renewable energy and re-invested in coal. They\u2019re now moving full *steam* ahead on a stack of new coal power plants, which will increase annual Turkish emissions by 40%. On ya, Turkey!\n\n\n\nNow this thing of - \u2018what happened in Paris can stay in Paris\u2019 \u2013 is becoming more and more problematic - not just because we only have a few years left to avoid a climate apocalypse, but of this - The United Nations Katowice Climate Change Conference - that\u2019s coming up in December in Poland. It\u2019s the biggest climate meeting since Paris. Most countries are making their plans now - but Trump leading everyone in the wrong direction is making it almost impossible for countries to work together on something they can all agree on. Katowice is possibly the moment when any hope for global collaboration could go down down the shitter.\n\n\n\nCome on America \u2013\u2013 you\u2019re ruining this whole planet thing for everyone.\n\n\n\nBut what do you guys think? Do you think Trump\u2019s setting a bad example for the rest of the world?

Whitaker, who had been serving as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff.\n\n\n\n'We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!' Trump tweeted.

    "text": "So, Democrats seize control of the House, Republicans increase their majority in the Senate. Where does that leave us?\n\nA deeply divided country with no real consensus about major questions of leadership tone, direction, or major policies (foreign or domestic.)\n\nThe President is somewhat weakened but still in an overall position of comparative political strength. He\u2019ll soon be forced to face more questions and investigations from the new Democratic-controlled house, and new challenges from the wide-ranging Mueller probe.\n\nThe race for the next Presidential nominations begins in earnest today, complicating things further and adding to a public sense of dysfunction and mendacity in Washington.\n\nThe wild ride we, as a people, as a nation, have been on for awhile figures to continue. The deep divide gets deeper. Optimism about the long-range outlook remains the best recommendation. But in the short and medium range, optimism will not come easily. Grab a handhold on hope and hang on."

Hundreds wrote long essays about their families and communities. They go to prominent megachurches as well as small Southern Baptist, nondenominational and even mainline Protestant congregations.

As President Trump wrapped up the midterm election cycle with a late-night rally on Monday in southeast Missouri, he was joined by a trio of conservative media rock stars.\n\n\n\nIntroducing the president as he stumped for Republican candidates was Rush Limbaugh, the radio host who was born and raised in Cape Girardeau. Then after Mr. Trump took the microphone, he invited two Fox News personalities, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro, to join him onstage, where each also delivered a short speech backing the president.\n\n\n\nThe participation of the Fox hosts in a political rally struck even executives at the network as inappropriate. \u201cFox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events,\u201d the network said in a statement on Tuesday. 'We have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight, and we are extremely proud of their work.

She wrote it, her T-shirt said it, she said it, and she even sang it \u2014 vote.\n\n\n\n'I heard people are making racist robocalls in my name against Stacey Abrams, who I am 100 percent for in Georgia. I just want to say, Jesus don\u2019t like ugly,' Oprah said in an Instagram video captioned, 'The antidote to Hate... VOTE your love!'\n\n\n\nOprah on Thursday campaigned for Abrams during two rallies and joined her as she canvassed door-to-door. Abrams, who is in the midst of a tight race against President Donald Trump-backed Republican candidate Brian Kemp, would be the first black female governor in U.S. history.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHosts: Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz\n\n\n\nCast: Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe Largest Online News Show in the World.
