    "text": "H E SEEMS to have been a classic \u201clone wolf\u201d. As far as police can tell, the man who murdered 50 worshippers, and critically wounded nine more, at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15th was not part of any organisation. The 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, claimed to have developed his violent beliefs on his own, surfing the internet and visiting Europe. He bought his weapons himself. He honed his skills at a suburban shooting-range. No one there suspected that he was preparing a massacre.\n\nYet he was part of something much bigger. The names and slogans scrawled on his weapons were familiar to extreme white nationalists all around the world\u2014but hardly anyone else. His ranting internet manifesto, \u201cThe Great Replacement\u201d, repeated a staple far-right conspiracy theory: that non-white and Muslim immigrants in Western countries are invaders, ushered in by scheming elites to replace ethnic-European populations. Variants of that once-fringe idea are now common, not just in social-media posts by anonymous wackos but in the speeches of elected politicians from Hungary to Iowa.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn another sense, too, the lone wolf had a pack. Attacks by neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other extreme-right types are growing more common. In America they outnumber those committed by Islamists. Of 263 domestic terrorism incidents in 2010-17, fully 92 were carried out by far-right attackers, compared with 38 by jihadists, according to an analysis of the Global Terrorism Database by the Washington Post. In Europe jihadist killings still predominate, but deaths from extreme-right terrorism have surged since 2010 (see chart).\n\nThe past six months have seen a rash of far-right terrorist incidents. Last autumn a white nationalist killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. France broke up a plot to kill Emmanuel Macron, the president, and Spain arrested a fascist hoping to assassinate Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the prime minister. Germany uncovered an extremist cell in the army, allegedly planning to kill the foreign minister and others. In February America\u2019s FBI arrested a Coast Guard officer who had an arsenal and a target-list of Democratic politicians.\n\nGlobally, white-nationalist terrorism is far less deadly than the jihadist variety. But it is more prevalent than authorities acknowledge, says Jacob Aasland Ravndal of Norway\u2019s Centre for Research on Extremism. Legal definitions of terrorism often require that an attack be planned in advance. Much extreme-right violence is spontaneous. Even burning down a refugee centre may count as a hate crime, not terrorism. Europol, the EU \u2019s law-enforcement agency, ascribed just 3% of terrorist attacks in 2017 to the far right. But Mr Ravndal\u2019s database of ideologically motivated violent incidents shows that in western Europe, though jihadists kill more people, the far right carry out more attacks.\n\nMore right than they know\n\nIf the threat from white nationalists is underestimated, that is partly because they are more publicity-shy. Mr Tarrant and his hero, Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011, were exceptions. They left manifestos and tried to maximise media exposure. Indeed, the Christchurch killer also resembled sophisticated jihadist outfits, both in the ostentatious cruelty of his crime and in his hope that it would polarise society, fuelling yet more extremism.\n\nThe Breivik tradition\n\nIslamic State tries to provoke the West into persecuting Muslims and thus driving sympathisers from the \u201cgrey zone\u201d towards radical participation. Right-wing extremists may also hope to provoke an Islamist backlash. Police are investigating a possible terrorist motive behind the murder of three people on a tram in Utrecht in the Netherlands, three days after the massacre in Christchurch. A Turkish-born suspect has been arrested.\n\nIn Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has seized on the attack in Christchurch as evidence of a broad conspiracy against Turkey and Islam. He has quoted from the killer\u2019s manifesto, which includes calls to expel Turks from Europe and to kill Mr Erdogan. The president\u2019s not-so-subtle message is that only he can protect Turks from rampant white nationalism.\n\nThe Christchurch killer also hoped to provoke stricter gun laws, so that gun-owners would rise up in revolt. There is not much chance of more gun control in America, Mr Tarrant\u2019s primary target. However, Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, is moving to tighten her country\u2019s lax gun laws. This will not start a civil war. New Zealand prides itself on multiculturalism (see article). Its politics are more moderate than Australia\u2019s.\n\nThat, along with its easy gun laws, may have been why Mr Tarrant picked New Zealand. He wrote that he wanted to prove that nowhere was safe. Muslims in Christchurch have lost all sense of security. Tofazzal Alam, who survived the attack, says he is now afraid \u201cto go to mosque, afraid of any crowd, afraid even to open the door\u201d.\n\nYet the killer\u2019s manifesto was inspired by events far away in Europe. He claimed he was converted to radical-right ideology on a trip to France in 2017, when he saw how much of the population was Muslim. He decorated his flak jacket with a \u201cblack sun\u201d, a symbol traced to a floor motif used in his castle by Heinrich Himmler, a Nazi leader. He decorated his weapons with the names of victims of jihadist attacks in Stockholm and Paris. Before the shootings, he listened in his car to \u201cGod is a Serb\u201d, a song written in 1993 in support of Radovan Karadzic\u2014a Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide for his role in the massacre of 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995.\n\nThe idea that Muslims and non-whites are \u201cinvaders\u201d imported by a cosmopolitan elite to replace ethnic Europeans has its roots in thinkers of the French \u201cnew right\u201d of the 1970s, such as Alain de Benoist and Renaud Camus. It is often linked to the belief that multicultural societies, far from promoting diversity, extinguish it by mixing distinct cultures and races together. The nuttiest apostles of such notions equate immigration with genocide.\n\nThese ideas attracted the anti-Muslim populist politicians who sprung up across Europe around the turn of the millennium, especially after the September 11th attacks in America. They inspired the far-right youth network Generation Identity. But the big impetus came in 2015-16, when some 2m asylum-seekers, mostly from the Middle East, poured into Europe.\n\nFor right-wing populists, this crisis was a godsend. Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, built a fence against the migrants and began calling himself a defender of Christian Europe. A frenzied opposition to Muslim immigration (real or imaginary) is the lodestar of populist-right parties in Germany, Poland, Sweden and Italy. At the European Parliament this month, Javier Ortega Smith of Vox, a new far-right Spanish party, thundered that had Spanish and Venetian fleets not won the battle of Lepanto against the Turks in 1571, every female MEP \u201cwould be wearing a burqa\u201d.\n\nDaniel Koehler of the German Institute on Radicalisation and De-radicalisation Studies says that it is no coincidence that extreme-right violence jumped during the migrant crisis, along with the fortunes of far-right parties: \u201cIf you think you have \u2026to protect against \u2018invaders\u2019\u2014how do you do that without using force?\u201d\n\nIn America, too, the rise in extreme-right violence is linked to mainstream politics. Between 2009 and 2018, white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists. In 2016, the year Donald Trump won the presidency, more anti-Muslim assaults were reported to the FBI (127) than in any year since 2001 (93).\n\nSuch attacks rose steeply after Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008. Daryl Johnson, who spent 15 years studying right-wing terrorist groups, including at the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ), wrote a paper in 2009 warning that the arrival that year of a black person in the White House could spark far-right violence. Demonised by conservatives for this, he left the DHS in 2010. Today, he says, it has no experts in right-wing terrorism. A spokesman did not deny this, but, in an email, said that the DHS is \u201ccommitted to combating all forms of violent extremism, especially those that espouse racial supremacy or bigotry\u201d.\n\nIn denial\n\nMr Trump has played down the threat of right-wing extremists, calling them \u201ca small group of people that have very, very serious problems\u201d. In 2017 his administration cancelled grants to groups combating white-supremacism. Peter Singer, a cyber-security expert at the New America Foundation who was invited to speak to Mr Trump\u2019s national-security staff that year, said that they dismissed white-supremacist terrorism as \u201ca law-enforcement issue\u201d, and denied that it is transnational.\n\nIn fact, the ties between American and European extreme-right groups are ever closer. Europe\u2019s Generation Identity groups are linked to Identity Evropa, one of the the American far-right organisations that planned a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, where a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd and killed a counter-protester. Marchers at that rally chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d, referring to the same \u201cgreat replacement\u201d thesis shared by European extremists and the Christchurch killer.\n\nMr Trump has played the role for American white nationalists that such leaders as Mr Orban played for Europe\u2019s, says Brian Levin, who heads the Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. These groups, he says, saw their ideas, such as building a wall like Mr Orban\u2019s, and banning or deporting Muslims, \u201cgetting into the mainstream tent\u201d. They took this as a \u201cgreen light\u201d for violence. And he notes that, like the young on Europe\u2019s extremist right, they have softened their image in the past decade. Shaved heads and combat boots have given way to army haircuts, polo shirts and corduroy jackets.\n\nFar-right groups lack the state sponsors and safe havens enjoyed by some jihadists. Many on the extreme right admire Russia but it does not fit the bill. It has cultivated ties with far-right parties in Europe, but has snuffed out extremists at home. In the 2000s hate-motivated attacks, often directed at immigrants and internal migrants from the north Caucasus, reached nearly 700 a year, as the state flirted with nationalist movements. Clashes in Moscow in 2011 between police and far-right groups mixed with football hooligans showed the dangers of tolerating the ultranationalists. After they joined anti-government protests in 2011-12, the state began shutting them down, detaining the most violent. In 2014 war with Ukraine split the movement into pro-government and pro-Ukrainian factions. The SOVA Centre, an independent monitor, recorded just 57 hate-motivated attacks in 2018.\n\nThe Ukrainian model\n\nOther Western white nationalists look to Ukraine itself, a hotbed of far-right activity since the Maidan uprising in 2014. Quasi-fascist militias, such as the Azov Battalion, have fought Russia in the east and taken a role in policing. So Kiev is \u201ca place of attraction for the global far-right\u201d, says Anton Shekhovtsov, of the University of Vienna. Some European radicals have joined Ukrainians on the front lines. American white supremacists have been spotted in Kiev. But as Mr Shekhovtsov puts it, \u201cmigration is a first-world problem\u201d, and, whereas earlier far-right groups would beat up foreigners from Africa and Asia, Azov is keener on disrupting gay-pride marches. In any case, Ukrainian men seeking romantic violence have plenty to do in the east.\n\nA more pressing concern for Western governments is far-right radicalism within their armed forces. Soldiers, obviously, are trained and have access to weapons. In America the DHS warned a decade ago that right-wing extremists will attempt to \u201crecruit and radicalise\u201d veterans, recalling the terrorist attacks of the 1990s by bitter ex-soldiers, such as the Oklahoma City bombing. A study of 119 lone-actor terrorists across America and Europe since 1990 found that 26% had done military service.\n\nRacial tension is rising in the armed services. A recent poll by Military Times, a newspaper, found that over half of non-white American service members had suffered racism in 2018, up from 42% in the previous year. In 2017 two marines were arrested for hanging a white-supremacist banner on a building in North Carolina. On March 18th the Huffington Post, a news website, identified seven serving American soldiers as active in Identity Evropa.\n\nThe German authorities are investigating some 450 cases of suspected right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr. Last year the security services identified dozens of police and soldiers as members of Reichsb\u00fcrger, a far-right movement. In Britain in September 2017 four soldiers were arrested for membership of National Action, a banned neo-Nazi group. \u201cIf we get enough of us into the Army,\u201d suggested one, \u201cwe\u2019ll be in the right place when things start to collapse.\u201d\n\nArmies are tightening their vetting procedures and becoming more vigilant. They insist that adherence to law is drilled into recruits. But, for good reason, most armed forces are prohibited from conducting political education.\n\nTracking sources of danger is hard because, as Mr Koehler, the German scholar, points out, far-right violence typically involves loose groups of individuals radicalised on social media. He calls this \u201chive terrorism\u201d. It is practically impossible to predict when someone will go from wishing others dead to actually killing them.\n\nThe Christchurch killer is a perfect example. He spent time on 8chan, a messageboard that prides itself on allowing users to post anything not illegal under American law. (After the attack, its administrators said they would co-operate with police.) It concerns itself with everything from Japanese cartoons to role-playing games. Anonymous posting is the norm.\n\nThe board\u2019s \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d subsections are far-right haunts. Their culture is a self-consciously puerile mishmash of memes, absurdism and irony, making it hard to know how seriously to take anything posted there. When Mr Tarrant declared on 8chan that he was about to commit murder, and proceeded to live-stream it on Facebook, many replies expressed surprise (often pleased) that the promised shooting spree was actually happening.\n\nThe killer\u2019s manifesto, too, is steeped in 8chan-like irony, a style sometimes termed \u201cshitposting\u201d. Serious rants about low European birth-rates alternate with claims to have been radicalised by \u201cSpyro the Dragon 3\u201d, a children\u2019s video game. If the media took such claims seriously, they would prove their own cluelessness.\n\nSince the attacks, there have been calls for internet platforms to do a better job of restricting violent right-wing content. Facebook has been blamed for letting the live-stream of the attack go on for 17 minutes. The platform says it began vigorously blocking the video as soon as it discovered it, removing 1.5m attempts to repost it. But internet users could still find copies hours after the attack. (It did not help that some \u201cmainstream\u201d media sites\u2014and even Mr Erdogan\u2014used some of it.)\n\nBig internet platforms could do more, but they face a gargantuan task. The underlying problem, says Ben Nimmo of the Oxford Internet Institute, is that \u201cradicalising content is not constant\u201d\u2014one viewer\u2019s trigger to violence is another\u2019s harmless satire. Hopes that artificial intelligence might do much of the filtering have not worked out; armies of human reviewers are still needed, and even they often err.\n\nHowever hard it is to stop terrorists exploiting the internet, other citizens can, at least, refuse to help them. The Christchurch killer\u2019s fixation on the former Yugoslavia is apt: as in that war, white nationalists seek to use spectacular violence and propaganda to turn citizens against each other. In New Zealand Ms Ardern has turned this on its head. She has tried to use horrific slaughter to unite a country in opposition to a creed whose most famous new exponent she refuses to name."

    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "J UAN IS GRATEFUL for New York\u2019s bottle bill, which imposes a refundable nickel deposit on bottles and cans of water, soda and beer. He and his wife earn about $500 a week by collecting empties from recycling bins, bars and restaurants in Bushwick, Brooklyn, which they trade for money at a local redemption centre. Their jangling cart is among the many that helped the state recycle over 5bn drinks containers in 2016. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, now wants to expand the bill to cover most non-alcoholic containers, to help fight litter and boost recycling throughout the state. Juan and his wife are delighted. Companies that handle the state\u2019s recycling, however, are howling.\n\nMost municipal recycling programmes work because the costs of collecting and sorting recyclables are largely offset by the value of these materials on commodity markets. But China, once the leading buyer of America\u2019s recyclables, upended these markets last year by banning most waste imports. Prices for scrap paper, cardboard and plastic have plunged. Recycling companies that once turned a tidy profit are now losing money and sending material to landfills. Local governments are debating whether to cancel their recycling services or charge residents for what had always been free.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nSome argue that bottle bills offer a handy way to boost recycling without adding real costs. In the ten states where container deposits are already in effect\u2014most of them introduced well before municipal recycling began\u2014they reduce litter, raise recovery rates and create a cleaner stream of recyclables, says Susan Collins of the Container Recycling Institute, an advocacy group. Unredeemed deposits often help pad state coffers. New York, for example, earns around $100m in revenue from its bottle bill every year.\n\nThe problem is that these bills encourage people to divert valuable materials, like aluminium and PET plastic, away from kerbside bins to a separate system run primarily by beverage manufacturers and distributors. This not only creates inefficiencies (more trucks, more bureaucracy), but also shrinks revenues for recycling companies left with less valuable materials.\n\nTom Outerbridge of SIMS , which has a long-term contract to process all the metal, glass and plastic collected by New York City\u2019s sanitation department, says New York\u2019s current bill, introduced in 1982, already cuts the value of every tonne of material SIMS receives by $15-30. He estimates that the governor\u2019s expanded bill could cost another $30 per tonne. The New York State Association for Reduction, Reuse and Recycling estimates that the expanded bill would cost recyclers $10m in lost commodity value, on top of $42m in new costs because of China-related turmoil.\n\nInstead of putting a bounty on materials that recycling companies need to stay afloat, Eric Goldstein of the Natural Resources Defence Council, a conservation group, recommends placing redemption values on things that are difficult to recycle, such as more glass (wine and liquor bottles, for example), batteries, paints and carpets. Collecting these materials will not be easy, but at least it will spare local recycling operators a financial headache."

    "title": "Democrats raise doubts about Georgia\u2019s election for governor",
    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "S TACEY ABRAMS , a Democrat who narrowly failed in her bid last year to become the first black governor of Georgia, does not concede that she lost the election. \u201cI concede I\u2019m not the governor of Georgia,\u201d she told a reporter from the Associated Press on March 19th. But she blamed her failure to come first in the poll on cheating. She says that voter suppression in Georgia kept her supporters\u2014mostly blacks\u2014away from the polls.\n\nShe is hardly alone in believing that. On March 6th Democrats in the House of Representatives launched an investigation into \u201cvoter registration, voter access, and other matters affecting the ability of people in Georgia to exercise their right to vote\u201d. The House Oversight Committee has requested documents from the declared winner of the poll, Brian Kemp\u2014who, as secretary of state, supervised his own campaign\u2014in order to evaluate his impartiality, the use of voting machines and the changing of polling places. There is no doubt that Georgia made voting tough for some. But are critics right in thinking that this was decisive in Mr Kemp\u2019s victory?\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nSome claims can be dismissed out of hand. At an event in Selma, Alabama earlier this month, Hillary Clinton claimed that Georgia had fewer registered voters in 2016 than in 2012. That is straightforwardly untrue. According to data from Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, fewer than 6.1m Georgians registered to vote in the 2012 general election; in 2016, that number had climbed to over 6.6m, and by 2018 it reached nearly 7m. (Mrs Clinton, too, thinks she is a victim: she also made a dodgy claim about voters being turned away from polls in Wisconsin, a state she lost in 2016.)\n\nThe House Oversight Committee is interested in the \u201cexact match\u201d voter-validation programme that was designed to ensure that voters\u2019 registration applications matched the information that the state had on file. In 2018 a US district judge, Eleanor Ross, said that raised \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about disenfranchising minority voters vastly more often than whites. Michael McDonald, an academic who has been involved in voting-rights litigation in the past, identified the programme as one of the more consequential examples of voter suppression in Georgia. But in the end poll workers were not allowed to use it to turn voters away from the voting booths, because of Judge Ross\u2019s ruling. The number of possibly disenfranchised voters was close to 50,000; Mr Kemp\u2019s margin was 55,000. Mr McDonald says that Ms Abrams\u2019s claims \u201care very tenuous\u201d.\n\nIt could be that changing the location of polling places in predominantly black precincts hurt Ms Abrams\u2019s ability to win. Georgia closed more than 200 polling places during Mr Kemp\u2019s tenure as secretary of state. Research by Henry Brady and John McNulty, both political scientists, found that changing the site of polling places in Los Angeles County had significant negative effects on voter turnout in California\u2019s election for governor in 2003. They estimate that there was a 1.85% reduction in turnout in precincts where polling places changed. So this strategy \u201ccould be used by an unscrupulous politician or registrar to manipulate an election\u201d.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, turnout among blacks in Georgia (some 90% of whom voted for Ms Abrams) did not decline but in fact leapt, from 750,000 to 1.1m. For Mr Kemp\u2019s lead to disappear, you have to assume that had he not closed down polling places, it would have been even higher, by about 6%. That is possible but perhaps generous to Ms Abrams.\n\nIn the end, it should not matter whether voter suppression was enough to keep Ms Abrams out of a job. As she herself has pointed out, \u201cvoter suppression is insidious\u201d. Even if it does not make the difference between a victory or a defeat, it still deprives citizens of their rights. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, commented in January that a bill intended to increase voter turnout was a \u201cpolitical power grab\u201d designed to \u201crewrite the rules to favour [Democrats] and their friends\u201d. Perhaps he should explain why the rules as they are now seem mostly to benefit Republicans."

As Vollie, short for Volunteer, realises, a convoy\u2019s orders could be distilled to one simple instruction: keep going, even if you get a flat tyre.

    ],
    "text": "\u201cF OR ME, NOTHING\u2019S gonna change,\u201d says a police sergeant, hands on hips, huddled with colleagues in a station in a scruffy, violent district on Chicago\u2019s West Side. He sounds relaxed as the city begins its term under a \u201cconsent decree\u201d, a court-ordered process that imposes federal monitors to oversee police reforms. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good officer, it won\u2019t change anything,\u201d agrees another man in uniform.\n\nAs they will soon discover, much in fact will have to be done differently if a history of often unconstitutional policing in the Windy City is to end. Even as Los Angeles and New York have cut murder rates to historic lows over the past three decades, Chicago\u2019s remain three times higher. Officers have long proved trigger-happy and quick to cover up colleagues\u2019 wrongdoing. One calculation in 2016 found that they fired at a member of the public every five days, and had killed 92 people in the previous six years. And young black men are overwhelmingly the victims of police abuse.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nReform in Chicago has been hampered by strong police unions and politicians who dared not make enemies by confronting the 13,000 men in blue. Chicago long failed, for example, to train its officers properly. Eddie Johnson, the superintendent, recalls he was educated in use-of-force rules as a novice at the police academy in 1988 but not retrained for 28 years, until he became the top cop in 2016.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s appointment came after protests over an egregious killing, in which a white officer was filmed shooting a disoriented black teenager, Laquan McDonald, 16 times in 2014. (The officer was convicted of murder, a rarity in Chicago, last October.) Since then a new \u201cpointing policy\u201d discourages quick draws, though it has caused consternation in the force. Mr Johnson said recently that officers grumbled so much, \u201cit is the bane of my life.\u201d\n\nThough he talks of other recent improvements, such as officers\u2019 use of body cameras, he admits that difficulties linger. These include ongoing use of \u201cracist techniques\u201d and the fact \u201cwe treat part of the city inappropriately\u201d. He means his police are most likely to abuse Latino or black residents. This, Mr Johnson reckons, is the fault of a few rotten apples. \u201cWe need to identify the bad actors and get them out.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the problems are structural. The compensation doled out for wrongdoing by his force provides an illustration. Since 2010, such settlements plus interest have amounted to over $930m (not far off the $1.5bn annual budget for the police). In 2015 the city agreed to pay reparations of $5.5m to victims of a detective, Jon Burge, who led a team known as the \u201cMidnight Crew\u201d. For much of the 1970s and 1980s they beat, burned, raped, electrocuted or subjected to mock executions 118 suspects, probably many more, to get confessions.\n\nSuch systemic failings explain why the mayor, Rahm Emanuel, at last agreed to a consent decree. He says that after \u201cseven attempts in 100 years to reform\u201d, he is proud that bigger changes will come. The decree was in the works for two years, as first the Justice Department and then Illinois\u2019s attorney-general demanded it. It allows federal monitors to insist on openness and accountability across many departments, not only the police, says Walter Katz, who negotiated for the city. The experiences of other cities which have had decrees, such as Los Angeles, suggest it will last a decade or more.\n\nConsent decrees were made possible by legislation from 1994 (passed after riots in 1992 in Los Angeles, sparked by the acquittal of police officers who had beat a black motorist, Rodney King.) The Justice Department each year has typically picked two or three targets for reform from 18,000 police departments. It usually responds to a prominent case of police malpractice. According to a Justice Department review of two decades\u2019 use of decrees, there have been 69 formal investigations and 40 decrees covering police departments.\n\nDo they work? Because they apply to only a few of America\u2019s 18,000 police departments, it is hard to prove that consent decrees lead to fewer police shootings. (America\u2019s police killed 998 people in 2018, on a par with recent years.) But Stephen Rushin of Loyola University in Chicago, author of a book on consent decrees, says their benefits far outweigh costs. He says police use less \u201ccategorical force\u201d when being monitored, meaning acts that send members of the public to hospital rather than a morgue. Surveys also often show that public support for the police rises when decrees are in place. And Mr Rushin argues that cities can expect to pay less in civil suits after decrees take effect.\n\nWhat of objections that constrained police are less able to get on with arresting criminals? Heather MacDonald, author of \u201cThe War on Cops\u201d, has argued that violent crime rises when police pull back from \u201cproactive\u201d measures such as stop-and-frisks of potential suspects. In 2016 she said that increases in violence in cities like Chicago or Baltimore could be because police felt hamstrung.\n\nMr Rushin, aided by evidence from the past couple of years in which crime began to fall again, rejects that. He agrees that consent decrees hurt police morale and could make officers leave. His study of \u201cdepolicing\u201d did suggest a short-lived but \u201csignificant\u201d uptick in some crime rates, when police complain of \u201cgrowing pains\u201d from external oversight. But he suggests this involves property crime, not the violent sort. In the case of gun violence police typically reacted to shootings, and did not act proactively to prevent them. Nor does he see arrest rates generally falling.\n\nBeyond Chicago, the chance for new research on decrees will be limited. Under Barack Obama the Justice Department was keen on decrees, but Donald Trump\u2019s administration has frozen them, saying state or local authorities, not federal ones, should take charge. That stance won Mr Trump support from police unions, just as it infuriated civil-rights activists.\n\nThat need not mean the end of reforms, however. Individual cities can study the Justice Departments\u2019s 69 investigations of police departments and find ideas for change. The best processes are often the most open. In Chicago the first draft of the consent decree was made public, passed round 13 focus groups (including police officers) and took hundreds of hours to negotiate. Mr Rushin thinks more open-minded police departments, state and local governments can find lessons to apply for themselves, even without federal pressure."

    "text": "\u201cI AM SIMPLY thrilled about all the folks you were able to admit,\u201d David Ellwood, the then dean of Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government, wrote to the then admissions dean, William Fitzsimmons, in a 2013 email entitled \u201cMy hero\u201d. \u201cAll big wins. [Name redacted] has already committed to a building.\u201d\n\nCharges brought against rich and famous people who are accused of illegally buying university places for their children has focused attention on an oddity in American higher education: that while it was illegal for these people to buy places, others can do so quite legally. This issue is normally hidden behind the veil of the \u201cholistic\u201d admissions policy which selective universities run. But a case in the Supreme Court in which Asian-American plaintiffs allege that Harvard\u2019s admissions system is racially biased has thrown a light on preference given to different groups, including \u201clegacies\u201d\u2014the children of alumni. Their parents do not have to fork out for them to be favoured, but since alumni are universities\u2019 principal source of donations after foundations, institutions that practice legacy preference defend it as essential.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nA survey by the Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, found that 29% of the class of 2021 had a close relation who had been at the university; 18% had at least one parent there. Nor is the practice confined to the top institutions. A survey of 499 admissions directors by Inside Higher Ed found that 42% of those at private universities used legacy preference.\n\nLegacy preference is, as Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and editor of \u201cAffirmative Action for the Rich\u201d, points out, both entirely un-American and uniquely American. It flies in the face of the ideals on which America was founded\u2014the rejection, as Thomas Jefferson put it, of the \u201cartificial aristocracy\u201d based on birth, which had corrupted Britain, in favour of a \u201cnatural aristocracy\u201d based on \u201cvirtue and talents\u201d. No other serious university system permits it. Universities in Britain, the only other country represented in the Times Higher Education league of the world\u2019s top ten universities, use test scores supplemented, in some institutions, with an interview.\n\nIn the 1920s, Ivy League college administrators feared that relying too much on exams to screen applicants would yield a high number of Jewish students. They set up admissions systems which embedded legacy preference. In the egalitarianism of the post-war era, universities tried to get rid of legacies, but were defeated by passionate opposition from their alumni.\n\nA nice fat tip\n\nNo combination of money and alumni clout, however powerful, will get a thick kid a place at a good university. University administrators point out that legacy applicants\u2019 SAT scores tend to be higher than average\u2014not surprising, since they tend to be richer and therefore better-prepared. In an interview with the Crimson, Mr Fitzsimmons referred to legacy as a \u201ctip\u201d which, other things being substantially equal, could win an applicant a place. But recent data suggest it is more than that. Michael Hurwitz, then at Harvard, calculated that, controlling for all relevant characteristics, being related to an alumnus of one of America\u2019s top 30 universities increased an applicant\u2019s chance threefold. Thomas Espenshade at Princeton found that it was the equivalent of 160 points on a SAT score where the maximum is 1,600.\n\nThe trial has forced Harvard to publicise its own numbers (see chart). The biggest advantage goes to athletes, but they are sometimes the same people as legacies\u2014as some of the sports which ease students in (lacrosse, rowing, golf) suggest. \u201cThe best donors\u201d, says an insider, \u201care sports scholars who went on to Harvard Business School. They \u2018bleed crimson\u2019.\u201d\n\nUniversities that favour legacy applicants say doing so helps pay for need-blind admissions, under which universities pay the bills of poorer students. But as Richard Reeves of the Brookings Institution points out, \u201cthey admit so few poor people that this is pocket change for them.\u201d According to Harvard\u2019s Raj Chetty, the university has 14 times as many students from the top than the bottom economic quintile. Legacies take places that might go to poorer people: Mimi Doe of Top Tier Admissions points out that half of places at top universities are fenced off by racial, athletic and legacy preferences. \u201cFor students who don\u2019t have any interesting \u2018hooks\u2019 on their cvs, acceptance rates of 10% of applicants come down to more like 5%.\u201d\n\nMIT , which does not favour legacies, has need-blind admissions. A study of 100 universities found that \u201cthe presence of legacy preference policies does not result in significantly higher alumni giving\u201d; those with legacy preference got more money from alumni, but that was because they had richer alumni. Abandoning the practice might be in the universities\u2019 interest. A study into the \u201cchild-cycle of alumni giving\u201d found that donations increased when alumni\u2019s children reached their early teens, and then dropped to below their original level when the child was turned down. Hell hath no fury like an alumnus whose child has been scorned.\n\nSome institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley, the University of California, Los Angeles and Texas A&M , have abandoned the practice. More than two-thirds of Americans are against it. Mr Kahlenberg notes that universities are increasingly unpopular among Americans. \u201cSome of this has to do with the idea that these are liberal bastions where students are being indoctrinated. But it is also about the fact that these are seen as gated communities where the privileged protect their positions in society.\u201d A majority of the admissions directors surveyed by Inside Higher Ed opposed it, including 11% of those who practised it. The Crimson wants it ended. \u201cIt would make it a happier place,\u201d says a Harvard insider. \u201cSo many of the students have impostor syndrome.\u201d\n\nRon Wyden, a Democratic senator, plans to help legacy preference on its way by introducing a bill to limit tax breaks on donations before or while a child is enrolled. It is a condition of tax exemption that a donor should get no direct benefit from a donation; and although universities are very careful to make it clear that there is no quid pro quo, their defence of legacy preference\u2014that it raises money\u2014implicitly admits the connection."

    "text": "L ESS THAN a week into his presidential campaign, Beto O\u2019Rourke is stirring strong emotions. Among the thousands who have flocked to hear the skateboarding, bilingual Texan in the small rallies he has already held in Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, they seem to be largely positive. Youngish, tall and more charismatic than any of his rivals, as he demonstrated during his losing Senate campaign last year, the 46-year-old former congressman is Democratic box office.\n\nDuring a pit-stop at Penn State University, in central Pennsylvania, midway between Iowa and New Hampshire, he received half the adulation Senator Bernie Sanders would have got, with a tenth of the planning. There is a gushier edge to Betomania, too. Like Swede Levov, George Clooney and, yes, Barack Obama, whose pensive pauses, fluid perorations and optimism Mr O\u2019Rourke has repurposed for a dress-down generation, he has passed the first test of American heroism: women and men seem equally prone to admire or love him. As he tried to exit the crush of a couple of thousand students, while standing head and shoulder above them, your columnist overheard one express amorous thoughts for him, while another loudly invited the candidate to join his punk band.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nYet Mr O\u2019Rourke, whose music is these days confined to air-drumming behind the wheel, has also attracted more (and nastier) criticism than his dozen rivals put together. His unofficial campaign announcement\u2014a cover-interview in Vanity Fair,with pictures by Annie Leibovitz\u2014was panned as preening and entitled. Commentators on the right have piled into his underwhelming record, as a once-aimless youth with a drunk-driving charge, who married money, then served three low-key terms in the House of Representatives. Those on the left were scandalised when Mr O\u2019Rourke, in an early stump speech, made a joke of his absentee fathering. And there is a bipartisan consensus that Mr O\u2019Rourke, who has launched himself at America in a self-driven rental truck, with tearaway passion, no campaign manager and few firm policy ideas, shows an unbefitting want of seriousness. \u201cWhen are we going to get an actual policy from you, instead of platitudes and nice stories?\u201d asked a Sanders supporter in the crowd at Penn State.\n\nMuch of this is warranted. Mr O\u2019Rourke is an undistinguished Democratic front-runner and his sketchiness on large areas of policy seems almost wilful. Surely, on the journey of introspection that followed his Texas defeat, during which Mr O\u2019Rourke ate sacred dirt in New Mexico and blogged religiously, he could have found time to form a view on Brexit? Yet he says he has no opinion on it. And he has little more to say on the environmental and other economic policies he claims to prioritise. Having sounded unenthusiastic about the Green New Deal preached by left-wingers, he was asked in Pennsylvania how he would change it. His reply included much emphasis on the seriousness of the climate emergency (as if his audience needed convincing on that), a joke about not wanting to be seen as one of the pendejos who failed to deal with it, a shout-out to Texan wind turbines, and little else.\n\nYet it is possible to exaggerate Mr O\u2019Rourke\u2019s cluelessness. He has conventional progressive positions on criminal justice and immigration reform, and a more interesting emerging one on health care. Having backed Medicare for all, he now wants to expand it while protecting the private-insurance market. As most of his rivals rush to the left, that is a notable statement of realism. It is also moot whether Mr O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hot air on climate change is less serious than the hallucination masquerading as policy that is the Green New Deal. Mr O\u2019Rourke has been so condemned mainly because his diverse critics view him as a threat.\n\nFor professional politickers\u2014the consultants, pollsters and columnists who shape political news\u2014his campaign is heretical. He disdains polling, depicts his rallies as brainstorming sessions and generates and distributes much of his own media. And his methods work. His slim defeat in Texas was not the stunning achievement he claims, yet it gave him a national profile and Sanders-esque command of online fundraising. His methods also work for reasons none of his Democratic rivals looks able to replicate.\n\nIn place of policy smarts, Mr O\u2019Rourke projects a mood that many find appealing. His optimistic talk of \u201cAmerica\u2019s genius\u201d is familiar; yet mingled with a rarer call for humility and atonement. Though America\u2019s shortcomings, its injustices and political dysfunction, are experienced unevenly, fixing them starts with acknowledging that everyone is responsible. Not least the candidate: \u201cThank you for the accountability,\u201d he replied sadly, when asked to explain the mismatch between his idealistic rhetoric and more pragmatic voting record. It was almost moving. Mr O\u2019Rourke, who is reading Joseph Campbell\u2019s treatise on heroism, \u201cThe Power of Myth\u201d, is not only the master of his narrative because of his quirkiness. It is also because his frailties are as integral to it as his inspirational strengths. He comes across as a reformed drifter vying to turn a personal quest for self-improvement into a political cause.\n\nEl Paso on that\n\nIf he fails, it will be because Democrats find his shortcomings too risky. Mr Obama, one notes, had to convince them he had serious policy chops besides the feel-good. Yet Democrats face bigger challenges today than they did back then, to which Mr O\u2019Rourke offers a possibly flawed yet perhaps unrivalled answer.\n\nThe hard left is stronger\u2014which makes his Obama-like ability to cloak his pragmatism in soaring rhetoric and a few progressive pledges especially valuable. And Donald Trump, who tries to turn any contest into a brawl, is a fierce opponent. A Democratic challenger who could not merely dust himself off, as Mr Obama could, but make his patience and fortitude seem more important than the president\u2019s boorishness, as Mr O\u2019Rourke would try to do, might be awkward. That the lanky Texan would then get back on his skateboard, while vlogging about it, would be another plus."

    "text": "\u201cHISTORY WILL be kind to me, for I intend to write it,\u201d said Winston Churchill. Those who describe events are seldom unbiased. Which is why it matters that those who write the first draft of history today are so disproportionately male.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the Women\u2019s Media Centre, a pressure group, of coverage by 28 American news outlets in late 2017, men received 63% of bylines and TV credits\u2014one percentage point higher than their share the previous year. Men enjoy similarly out-sized influence on social media: a study published in the International Journal of Press/Politics found that male journalists have twice as many Twitter followers as their female colleagues do. They are also slightly more likely to be verified, an accreditation the site grants to prominent users. Online, male political reporters form an echo chamber: they amplify the voices of male co-workers three times as often as they retweet female colleagues, and 92% of replies to colleagues by male reporters were in response to other male journalists.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThese gaps are even larger for coverage of subjects that are traditionally of greater interest to men. The Women\u2019s Media Centre\u2019s analysis found that women were least likely to report on sports, registering a mere 10% of bylines in print and 21% online. In contrast, they made up a majority of bylines on reports about lifestyle and health.\n\nThe size of the gender gap varies widely by publication. At USA Today, just 31% of bylines credited women. Conversely, a few online outlets, including the Huffington Post and Vox, managed to achieve gender parity in bylines, as did the website of MSNBC, a cable network whose political coverage leans to the left."

    "text": "W HY, A STRATEGIST from Mars might wonder, do Europeans doubt their ability to defend themselves against Russia without American help? The total GDP of NATO \u2019s European members is more than ten times that of Russia, which has an economy about the size of Spain\u2019s. They spend three-and-a-half times as much on defence as Russia, which has lately had to cut its budget sharply because of a broader squeeze on its economy. True, Russia has 13 times as many nuclear warheads as western Europe has, but surely Britain and France, the two nuclear powers, have more than enough to deter an attack?\n\nFor decades Europeans did not need to worry about the Martian\u2019s question, because America\u2019s commitment to their defence was not in doubt. That has changed. \u201cThe times when we could unconditionally rely on others are past,\u201d Angela Merkel told the European Parliament in November. She echoed the call of France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, for \u201ca true European army\u201d. In January the two leaders signed a treaty between France and Germany which includes a mutual-security pledge similar to NATO \u2019s Article 5 (as well as Article 42.7 of the European Union\u2019s Lisbon treaty).\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThis is sensitive territory. Mr Macron\u2019s talk of a European army, and of \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d, irritates Americans. It is only prudent for Europeans to start hedging their bets against over-reliance on America, but hedging can be costly, and they have to be careful lest the hedge become a wedge, as Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg of the Fondation pour la Recherche Strat\u00e9gique, a think-tank, pithily puts it.\n\nStill, Mr Trump\u2019s ambivalence about allies is almost an invitation to think through the implications of an end to Pax Americana. Suppose one morning a tweet announces that the United States is leaving NATO . Under Article 13 of the alliance\u2019s founding treaty, a country can cease to be a member one year after notifying the government of the United States. So, bizarrely, Mr Trump would be serving notice on himself. An optimistic version of what happens next, apart from howls of protest, is that Europe makes a concerted effort to organise its own defence. Call it Europe United.\n\nThe conventional wisdom on Europe\u2019s ability to protect its interests may be too defeatist, suggests Kori Schake of the IISS . The middle powers, in which she includes countries like Britain, France, Italy and the Netherlands, have been talking themselves into \u201cexquisite uselessness\u201d, but they have impressive capabilities. And, she argues, \u201cthe high-end American way of war is not the only way of war.\u201d\n\nA pale shadow\n\nYet the Europeans would immediately face institutional hurdles. Compared with Russia\u2019s top-down system, command and control is hard enough in consensus-bound NATO . It would be a bigger challenge for Europeans alone, especially if they did not inherit NATO \u2019s command structure. The EU may want to take the lead, but military thinking is not in its DNA . Besides, an EU -only alliance would be a pale shadow of NATO : after Brexit, non- EU countries will account for fully 80% of NATO defence spending.\n\nThere would be gaps in capabilities, too. How bad these were would depend on the mission, and how many operations were under way at the same time. The European-led interventions in Libya and Mali exposed dependence on America in vital areas such as air-to-air refuelling and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. A detailed look at the sort of scenarios Europe might face would help to identify other gaps, and what it would take to fill them. Bastian Giegerich of the IISS , who is starting to work on such assessments, reckons that realistically the gap-filling could take 15 years or so. That is a long time for places like Poland and the Baltic countries that feel under threat. Fear and mistrust could quickly conspire to make narrow national interests trump efforts to maintain European unity. Hence a second, perhaps likelier, version of what might follow an American withdrawal: Europe Divided.\n\nJonathan Eyal of the Royal United Services Institute in London imagines a frenzy of activity, a cacophony of summits\u2014and a renationalisation of defence strategies. Lots of countries would seek bilateral deals. In central Europe he would expect an alliance between Poland and Romania to guarantee the eastern border. The Russians and Chinese would not sit idly by, he says, but would play their own games with the Greeks, Hungarians and others.\n\nIt is these games of mistrust that the American security guarantee has largely helped to avoid. They could all too easily resurface. \u201cEstablishing a purely European defence\u201d, warns Michael R\u00fchle, a long-time NATO official, \u201cwould overwhelm the Europeans politically, financially and militarily.\u201d\n\nThat is why a third way forward for Europe looks more attractive: what might be called Europe Upgraded. This would involve the Europeans doing a lot more to improve their capacity in defence, but in ways that would help persuade the Americans to stay in: less loose talk about a European army, more effort to develop capabilities currently lacking.\n\nEurope Upgraded sounds like an easy option, but it is not. It would demand cash, creativity and care. A serious push to plug the gaps in Europe\u2019s capabilities would not be cheap. European governments, especially the big ones, would have to find a way to sell far larger defence budgets to their voters.\n\nAs for creativity, the European Intervention Initiative, championed by Mr Macron and launched last year, is an example of the sort of innovation that could help. It is inclusive: its ten members include Finland, not part of NATO , and Britain, soon to be out of the EU . The aim is to foster a common strategic culture that will help Europe respond more nimbly to crises in its neighbourhood without calling for American help.\n\nThe care is needed to make sure a more robust Europe is seen as supporting NATO rather than undermining it. America is suspicious of any duplication of NATO \u2019s efforts, such as the creation of rival headquarters. And bigger spending on defence could trigger disputes over industrial protectionism, especially if broader trade rows between Europe and America rumble on.\n\nEven as the allies grapple with different visions of the future, a nuclear elephant has entered the room. Last October America declared (without warning the Europeans) that it was leaving the INF treaty, claiming a blatant violation by Russia, and served formal notice in February. Russia has since responded by pulling out too, threatening to develop new missiles. To make matters worse, the New START treaty, which limits strategic nuclear warheads and has strong verification provisions, is up for renewal in 2021.\n\nA new nuclear-arms race would be a nightmare for NATO . In Berlin, Claudia Major is \u201cenormously worried\u201d that arguments over INF could divide Germany, Europe and the transatlantic alliance. Radek Sikorski fears that Russia\u2019s missiles will leave Europe \u201cdefenceless\u201d if it lacks a proportionate response to a first use of nuclear weapons by Russia, giving the Russians time to get where they want to by using conventional forces.\n\nNATO has been here before. In the 1980s concern that Russian SS -20 intermediate-range missiles would \u201cdecouple\u201d the European allies from America led to a dual-track approach: pursuit of arms control along with deployment of American cruise and Pershing II missiles in several European countries. The deployment went ahead despite mass protests, but the INF treaty signed in 1987 resulted in their removal and a long period of relative nuclear calm.\n\nAmerica is keen to maintain alliance solidarity, and officials say there are no plans to deploy intermediate-range missiles. There are other tools in the kit to keep Europe coupled. These include submarine-launched nuclear cruise missiles, currently in development, and new low-yield warheads for existing Trident missiles. A strengthening of missile defences would ramp up tensions with Russia.\n\nThe abandonment of the INF treaty is the most urgent reason to ask questions about the nuclear future. But the broader doubts about the strength of America\u2019s commitment to defend Europe are also stirring things up. Like it or not, for the first time this century Europeans are having to brace themselves for a serious debate about the role of nuclear weapons on their continent.\n\nTaboos could tumble. In a paper last November for the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, a French expert, Bruno Tertrais, suggested a range of \u201crealistic\u201d scenarios for expanding French and British nuclear protection, with or without NATO . Maximilian Terhalle, of the University of Winchester, and Mr Heisbourg recently argued that France should extend its nuclear umbrella to its European partners, including Germany. They acknowledge that \u201cgreat leadership skills\u201d would be needed to win support for this at home while not \u201cprompting the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from Europe\u201d."

By one estimate, between 2009 and 2018 white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists in America. Far-right networks with violent ambitions have been uncovered in the German army. The West has no white-nationalist equivalent of Islamic State, but plenty of angry racists there have access to guns. And recent events have fired them up. The Syrian refugee crisis, for example, created vivid images of Muslims surging into Europe, fuelling the fears of those who fret that non-whites are outbreeding whites and will one day \u201creplace\u201d them in their ancestral homelands.\n\nYet there is hope. Another reason the white racist threat looms relatively larger is that the West has grown better at thwarting the jihadist one. Since the attacks of September 11th 2001, security services have put huge efforts into infiltrating jihadist groups both in person and online, eavesdropping on their conversations and taking down their propaganda. Since jihadism crosses borders, intelligence services have also shared information and worked hand in hand to disrupt plots. Governments have strengthened the defences of obvious targets, starting with airline cockpits. They have foiled dozens of plots and jailed hundreds of jihadists. They have also worked to deradicalise extremists, or to prevent them from taking up arms.\n\nAll these methods should be used against violent white nationalists, too. More cash will be needed. It is absurd, for example, that America\u2019s Department of Homeland Security has no experts in far-right terrorism. But even with ample funds, the task will not be easy. People who post racist diatribes online often pretend that they are joking. Spotting potential killers among the much larger number of poison-pontificators is hard. So is finding the right people to deradicalise the far right. Would-be jihadists can sometimes be talked out of it by moderate imams, who ground their arguments in texts that both parties revere. This is trickier with neo-Nazis, but a mix of public ostracism and patient counselling can work.\n\nSensitivity is essential. Lots of non-violent people share at least some of the extremists\u2019 concerns, albeit in milder form. And just as the struggle against jihadism must be calibrated so as not to pick on peaceful Muslims\u2014or create that sense\u2014so the struggle against white extremism should avoid alienating peaceful whites who happen to oppose immigration or who occasionally say obnoxious things online.\n\nIt is an explosive problem, and one that would be easier to deal with if prominent politicians stopped throwing lighted matches at it. When President Donald Trump calls the flow of immigrants an \u201cinvasion\u201d, he lends cover to those who would repel them violently. Likewise Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, when he claims that a Jewish billionaire is plotting to flood Europe with Muslim migrants in order to swamp its Christian culture. And so too Turkey\u2019s strongman, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, when he says that the shooter in New Zealand is part of a grand plot against Turks. By contrast, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has struck the right note. She donned a headscarf, to show that an attack on Muslims is an attack on all New Zealanders. She is tightening the country\u2019s gun controls. She has shown how an assault on New Zealand\u2019s values of tolerance and openness is in fact a reason to strengthen them."

    "text": "T OWARDS THE end of Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial\u201d, Josef K, the protagonist, gets some advice. There is no such thing as a definite acquittal, the court artist tells him; the court \u201cforgets nothing\u201d. Whenever they like, the authorities can renew their charges against the released defendant. When they do, Kafka writes, \u201chis life as a free man is at an end.\u201d\n\nAmerican law emulated Kafka on March 19th when a 5-4 Supreme Court majority ruled that many immigrants who had been held in criminal custody are subject to mandatory detention by Immigration and Control Enforcement ( ICE ) at any time after their release. Eduardo Vega Padilla, one of the litigants in Nielsen v Preap, came to America in the 1960s as an infant. In the late 1990s he was twice convicted for possessing drugs and, in 2002, for illegally (as a previous felon) owning a firearm. In 2013, 11 years after finishing his six-month sentence for the gun conviction, Mr Padilla found himself on the brink of being deported to Mexico, a country he left when he was 16 months old.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe question the justices tackled in Preap was how to interpret a law of 1996 requiring the detention of certain immigrants \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d from criminal custody. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2016 that green-card holders may not be nabbed and held indefinitely without a bail hearing long after being released. The law, the appeals court said, permitted ICE to swoop in only at the time of the immigrant\u2019s release. If authorities wanted to detain an alien later, they would have to give him a hearing.\n\nFor Justice Samuel Alito, author of the majority in the latest ruling, that reading is \u201chard to swallow\u201d. Requiring that the \u201calien must be arrested on the day he walks out of jail\u201d unreasonably constrains ICE authority, he says. The law would amount to \u201cnonsense\u201d if it were understood to favour Mr Padilla and his fellow plaintiffs. Mandatory detention would be \u201cdownright incoherent\u201d if it did not require the detention of every alien who has committed an offence listed, at any time.\n\nIn dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that the case concerns \u201cbasic American legal values\u201d. It has \u201cconsequences\u201d for green-card holders who have \u201cestablished families and put down roots in a community\u201d. The ruling threatens to deprive people of their liberty without \u201cdue process of law\u201d and to strip them of \u201cthe longstanding right of virtually all persons to receive a bail hearing\u201d when held in custody. A six-month limit on re-arrest, Justice Breyer wrote, is reasonable and squares with other detention time frames.\n\nA long-running disagreement fuels the split between the court\u2019s liberals and conservatives: how to read statutes. Whereas the Alito majority in Preap takes a magnifying glass to the words on the page and strives to understand them without reference to anything else\u2014an approach known as \u201ctextualism\u201d\u2014the Breyer dissent takes a broader view, considering the purposes that lie behind the law. \u201cI would have thought that Congress...did not intend to allow the government to apprehend persons years after their release from prison,\u201d Justice Breyer wrote."

    "text": "\u201cIT WAS a complete and total exoneration!\u201d crowed Donald Trump on March 24th, shortly after his attorney-general released a four-page summary of Robert Mueller\u2019s findings. \u201cThis was an illegal takedown that failed.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s euphoria was understandable. After spending 22 months investigating the Russian campaign to rig the 2016 election in Mr Trump\u2019s favour, the special counsel did not find that the president had a case to answer. Yet nor did he exonerate him on all counts.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nFirst the good news for Mr Trump. On the most serious area of wrongdoing Mr Mueller considered, according to Attorney-General William Barr\u2019s summary, he \u201cdid not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in election interference activities.\u201d\n\nThat does not mean Mr Trump\u2019s campaign did not cooperate with the Russian effort. Over the course of Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation several apparent instances of cooperation have come to light. Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman\u2014who thanks to Mr Mueller is now serving a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence\u2014shared campaign polling data with an alleged Russian agent, for example. And it is possible that Mr Mueller found more such instances. Yet he clearly found no \u201csmoking-gun\u201d evidence that the Trump team were witting participants in the Russian plot. Their dealings with Russians, according to the summary, did not amount to a \u201cconspiracy\u201d or an \u201cagreement\u2014tacit or express...on election interference\u201d.\n\nIt will take a fuller disclosure of Mr Mueller\u2019s findings, which Mr Barr has promised, to ascertain quite how reassuring this conclusion is. But it is nonetheless a big win for the president. Despite the nagging caveats\u2014given his team\u2019s many lies, evasions and demonstrable openness to receiving Russian help\u2014it comes as close to corroborating the president\u2019s \u201cNO COLLUSION!!\u201d assertion as he could possibly have hoped.\n\nIt will not deter House Democrats from continuing their ongoing congressional probes into Mr Trump\u2019s affairs and Russia. Nor should it. Congressional oversight is different from special counsel investigations. It aims to provide a public reckoning of behaviour antithetical to the public interest, even when that does not rise to the level of criminality, the yardstick Mr Mueller was mandated to consider. And there remain many unanswered questions about Mr Trump\u2019s strange relationship with Russia (for example, why was it so keen to see him elected in the first place?) that it seems Mr Mueller either did not consider or has not resolved.\n\nNonetheless, the special counsel appears to have allayed the biggest fear of all: that America\u2019s sitting president was a traitorous accomplice to the Russia plot. Good as this is for Mr Trump, it is even better for America, and the Democrats\u2019 oversight effort should be guided by it. If Mr Mueller did not find a smoking gun, they should not expect to.\n\nThe other main part of Mr Mueller\u2019s inquiry was a closer run thing. Mr Barr\u2019s summary confirms that the special counsel looked into \u201ca number of actions by the president\u201d that might have constituted an illegal effort to obstruct investigations into the Russian plot. The main investigation, by the FBI, was handed over to Mr Mueller in part because of Mr Trump\u2019s decision to sack the bureau\u2019s then director, James Comey. That was one such action. The president\u2019s subsequent effort to sack Mr Mueller, whose investigation he dubbed a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d, perhaps constituted another.\n\nBoth steps looked bad for the president. Yet it was always moot whether they could be conclusively seen as obstruction, given that Mr Trump was empowered by his office to remove both men. Most legal experts think a president can be guilty of obstruction, even when exercising the legitimate powers of his office, if his motives are malign. And sacking Mr Comey in an effort to shut down the Russian investigation would certainly appear to fit that description.\n\nOther experts\u2014not insignificantly including Mr Barr\u2014maintained that a president could not be guilty of obstruction when acting within his legal powers. In the end Mr Mueller, mindful of this thorny legal disagreement, decided not to try to settle it.\n\nAccording to the attorney-general\u2019s summary of his conclusions, he relayed his findings on Mr Trump\u2019s dubious actions without concluding whether or not they constituted clinching evidence of obstruction. Instead Mr Mueller provided arguments on both sides of the question. According to Mr Barr, \u201cthe special counsel states that \u2018while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it does not exonerate him either.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe attorney-general\u2014who last month returned to the helm of the Justice Department, having previously run it for George H. W. Bush\u2014took it upon himself to settle the matter. He and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, duly concluded that the evidence provided by Mr Mueller was not sufficient to \u201cestablish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offence.\u201d Given Mr Barr\u2019s afore-stated views, this was not terribly surprising. Though the attorney-general in fact offered a different argument in support of their finding. As Mr Mueller had not found the president to be engaged in a conspiracy with Russia, Mr Barr argued, it would be hard to establish that Mr Trump\u2019s quasi-obstructive exercise of his powers was ill-intended.\n\nThat might sound like a stretch. The many dodgy ties between Mr Trump and Russia, and his and his associates\u2019 record of lying about them, suggested he had highly questionable motives\u2014short of a grand election-rigging conspiracy\u2014to shut the Russia probe down. In any event, Mr Trump\u2019s opponents will home in on the implication that Mr Mueller provided evidence of obstruction, which he felt unable to exonerate the president on, notwithstanding the legal arguments in favour of doing so. The Democrats will now fight to obtain the details of Mr Mueller\u2019s reporting on this issue.\n\nThat battle will shortly take on a political life of its own. In his summary Mr Barr reiterated that, \u201cmindful of the public interest in this matter\u201d, he hoped to make as much of the special counsel\u2019s report public as he could, \u201cconsistent with applicable law, regulations, and departmental policies.\u201d Yet that could keep a lot of Mr Mueller\u2019s report under wraps.\n\nMr Barr noted a provision against disclosure of information brought before a grand jury, which Mr Mueller made heavy use of. He also noted his need to protect material relevant to ongoing investigations, of which Mr Mueller has sparked several, notably including one by the US attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York that is looking into various aspects of Mr Trump\u2019s affairs. Democrats who feel bruised by Mr Mueller\u2019s failure to hang the president will console themselves by getting stuck into the new fight with Mr Barr over disclosure.\n\nBut they should not feel bruised. The notion that the special counsel was about to take down Mr Trump has long owed more to feverish Democratic imaginations than reality. The reams of evidence the special counsel has already made public, in hundreds of pages of court filings, did not point to a grand conspiracy between the Trump team and Russian agents. The obstruction case looked hard to prove.\n\nIf anything, the heavy burden of proof the special counsel was labouring under made his investigation look like a distraction from the more salient political questions surrounding Mr Trump\u2019s dealings with Russia. For example: do American voters think it acceptable that their president continues to deny the existence of an attack on their democracy by a hostile power, which he has consistently lied about his links to, may owe his job to, and which he has done hardly anything to deter from continuing its assault?\n\nDemocrats might also feel Mr Mueller has done them a tactical favour. A more damning report on Mr Trump, including a clear allegation of criminality, would have made it hard for them to avoid impeaching him. Yet that course of action has always looked like a hiding to nothing. Protected by his party, Mr Trump almost certainly could not be removed by impeachment proceedings, and might well be strengthened by a failed effort. Democratic leaders know this perfectly well. Despite well-publicised calls for Mr Trump\u2019s impeachment from a few hotheads, most Democrats in Congress are against it.\n\nThe best they could have hoped for from Mr Mueller was therefore a report that justified their continuing oversight operations against Mr Trump, without forcing them to impeach him. The special counsel appears to have delivered something close to that.\n\nIn a more abstract sense, indeed, his report appears almost as a rebuke to those who look to the law to solve political problems. Mr Mueller would not put it like this: the celebrated prosecutor is too fastidious and discreet. Yet his conclusions, in so far as Mr Barr has represented them accurately, appear to have added a few important embellishments to the Trump saga, and then kicked it back into the political realm where it belongs. Voters, not prosecutors, will ultimately decide whether Mr Trump is fit to occupy the White House. That is as it should be.\n\nFurther reading: Our background briefing on the Mueller report"

    "text": "\u201cI AM SIMPLY thrilled about all the folks you were able to admit,\u201d David Ellwood, the then dean of Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government, wrote to the then admissions dean, William Fitzsimmons, in a 2013 email entitled \u201cMy hero\u201d. \u201cAll big wins. [Name redacted] has already committed to a building.\u201d\n\nCharges brought against rich and famous people who are accused of illegally buying university places for their children has focused attention on an oddity in American higher education: that while it was illegal for these people to buy places, others can do so quite legally. This issue is normally hidden behind the veil of the \u201cholistic\u201d admissions policy which selective universities run. But a case in the Supreme Court in which Asian-American plaintiffs allege that Harvard\u2019s admissions system is racially biased has thrown a light on preference given to different groups, including \u201clegacies\u201d\u2014the children of alumni. Their parents do not have to fork out for them to be favoured, but since alumni are universities\u2019 principal source of donations after foundations, institutions that practice legacy preference defend it as essential.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nA survey by the Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, found that 29% of the class of 2021 had a close relation who had been at the university; 18% had at least one parent there. Nor is the practice confined to the top institutions. A survey of 499 admissions directors by Inside Higher Ed found that 42% of those at private universities used legacy preference.\n\nLegacy preference is, as Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and editor of \u201cAffirmative Action for the Rich\u201d, points out, both entirely un-American and uniquely American. It flies in the face of the ideals on which America was founded\u2014the rejection, as Thomas Jefferson put it, of the \u201cartificial aristocracy\u201d based on birth, which had corrupted Britain, in favour of a \u201cnatural aristocracy\u201d based on \u201cvirtue and talents\u201d. No other serious university system permits it. Universities in Britain, the only other country represented in the Times Higher Education league of the world\u2019s top ten universities, use test scores supplemented, in some institutions, with an interview.\n\nIn the 1920s, Ivy League college administrators feared that relying too much on exams to screen applicants would yield a high number of Jewish students. They set up admissions systems which embedded legacy preference. In the egalitarianism of the post-war era, universities tried to get rid of legacies, but were defeated by passionate opposition from their alumni.\n\nA nice fat tip\n\nNo combination of money and alumni clout, however powerful, will get a thick kid a place at a good university. University administrators point out that legacy applicants\u2019 SAT scores tend to be higher than average\u2014not surprising, since they tend to be richer and therefore better-prepared. In an interview with the Crimson, Mr Fitzsimmons referred to legacy as a \u201ctip\u201d which, other things being substantially equal, could win an applicant a place. But recent data suggest it is more than that. Michael Hurwitz, then at Harvard, calculated that, controlling for all relevant characteristics, being related to an alumnus of one of America\u2019s top 30 universities increased an applicant\u2019s chance threefold. Thomas Espenshade at Princeton found that it was the equivalent of 160 points on a SAT score where the maximum is 1,600.\n\nThe trial has forced Harvard to publicise its own numbers (see chart). The biggest advantage goes to athletes, but they are sometimes the same people as legacies\u2014as some of the sports which ease students in (lacrosse, rowing, golf) suggest. \u201cThe best donors\u201d, says an insider, \u201care sports scholars who went on to Harvard Business School. They \u2018bleed crimson\u2019.\u201d\n\nUniversities that favour legacy applicants say doing so helps pay for need-blind admissions, under which universities pay the bills of poorer students. But as Richard Reeves of the Brookings Institution points out, \u201cthey admit so few poor people that this is pocket change for them.\u201d According to Harvard\u2019s Raj Chetty, the university has 14 times as many students from the top than the bottom economic quintile. Legacies take places that might go to poorer people: Mimi Doe of Top Tier Admissions points out that half of places at top universities are fenced off by racial, athletic and legacy preferences. \u201cFor students who don\u2019t have any interesting \u2018hooks\u2019 on their cvs, acceptance rates of 10% of applicants come down to more like 5%.\u201d\n\nMIT , which does not favour legacies, has need-blind admissions. A study of 100 universities found that \u201cthe presence of legacy preference policies does not result in significantly higher alumni giving\u201d; those with legacy preference got more money from alumni, but that was because they had richer alumni. Abandoning the practice might be in the universities\u2019 interest. A study into the \u201cchild-cycle of alumni giving\u201d found that donations increased when alumni\u2019s children reached their early teens, and then dropped to below their original level when the child was turned down. Hell hath no fury like an alumnus whose child has been scorned.\n\nSome institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley, the University of California, Los Angeles and Texas A&M , have abandoned the practice. More than two-thirds of Americans are against it. Mr Kahlenberg notes that universities are increasingly unpopular among Americans. \u201cSome of this has to do with the idea that these are liberal bastions where students are being indoctrinated. But it is also about the fact that these are seen as gated communities where the privileged protect their positions in society.\u201d A majority of the admissions directors surveyed by Inside Higher Ed opposed it, including 11% of those who practised it. The Crimson wants it ended. \u201cIt would make it a happier place,\u201d says a Harvard insider. \u201cSo many of the students have impostor syndrome.\u201d\n\nRon Wyden, a Democratic senator, plans to help legacy preference on its way by introducing a bill to limit tax breaks on donations before or while a child is enrolled. It is a condition of tax exemption that a donor should get no direct benefit from a donation; and although universities are very careful to make it clear that there is no quid pro quo, their defence of legacy preference\u2014that it raises money\u2014implicitly admits the connection."

    "text": "L ESS THAN a week into his presidential campaign, Beto O\u2019Rourke is stirring strong emotions. Among the thousands who have flocked to hear the skateboarding, bilingual Texan in the small rallies he has already held in Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, they seem to be largely positive. Youngish, tall and more charismatic than any of his rivals, as he demonstrated during his losing Senate campaign last year, the 46-year-old former congressman is Democratic box office.\n\nDuring a pit-stop at Penn State University, in central Pennsylvania, midway between Iowa and New Hampshire, he received half the adulation Senator Bernie Sanders would have got, with a tenth of the planning. There is a gushier edge to Betomania, too. Like Swede Levov, George Clooney and, yes, Barack Obama, whose pensive pauses, fluid perorations and optimism Mr O\u2019Rourke has repurposed for a dress-down generation, he has passed the first test of American heroism: women and men seem equally prone to admire or love him. As he tried to exit the crush of a couple of thousand students, while standing head and shoulder above them, your columnist overheard one express amorous thoughts for him, while another loudly invited the candidate to join his punk band.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nYet Mr O\u2019Rourke, whose music is these days confined to air-drumming behind the wheel, has also attracted more (and nastier) criticism than his dozen rivals put together. His unofficial campaign announcement\u2014a cover-interview in Vanity Fair,with pictures by Annie Leibovitz\u2014was panned as preening and entitled. Commentators on the right have piled into his underwhelming record, as a once-aimless youth with a drunk-driving charge, who married money, then served three low-key terms in the House of Representatives. Those on the left were scandalised when Mr O\u2019Rourke, in an early stump speech, made a joke of his absentee fathering. And there is a bipartisan consensus that Mr O\u2019Rourke, who has launched himself at America in a self-driven rental truck, with tearaway passion, no campaign manager and few firm policy ideas, shows an unbefitting want of seriousness. \u201cWhen are we going to get an actual policy from you, instead of platitudes and nice stories?\u201d asked a Sanders supporter in the crowd at Penn State.\n\nMuch of this is warranted. Mr O\u2019Rourke is an undistinguished Democratic front-runner and his sketchiness on large areas of policy seems almost wilful. Surely, on the journey of introspection that followed his Texas defeat, during which Mr O\u2019Rourke ate sacred dirt in New Mexico and blogged religiously, he could have found time to form a view on Brexit? Yet he says he has no opinion on it. And he has little more to say on the environmental and other economic policies he claims to prioritise. Having sounded unenthusiastic about the Green New Deal preached by left-wingers, he was asked in Pennsylvania how he would change it. His reply included much emphasis on the seriousness of the climate emergency (as if his audience needed convincing on that), a joke about not wanting to be seen as one of the pendejos who failed to deal with it, a shout-out to Texan wind turbines, and little else.\n\nYet it is possible to exaggerate Mr O\u2019Rourke\u2019s cluelessness. He has conventional progressive positions on criminal justice and immigration reform, and a more interesting emerging one on health care. Having backed Medicare for all, he now wants to expand it while protecting the private-insurance market. As most of his rivals rush to the left, that is a notable statement of realism. It is also moot whether Mr O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hot air on climate change is less serious than the hallucination masquerading as policy that is the Green New Deal. Mr O\u2019Rourke has been so condemned mainly because his diverse critics view him as a threat.\n\nFor professional politickers\u2014the consultants, pollsters and columnists who shape political news\u2014his campaign is heretical. He disdains polling, depicts his rallies as brainstorming sessions and generates and distributes much of his own media. And his methods work. His slim defeat in Texas was not the stunning achievement he claims, yet it gave him a national profile and Sanders-esque command of online fundraising. His methods also work for reasons none of his Democratic rivals looks able to replicate.\n\nIn place of policy smarts, Mr O\u2019Rourke projects a mood that many find appealing. His optimistic talk of \u201cAmerica\u2019s genius\u201d is familiar; yet mingled with a rarer call for humility and atonement. Though America\u2019s shortcomings, its injustices and political dysfunction, are experienced unevenly, fixing them starts with acknowledging that everyone is responsible. Not least the candidate: \u201cThank you for the accountability,\u201d he replied sadly, when asked to explain the mismatch between his idealistic rhetoric and more pragmatic voting record. It was almost moving. Mr O\u2019Rourke, who is reading Joseph Campbell\u2019s treatise on heroism, \u201cThe Power of Myth\u201d, is not only the master of his narrative because of his quirkiness. It is also because his frailties are as integral to it as his inspirational strengths. He comes across as a reformed drifter vying to turn a personal quest for self-improvement into a political cause.\n\nEl Paso on that\n\nIf he fails, it will be because Democrats find his shortcomings too risky. Mr Obama, one notes, had to convince them he had serious policy chops besides the feel-good. Yet Democrats face bigger challenges today than they did back then, to which Mr O\u2019Rourke offers a possibly flawed yet perhaps unrivalled answer.\n\nThe hard left is stronger\u2014which makes his Obama-like ability to cloak his pragmatism in soaring rhetoric and a few progressive pledges especially valuable. And Donald Trump, who tries to turn any contest into a brawl, is a fierce opponent. A Democratic challenger who could not merely dust himself off, as Mr Obama could, but make his patience and fortitude seem more important than the president\u2019s boorishness, as Mr O\u2019Rourke would try to do, might be awkward. That the lanky Texan would then get back on his skateboard, while vlogging about it, would be another plus."

    "text": "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nP HILOSOPHERS FROM Aristotle to the Beatles have argued that money does not buy happiness. But it seems to help. Since 2005 Gallup, a pollster, has asked a representative sample of adults from countries across the world to rate their life satisfaction on a scale from zero to ten. The headline result is clear: the richer the country, on average, the higher the level of self-reported happiness. The simple correlation suggests that doubling GDP per person lifts life satisfaction by about 0.7 points.\n\nYet the prediction that as a country gets richer its mood will improve has a dubious record. In 1974 Richard Easterlin, an economist, discovered that average life satisfaction in America had stagnated between 1946 and 1970 even as GDP per person had grown by 65% over the same period. He went on to find a similar disconnect in other places, too. Although income is correlated with happiness when looking across countries\u2014and although economic downturns are reliable sources of temporary misery\u2014long-term GDP growth does not seem to be enough to turn the average frown upside-down.\n\nThe \u201cEasterlin paradox\u201d has been hotly disputed since, with some economists claiming to find a link between growth and rising happiness by using better quality data. On March 20th the latest Gallup data were presented in the World Happiness Report, an annual UN-backed study. The new data provide some ammunition for both sides of the debate but, on the whole, suggest that the paradox is alive and well.\n\nThere are important examples of national income and happiness rising and falling together. The most significant\u2014in terms of population\u2014is China, where GDP per person has doubled over a decade, while average happiness has risen by 0.43 points. Among rich countries Germany enjoys higher incomes and greater cheer than ten years ago. Venezuela, once the fifth-happiest country in the world, has become miserable as its economy has collapsed. Looking across countries, growth is correlated with rising happiness.\n\nYet that correlation is very weak. Of the 125 countries for which good data exist, 43 have seen GDP per person and happiness move in opposite directions. Like China, India is a populous developing economy that is growing quickly. But happiness is down by about 1.2 points in the past decade. America, the subject of Easterlin\u2019s initial study, has again seen happiness fall as the economy has grown. In total the world\u2019s population looks roughly equally divided between places where happiness and incomes have moved in the same direction over the past ten years, and places where they have diverged.\n\nSources: World Happiness Report, by John Helliwell, Richard Layard & Jeffrey Sachs (eds), UN, 2019; World Bank\n\nGet the data"

    "text": "\u201cI AM SIMPLY thrilled about all the folks you were able to admit,\u201d David Ellwood, the then dean of Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government, wrote to the then admissions dean, William Fitzsimmons, in a 2013 email entitled \u201cMy hero\u201d. \u201cAll big wins. [Name redacted] has already committed to a building.\u201d\n\nCharges brought against rich and famous people who are accused of illegally buying university places for their children has focused attention on an oddity in American higher education: that while it was illegal for these people to buy places, others can do so quite legally. This issue is normally hidden behind the veil of the \u201cholistic\u201d admissions policy which selective universities run. But a case in the Supreme Court in which Asian-American plaintiffs allege that Harvard\u2019s admissions system is racially biased has thrown a light on preference given to different groups, including \u201clegacies\u201d\u2014the children of alumni. Their parents do not have to fork out for them to be favoured, but since alumni are universities\u2019 principal source of donations after foundations, institutions that practice legacy preference defend it as essential.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nA survey by the Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, found that 29% of the class of 2021 had a close relation who had been at the university; 18% had at least one parent there. Nor is the practice confined to the top institutions. A survey of 499 admissions directors by Inside Higher Ed found that 42% of those at private universities used legacy preference.\n\nLegacy preference is, as Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and editor of \u201cAffirmative Action for the Rich\u201d, points out, both entirely un-American and uniquely American. It flies in the face of the ideals on which America was founded\u2014the rejection, as Thomas Jefferson put it, of the \u201cartificial aristocracy\u201d based on birth, which had corrupted Britain, in favour of a \u201cnatural aristocracy\u201d based on \u201cvirtue and talents\u201d. No other serious university system permits it. Universities in Britain, the only other country represented in the Times Higher Education league of the world\u2019s top ten universities, use test scores supplemented, in some institutions, with an interview.\n\nIn the 1920s, Ivy League college administrators feared that relying too much on exams to screen applicants would yield a high number of Jewish students. They set up admissions systems which embedded legacy preference. In the egalitarianism of the post-war era, universities tried to get rid of legacies, but were defeated by passionate opposition from their alumni.\n\nA nice fat tip\n\nNo combination of money and alumni clout, however powerful, will get a thick kid a place at a good university. University administrators point out that legacy applicants\u2019 SAT scores tend to be higher than average\u2014not surprising, since they tend to be richer and therefore better-prepared. In an interview with the Crimson, Mr Fitzsimmons referred to legacy as a \u201ctip\u201d which, other things being substantially equal, could win an applicant a place. But recent data suggest it is more than that. Michael Hurwitz, then at Harvard, calculated that, controlling for all relevant characteristics, being related to an alumnus of one of America\u2019s top 30 universities increased an applicant\u2019s chance threefold. Thomas Espenshade at Princeton found that it was the equivalent of 160 points on a SAT score where the maximum is 1,600.\n\nThe trial has forced Harvard to publicise its own numbers (see chart). The biggest advantage goes to athletes, but they are sometimes the same people as legacies\u2014as some of the sports which ease students in (lacrosse, rowing, golf) suggest. \u201cThe best donors\u201d, says an insider, \u201care sports scholars who went on to Harvard Business School. They \u2018bleed crimson\u2019.\u201d\n\nUniversities that favour legacy applicants say doing so helps pay for need-blind admissions, under which universities pay the bills of poorer students. But as Richard Reeves of the Brookings Institution points out, \u201cthey admit so few poor people that this is pocket change for them.\u201d According to Harvard\u2019s Raj Chetty, the university has 14 times as many students from the top than the bottom economic quintile. Legacies take places that might go to poorer people: Mimi Doe of Top Tier Admissions points out that half of places at top universities are fenced off by racial, athletic and legacy preferences. \u201cFor students who don\u2019t have any interesting \u2018hooks\u2019 on their cvs, acceptance rates of 10% of applicants come down to more like 5%.\u201d\n\nMIT , which does not favour legacies, has need-blind admissions. A study of 100 universities found that \u201cthe presence of legacy preference policies does not result in significantly higher alumni giving\u201d; those with legacy preference got more money from alumni, but that was because they had richer alumni. Abandoning the practice might be in the universities\u2019 interest. A study into the \u201cchild-cycle of alumni giving\u201d found that donations increased when alumni\u2019s children reached their early teens, and then dropped to below their original level when the child was turned down. Hell hath no fury like an alumnus whose child has been scorned.\n\nSome institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley, the University of California, Los Angeles and Texas A&M , have abandoned the practice. More than two-thirds of Americans are against it. Mr Kahlenberg notes that universities are increasingly unpopular among Americans. \u201cSome of this has to do with the idea that these are liberal bastions where students are being indoctrinated. But it is also about the fact that these are seen as gated communities where the privileged protect their positions in society.\u201d A majority of the admissions directors surveyed by Inside Higher Ed opposed it, including 11% of those who practised it. The Crimson wants it ended. \u201cIt would make it a happier place,\u201d says a Harvard insider. \u201cSo many of the students have impostor syndrome.\u201d\n\nRon Wyden, a Democratic senator, plans to help legacy preference on its way by introducing a bill to limit tax breaks on donations before or while a child is enrolled. It is a condition of tax exemption that a donor should get no direct benefit from a donation; and although universities are very careful to make it clear that there is no quid pro quo, their defence of legacy preference\u2014that it raises money\u2014implicitly admits the connection."

    "text": "H E SEEMS to have been a classic \u201clone wolf\u201d. As far as police can tell, the man who murdered 50 worshippers, and critically wounded nine more, at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15th was not part of any organisation. The 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, claimed to have developed his violent beliefs on his own, surfing the internet and visiting Europe. He bought his weapons himself. He honed his skills at a suburban shooting-range. No one there suspected that he was preparing a massacre.\n\nYet he was part of something much bigger. The names and slogans scrawled on his weapons were familiar to extreme white nationalists all around the world\u2014but hardly anyone else. His ranting internet manifesto, \u201cThe Great Replacement\u201d, repeated a staple far-right conspiracy theory: that non-white and Muslim immigrants in Western countries are invaders, ushered in by scheming elites to replace ethnic-European populations. Variants of that once-fringe idea are now common, not just in social-media posts by anonymous wackos but in the speeches of elected politicians from Hungary to Iowa.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn another sense, too, the lone wolf had a pack. Attacks by neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other extreme-right types are growing more common. In America they outnumber those committed by Islamists. Of 263 domestic terrorism incidents in 2010-17, fully 92 were carried out by far-right attackers, compared with 38 by jihadists, according to an analysis of the Global Terrorism Database by the Washington Post. In Europe jihadist killings still predominate, but deaths from extreme-right terrorism have surged since 2010 (see chart).\n\nThe past six months have seen a rash of far-right terrorist incidents. Last autumn a white nationalist killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. France broke up a plot to kill Emmanuel Macron, the president, and Spain arrested a fascist hoping to assassinate Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the prime minister. Germany uncovered an extremist cell in the army, allegedly planning to kill the foreign minister and others. In February America\u2019s FBI arrested a Coast Guard officer who had an arsenal and a target-list of Democratic politicians.\n\nGlobally, white-nationalist terrorism is far less deadly than the jihadist variety. But it is more prevalent than authorities acknowledge, says Jacob Aasland Ravndal of Norway\u2019s Centre for Research on Extremism. Legal definitions of terrorism often require that an attack be planned in advance. Much extreme-right violence is spontaneous. Even burning down a refugee centre may count as a hate crime, not terrorism. Europol, the EU \u2019s law-enforcement agency, ascribed just 3% of terrorist attacks in 2017 to the far right. But Mr Ravndal\u2019s database of ideologically motivated violent incidents shows that in western Europe, though jihadists kill more people, the far right carry out more attacks.\n\nMore right than they know\n\nIf the threat from white nationalists is underestimated, that is partly because they are more publicity-shy. Mr Tarrant and his hero, Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011, were exceptions. They left manifestos and tried to maximise media exposure. Indeed, the Christchurch killer also resembled sophisticated jihadist outfits, both in the ostentatious cruelty of his crime and in his hope that it would polarise society, fuelling yet more extremism.\n\nThe Breivik tradition\n\nIslamic State tries to provoke the West into persecuting Muslims and thus driving sympathisers from the \u201cgrey zone\u201d towards radical participation. Right-wing extremists may also hope to provoke an Islamist backlash. Police are investigating a possible terrorist motive behind the murder of three people on a tram in Utrecht in the Netherlands, three days after the massacre in Christchurch. A Turkish-born suspect has been arrested.\n\nIn Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has seized on the attack in Christchurch as evidence of a broad conspiracy against Turkey and Islam. He has quoted from the killer\u2019s manifesto, which includes calls to expel Turks from Europe and to kill Mr Erdogan. The president\u2019s not-so-subtle message is that only he can protect Turks from rampant white nationalism.\n\nThe Christchurch killer also hoped to provoke stricter gun laws, so that gun-owners would rise up in revolt. There is not much chance of more gun control in America, Mr Tarrant\u2019s primary target. However, Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, is moving to tighten her country\u2019s lax gun laws. This will not start a civil war. New Zealand prides itself on multiculturalism (see article). Its politics are more moderate than Australia\u2019s.\n\nThat, along with its easy gun laws, may have been why Mr Tarrant picked New Zealand. He wrote that he wanted to prove that nowhere was safe. Muslims in Christchurch have lost all sense of security. Tofazzal Alam, who survived the attack, says he is now afraid \u201cto go to mosque, afraid of any crowd, afraid even to open the door\u201d.\n\nYet the killer\u2019s manifesto was inspired by events far away in Europe. He claimed he was converted to radical-right ideology on a trip to France in 2017, when he saw how much of the population was Muslim. He decorated his flak jacket with a \u201cblack sun\u201d, a symbol traced to a floor motif used in his castle by Heinrich Himmler, a Nazi leader. He decorated his weapons with the names of victims of jihadist attacks in Stockholm and Paris. Before the shootings, he listened in his car to \u201cGod is a Serb\u201d, a song written in 1993 in support of Radovan Karadzic\u2014a Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide for his role in the massacre of 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995.\n\nThe idea that Muslims and non-whites are \u201cinvaders\u201d imported by a cosmopolitan elite to replace ethnic Europeans has its roots in thinkers of the French \u201cnew right\u201d of the 1970s, such as Alain de Benoist and Renaud Camus. It is often linked to the belief that multicultural societies, far from promoting diversity, extinguish it by mixing distinct cultures and races together. The nuttiest apostles of such notions equate immigration with genocide.\n\nThese ideas attracted the anti-Muslim populist politicians who sprung up across Europe around the turn of the millennium, especially after the September 11th attacks in America. They inspired the far-right youth network Generation Identity. But the big impetus came in 2015-16, when some 2m asylum-seekers, mostly from the Middle East, poured into Europe.\n\nFor right-wing populists, this crisis was a godsend. Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, built a fence against the migrants and began calling himself a defender of Christian Europe. A frenzied opposition to Muslim immigration (real or imaginary) is the lodestar of populist-right parties in Germany, Poland, Sweden and Italy. At the European Parliament this month, Javier Ortega Smith of Vox, a new far-right Spanish party, thundered that had Spanish and Venetian fleets not won the battle of Lepanto against the Turks in 1571, every female MEP \u201cwould be wearing a burqa\u201d.\n\nDaniel Koehler of the German Institute on Radicalisation and De-radicalisation Studies says that it is no coincidence that extreme-right violence jumped during the migrant crisis, along with the fortunes of far-right parties: \u201cIf you think you have \u2026to protect against \u2018invaders\u2019\u2014how do you do that without using force?\u201d\n\nIn America, too, the rise in extreme-right violence is linked to mainstream politics. Between 2009 and 2018, white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists. In 2016, the year Donald Trump won the presidency, more anti-Muslim assaults were reported to the FBI (127) than in any year since 2001 (93).\n\nSuch attacks rose steeply after Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008. Daryl Johnson, who spent 15 years studying right-wing terrorist groups, including at the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ), wrote a paper in 2009 warning that the arrival that year of a black person in the White House could spark far-right violence. Demonised by conservatives for this, he left the DHS in 2010. Today, he says, it has no experts in right-wing terrorism. A spokesman did not deny this, but, in an email, said that the DHS is \u201ccommitted to combating all forms of violent extremism, especially those that espouse racial supremacy or bigotry\u201d.\n\nIn denial\n\nMr Trump has played down the threat of right-wing extremists, calling them \u201ca small group of people that have very, very serious problems\u201d. In 2017 his administration cancelled grants to groups combating white-supremacism. Peter Singer, a cyber-security expert at the New America Foundation who was invited to speak to Mr Trump\u2019s national-security staff that year, said that they dismissed white-supremacist terrorism as \u201ca law-enforcement issue\u201d, and denied that it is transnational.\n\nIn fact, the ties between American and European extreme-right groups are ever closer. Europe\u2019s Generation Identity groups are linked to Identity Evropa, one of the the American far-right organisations that planned a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, where a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd and killed a counter-protester. Marchers at that rally chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d, referring to the same \u201cgreat replacement\u201d thesis shared by European extremists and the Christchurch killer.\n\nMr Trump has played the role for American white nationalists that such leaders as Mr Orban played for Europe\u2019s, says Brian Levin, who heads the Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. These groups, he says, saw their ideas, such as building a wall like Mr Orban\u2019s, and banning or deporting Muslims, \u201cgetting into the mainstream tent\u201d. They took this as a \u201cgreen light\u201d for violence. And he notes that, like the young on Europe\u2019s extremist right, they have softened their image in the past decade. Shaved heads and combat boots have given way to army haircuts, polo shirts and corduroy jackets.\n\nFar-right groups lack the state sponsors and safe havens enjoyed by some jihadists. Many on the extreme right admire Russia but it does not fit the bill. It has cultivated ties with far-right parties in Europe, but has snuffed out extremists at home. In the 2000s hate-motivated attacks, often directed at immigrants and internal migrants from the north Caucasus, reached nearly 700 a year, as the state flirted with nationalist movements. Clashes in Moscow in 2011 between police and far-right groups mixed with football hooligans showed the dangers of tolerating the ultranationalists. After they joined anti-government protests in 2011-12, the state began shutting them down, detaining the most violent. In 2014 war with Ukraine split the movement into pro-government and pro-Ukrainian factions. The SOVA Centre, an independent monitor, recorded just 57 hate-motivated attacks in 2018.\n\nThe Ukrainian model\n\nOther Western white nationalists look to Ukraine itself, a hotbed of far-right activity since the Maidan uprising in 2014. Quasi-fascist militias, such as the Azov Battalion, have fought Russia in the east and taken a role in policing. So Kiev is \u201ca place of attraction for the global far-right\u201d, says Anton Shekhovtsov, of the University of Vienna. Some European radicals have joined Ukrainians on the front lines. American white supremacists have been spotted in Kiev. But as Mr Shekhovtsov puts it, \u201cmigration is a first-world problem\u201d, and, whereas earlier far-right groups would beat up foreigners from Africa and Asia, Azov is keener on disrupting gay-pride marches. In any case, Ukrainian men seeking romantic violence have plenty to do in the east.\n\nA more pressing concern for Western governments is far-right radicalism within their armed forces. Soldiers, obviously, are trained and have access to weapons. In America the DHS warned a decade ago that right-wing extremists will attempt to \u201crecruit and radicalise\u201d veterans, recalling the terrorist attacks of the 1990s by bitter ex-soldiers, such as the Oklahoma City bombing. A study of 119 lone-actor terrorists across America and Europe since 1990 found that 26% had done military service.\n\nRacial tension is rising in the armed services. A recent poll by Military Times, a newspaper, found that over half of non-white American service members had suffered racism in 2018, up from 42% in the previous year. In 2017 two marines were arrested for hanging a white-supremacist banner on a building in North Carolina. On March 18th the Huffington Post, a news website, identified seven serving American soldiers as active in Identity Evropa.\n\nThe German authorities are investigating some 450 cases of suspected right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr. Last year the security services identified dozens of police and soldiers as members of Reichsb\u00fcrger, a far-right movement. In Britain in September 2017 four soldiers were arrested for membership of National Action, a banned neo-Nazi group. \u201cIf we get enough of us into the Army,\u201d suggested one, \u201cwe\u2019ll be in the right place when things start to collapse.\u201d\n\nArmies are tightening their vetting procedures and becoming more vigilant. They insist that adherence to law is drilled into recruits. But, for good reason, most armed forces are prohibited from conducting political education.\n\nTracking sources of danger is hard because, as Mr Koehler, the German scholar, points out, far-right violence typically involves loose groups of individuals radicalised on social media. He calls this \u201chive terrorism\u201d. It is practically impossible to predict when someone will go from wishing others dead to actually killing them.\n\nThe Christchurch killer is a perfect example. He spent time on 8chan, a messageboard that prides itself on allowing users to post anything not illegal under American law. (After the attack, its administrators said they would co-operate with police.) It concerns itself with everything from Japanese cartoons to role-playing games. Anonymous posting is the norm.\n\nThe board\u2019s \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d subsections are far-right haunts. Their culture is a self-consciously puerile mishmash of memes, absurdism and irony, making it hard to know how seriously to take anything posted there. When Mr Tarrant declared on 8chan that he was about to commit murder, and proceeded to live-stream it on Facebook, many replies expressed surprise (often pleased) that the promised shooting spree was actually happening.\n\nThe killer\u2019s manifesto, too, is steeped in 8chan-like irony, a style sometimes termed \u201cshitposting\u201d. Serious rants about low European birth-rates alternate with claims to have been radicalised by \u201cSpyro the Dragon 3\u201d, a children\u2019s video game. If the media took such claims seriously, they would prove their own cluelessness.\n\nSince the attacks, there have been calls for internet platforms to do a better job of restricting violent right-wing content. Facebook has been blamed for letting the live-stream of the attack go on for 17 minutes. The platform says it began vigorously blocking the video as soon as it discovered it, removing 1.5m attempts to repost it. But internet users could still find copies hours after the attack. (It did not help that some \u201cmainstream\u201d media sites\u2014and even Mr Erdogan\u2014used some of it.)\n\nBig internet platforms could do more, but they face a gargantuan task. The underlying problem, says Ben Nimmo of the Oxford Internet Institute, is that \u201cradicalising content is not constant\u201d\u2014one viewer\u2019s trigger to violence is another\u2019s harmless satire. Hopes that artificial intelligence might do much of the filtering have not worked out; armies of human reviewers are still needed, and even they often err.\n\nHowever hard it is to stop terrorists exploiting the internet, other citizens can, at least, refuse to help them. The Christchurch killer\u2019s fixation on the former Yugoslavia is apt: as in that war, white nationalists seek to use spectacular violence and propaganda to turn citizens against each other. In New Zealand Ms Ardern has turned this on its head. She has tried to use horrific slaughter to unite a country in opposition to a creed whose most famous new exponent she refuses to name."

      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "J UAN IS GRATEFUL for New York\u2019s bottle bill, which imposes a refundable nickel deposit on bottles and cans of water, soda and beer. He and his wife earn about $500 a week by collecting empties from recycling bins, bars and restaurants in Bushwick, Brooklyn, which they trade for money at a local redemption centre. Their jangling cart is among the many that helped the state recycle over 5bn drinks containers in 2016. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, now wants to expand the bill to cover most non-alcoholic containers, to help fight litter and boost recycling throughout the state. Juan and his wife are delighted. Companies that handle the state\u2019s recycling, however, are howling.\n\nMost municipal recycling programmes work because the costs of collecting and sorting recyclables are largely offset by the value of these materials on commodity markets. But China, once the leading buyer of America\u2019s recyclables, upended these markets last year by banning most waste imports. Prices for scrap paper, cardboard and plastic have plunged. Recycling companies that once turned a tidy profit are now losing money and sending material to landfills. Local governments are debating whether to cancel their recycling services or charge residents for what had always been free.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nSome argue that bottle bills offer a handy way to boost recycling without adding real costs. In the ten states where container deposits are already in effect\u2014most of them introduced well before municipal recycling began\u2014they reduce litter, raise recovery rates and create a cleaner stream of recyclables, says Susan Collins of the Container Recycling Institute, an advocacy group. Unredeemed deposits often help pad state coffers. New York, for example, earns around $100m in revenue from its bottle bill every year.\n\nThe problem is that these bills encourage people to divert valuable materials, like aluminium and PET plastic, away from kerbside bins to a separate system run primarily by beverage manufacturers and distributors. This not only creates inefficiencies (more trucks, more bureaucracy), but also shrinks revenues for recycling companies left with less valuable materials.\n\nTom Outerbridge of SIMS , which has a long-term contract to process all the metal, glass and plastic collected by New York City\u2019s sanitation department, says New York\u2019s current bill, introduced in 1982, already cuts the value of every tonne of material SIMS receives by $15-30. He estimates that the governor\u2019s expanded bill could cost another $30 per tonne. The New York State Association for Reduction, Reuse and Recycling estimates that the expanded bill would cost recyclers $10m in lost commodity value, on top of $42m in new costs because of China-related turmoil.\n\nInstead of putting a bounty on materials that recycling companies need to stay afloat, Eric Goldstein of the Natural Resources Defence Council, a conservation group, recommends placing redemption values on things that are difficult to recycle, such as more glass (wine and liquor bottles, for example), batteries, paints and carpets. Collecting these materials will not be easy, but at least it will spare local recycling operators a financial headache."

Germany uncovered an extremist cell in the army, allegedly planning to kill the foreign minister and others. In February America\u2019s FBI arrested a Coast Guard officer who had an arsenal and a target-list of Democratic politicians.\n\nGlobally, white-nationalist terrorism is far less deadly than the jihadist variety. But it is more prevalent than authorities acknowledge, says Jacob Aasland Ravndal of Norway\u2019s Centre for Research on Extremism. Legal definitions of terrorism often require that an attack be planned in advance. Much extreme-right violence is spontaneous. Even burning down a refugee centre may count as a hate crime, not terrorism. Europol, the EU \u2019s law-enforcement agency, ascribed just 3% of terrorist attacks in 2017 to the far right. But Mr Ravndal\u2019s database of ideologically motivated violent incidents shows that in western Europe, though jihadists kill more people, the far right carry out more attacks.\n\nMore right than they know\n\nIf the threat from white nationalists is underestimated, that is partly because they are more publicity-shy. Mr Tarrant and his hero, Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011, were exceptions. They left manifestos and tried to maximise media exposure. Indeed, the Christchurch killer also resembled sophisticated jihadist outfits, both in the ostentatious cruelty of his crime and in his hope that it would polarise society, fuelling yet more extremism.\n\nThe Breivik tradition\n\nIslamic State tries to provoke the West into persecuting Muslims and thus driving sympathisers from the \u201cgrey zone\u201d towards radical participation. Right-wing extremists may also hope to provoke an Islamist backlash. Police are investigating a possible terrorist motive behind the murder of three people on a tram in Utrecht in the Netherlands, three days after the massacre in Christchurch. A Turkish-born suspect has been arrested.\n\nIn Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has seized on the attack in Christchurch as evidence of a broad conspiracy against Turkey and Islam. He has quoted from the killer\u2019s manifesto, which includes calls to expel Turks from Europe and to kill Mr Erdogan. The president\u2019s not-so-subtle message is that only he can protect Turks from rampant white nationalism.\n\nThe Christchurch killer also hoped to provoke stricter gun laws, so that gun-owners would rise up in revolt. There is not much chance of more gun control in America, Mr Tarrant\u2019s primary target. However, Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, is moving to tighten her country\u2019s lax gun laws. This will not start a civil war. New Zealand prides itself on multiculturalism (see article). Its politics are more moderate than Australia\u2019s.\n\nThat, along with its easy gun laws, may have been why Mr Tarrant picked New Zealand. He wrote that he wanted to prove that nowhere was safe. Muslims in Christchurch have lost all sense of security. Tofazzal Alam, who survived the attack, says he is now afraid \u201cto go to mosque, afraid of any crowd, afraid even to open the door\u201d.\n\nYet the killer\u2019s manifesto was inspired by events far away in Europe. He claimed he was converted to radical-right ideology on a trip to France in 2017, when he saw how much of the population was Muslim. He decorated his flak jacket with a \u201cblack sun\u201d, a symbol traced to a floor motif used in his castle by Heinrich Himmler, a Nazi leader. He decorated his weapons with the names of victims of jihadist attacks in Stockholm and Paris. Before the shootings, he listened in his car to \u201cGod is a Serb\u201d, a song written in 1993 in support of Radovan Karadzic\u2014a Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide for his role in the massacre of 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995.\n\nThe idea that Muslims and non-whites are \u201cinvaders\u201d imported by a cosmopolitan elite to replace ethnic Europeans has its roots in thinkers of the French \u201cnew right\u201d of the 1970s, such as Alain de Benoist and Renaud Camus. It is often linked to the belief that multicultural societies, far from promoting diversity, extinguish it by mixing distinct cultures and races together. The nuttiest apostles of such notions equate immigration with genocide.\n\nThese ideas attracted the anti-Muslim populist politicians who sprung up across Europe around the turn of the millennium, especially after the September 11th attacks in America. They inspired the far-right youth network Generation Identity. But the big impetus came in 2015-16, when some 2m asylum-seekers, mostly from the Middle East, poured into Europe.\n\nFor right-wing populists, this crisis was a godsend. Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, built a fence against the migrants and began calling himself a defender of Christian Europe. A frenzied opposition to Muslim immigration (real or imaginary) is the lodestar of populist-right parties in Germany, Poland, Sweden and Italy. At the European Parliament this month, Javier Ortega Smith of Vox, a new far-right Spanish party, thundered that had Spanish and Venetian fleets not won the battle of Lepanto against the Turks in 1571, every female MEP \u201cwould be wearing a burqa\u201d.\n\nDaniel Koehler of the German Institute on Radicalisation and De-radicalisation Studies says that it is no coincidence that extreme-right violence jumped during the migrant crisis, along with the fortunes of far-right parties: \u201cIf you think you have \u2026to protect against \u2018invaders\u2019\u2014how do you do that without using force?\u201d\n\nIn America, too, the rise in extreme-right violence is linked to mainstream politics. Between 2009 and 2018, white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists. In 2016, the year Donald Trump won the presidency, more anti-Muslim assaults were reported to the FBI (127) than in any year since 2001 (93).\n\nSuch attacks rose steeply after Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008. Daryl Johnson, who spent 15 years studying right-wing terrorist groups, including at the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ), wrote a paper in 2009 warning that the arrival that year of a black person in the White House could spark far-right violence. Demonised by conservatives for this, he left the DHS in 2010. Today, he says, it has no experts in right-wing terrorism. A spokesman did not deny this, but, in an email, said that the DHS is \u201ccommitted to combating all forms of violent extremism, especially those that espouse racial supremacy or bigotry\u201d.\n\nIn denial\n\nMr Trump has played down the threat of right-wing extremists, calling them \u201ca small group of people that have very, very serious problems\u201d. In 2017 his administration cancelled grants to groups combating white-supremacism. Peter Singer, a cyber-security expert at the New America Foundation who was invited to speak to Mr Trump\u2019s national-security staff that year, said that they dismissed white-supremacist terrorism as \u201ca law-enforcement issue\u201d, and denied that it is transnational.\n\nIn fact, the ties between American and European extreme-right groups are ever closer. Europe\u2019s Generation Identity groups are linked to Identity Evropa, one of the the American far-right organisations that planned a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, where a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd and killed a counter-protester. Marchers at that rally chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d, referring to the same \u201cgreat replacement\u201d thesis shared by European extremists and the Christchurch killer.\n\nMr Trump has played the role for American white nationalists that such leaders as Mr Orban played for Europe\u2019s, says Brian Levin, who heads the Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. These groups, he says, saw their ideas, such as building a wall like Mr Orban\u2019s, and banning or deporting Muslims, \u201cgetting into the mainstream tent\u201d. They took this as a \u201cgreen light\u201d for violence. And he notes that, like the young on Europe\u2019s extremist right, they have softened their image in the past decade. Shaved heads and combat boots have given way to army haircuts, polo shirts and corduroy jackets.\n\nFar-right groups lack the state sponsors and safe havens enjoyed by some jihadists. Many on the extreme right admire Russia but it does not fit the bill. It has cultivated ties with far-right parties in Europe, but has snuffed out extremists at home. In the 2000s hate-motivated attacks, often directed at immigrants and internal migrants from the north Caucasus, reached nearly 700 a year, as the state flirted with nationalist movements. Clashes in Moscow in 2011 between police and far-right groups mixed with football hooligans showed the dangers of tolerating the ultranationalists. After they joined anti-government protests in 2011-12, the state began shutting them down, detaining the most violent. In 2014 war with Ukraine split the movement into pro-government and pro-Ukrainian factions. The SOVA Centre, an independent monitor, recorded just 57 hate-motivated attacks in 2018.\n\nThe Ukrainian model\n\nOther Western white nationalists look to Ukraine itself, a hotbed of far-right activity since the Maidan uprising in 2014. Quasi-fascist militias, such as the Azov Battalion, have fought Russia in the east and taken a role in policing. So Kiev is \u201ca place of attraction for the global far-right\u201d, says Anton Shekhovtsov, of the University of Vienna. Some European radicals have joined Ukrainians on the front lines. American white supremacists have been spotted in Kiev. But as Mr Shekhovtsov puts it, \u201cmigration is a first-world problem\u201d, and, whereas earlier far-right groups would beat up foreigners from Africa and Asia, Azov is keener on disrupting gay-pride marches. In any case, Ukrainian men seeking romantic violence have plenty to do in the east.\n\nA more pressing concern for Western governments is far-right radicalism within their armed forces. Soldiers, obviously, are trained and have access to weapons. In America the DHS warned a decade ago that right-wing extremists will attempt to \u201crecruit and radicalise\u201d veterans, recalling the terrorist attacks of the 1990s by bitter ex-soldiers, such as the Oklahoma City bombing. A study of 119 lone-actor terrorists across America and Europe since 1990 found that 26% had done military service.\n\nRacial tension is rising in the armed services. A recent poll by Military Times, a newspaper, found that over half of non-white American service members had suffered racism in 2018, up from 42% in the previous year. In 2017 two marines were arrested for hanging a white-supremacist banner on a building in North Carolina. On March 18th the Huffington Post, a news website, identified seven serving American soldiers as active in Identity Evropa.\n\nThe German authorities are investigating some 450 cases of suspected right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr. Last year the security services identified dozens of police and soldiers as members of Reichsb\u00fcrger, a far-right movement. In Britain in September 2017 four soldiers were arrested for membership of National Action, a banned neo-Nazi group. \u201cIf we get enough of us into the Army,\u201d suggested one, \u201cwe\u2019ll be in the right place when things start to collapse.\u201d\n\nArmies are tightening their vetting procedures and becoming more vigilant. They insist that adherence to law is drilled into recruits. But, for good reason, most armed forces are prohibited from conducting political education.\n\nTracking sources of danger is hard because, as Mr Koehler, the German scholar, points out, far-right violence typically involves loose groups of individuals radicalised on social media. He calls this \u201chive terrorism\u201d. It is practically impossible to predict when someone will go from wishing others dead to actually killing them.\n\nThe Christchurch killer is a perfect example. He spent time on 8chan, a messageboard that prides itself on allowing users to post anything not illegal under American law. (After the attack, its administrators said they would co-operate with police.) It concerns itself with everything from Japanese cartoons to role-playing games. Anonymous posting is the norm.\n\nThe board\u2019s \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d subsections are far-right haunts. Their culture is a self-consciously puerile mishmash of memes, absurdism and irony, making it hard to know how seriously to take anything posted there. When Mr Tarrant declared on 8chan that he was about to commit murder, and proceeded to live-stream it on Facebook, many replies expressed surprise (often pleased) that the promised shooting spree was actually happening.\n\nThe killer\u2019s manifesto, too, is steeped in 8chan-like irony, a style sometimes termed \u201cshitposting\u201d. Serious rants about low European birth-rates alternate with claims to have been radicalised by \u201cSpyro the Dragon 3\u201d, a children\u2019s video game. If the media took such claims seriously, they would prove their own cluelessness.\n\nSince the attacks, there have been calls for internet platforms to do a better job of restricting violent right-wing content. Facebook has been blamed for letting the live-stream of the attack go on for 17 minutes. The platform says it began vigorously blocking the video as soon as it discovered it, removing 1.5m attempts to repost it. But internet users could still find copies hours after the attack. (It did not help that some \u201cmainstream\u201d media sites\u2014and even Mr Erdogan\u2014used some of it.)\n\nBig internet platforms could do more, but they face a gargantuan task. The underlying problem, says Ben Nimmo of the Oxford Internet Institute, is that \u201cradicalising content is not constant\u201d\u2014one viewer\u2019s trigger to violence is another\u2019s harmless satire. Hopes that artificial intelligence might do much of the filtering have not worked out; armies of human reviewers are still needed, and even they often err.\n\nHowever hard it is to stop terrorists exploiting the internet, other citizens can, at least, refuse to help them. The Christchurch killer\u2019s fixation on the former Yugoslavia is apt: as in that war, white nationalists seek to use spectacular violence and propaganda to turn citizens against each other. In New Zealand Ms Ardern has turned this on its head. She has tried to use horrific slaughter to unite a country in opposition to a creed whose most famous new exponent she refuses to name."

      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "DONALD TRUMP has not been afraid to upset people abroad. The American president has regularly criticised the leaders of his country\u2019s allies and cast doubt on the value of international partnerships. In 2018 he reportedly described some poor African states as \u201cshithole countries\u201d.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the share of foreigners who approve of America\u2019s leadership has dropped sharply since his election, according to Gallup, a pollster. In 2016, the median approval rate among the 133 countries it surveyed was 48%. By 2018, that figure had dropped to 31%. America is now below China\u2019s figure of 34%, and only a little above Russia\u2019s 30%.\n\n\n\nThat has generated plenty of headlines, and might worry supporters of democracy. But they should be wary of over-interpreting those figures. Gallup has provided The Economist with polling data for 18 (mostly rich) countries, starting in 2006, when it first began asking about leadership. These numbers paint a less alarming picture.\n\n\n\nThe data suggest that analysts ought to report the \u201cnet approval rate\u201d: that is, the share of people who approve of a country\u2019s leadership minus the share who disapprove. For example, the proportion of Brazilians who favour China\u2019s rulers has risen from 20% in 2008 to 32% in 2018\u2014but the share who dislike the Chinese government has also swelled from 26% to 38%, meaning that the net approval rate has remained at -6%. The real change has been that the share of Brazilians who express no opinion has fallen from 54% to 30%, which suggests that more of them have been paying attention to international news.\n\n\n\nA similar pattern exists in most of the countries in our sample, when asked about leaders in either China or Russia. Overall, there was little sign of a drastic swing in favourability towards either country.\n\n\n\nThis net approval calculation still shows a marked decline for America, from a global median of +20% in 2016 to -9% last year. But this trend should be taken with a pinch of salt. The sharpest declines have occurred in the Americas and in wealthy countries in Europe and Asia. Even in this select group, the current levels of favourability are similar to those in the final years of George W. Bush\u2019s administration. If the majority of people in these countries have sympathies to the left of the Republican Party\u2019s platform, their approval may rebound rapidly whenever a Democrat is elected president.\n\n\n\nOutside this group, Mr Trump\u2019s election has had only a limited impact on the world\u2019s view of America. Net approval rates have fluctuated only a little in the Middle East\u2014up in Israel, down elsewhere\u2014and been relatively flat in eastern Europe, India and Africa. The president has taken a wrecking ball to many international institutions, but has yet to cause irreparable damage to America\u2019s global image."

    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "\u201cF OR ME, NOTHING\u2019S gonna change,\u201d says a police sergeant, hands on hips, huddled with colleagues in a station in a scruffy, violent district on Chicago\u2019s West Side. He sounds relaxed as the city begins its term under a \u201cconsent decree\u201d, a court-ordered process that imposes federal monitors to oversee police reforms. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good officer, it won\u2019t change anything,\u201d agrees another man in uniform.\n\nAs they will soon discover, much in fact will have to be done differently if a history of often unconstitutional policing in the Windy City is to end. Even as Los Angeles and New York have cut murder rates to historic lows over the past three decades, Chicago\u2019s remain three times higher. Officers have long proved trigger-happy and quick to cover up colleagues\u2019 wrongdoing. One calculation in 2016 found that they fired at a member of the public every five days, and had killed 92 people in the previous six years. And young black men are overwhelmingly the victims of police abuse.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nReform in Chicago has been hampered by strong police unions and politicians who dared not make enemies by confronting the 13,000 men in blue. Chicago long failed, for example, to train its officers properly. Eddie Johnson, the superintendent, recalls he was educated in use-of-force rules as a novice at the police academy in 1988 but not retrained for 28 years, until he became the top cop in 2016.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s appointment came after protests over an egregious killing, in which a white officer was filmed shooting a disoriented black teenager, Laquan McDonald, 16 times in 2014. (The officer was convicted of murder, a rarity in Chicago, last October.) Since then a new \u201cpointing policy\u201d discourages quick draws, though it has caused consternation in the force. Mr Johnson said recently that officers grumbled so much, \u201cit is the bane of my life.\u201d\n\nThough he talks of other recent improvements, such as officers\u2019 use of body cameras, he admits that difficulties linger. These include ongoing use of \u201cracist techniques\u201d and the fact \u201cwe treat part of the city inappropriately\u201d. He means his police are most likely to abuse Latino or black residents. This, Mr Johnson reckons, is the fault of a few rotten apples. \u201cWe need to identify the bad actors and get them out.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the problems are structural. The compensation doled out for wrongdoing by his force provides an illustration. Since 2010, such settlements plus interest have amounted to over $930m (not far off the $1.5bn annual budget for the police). In 2015 the city agreed to pay reparations of $5.5m to victims of a detective, Jon Burge, who led a team known as the \u201cMidnight Crew\u201d. For much of the 1970s and 1980s they beat, burned, raped, electrocuted or subjected to mock executions 118 suspects, probably many more, to get confessions.\n\nSuch systemic failings explain why the mayor, Rahm Emanuel, at last agreed to a consent decree. He says that after \u201cseven attempts in 100 years to reform\u201d, he is proud that bigger changes will come. The decree was in the works for two years, as first the Justice Department and then Illinois\u2019s attorney-general demanded it. It allows federal monitors to insist on openness and accountability across many departments, not only the police, says Walter Katz, who negotiated for the city. The experiences of other cities which have had decrees, such as Los Angeles, suggest it will last a decade or more.\n\nConsent decrees were made possible by legislation from 1994 (passed after riots in 1992 in Los Angeles, sparked by the acquittal of police officers who had beat a black motorist, Rodney King.) The Justice Department each year has typically picked two or three targets for reform from 18,000 police departments. It usually responds to a prominent case of police malpractice. According to a Justice Department review of two decades\u2019 use of decrees, there have been 69 formal investigations and 40 decrees covering police departments.\n\nDo they work? Because they apply to only a few of America\u2019s 18,000 police departments, it is hard to prove that consent decrees lead to fewer police shootings. (America\u2019s police killed 998 people in 2018, on a par with recent years.) But Stephen Rushin of Loyola University in Chicago, author of a book on consent decrees, says their benefits far outweigh costs. He says police use less \u201ccategorical force\u201d when being monitored, meaning acts that send members of the public to hospital rather than a morgue. Surveys also often show that public support for the police rises when decrees are in place. And Mr Rushin argues that cities can expect to pay less in civil suits after decrees take effect.\n\nWhat of objections that constrained police are less able to get on with arresting criminals? Heather MacDonald, author of \u201cThe War on Cops\u201d, has argued that violent crime rises when police pull back from \u201cproactive\u201d measures such as stop-and-frisks of potential suspects. In 2016 she said that increases in violence in cities like Chicago or Baltimore could be because police felt hamstrung.\n\nMr Rushin, aided by evidence from the past couple of years in which crime began to fall again, rejects that. He agrees that consent decrees hurt police morale and could make officers leave. His study of \u201cdepolicing\u201d did suggest a short-lived but \u201csignificant\u201d uptick in some crime rates, when police complain of \u201cgrowing pains\u201d from external oversight. But he suggests this involves property crime, not the violent sort. In the case of gun violence police typically reacted to shootings, and did not act proactively to prevent them. Nor does he see arrest rates generally falling.\n\nBeyond Chicago, the chance for new research on decrees will be limited. Under Barack Obama the Justice Department was keen on decrees, but Donald Trump\u2019s administration has frozen them, saying state or local authorities, not federal ones, should take charge. That stance won Mr Trump support from police unions, just as it infuriated civil-rights activists.\n\nThat need not mean the end of reforms, however. Individual cities can study the Justice Departments\u2019s 69 investigations of police departments and find ideas for change. The best processes are often the most open. In Chicago the first draft of the consent decree was made public, passed round 13 focus groups (including police officers) and took hundreds of hours to negotiate. Mr Rushin thinks more open-minded police departments, state and local governments can find lessons to apply for themselves, even without federal pressure."

    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "WHEN 15,000 female garment workers went on strike in New York City more than a century ago, their goal was to secure higher wages, shorter hours and better working conditions. Women today are still pursuing those aims. Although working conditions have improved significantly since the protest in 1908, which led to the creation of International Women\u2019s Day (now celebrated on March 8th), the median pay gap for full-time working women is still around 14%. And figures from The Economist\u2019s latest glass-ceiling index, which measures where women have the best chance of equal treatment at work, show that, after decades of improvement, progress for women in the workplace has stalled in recent years.\n\nMany of the measures associated with equal treatment at work, including pay, seniority and the decision to enter the workforce at all, remain relatively stable. Our index is based on performance across ten indicators including educational attainment, labour-market attachment, pay and representation in senior jobs. In the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, the gender pay gap, which measures the difference between what a typical woman and man earn, remains largely unchanged from last year at around 14%. The share of women on company boards, at 23%, has slightly increased, but the proportion of women in management has barely budged. Although the share of women in the labour force has crept up a little, to 64%, it is still 16 percentage points below the male average.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nWith few changes in the underlying data, it is little wonder that the countries doing best in this year\u2019s glass-ceiling index are mostly the same ones that received top marks in previous years. The Nordics are particularly good at getting women to complete university (around half earn a degree) and secure a job (some 75% are in the labour force). They also have a large share of women in senior positions; in Sweden and Norway the figure is around 40%. Mandatory quotas for women on boards have helped boost female representation. The Nordics also offer better parental-leave systems. Flexible schedules help parents who want to juggle work and child care. More than half the employees in those countries have at least some control over their working hours.\n\nThe OECD countries with the worst environment for working women tend to be in Asia. In South Korea, which ranks last in our index, the pay gap is a whopping 35%. The female labour-force participation rate there is just 59%, compared with 79% for men. Moon Jae-in, South Korea\u2019s president, would like women to hold 10% of senior government positions and make up 20% of public-company executives and 40% of government committees by 2022. But there is a long way to go. Boards of directors at publicly traded South Korean firms are 98% male; out of 109 companies, only one has a female boss. Just over one in ten managerial positions in the country are held by women. While paternity leave is generous, uptake is still low.\n\nThings are little better in Japan, which ranks second-to-last in our index. Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, has tried to promote more women in the workforce to address labour shortages. On this narrow measure, he has succeeded: their number has gone up by 2m since 2015. But most of this work is part-time and poorly paid. The wage gap in Japan is still a hefty 25%. And despite Mr Abe\u2019s support for \u201cwomenomics\u201d, last October he appointed just one woman to his new cabinet. (In his defence, Mr Abe said she has the \u201cpresence of two or three women\u201d.)\n\nCultural and societal norms appear to be a decisive influence on gender equality at work. In Asia, many women are expected to choose between having a family and a career. Moreover, the division of labour at home is often woefully unbalanced. In Japan and South Korea, for example, women do roughly five times more housework, food shopping and other unpaid activities than men do. Women who want to climb the career ladder often struggle to secure spots at top firms. Men are typically favoured for promotions.\n\nStill, there have been some bright spots, particularly in the governments of western democracies. Last June Spain\u2019s prime minister appointed the first female-majority cabinet since the country returned to democracy in 1975. Last November more women than ever were elected to office in America\u2019s mid-term congressional elections. And despite threats to their leadership, Angela Merkel and Theresa May still hold the top political positions in their respective countries. Having women in positions of power should improve the chances of public policies that promote equality in the workplace."

This is doubly true in such a crowded field. Nevertheless, due to his knack for retail politics, his ability to appeal to both progressives and moderates, and his unmatched fundraising prowess, Mr O\u2019Rourke begins his campaign in the top tier of primary candidates.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe best evidence of Mr O\u2019Rourke\u2019s strength is his performance in last year's Senate race in Texas against Mr Cruz. Mr O\u2019Rourke did roughly eight percentage points better than he had any right to. Based on the partisan lean of Texas, and the fact that incumbent senators who run for re-election typically have an advantage, the race ought to have been easy for Mr Cruz. In fact, he only won by 2.6 percentage points.\n\nTurnout in last year\u2019s Senate race increased by more than 3.7m votes relative to the 2014 election, according to the Texas Secretary of State. More impressively, the 8.4m votes cast in last year\u2019s contest rivalled turnout in the 2016 presidential election, a feat uncommon in mid-term elections. That cannot be entirely attributed to Mr O\u2019Rourke: the Democrats\u2019 blue wave carried them to success nationwide. But the fact that Mr O\u2019Rourke came within 600,000 votes of turnout in the last presidential race while running 6 points ahead of Hillary Clinton, and ahead of every other statewide candidate that year, is a testament to his ability to win over at least some Republican voters.\n\nThat enthusiasm can be measured in dollars. Mr O\u2019Rourke enjoyed the benefit of a previously unimaginable campaign fund in 2018. He raised $80m for his race against Mr Cruz, almost half of which came from contributions of less than $200, according to the campaign finance website OpenSecrets.com. The 2020 race is likely to be an order of magnitude more expensive, and a candidate who can raise a lot of money will start out ahead. Mr O'Rourke also has a vast appetite for retail politics. In his 2018 campaign, he visited each of Texas 254 counties. Successful campaigns in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two primary states, are made in a similar fashion.\n\nStill, it is not certain whether Mr O\u2019Rourke\u2019s over-performance in Texas would translate to the national stage. It could be that he did well because he is more moderate than the typical Democrat and because Texas voters are rather conservative. Indeed, according to the political scientists who developed the DW-NOMINATE algorithm to score the ideologies of senators and House members using their voting records in Congress, Mr O\u2019Rourke was more moderate than 77% of Democrats serving in the House of Representatives last year.\n\nThat relative moderation could be an asset. Research suggests that voters do not pay close attention to candidates\u2019 policies, often projecting their own views onto the candidate they like. But given that Democrats need to find a way to win back voters who switched from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, it might make sense to pick someone who cannot easily be characterised as an extremist.\n\nMr O\u2019Rourke is left enough to stand a chance in his party\u2019s primary. He voted with fellow Democrats 93% of the time when he served in Congress, which is slightly less than the average Democrat but nevertheless high. He holds notably liberal positions on border security and immigration: last month, he said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d tear down the border wall in his home city of El Paso, Texas if he were elected president. Mr O\u2019Rourke also made headlines last year when a video of him defending the rights of NFL players to protest during the national anthem went viral. He co-sponsored a bill to make it harder for states to limit abortions and supports universal health coverage, though has shied away from the Medicare-for-all plan that some of his opponents support.\n\nThat Mr O\u2019Rourke has a reputation as a moderate but can claim a leftish record suggests he has mastered the shape-shifting required to thrive in a primary and then change tack in a general election. He still faces long odds. Americans have only elected two presidents for whom their highest qualifying office was the House of Representatives, and one of them was Abraham Lincoln\u2014a man of extraordinary political and intellectual ability. But he has an Obama-ish (or Trump-ish) ability to excite people in the small coffee shops of Keokuk, Iowa, or at large campaign rallies, such as the one he held his in 2018 with the greatest living Texan, Willie Nelson.\n\nSome have accused Mr O\u2019Rourke of being all style and no substance, but one of those qualities can be taught. He possesses the uncoachable one. Primary voters, like generals, are always fighting the last war. Last time out, Democrats learned that if voters do not like a candidate, they will not listen to her policies, however detailed they are. If Democrats carry that lesson into Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr O\u2019Rourke has a good shot at winning."

    "text": "D ANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN , the sociologist and senator who died in 2003, once said that America\u2019s longstanding preference for bureaucratic social services for the poor over simply handing them cash was like \u201cfeeding the sparrows by feeding the horses\u201d. The universal child-care plan offered by Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts and Democratic candidate for 2020, falls into such a snare. Given the cost of American child care, which is the least affordable among developed countries, some plan is clearly needed. Her ambitious proposal calls for publicly funded child-care centres nationwide, which would be free to those making less than 200% of the poverty line (or $51,500 for a family of four) and cost no more than 7% of income for those above it. The complicated infrastructure it envisions would be less efficient than simple cash transfers to poor families with children\u2014and would give uncertain returns.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Canadian province of Quebec introduced a universal child-care scheme backed by large subsidies\u2014out-of-pocket costs were limited to $5 a day. When social scientists tracked the life outcomes for the children and parents who took part in the programme, the results were unexpectedly terrible. Children came out no cleverer and with worse health, life satisfaction and rates of criminal offence. Although women worked more, the taxes generated on their additional labour fell far short of the costs of running the programme. Studies of European programmes have found more positive results, but the outcomes of the recent experiment in North America are troubling. \u201cIt tells us that a poorly funded programme that was rapidly rolled out did not generate the benefits that were promised,\u201d says Amitabh Chandra, a professor of economics at Harvard. And \u201cwe have a history of underfunding programmes in the US when they disproportionately benefit the poor.\u201d\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn practice, the universal child care envisioned by Ms Warren would operate as more of a middle-class entitlement than a well-targeted anti-poverty programme. The costs of child care vary enormously by place. In Washington, DC , it costs around $22,000 a year. Assuming identical costs, Ms Warren\u2019s plan would grant a well-to-do professional couple in the city making $150,000 an $11,500 subsidy to deposit Junior in day care. And although it is true that a poor working mother would receive the same service free of charge, the public costs of looking after her child might well exceed her annual earnings. Giving even a fraction of that amount in cash to mother and child would probably be better for both.\n\nPoor and ethnic-minority mothers are also less likely to use formal day-care centres in the first place. They tend to stay at home to look after children or to use informal child care, such as relatives. \u201cThere\u2019s this amazing tone-deafness to the cultural implications. It\u2019s not just a technocratic policy to close the female wage gap or to grow the earnings of kids,\u201d says Sam Hammond of the Niskanen Centre, a think-tank. The Quebec experiment showed a significant crowding out of informal child-care arrangements in favour of cheap, government-run facilities.\n\nMs Warren herself once grasped this conundrum. In her book \u201cThe Two-Income Trap\u201d, co-written with her daughter in 2003, she dismissed the \u201csacred cow\u201d of free day care. \u201cSubsidised day care benefits only some kids\u2014those whose parents both work outside the home. Day-care subsidies offer no help for families with a stay-at-home mother,\u201d Ms Warren wrote then. She also recognised its possible exacerbating effect on inequality. \u201cEvery dollar spent to subsidise the price of day care frees up a dollar for the two-income family to spend in the bidding wars for housing, tuition, and everything else,\u201d she continued.\n\nA better way to reduce child poverty is to provide a basic monthly child allowance which could be spent on food, rent or formal child care. Michael Bennet and Sherrod Brown, two Democratic senators, have proposed paying families $250-300 per child each month\u2014which would cut the child-poverty rate by almost half, and at the same cost as Ms Warren\u2019s plan. If child care is to be subsidised, it is probably better done through means-tested tax credits. Sadly, the phrase \u201cfully refundable child tax credits\u201d does not stir the soul of Democratic primary voters quite like \u201cuniversal child-care\u201d does."

    "text": "BLACK MOTORISTS have long complained that American police officers tend to target them for traffic stops. A study by the Justice Department, published in 2013, found that black drivers were 31% more likely to be pulled over than white ones; other interactions with law enforcement are characterised by similar racial imbalances.\n\nSuch figures do not by themselves prove that bias is to blame. It is hard to distinguish how much of this imbalance can be attributed to race-specific differences in driving behaviours\u2014such as adherence to traffic laws or the amount of time spent on roads in areas where police are present\u2014and how much is driven by racial profiling. But new research suggests that discrimination is at least part of the problem.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nA study released this week by researchers from Stanford University and New York University finds \u201cwidespread discrimination\u201d in police officers\u2019 decisions to stop and search drivers. The authors used data from nearly 100m traffic stops carried out by state and municipal police departments across America between 2011 and 2017. They find that blacks are about 38% more likely to be pulled over by state patrol officers than white drivers. For local officers, the figure is 35%.\n\nAt least some of this gap can be attributed to racial bias. Using a \u201cveil of darkness\u201d test, the authors show that black drivers account for a significantly higher share of traffic stops during the day, when it is easier for an officer to determine a driver\u2019s race, than they do at night, when a driver\u2019s skin colour is harder to ascertain (see chart). The variation in sunset times during the year, three of which are shown in the panels above, allow the researchers to control for other factors such as when the most police officers are on patrol.\n\nState and local lawmakers can help combat such discrimination by gathering and analysing information on it. In 1999, North Carolina became the first state in America to require police agencies to collect and report data on traffic stops. Other states, including Connecticut and California, have followed, but some do not yet do so. The authors of the study argue that such data-collection efforts will help police officers to do their jobs better. \u201cCollecting, releasing, and analysing police data are essential steps for increasing the effectiveness and equity of law-enforcement practices,\u201d the authors write, \u201cand for improving relations with the public.\u201d"

    "text": "T HE KEY TO understanding Texas is the state Capitol in Austin. It is there that legislators meet only every other year to pass new laws and set the state budget. The elegant domed building is several feet taller than the Capitol in Washington, and that matters to Texans. Gun-owners with a concealed-carry licence can enter through a separate security lane and do not have to go through the indignity of a metal detector, as lowly journalists do. The Capitol is built of pinkish granite, a suitable material for a red state now facing the prospect of diluted Republican influence.\n\nAfter years of pushing to the right on social issues and immigration, Texas Republicans have shifted their tone during the current legislative session. \u201cThere\u2019s been a rush to the middle,\u201d explains Jason Sabo of Frontera Strategy, a lobbying firm. Evidence of that lies in the list of priorities presented by Greg Abbott, the recently re-elected Republican governor. His \u201cemergency\u201d items, which he wants the legislature to focus on, include financing public schools, paying teachers more, reforming the property-tax regime, funding for special education and expanding access to mental-health services.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nHow unlike the previous session of the biennial legislature, in 2017. Back then Republicans passed a hugely controversial immigration bill, giving law-enforcement officers the right to stop people and ask to see papers confirming their citizenship. Some compare this action to Proposition 187, an anti-immigration bill that passed in California in 1994 and turned Hispanics in that state against the Republican Party. Another contentious legislative item that session was a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, designed to regulate where transgender people are allowed to pee. Mr Abbott declared it a priority at the time, though ultimately it withered after opposition from businesses.\n\nRepublicans \u201chave moved over to our issue set and the things we had been talking about,\u201d says Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. Culture wars are still playing out in this legislative session, including over abortion, but they are fewer. Republicans are \u201cnot talking about divisive social issues any more,\u201d says Joe Straus, who served as Speaker of the Texas House for a decade before stepping down in January. Republicans moved to the right to win primaries against other Republicans, but now they face more challenging general elections. Today \u201cthere\u2019s more fear of the November voter than there is of the primary voter. But there\u2019s fear of both,\u201d says Mr Straus.\n\nThere are several reasons for the Republicans\u2019 change of tone and approach, but the 2016 and 2018 elections are central to it. In 2016 Hillary Clinton lost Texas by the smallest margin of any Democrat since 1996. In 2018, when Democrats picked up 12 House seats and two state Senate seats, many right-wing Republicans lost what were thought to be safe districts or won by slimmer margins than expected. This had more than a little to do with Beto O\u2019Rourke, who was challenging Republican Ted Cruz for the US Senate. Although he lost, Mr O\u2019Rourke helped get many down-ballot Democratic state legislators and judges elected.\n\nDonald Trump has also cast a shadow over state Republicans. \u201cThe worst thing that ever happened to Texas Republicans was the election of Donald Trump,\u201d says Mark Jones of Rice University in Houston. Mr Trump has alienated many white Republican women in Texas, and has also pushed away Hispanics, who account for around 40% of the state\u2019s population. Long after Mr Trump leaves office, demographic change in Texas will continue to exert an influence on the fortunes of Republicans, as the Hispanic population grows, millennials vote in increasing numbers and people continue to move to Texas from other states, bringing their more liberal politics with them. According to a recent poll by the University of Texas and Texas Tribune, more Texans say they would sooner vote for a candidate running against Mr Trump than re-elect the president.\n\nShowing voters that they can bring about change on bread-and-butter issues may help Republicans fend off competition in 2020. Legislators are broadly in agreement that the state needs to do something about property taxes, which have risen considerably as Texas\u2019s economy has boomed and pushed up property values. Texas does not have a state income tax, so it relies disproportionately on property taxes to fund schools. But because the property tax is a very transparent levy, voters frequently complain about their high bills.\n\nMr Abbott has suggested capping the rate by which local governments can raise taxes at 2.5% without a special vote (today, that threshold is 8%); this is probably just a starting point for negotiation. But how the state will manage to reduce property-tax growth rates while doing more to fund public schools equitably and boost their performance\u2014another legislative priority\u2014is unclear. Restricting the ability of local districts to raise revenue when they have so few other sources available to them could damage the state\u2019s educational prospects in the long run.\n\nThe property-tax issue points to a broader theme in Texas politics: the clash between state and local control. In theory, Republicans tend to be in favour of light-touch regulation and leaving governance and policymaking to local authorities. But as cities have turned into Democratic bastions and forged their own liberal visions for the future, Republicans have changed their stance. For example, last year Austin and San Antonio passed ordinances that require employers to offer paid sick leave. But a bill making its way through the state Senate would hamstring cities\u2019 ability to set such policies.\n\nMuch is at stake. If Republicans lose the state House, Democrats will have a stronger influence on the redistricting process. (A Democrat-controlled House would presumably not agree with a Republican-controlled Senate plan.) In another twist, next year\u2019s election will be the first when \u201cstraight ticket\u201d voting (ie, ticking a single box to vote for every candidate from that party on a ballot) is eliminated, thanks to efforts by Republicans in the previous legislative session. Candidates will have to compete more on their own merits rather than rely on party loyalty. This could contribute, sometime between 2020 and 2026, to the end of the Republicans\u2019 20-year dominance of all statewide offices, according to Mr Jones of Rice University."

    "text": "ROBERT MUELLER has concluded his investigation into links and/or co-ordination between President Donald Trump\u2019s electoral campaign and the Russian government. This is a big moment. The special counsel\u2019s probe has already been the downfall of some of Mr Trump\u2019s closest former advisers. Many of the president\u2019s opponents are hoping his final report, now sitting on the desk of Attorney-General William Barr, is about to hook an even bigger fish: the president himself.\n\nAnalysis: How to find a way through a forest of scandals\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIt will take some time for Mr Mueller\u2019s final conclusions to come to light. Mr Barr, who returned to run the Justice Department for the second time last month, is only obliged to divulge the gist of them to Congress, and in his own time. In a letter to the House and Senate justice committees on March 22nd he said he nonetheless hoped to brief them on the report\u2019s \u201cprincipal conclusions as soon as this weekend\u201d. He added that he would take longer to consider what \u201cother information\u201d he might make available from the report.\n\nIn the meantime, Washington, DC is already half-mad with gossip and speculation about Mr Mueller\u2019s findings and Mr Barr\u2019s putative handling of them. The Democrats\u2019 leaders in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, greeted the news that Mr Mueller\u2019s report had landed by warning the attorney-general not to allow Mr Trump a \u201csneak preview\u201d of it. (The White House claims not to have seen it yet.) All the main Democratic presidential candidates, including senators Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker, then urged Mr Barr to make the full report public.\n\nAmid the speculation, a couple of things can be said with certainty.\n\nFirst, Mr Mueller\u2019s now-completed probe has been very successful. Over the past two years his team has uncovered details of an extraordinary propaganda and influence campaign by Russian agents to bend the course of the 2016 election in Mr Trump\u2019s favour. It also found that several members of Mr Trump\u2019s campaign had shady communications with people connected to the Russian government\u2014some of whom were probably spies\u2014and then lied about them.\n\nIt charged 34 people with over 200 federal crimes, including two dozen Russians, and six Trump advisers. Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, was sentenced this month to seven-and-a-half years in prison, for various financial and other crimes. Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation did not look at Russia\u2019s continuing efforts to attack American democracy. Yet it has certainly helped raise America\u2019s defences against them.\n\nSecond, despite a relentless attack on Mr Mueller by the president, who branded the probe a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d and slandered its investigators, it appears to have been conducted without political interference. The Justice Department has intimated that Mr Mueller does not intend to issue any further indictment. And in his letter to Congress Mr Barr said Mr Mueller had not been refused permission to take any \u201cproposed action\u201d. Given the fears Mr Trump\u2019s behaviour raised, this is in itself cause for considerable relief.\n\nIt may also be worth adding to the speculation a bit\u2014by noting that the president\u2019s opponents could well end up disappointed by Mr Mueller\u2019s conclusions.\n\nIt seems likely that a draft version of them is already available in the hundreds of pages of court filings that support the indictments his team has handed out. They underline the painstaking nature of the Mueller probe. They also provide no clear evidence that the Trump team, for all its lies and evasion, illegally participated in the Russian plot. Nor do they point to criminality on the part of the president.\n\nThe final report could contain additional incriminating details about Mr Trump. If, for example, the special counsel was deterred from indicting him only by the Justice Department\u2019s policy of granting immunity to a sitting president, Mr Mueller might be expected to inform Mr Barr of the charges he would otherwise have brought. This is clearly possible. But there is nothing in the available evidence to suggest it is likely.\n\nEven If Mr Mueller did not find evidence of law-breaking by Mr Trump, his critics hope his report might provide lots of evidence of lesser misdemeanours nonetheless. Yet this would also be unlikely. By longstanding convention, prosecutors should not pass judgements on or reveal salacious details about individuals unless they are related to a case they are bringing against them. That is why former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to criticise Hillary Clinton over her email arrangements in 2016\u2014despite the fact that he had found no case for her to answer\u2014was so controversial.\n\nOnly a full disclosure of Mr Mueller\u2019s report would settle the matter. The House of Representatives has already voted unanimously that this should happen. Mr Trump has also said he wants the report to be made public. Yet it probably won\u2019t be, because it is not incumbent upon the careful Mr Barr to do so, and for an additional reason that Mr Trump might take comfort from.\n\nThe most damaging misbehaviour by the Trump team\u2014and conceivably Mr Trump himself\u2014examined by the special counsel concerned its communications with Russians. Yet this is subject to a continuing counter-intelligence investigation, and therefore most likely to be kept under wraps by Mr Barr. The fact that the attorney-general has a history of taking an expansive view of executive power, which in this hypothetical case could be cited on national security grounds, makes that seem likelier still.\n\nIt is fitting that an investigation that has given rise to so much speculation over the past two years should give rise to yet more at its conclusion. Yet there is one other thing that can be said with some certainty. Even if Mr Mueller\u2019s probe has not provided the silver bullet that Mr Trump\u2019s critics crave, it has already done the president tremendous damage.\n\nIt has shown that the initial rumours of illicit Russian support for his campaign\u2014which of course Mr Trump denied\u2014grossly underestimated the extent of the Russian operation. It has shown that his campaign had several liars and charlatans, greedy for a favour from any hand, at the helm. And, perhaps most damaging of all, Mr Mueller appears to have unearthed evidence against Mr Trump on other matters, which has in turn helped sparked a proliferating number of additional investigations.\n\nThe special counsel is known, for example, to have been cooperating with federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, who are investigating the president\u2019s campaign finances and those of his inauguration committee. Mr Trump has already been named by prosecutors as a co-conspirator in a campaign finance violation committed by his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who has been sentenced to three years in prison for it and other offences.\n\nWhatever may be in the Mueller report, it will not be the end of Mr Trump\u2019s legal troubles, in other words. It may barely be the end of the beginning."

    "text": "NEAR the end of his bewildering ordeal in Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial\u201d, Josef K. gets some advice from one Titorelli, the court artist. So-called \"actual acquittals\" are the stuff of legend, Titorelli tells K. More realistic options are \u201cprotraction\u201d (keeping one\u2019s case simmering forever) or \u201capparent acquittal\u201d\u2014release with a looming possibility of re-arrest and re-trial at an unspecified future point. The follow-up brush with the law could happen years later, as soon as the poor soul arrives home or any time in between. The court \u201cforgets nothing\u201d. Whenever the authorities renew their charges against the released defendant, Kafka writes, \u201chis life as a free man is at an end.\"\n\nAmerican law imitated Kafka\u2019s fiction on March 19th when a 5-4 Supreme Court majority ruled that many immigrants who had been held in criminal custody are subject to mandatory detention by Immigration and Control Enforcement (ICE) at any time after their release. Eduardo Vega Padilla, one of the litigants in Nielsen v Preap, came to America in the 1960s as an infant and soon became a lawful permanent resident. In the late 1990s, he was twice convicted for possessing drugs and, in 2002, for illegally owning a firearm as a prior felon. In 2013, 11 years after finishing his six-month sentence for the gun conviction\u2014now a father of five and grandfather of six American citizens\u2014Mr Padilla answered a knock at his door and was taken into custody by immigration officials. He found himself on the cusp of being deported to Mexico, a country he left when he was 16 months old.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe question the justices tackled in Preap was how to interpret a 1996 law\u2014the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act\u2014requiring the detention of immigrants \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d following offences ranging from serious felonies to drug possession or \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d misdemeanours like jumping a turnstile or illegally downloading music. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2016 that green-card holders may not be nabbed and held indefinitely without a bail hearing long after being released from criminal custody. The law, the appeals court said, permitted ICE to swoop in only at the time of the immigrant\u2019s release. If authorities wanted to detain an alien at a later time, they\u2019d have to give him a hearing where he could try to prove he neither posed a danger to the community nor was a flight risk.\n\nFor Justice Samuel Alito, author of the majority opinion, that reading is \u201chard to swallow\u201d. Requiring that the \u201calien must be arrested on the day he walks out of jail\u201d\u2014whether at the prison door or in the parking lot\u2014unreasonably constrains ICE authority. With a granular analysis of the law's disputed adverbial clause (\u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d) and its relationship to \u201ca series of adjectival clauses\u201d, Justice Alito reversed the Ninth Circuit on grammatical grounds, throwing in a number of rhetorical digs. The law would amount to \u201cnonsense\u201d if it were understood to favour Mr Padilla and his fellow plaintiffs. It would be \u201cridiculous\u201d to see the law as distinguishing between different classes of criminal aliens. Mandatory detention would be \u201cdownright incoherent\u201d if it did not require the detention of every alien who has committed an offence listed in the law, at any time. In sum, the Secretary of Homeland Security \u201cmust arrest those aliens guilty of a predicate offence\u201d. What of the immigrants\u2019 claims that their \u201cstrong ties to the country\u201d make a difference and raise \u201cconstitutional doubts\u201d about being rounded up years after release from custody? That\u2019s all quite irrelevant, Justice Alito responded. The law, as written, is clear.\n\nIf the majority opinion was penned with a schoolmarm\u2019s icy attention to adverbial phrases, the dissent was crafted with a professor\u2019s horizon-scanning view of the immigrant experience and the limits of government power. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that Preap concerns \u201cbasic American legal values\u201d. It has \u201cconsequences\u201d for green-card holders who have \u201cestablished families and put down roots in a community\u201d. The ruling threatens to deprive people of their liberty without \u201cdue process of law\u201d\u2014in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2014and to strip them of \u201cthe longstanding right of virtually all persons to receive a bail hearing\u201d when held in custody. Yet Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent does not cede exegesis to the majority. \u201cThe language of the statute\u201d, he wrote, \u201cwill not bear the broad interpretation the majority now adopts.\u201d Instead, the law\u2019s \u201cordinary meaning\u201d and its \u201cstructure\u201d, together with traditional interpretive tools, \u201call argue convincingly to the contrary\u201d.\n\nCapping his 14-page interpretive foray into the 1996 law, Justice Breyer addressed how the phrase \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d should be read. The majority\u2019s inclination to permit immigrants to be grabbed at any time in the future is wrong, he wrote, but the Ninth Circuit\u2019s immediacy standard errs, too: when a parent asks a child to \u201cmow the lawn, please, when you get home from school\u201d, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean at the precise moment the child walks in the door. (\u201cShe can do a few other things first.\u201d) A six-month limit, Justice Breyer wrote, is reasonable and squares with other detention timeframes.\n\nA long-running disagreement over how to read statutes fuels the split between the court\u2019s liberals and conservatives. Whereas the Alito majority in Preap takes a magnifying glass to the words on the page and strives to understand them without reference to anything outside the four corners of the document\u2014an approach known as \u201ctextualism\u201d\u2014the Breyer dissent takes a broader view. As he wrote in his 2010 book \u201cMaking Our Democracy Work\u201d, Justice Breyer \u201clooks for the problem that Congress enacted the statute to resolve\u201d and considers how the law was intended to resolve it. He also \u201cexamines the likely consequences of a proposed interpretation\u201d to ask whether it serves the law\u2019s purposes within America's constitutional design.\n\n\u201cI would have thought that Congress meant to adhere to [America's] values and did not intend to allow the government to apprehend persons years after their release from prison\u201d, Justice Breyer wrote. To interpret the 1996 law otherwise is to do \u201cserious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood\u201d. In an era when immigrants\u2014both legal and undocumented\u2014face mounting pressure, Nielsen v Preap will do little to reassure them. Green-card holders with criminal records\u2014no matter how distant\u2014now have fresh reason to keep looking over their shoulders."

    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "DONALD TRUMP has not been afraid to upset people abroad. The American president has regularly criticised the leaders of his country\u2019s allies and cast doubt on the value of international partnerships. In 2018 he reportedly described some poor African states as \u201cshithole countries\u201d.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the share of foreigners who approve of America\u2019s leadership has dropped sharply since his election, according to Gallup, a pollster. In 2016, the median approval rate among the 133 countries it surveyed was 48%. By 2018, that figure had dropped to 31%. America is now below China\u2019s figure of 34%, and only a little above Russia\u2019s 30%.\n\n\n\nThat has generated plenty of headlines, and might worry supporters of democracy. But they should be wary of over-interpreting those figures. Gallup has provided The Economist with polling data for 18 (mostly rich) countries, starting in 2006, when it first began asking about leadership. These numbers paint a less alarming picture.\n\n\n\nThe data suggest that analysts ought to report the \u201cnet approval rate\u201d: that is, the share of people who approve of a country\u2019s leadership minus the share who disapprove. For example, the proportion of Brazilians who favour China\u2019s rulers has risen from 20% in 2008 to 32% in 2018\u2014but the share who dislike the Chinese government has also swelled from 26% to 38%, meaning that the net approval rate has remained at -6%. The real change has been that the share of Brazilians who express no opinion has fallen from 54% to 30%, which suggests that more of them have been paying attention to international news.\n\n\n\nA similar pattern exists in most of the countries in our sample, when asked about leaders in either China or Russia. Overall, there was little sign of a drastic swing in favourability towards either country.\n\n\n\nThis net approval calculation still shows a marked decline for America, from a global median of +20% in 2016 to -9% last year. But this trend should be taken with a pinch of salt. The sharpest declines have occurred in the Americas and in wealthy countries in Europe and Asia. Even in this select group, the current levels of favourability are similar to those in the final years of George W. Bush\u2019s administration. If the majority of people in these countries have sympathies to the left of the Republican Party\u2019s platform, their approval may rebound rapidly whenever a Democrat is elected president.\n\n\n\nOutside this group, Mr Trump\u2019s election has had only a limited impact on the world\u2019s view of America. Net approval rates have fluctuated only a little in the Middle East\u2014up in Israel, down elsewhere\u2014and been relatively flat in eastern Europe, India and Africa. The president has taken a wrecking ball to many international institutions, but has yet to cause irreparable damage to America\u2019s global image."

Mr Barr, who returned to run the Justice Department for the second time last month, is only obliged to divulge the gist of them to Congress, and in his own time. In a letter to the House and Senate justice committees on March 22nd he said he nonetheless hoped to brief them on the report\u2019s \u201cprincipal conclusions as soon as this weekend\u201d. He added that he would take longer to consider what \u201cother information\u201d he might make available from the report.\n\nIn the meantime, Washington, DC is already half-mad with gossip and speculation about Mr Mueller\u2019s findings and Mr Barr\u2019s putative handling of them. The Democrats\u2019 leaders in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, greeted the news that Mr Mueller\u2019s report had landed by warning the attorney-general not to allow Mr Trump a \u201csneak preview\u201d of it. (The White House claims not to have seen it yet.) All the main Democratic presidential candidates, including senators Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker, then urged Mr Barr to make the full report public.\n\nAmid the speculation, a couple of things can be said with certainty.\n\nFirst, Mr Mueller\u2019s now-completed probe has been very successful. Over the past two years his team has uncovered details of an extraordinary propaganda and influence campaign by Russian agents to bend the course of the 2016 election in Mr Trump\u2019s favour. It also found that several members of Mr Trump\u2019s campaign had shady communications with people connected to the Russian government\u2014some of whom were probably spies\u2014and then lied about them.\n\nIt charged 34 people with over 200 federal crimes, including two dozen Russians, and six Trump advisers. Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, was sentenced this month to seven-and-a-half years in prison, for various financial and other crimes. Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation did not look at Russia\u2019s continuing efforts to attack American democracy. Yet it has certainly helped raise America\u2019s defences against them.\n\nSecond, despite a relentless attack on Mr Mueller by the president, who branded the probe a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d and slandered its investigators, it appears to have been conducted without political interference. The Justice Department has intimated that Mr Mueller does not intend to issue any further indictment. And in his letter to Congress Mr Barr said Mr Mueller had not been refused permission to take any \u201cproposed action\u201d. Given the fears Mr Trump\u2019s behaviour raised, this is in itself cause for considerable relief.\n\nIt may also be worth adding to the speculation a bit\u2014by noting that the president\u2019s opponents could well end up disappointed by Mr Mueller\u2019s conclusions.\n\nIt seems likely that a draft version of them is already available in the hundreds of pages of court filings that support the indictments his team has handed out. They underline the painstaking nature of the Mueller probe. They also provide no clear evidence that the Trump team, for all its lies and evasion, illegally participated in the Russian plot. Nor do they point to criminality on the part of the president.\n\nThe final report could contain additional incriminating details about Mr Trump. If, for example, the special counsel was deterred from indicting him only by the Justice Department\u2019s policy of granting immunity to a sitting president, Mr Mueller might be expected to inform Mr Barr of the charges he would otherwise have brought. This is clearly possible. But there is nothing in the available evidence to suggest it is likely.\n\nEven If Mr Mueller did not find evidence of law-breaking by Mr Trump, his critics hope his report might provide lots of evidence of lesser misdemeanours nonetheless. Yet this would also be unlikely. By longstanding convention, prosecutors should not pass judgements on or reveal salacious details about individuals unless they are related to a case they are bringing against them. That is why former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to criticise Hillary Clinton over her email arrangements in 2016\u2014despite the fact that he had found no case for her to answer\u2014was so controversial.\n\nOnly a full disclosure of Mr Mueller\u2019s report would settle the matter. The House of Representatives has already voted unanimously that this should happen. Mr Trump has also said he wants the report to be made public. Yet it probably won\u2019t be, because it is not incumbent upon the careful Mr Barr to do so, and for an additional reason that Mr Trump might take comfort from.\n\nThe most damaging misbehaviour by the Trump team\u2014and conceivably Mr Trump himself\u2014examined by the special counsel concerned its communications with Russians. Yet this is subject to a continuing counter-intelligence investigation, and therefore most likely to be kept under wraps by Mr Barr. The fact that the attorney-general has a history of taking an expansive view of executive power, which in this hypothetical case could be cited on national security grounds, makes that seem likelier still.\n\nIt is fitting that an investigation that has given rise to so much speculation over the past two years should give rise to yet more at its conclusion. Yet there is one other thing that can be said with some certainty. Even if Mr Mueller\u2019s probe has not provided the silver bullet that Mr Trump\u2019s critics crave, it has already done the president tremendous damage.\n\nIt has shown that the initial rumours of illicit Russian support for his campaign\u2014which of course Mr Trump denied\u2014grossly underestimated the extent of the Russian operation. It has shown that his campaign had several liars and charlatans, greedy for a favour from any hand, at the helm. And, perhaps most damaging of all, Mr Mueller appears to have unearthed evidence against Mr Trump on other matters, which has in turn helped sparked a proliferating number of additional investigations.\n\nThe special counsel is known, for example, to have been cooperating with federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, who are investigating the president\u2019s campaign finances and those of his inauguration committee. Mr Trump has already been named by prosecutors as a co-conspirator in a campaign finance violation committed by his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who has been sentenced to three years in prison for it and other offences.\n\nWhatever may be in the Mueller report, it will not be the end of Mr Trump\u2019s legal troubles, in other words. It may barely be the end of the beginning."

The move thrilled Israelis and bolstered Mr Netanyahu\u2019s claim to be the most reliable guarantor of his country\u2019s vital relationship with America, which under Mr Trump has also recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. But it will complicate efforts to secure Arab support for a forthcoming American plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nThough the Golan has political, economic and symbolic importance, its strategic value is paramount. That stems largely from its geography. In the 1950s and 1960s, Israel and Syria sparred over water sources and Israeli cultivation of demilitarised areas near the Golan. Syria sometimes shelled Israeli farms and villages in the Galilee below. Once Israel grabbed the Golan in the six-day war of 1967, it tightened its grip by expelling Syrians, establishing Jewish settlements and building up army and intelligence outposts.\n\nThat outraged the rest of the world, but gave Israel a strategic edge. When Syria attacked the Golan during the Yom Kippur war of 1973, Israel was able to repel over 1,000 Syrian tanks with just 177 of its own by exploiting the area\u2019s terrain, including natural chokepoints. Mike Pompeo, America\u2019s secretary of state, recently recalled studying those tank battles when he was a cadet at West Point, a military college.\n\nIsraeli commanders view the Golan not only as a shield, but also as a potential springboard. The plateau is just 60km away from Damascus, Syria\u2019s capital. The peaks around Mount Hermon, control of which is split between Israel, Syria and Lebanon, are ideal vantage points for monitoring military activity and hoovering up intelligence. Though previous Israeli governments considered withdrawing from the Golan in exchange for Syrian concessions, most envisaged keeping early-warning facilities on the peaks.\n\nSyria\u2019s civil war created new challenges for Israel in the Golan. The local affiliate of al-Qaeda, the jihadists of Islamic State and Iranian-backed militias have all been active near the Israeli-Syrian border. This year and last Israel accused Iranian forces of firing rockets into the Golan\u2014and responded with airstrikes on Iranian facilities in Syria. On March 13th Israeli officials accused Hizbullah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group, of establishing a cell in the Syrian part of the Golan with the intention of mounting cross-border attacks.\n\nAll of that has convinced Mr Netanyahu to maintain Israel\u2019s grip on the Golan and shun negotiations with Syria. So Mr Trump\u2019s announcement makes little difference on the ground. But it does set an uncomfortable precedent. If Israel can capture and keep land by force, why can\u2019t other countries? \u201cThis is a catastrophic departure from the very basis of international law,\u201d wrote Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister and diplomat, on Twitter. \u201c[The] Kremlin will applaud and apply the same principle to Crimea. Beijing will applaud and apply to South China Sea.\u201d"

    "text": "T HE FBI called it Operation Varsity Blues. It was an investigation centred on William Singer, an enterprising college counsellor, who earned $25m from all manner of powerful people by fraudulently securing spots for their children at highly selective universities like Stanford and Yale. Among his clients charged with crimes were Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, two well-known actresses; Gordon Caplan, the co-chairman of an international law firm; and William McGlashan, a Silicon Valley private-equity executive who champions ethical investing.\n\nTo grease the lucrative scheme, Mr Singer bribed proctors of admissions exams to fake scores and bribed athletics officials to accept wealthy children with concocted sports r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, according to court documents unveiled by federal prosecutors on March 12th. The lurid details have provoked embarrassment for universities and Schadenfreude for the public.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThere is also an entirely legal way to corrupt the elite admissions system, which for some reason generates less outrage. Mr Singer grasped this dynamic: There is a front door \u201cwhich means you get in on your own\u201d and a \u201cback door\u201d secured by multimillion-dollar donations to universities, he explained in a recorded call to a client. What Mr Singer did\u2014for 761 buyers, he claimed\u2014is create a \u201cside door\u201d by bribing university officials and faking test scores that would achieve the same result at one-tenth of the cost. In effect, his scheme granted mere multimillionaires access to the billionaires\u2019 entrance.\n\nGetting in through the side door was a sordid undertaking. According to prosecutors, Mr Singer bribed Rudy Meredith, then a women\u2019s soccer coach at Yale, to accept a student who did not play competitive soccer. The relatives paid $1.2m for the slot. Ms Laughlin, one of the actresses, and her husband paid $500,000 to get their daughters, both Instagram influencers and minor celebrities in their own right, designated as crew-team recruits for the University of Southern California\u2014despite the fact that neither one rowed. Mr Caplan, the international lawyer, allegedly faked a learning-disability diagnosis for his daughter and paid $75,000 for a boosted admissions score. The prosecutors, who flipped Mr Singer, enumerate several other jaw-dropping tales, backed up with wiretaps of the various notables admitting the finer details of the schemes.\n\nRich children are already unfairly advantaged in the game of elite university admissions. They start out with stabler families, better schools and helpful networks. Elite American colleges then operate a large, entirely legal affirmative-action programme for the rich. Most highly selective American universities indulge in \u201clegacy preferences\u201d\u2014positive discrimination for relatives of alumni\u2014that disproportionately benefit the already rich. Such universities also have lax standards for recruited athletes, which helps rich children. Opportunities to row, fence or play golf do not abound in the ghetto.\n\nFunding a new building just as a mediocre child applies to college, in the hope of boosting their admission chances, remains perfectly legal so long as there is no established quid pro quo. The strategy seems common and successful. Emails recently revealed by a lawsuit show one Harvard dean \u201csimply thrilled\u201d about admissions decisions because one unnamed person had \u201calready committed to building and building\u201d and two others \u201ccommitted major money for fellowships.\u201d\n\nThe result is that, for all the paeans sung to racial diversity, socioeconomic diversity in the hallowed ivy quadrangles remains woeful. A survey conducted by Yale\u2019s student newspaper found that twice as many students come from families in the top 5% of the income distribution as from the entire bottom half."

    "text": "H E SEEMS to have been a classic \u201clone wolf\u201d. As far as police can tell, the man who murdered 50 worshippers, and critically wounded nine more, at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15th was not part of any organisation. The 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, claimed to have developed his violent beliefs on his own, surfing the internet and visiting Europe. He bought his weapons himself. He honed his skills at a suburban shooting-range. No one there suspected that he was preparing a massacre.\n\nYet he was part of something much bigger. The names and slogans scrawled on his weapons were familiar to extreme white nationalists all around the world\u2014but hardly anyone else. His ranting internet manifesto, \u201cThe Great Replacement\u201d, repeated a staple far-right conspiracy theory: that non-white and Muslim immigrants in Western countries are invaders, ushered in by scheming elites to replace ethnic-European populations. Variants of that once-fringe idea are now common, not just in social-media posts by anonymous wackos but in the speeches of elected politicians from Hungary to Iowa.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn another sense, too, the lone wolf had a pack. Attacks by neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other extreme-right types are growing more common. In America they outnumber those committed by Islamists. Of 263 domestic terrorism incidents in 2010-17, fully 92 were carried out by far-right attackers, compared with 38 by jihadists, according to an analysis of the Global Terrorism Database by the Washington Post. In Europe jihadist killings still predominate, but deaths from extreme-right terrorism have surged since 2010 (see chart).\n\nThe past six months have seen a rash of far-right terrorist incidents. Last autumn a white nationalist killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. France broke up a plot to kill Emmanuel Macron, the president, and Spain arrested a fascist hoping to assassinate Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the prime minister. Germany uncovered an extremist cell in the army, allegedly planning to kill the foreign minister and others. In February America\u2019s FBI arrested a Coast Guard officer who had an arsenal and a target-list of Democratic politicians.\n\nGlobally, white-nationalist terrorism is far less deadly than the jihadist variety. But it is more prevalent than authorities acknowledge, says Jacob Aasland Ravndal of Norway\u2019s Centre for Research on Extremism. Legal definitions of terrorism often require that an attack be planned in advance. Much extreme-right violence is spontaneous. Even burning down a refugee centre may count as a hate crime, not terrorism. Europol, the EU \u2019s law-enforcement agency, ascribed just 3% of terrorist attacks in 2017 to the far right. But Mr Ravndal\u2019s database of ideologically motivated violent incidents shows that in western Europe, though jihadists kill more people, the far right carry out more attacks.\n\nMore right than they know\n\nIf the threat from white nationalists is underestimated, that is partly because they are more publicity-shy. Mr Tarrant and his hero, Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011, were exceptions. They left manifestos and tried to maximise media exposure. Indeed, the Christchurch killer also resembled sophisticated jihadist outfits, both in the ostentatious cruelty of his crime and in his hope that it would polarise society, fuelling yet more extremism.\n\nThe Breivik tradition\n\nIslamic State tries to provoke the West into persecuting Muslims and thus driving sympathisers from the \u201cgrey zone\u201d towards radical participation. Right-wing extremists may also hope to provoke an Islamist backlash. Police are investigating a possible terrorist motive behind the murder of three people on a tram in Utrecht in the Netherlands, three days after the massacre in Christchurch. A Turkish-born suspect has been arrested.\n\nIn Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has seized on the attack in Christchurch as evidence of a broad conspiracy against Turkey and Islam. He has quoted from the killer\u2019s manifesto, which includes calls to expel Turks from Europe and to kill Mr Erdogan. The president\u2019s not-so-subtle message is that only he can protect Turks from rampant white nationalism.\n\nThe Christchurch killer also hoped to provoke stricter gun laws, so that gun-owners would rise up in revolt. There is not much chance of more gun control in America, Mr Tarrant\u2019s primary target. However, Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, is moving to tighten her country\u2019s lax gun laws. This will not start a civil war. New Zealand prides itself on multiculturalism (see article). Its politics are more moderate than Australia\u2019s.\n\nThat, along with its easy gun laws, may have been why Mr Tarrant picked New Zealand. He wrote that he wanted to prove that nowhere was safe. Muslims in Christchurch have lost all sense of security. Tofazzal Alam, who survived the attack, says he is now afraid \u201cto go to mosque, afraid of any crowd, afraid even to open the door\u201d.\n\nYet the killer\u2019s manifesto was inspired by events far away in Europe. He claimed he was converted to radical-right ideology on a trip to France in 2017, when he saw how much of the population was Muslim. He decorated his flak jacket with a \u201cblack sun\u201d, a symbol traced to a floor motif used in his castle by Heinrich Himmler, a Nazi leader. He decorated his weapons with the names of victims of jihadist attacks in Stockholm and Paris. Before the shootings, he listened in his car to \u201cGod is a Serb\u201d, a song written in 1993 in support of Radovan Karadzic\u2014a Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide for his role in the massacre of 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995.\n\nThe idea that Muslims and non-whites are \u201cinvaders\u201d imported by a cosmopolitan elite to replace ethnic Europeans has its roots in thinkers of the French \u201cnew right\u201d of the 1970s, such as Alain de Benoist and Renaud Camus. It is often linked to the belief that multicultural societies, far from promoting diversity, extinguish it by mixing distinct cultures and races together. The nuttiest apostles of such notions equate immigration with genocide.\n\nThese ideas attracted the anti-Muslim populist politicians who sprung up across Europe around the turn of the millennium, especially after the September 11th attacks in America. They inspired the far-right youth network Generation Identity. But the big impetus came in 2015-16, when some 2m asylum-seekers, mostly from the Middle East, poured into Europe.\n\nFor right-wing populists, this crisis was a godsend. Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, built a fence against the migrants and began calling himself a defender of Christian Europe. A frenzied opposition to Muslim immigration (real or imaginary) is the lodestar of populist-right parties in Germany, Poland, Sweden and Italy. At the European Parliament this month, Javier Ortega Smith of Vox, a new far-right Spanish party, thundered that had Spanish and Venetian fleets not won the battle of Lepanto against the Turks in 1571, every female MEP \u201cwould be wearing a burqa\u201d.\n\nDaniel Koehler of the German Institute on Radicalisation and De-radicalisation Studies says that it is no coincidence that extreme-right violence jumped during the migrant crisis, along with the fortunes of far-right parties: \u201cIf you think you have \u2026to protect against \u2018invaders\u2019\u2014how do you do that without using force?\u201d\n\nIn America, too, the rise in extreme-right violence is linked to mainstream politics. Between 2009 and 2018, white supremacists killed more than three-quarters of the 313 people murdered by extremists. In 2016, the year Donald Trump won the presidency, more anti-Muslim assaults were reported to the FBI (127) than in any year since 2001 (93).\n\nSuch attacks rose steeply after Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008. Daryl Johnson, who spent 15 years studying right-wing terrorist groups, including at the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ), wrote a paper in 2009 warning that the arrival that year of a black person in the White House could spark far-right violence. Demonised by conservatives for this, he left the DHS in 2010. Today, he says, it has no experts in right-wing terrorism. A spokesman did not deny this, but, in an email, said that the DHS is \u201ccommitted to combating all forms of violent extremism, especially those that espouse racial supremacy or bigotry\u201d.\n\nIn denial\n\nMr Trump has played down the threat of right-wing extremists, calling them \u201ca small group of people that have very, very serious problems\u201d. In 2017 his administration cancelled grants to groups combating white-supremacism. Peter Singer, a cyber-security expert at the New America Foundation who was invited to speak to Mr Trump\u2019s national-security staff that year, said that they dismissed white-supremacist terrorism as \u201ca law-enforcement issue\u201d, and denied that it is transnational.\n\nIn fact, the ties between American and European extreme-right groups are ever closer. Europe\u2019s Generation Identity groups are linked to Identity Evropa, one of the the American far-right organisations that planned a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, where a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd and killed a counter-protester. Marchers at that rally chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d, referring to the same \u201cgreat replacement\u201d thesis shared by European extremists and the Christchurch killer.\n\nMr Trump has played the role for American white nationalists that such leaders as Mr Orban played for Europe\u2019s, says Brian Levin, who heads the Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. These groups, he says, saw their ideas, such as building a wall like Mr Orban\u2019s, and banning or deporting Muslims, \u201cgetting into the mainstream tent\u201d. They took this as a \u201cgreen light\u201d for violence. And he notes that, like the young on Europe\u2019s extremist right, they have softened their image in the past decade. Shaved heads and combat boots have given way to army haircuts, polo shirts and corduroy jackets.\n\nFar-right groups lack the state sponsors and safe havens enjoyed by some jihadists. Many on the extreme right admire Russia but it does not fit the bill. It has cultivated ties with far-right parties in Europe, but has snuffed out extremists at home. In the 2000s hate-motivated attacks, often directed at immigrants and internal migrants from the north Caucasus, reached nearly 700 a year, as the state flirted with nationalist movements. Clashes in Moscow in 2011 between police and far-right groups mixed with football hooligans showed the dangers of tolerating the ultranationalists. After they joined anti-government protests in 2011-12, the state began shutting them down, detaining the most violent. In 2014 war with Ukraine split the movement into pro-government and pro-Ukrainian factions. The SOVA Centre, an independent monitor, recorded just 57 hate-motivated attacks in 2018.\n\nThe Ukrainian model\n\nOther Western white nationalists look to Ukraine itself, a hotbed of far-right activity since the Maidan uprising in 2014. Quasi-fascist militias, such as the Azov Battalion, have fought Russia in the east and taken a role in policing. So Kiev is \u201ca place of attraction for the global far-right\u201d, says Anton Shekhovtsov, of the University of Vienna. Some European radicals have joined Ukrainians on the front lines. American white supremacists have been spotted in Kiev. But as Mr Shekhovtsov puts it, \u201cmigration is a first-world problem\u201d, and, whereas earlier far-right groups would beat up foreigners from Africa and Asia, Azov is keener on disrupting gay-pride marches. In any case, Ukrainian men seeking romantic violence have plenty to do in the east.\n\nA more pressing concern for Western governments is far-right radicalism within their armed forces. Soldiers, obviously, are trained and have access to weapons. In America the DHS warned a decade ago that right-wing extremists will attempt to \u201crecruit and radicalise\u201d veterans, recalling the terrorist attacks of the 1990s by bitter ex-soldiers, such as the Oklahoma City bombing. A study of 119 lone-actor terrorists across America and Europe since 1990 found that 26% had done military service.\n\nRacial tension is rising in the armed services. A recent poll by Military Times, a newspaper, found that over half of non-white American service members had suffered racism in 2018, up from 42% in the previous year. In 2017 two marines were arrested for hanging a white-supremacist banner on a building in North Carolina. On March 18th the Huffington Post, a news website, identified seven serving American soldiers as active in Identity Evropa.\n\nThe German authorities are investigating some 450 cases of suspected right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr. Last year the security services identified dozens of police and soldiers as members of Reichsb\u00fcrger, a far-right movement. In Britain in September 2017 four soldiers were arrested for membership of National Action, a banned neo-Nazi group. \u201cIf we get enough of us into the Army,\u201d suggested one, \u201cwe\u2019ll be in the right place when things start to collapse.\u201d\n\nArmies are tightening their vetting procedures and becoming more vigilant. They insist that adherence to law is drilled into recruits. But, for good reason, most armed forces are prohibited from conducting political education.\n\nTracking sources of danger is hard because, as Mr Koehler, the German scholar, points out, far-right violence typically involves loose groups of individuals radicalised on social media. He calls this \u201chive terrorism\u201d. It is practically impossible to predict when someone will go from wishing others dead to actually killing them.\n\nThe Christchurch killer is a perfect example. He spent time on 8chan, a messageboard that prides itself on allowing users to post anything not illegal under American law. (After the attack, its administrators said they would co-operate with police.) It concerns itself with everything from Japanese cartoons to role-playing games. Anonymous posting is the norm.\n\nThe board\u2019s \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d subsections are far-right haunts. Their culture is a self-consciously puerile mishmash of memes, absurdism and irony, making it hard to know how seriously to take anything posted there. When Mr Tarrant declared on 8chan that he was about to commit murder, and proceeded to live-stream it on Facebook, many replies expressed surprise (often pleased) that the promised shooting spree was actually happening.\n\nThe killer\u2019s manifesto, too, is steeped in 8chan-like irony, a style sometimes termed \u201cshitposting\u201d. Serious rants about low European birth-rates alternate with claims to have been radicalised by \u201cSpyro the Dragon 3\u201d, a children\u2019s video game. If the media took such claims seriously, they would prove their own cluelessness.\n\nSince the attacks, there have been calls for internet platforms to do a better job of restricting violent right-wing content. Facebook has been blamed for letting the live-stream of the attack go on for 17 minutes. The platform says it began vigorously blocking the video as soon as it discovered it, removing 1.5m attempts to repost it. But internet users could still find copies hours after the attack. (It did not help that some \u201cmainstream\u201d media sites\u2014and even Mr Erdogan\u2014used some of it.)\n\nBig internet platforms could do more, but they face a gargantuan task. The underlying problem, says Ben Nimmo of the Oxford Internet Institute, is that \u201cradicalising content is not constant\u201d\u2014one viewer\u2019s trigger to violence is another\u2019s harmless satire. Hopes that artificial intelligence might do much of the filtering have not worked out; armies of human reviewers are still needed, and even they often err.\n\nHowever hard it is to stop terrorists exploiting the internet, other citizens can, at least, refuse to help them. The Christchurch killer\u2019s fixation on the former Yugoslavia is apt: as in that war, white nationalists seek to use spectacular violence and propaganda to turn citizens against each other. In New Zealand Ms Ardern has turned this on its head. She has tried to use horrific slaughter to unite a country in opposition to a creed whose most famous new exponent she refuses to name."

    "text": "WHEN 15,000 female garment workers went on strike in New York City more than a century ago, their goal was to secure higher wages, shorter hours and better working conditions. Women today are still pursuing those aims. Although working conditions have improved significantly since the protest in 1908, which led to the creation of International Women\u2019s Day (now celebrated on March 8th), the median pay gap for full-time working women is still around 14%. And figures from The Economist\u2019s latest glass-ceiling index, which measures where women have the best chance of equal treatment at work, show that, after decades of improvement, progress for women in the workplace has stalled in recent years.\n\nMany of the measures associated with equal treatment at work, including pay, seniority and the decision to enter the workforce at all, remain relatively stable. Our index is based on performance across ten indicators including educational attainment, labour-market attachment, pay and representation in senior jobs. In the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, the gender pay gap, which measures the difference between what a typical woman and man earn, remains largely unchanged from last year at around 14%. The share of women on company boards, at 23%, has slightly increased, but the proportion of women in management has barely budged. Although the share of women in the labour force has crept up a little, to 64%, it is still 16 percentage points below the male average.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nWith few changes in the underlying data, it is little wonder that the countries doing best in this year\u2019s glass-ceiling index are mostly the same ones that received top marks in previous years. The Nordics are particularly good at getting women to complete university (around half earn a degree) and secure a job (some 75% are in the labour force). They also have a large share of women in senior positions; in Sweden and Norway the figure is around 40%. Mandatory quotas for women on boards have helped boost female representation. The Nordics also offer better parental-leave systems. Flexible schedules help parents who want to juggle work and child care. More than half the employees in those countries have at least some control over their working hours.\n\nThe OECD countries with the worst environment for working women tend to be in Asia. In South Korea, which ranks last in our index, the pay gap is a whopping 35%. The female labour-force participation rate there is just 59%, compared with 79% for men. Moon Jae-in, South Korea\u2019s president, would like women to hold 10% of senior government positions and make up 20% of public-company executives and 40% of government committees by 2022. But there is a long way to go. Boards of directors at publicly traded South Korean firms are 98% male; out of 109 companies, only one has a female boss. Just over one in ten managerial positions in the country are held by women. While paternity leave is generous, uptake is still low.\n\nThings are little better in Japan, which ranks second-to-last in our index. Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, has tried to promote more women in the workforce to address labour shortages. On this narrow measure, he has succeeded: their number has gone up by 2m since 2015. But most of this work is part-time and poorly paid. The wage gap in Japan is still a hefty 25%. And despite Mr Abe\u2019s support for \u201cwomenomics\u201d, last October he appointed just one woman to his new cabinet. (In his defence, Mr Abe said she has the \u201cpresence of two or three women\u201d.)\n\nCultural and societal norms appear to be a decisive influence on gender equality at work. In Asia, many women are expected to choose between having a family and a career. Moreover, the division of labour at home is often woefully unbalanced. In Japan and South Korea, for example, women do roughly five times more housework, food shopping and other unpaid activities than men do. Women who want to climb the career ladder often struggle to secure spots at top firms. Men are typically favoured for promotions.\n\nStill, there have been some bright spots, particularly in the governments of western democracies. Last June Spain\u2019s prime minister appointed the first female-majority cabinet since the country returned to democracy in 1975. Last November more women than ever were elected to office in America\u2019s mid-term congressional elections. And despite threats to their leadership, Angela Merkel and Theresa May still hold the top political positions in their respective countries. Having women in positions of power should improve the chances of public policies that promote equality in the workplace."

    "text": "A RMS OUTSTRETCHED , the congregation at Hyde Park Baptist Church welcomed the Holy Spirit into their two-storey, stained-glass sanctuary. Along with the spirit came their pastor, Kie Bowman, accompanied by a full jazz orchestra. He summed up his sermon as: \u201cto impact culture, love the Bible\u201d. But interspersed with this joyful invitation to share the Gospel were some spiky remarks, such his assertion that \u201cyou have to be convinced by the media that God does not exist.\u201d Such has been the transformation of white evangelical Christianity over the past half-century. But conservative politics in church have also caused a backlash.\n\nMr Bowman\u2019s statements reflect the battle that evangelical denominations have been fighting since the 1980s, when evangelical leaders began to move past discussions about morality and embraced conservative rhetoric about individual rights. Andrew Lewis, author of a book about this phenomenon called \u201cThe Rights Turn\u201d, says that Republicans and conservative Christians now have a shared approach to the law. As examples, he points to the use of free-speech rights to defend anti-abortion legislation and to argue against regulating campaign finance. That fusion seemed complete in 2016, when 81% of white born-again Christians voted for Donald Trump, according to data from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nYet this coupling seems to be hurting membership of evangelical churches. Several polling firms have detected a decline in the share of Americans who describe themselves as white evangelicals over the past decade. The Pew Research Centre found a two-percentage-point drop from 2007 to 2012. PRRI found a six-percentage-point drop in the share of the population that identify as white evangelicals, from 23% in 2006 to 17% in 2016. ABC and the Washington Post found a still larger decline of eight percentage points, larger than the drop among mainline white Protestants. The problem is partly generational: in the PRRI data just 8% of young Americans aged 18-29 say they are white evangelicals, while 26% of those aged 65 or older are white evangelical Protestants. Together with the decline in the share of whites who identify as Catholics, this has caused anxiety among some of the faithful that white Christian America is under threat.\n\nThe argument about how to restore lost greatness has been running for 40 years. In the late 1970s the Southern Baptist Convention ( SBC ), an umbrella organisation for evangelical churches, was roiled by a confrontation between modernisers, who were in charge of the organisation, and traditionalists, who blamed them for presiding over a levelling-off in church attendance. The traditionalists won, but on their watch the malaise has worsened. Nor are falling numbers the only problem: an exhaustive investigation by the Houston Chronicle and the San Antonio Express-News identified more than 250 church leaders who have been accused of sexually abusing people who worshipped at SBC churches.\n\nMany churches remain committed to preaching conservative politics from the pulpit on Sundays. The SBC \u2019s leadership, however, has been critical of Mr Trump. Russell Moore, a theologian who heads its work on public policy, is among the president\u2019s most eloquent critics.\n\nThis may be too little, too late for a group of former evangelicals who are trying to organise \u201cex-vangelicals\u201d\u2014or \u201cexvies\u201d\u2014into a nascent political movement. Christopher Stroop, a journalist, has emerged as a leader among the exvies. Mr Stroop was raised in a fundamentalist evangelical household, where he went to non-denominational Christian schools and was surrounded mostly by friends who shared his beliefs. In high-school, biology lessons about DNA would be interspersed with preaching from the teacher, and sometimes with documentaries on \u201cflood geology\u201d and the search for Noah\u2019s ark. \u201cThere was strong pressure to be a young-Earth creationist,\u201d Mr Stroop says. He also recalls a class field-trip during school hours to a prototype Tea Party convention. Mr Stroop says his education was \u201call about isolating children in the subculture so they\u2019ll grow up to be the culture warriors the church wants them to be.\u201d\n\nHe typifies a larger pattern. In a paper published in 2017 Paul Djupe, Jacob Neiheisel and Anand Sokhey, all political scientists, found that people stop attending church when they have intellectual disagreements with their religion and when they lose social attachments to their congregations. Since Americans have become yoked to their political tribe with an intensity that often rivals religious fervour, those with moderate political disagreements frequently find their faith hard to reconcile with their politics and end up leaving their churches."

    "text": "SINCE 2016, Donald Trump has tried to sow doubts about the results of an election he won\u2014claiming, for instance, that he lost the popular vote because so many \u201cillegals\u201d voted. Imagining how he might respond if he loses in 2020 is unsettling. Because Americans are so divided politically, they need to have confidence in the electoral process. A new report about America\u2019s voting infrastructure from the Brennan Centre for Justice, a public policy think-tank, should alarm anyone who agrees with that.\n\nThe report finds that voting machines across America are antiquated. Fully 45 states use equipment that is no longer manufactured, and 40 use machines at least a decade old. This makes finding spare parts and undertaking essential repairs difficult and expensive. The code for some machines is so old that they no longer receive security updates, leaving them vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nMany of these old machines are paperless\u2014meaning they produce no hard copies that voters can verify, or that can be used in audits or recounts. Twelve states use paperless machines in some counties or towns, while four use them state-wide\u2014including Georgia, where the recent governor\u2019s election was marred by accusations of voter suppression and tampering and where the machines may have been among those hacked two years ago.\n\nMost of those 12 states said they wanted to buy new machines that produce paper ballots, and some have even passed laws requiring that. But that is an expensive undertaking. Since 2015 Congress has distributed $380m in grants to improve election security. But that does not go very far. Officials in 31 of the 45 states with outdated voting machines said they needed to replace their machines before 2020, but two-thirds of those officials said they lacked funding to do so\u2014even with congressional funds. Of the 12 paperless states, only one, Delaware, has secured the money to replace machines this year. And some of those federal funds will also go to pay for better cybersecurity and improving post-election audits. But not all states require audits, which tend to compare paper trails with voting-machine totals in a random sampling of districts as a way to detect fraud or irregularities.\n\nThe state of America\u2019s voting machines raises two concerns. The first is that old, insecure machines are more vulnerable to exploitation, cyberattacks and tampering. Replacing them with newer machines would be a good first step. The other concern is that rickety voting infrastructure dents Americans\u2019 confidence in the process; the new report comes just 20 months before the next presidential election. If the results of that election end up contested, Americans need to believe that the adjudication and dispute-settling processes are fair and reliable. Outdated, rickety voting machines without paper trails make that much harder, and risk worsening any post-election discontent."

      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "L ONDON BREED , the mayor of San Francisco, recently announced a new drugs task-force, which is the kind of thing mayors do. This task force, though, was unusual because it was not aimed at opioids but at methamphetamine. In 2017 meth overdoses killed 87 people in the city, more than twice as many as heroin. Open-air dealing, uninterrupted by the police, is a common sight in the poor Tenderloin district. Use is widespread among the city\u2019s many homeless. Because the drug induces aggression, frenzy and paranoia, passers-by often feel unsafe. Half the people now admitted for psychiatric emergencies to the city\u2019s general hospital are suffering from the effects of meth-induced psychosis.\n\nThe problem is not confined to San Francisco. Although politicians and journalists are understandably transfixed by the 50,000 people killed by opioids each year, the rise in meth-overdose deaths has attracted less attention (see chart). In 2000 only 578 Americans died of an overdose. By 2017, deaths had increased 18-fold to 10,333 people. Meth addiction mostly afflicts western and south-western states like Arizona, Oklahoma and New Mexico, where fentanyl and heroin deaths are less common than in the east. For that reason, states tend to either have a meth problem or an opioid problem\u2014with the exception of West Virginia, which leads the nation in overdose deaths for both.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nMuch of this deadly surge is caused by supply. Little meth is now made in America. The number of domestic meth labs busted by police dropped from 15,000 in 2010 to 3,000 in 2017. Most of these are amateurish operations that cops call \u201cBeavis and Butthead labs\u201d, incapable of producing more than two ounces of the stuff per batch. \u201cMexican cartels dominate the market. They manufacture meth in superlabs across the border,\u201d says Chris Nielsen, the special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s ( DEA ) San Francisco division. Left unmolested, the chemists have perfected their technique. The purity of Mexican-produced meth has surged from 39% in 2007 to 97% today. At the same time, competition between cartels has increased supply, quartering prices. \u201cThey\u2019re becoming more brazen now. The loads are becoming bigger,\u201d says Mr Nielsen. His division seized 830kg of meth in 2018\u201447% more than the year before.\n\nAnother reason for the meth surge is the growth of so-called polydrug abuse. Half of those who died of meth overdoses in 2017 also had opioids in their system. Users usually have a drug of choice\u2014opioids, which numb feeling, or stimulants such as cocaine and meth. When they cannot cheaply or easily obtain their preferred hit (or if they are afraid that the local batch is tainted), they will often substitute another drug. In robust urban markets, doses of fentanyl-laced heroin or meth can be obtained for as little as $5.\n\nOne factor that had limited the spread of meth is that it is a pain to use. Injecting it requires dissolving it in acid and high heat, which then damages veins. Smoking it harms the lungs. But that too may now be changing, as manufacturers are experimenting with putting the drug in pill form. A husband and wife were recently arrested for running a meth-pill operation from their business, a care home in Vallejo, California. They had 31lb of pills embossed with reproductions of American icons like the Kool-Aid man, Tesla and Donald Trump. Widespread introduction of such pills would not just make the drug easier to take; it could also be sold as a party drug to unsuspecting youngsters.\n\nIn San Francisco, where the death rate in 2017 was nearly triple the national average, rates of use are especially high among gay residents, who take it as a party drug, and the homeless. Its cheapness has accelerated \u201ca problem that has existed for decades among the LGBT community around meth use,\u201d says Raphael Mandelman, a member of the city\u2019s board of supervisors. It is also used by \u201cfolks who are homeless who are trying to get through a cold night or stay awake,\u201d he says.\n\nLike opioids, meth is highly addictive and difficult to quit. But unlike opioids, it lacks effective pharmacological treatments. There is no approved medication-assisted treatment for addiction which substantially decreases the chance of relapse. There is also no equivalent of naloxone, a life-saving drug that reverses an opioid overdose. Meth kills by overloading blood vessels, eventually resulting in aneurysms, heart failure and strokes. As a result, longtime older users are likeliest to die\u2014in San Francisco, the average age of those who die of a meth overdose is 49."

    "text": "T HE KEY TO understanding Texas is the state Capitol in Austin. It is there that legislators meet only every other year to pass new laws and set the state budget. The elegant domed building is several feet taller than the Capitol in Washington, and that matters to Texans. Gun-owners with a concealed-carry licence can enter through a separate security lane and do not have to go through the indignity of a metal detector, as lowly journalists do. The Capitol is built of pinkish granite, a suitable material for a red state now facing the prospect of diluted Republican influence.\n\nAfter years of pushing to the right on social issues and immigration, Texas Republicans have shifted their tone during the current legislative session. \u201cThere\u2019s been a rush to the middle,\u201d explains Jason Sabo of Frontera Strategy, a lobbying firm. Evidence of that lies in the list of priorities presented by Greg Abbott, the recently re-elected Republican governor. His \u201cemergency\u201d items, which he wants the legislature to focus on, include financing public schools, paying teachers more, reforming the property-tax regime, funding for special education and expanding access to mental-health services.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nHow unlike the previous session of the biennial legislature, in 2017. Back then Republicans passed a hugely controversial immigration bill, giving law-enforcement officers the right to stop people and ask to see papers confirming their citizenship. Some compare this action to Proposition 187, an anti-immigration bill that passed in California in 1994 and turned Hispanics in that state against the Republican Party. Another contentious legislative item that session was a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, designed to regulate where transgender people are allowed to pee. Mr Abbott declared it a priority at the time, though ultimately it withered after opposition from businesses.\n\nRepublicans \u201chave moved over to our issue set and the things we had been talking about,\u201d says Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. Culture wars are still playing out in this legislative session, including over abortion, but they are fewer. Republicans are \u201cnot talking about divisive social issues any more,\u201d says Joe Straus, who served as Speaker of the Texas House for a decade before stepping down in January. Republicans moved to the right to win primaries against other Republicans, but now they face more challenging general elections. Today \u201cthere\u2019s more fear of the November voter than there is of the primary voter. But there\u2019s fear of both,\u201d says Mr Straus.\n\nThere are several reasons for the Republicans\u2019 change of tone and approach, but the 2016 and 2018 elections are central to it. In 2016 Hillary Clinton lost Texas by the smallest margin of any Democrat since 1996. In 2018, when Democrats picked up 12 House seats and two state Senate seats, many right-wing Republicans lost what were thought to be safe districts or won by slimmer margins than expected. This had more than a little to do with Beto O\u2019Rourke, who was challenging Republican Ted Cruz for the US Senate. Although he lost, Mr O\u2019Rourke helped get many down-ballot Democratic state legislators and judges elected.\n\nDonald Trump has also cast a shadow over state Republicans. \u201cThe worst thing that ever happened to Texas Republicans was the election of Donald Trump,\u201d says Mark Jones of Rice University in Houston. Mr Trump has alienated many white Republican women in Texas, and has also pushed away Hispanics, who account for around 40% of the state\u2019s population. Long after Mr Trump leaves office, demographic change in Texas will continue to exert an influence on the fortunes of Republicans, as the Hispanic population grows, millennials vote in increasing numbers and people continue to move to Texas from other states, bringing their more liberal politics with them. According to a recent poll by the University of Texas and Texas Tribune, more Texans say they would sooner vote for a candidate running against Mr Trump than re-elect the president.\n\nShowing voters that they can bring about change on bread-and-butter issues may help Republicans fend off competition in 2020. Legislators are broadly in agreement that the state needs to do something about property taxes, which have risen considerably as Texas\u2019s economy has boomed and pushed up property values. Texas does not have a state income tax, so it relies disproportionately on property taxes to fund schools. But because the property tax is a very transparent levy, voters frequently complain about their high bills.\n\nMr Abbott has suggested capping the rate by which local governments can raise taxes at 2.5% without a special vote (today, that threshold is 8%); this is probably just a starting point for negotiation. But how the state will manage to reduce property-tax growth rates while doing more to fund public schools equitably and boost their performance\u2014another legislative priority\u2014is unclear. Restricting the ability of local districts to raise revenue when they have so few other sources available to them could damage the state\u2019s educational prospects in the long run.\n\nThe property-tax issue points to a broader theme in Texas politics: the clash between state and local control. In theory, Republicans tend to be in favour of light-touch regulation and leaving governance and policymaking to local authorities. But as cities have turned into Democratic bastions and forged their own liberal visions for the future, Republicans have changed their stance. For example, last year Austin and San Antonio passed ordinances that require employers to offer paid sick leave. But a bill making its way through the state Senate would hamstring cities\u2019 ability to set such policies.\n\nMuch is at stake. If Republicans lose the state House, Democrats will have a stronger influence on the redistricting process. (A Democrat-controlled House would presumably not agree with a Republican-controlled Senate plan.) In another twist, next year\u2019s election will be the first when \u201cstraight ticket\u201d voting (ie, ticking a single box to vote for every candidate from that party on a ballot) is eliminated, thanks to efforts by Republicans in the previous legislative session. Candidates will have to compete more on their own merits rather than rely on party loyalty. This could contribute, sometime between 2020 and 2026, to the end of the Republicans\u2019 20-year dominance of all statewide offices, according to Mr Jones of Rice University."

    "text": "NEAR the end of his bewildering ordeal in Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial\u201d, Josef K. gets some advice from one Titorelli, the court artist. So-called \"actual acquittals\" are the stuff of legend, Titorelli tells K. More realistic options are \u201cprotraction\u201d (keeping one\u2019s case simmering forever) or \u201capparent acquittal\u201d\u2014release with a looming possibility of re-arrest and re-trial at an unspecified future point. The follow-up brush with the law could happen years later, as soon as the poor soul arrives home or any time in between. The court \u201cforgets nothing\u201d. Whenever the authorities renew their charges against the released defendant, Kafka writes, \u201chis life as a free man is at an end.\"\n\nAmerican law imitated Kafka\u2019s fiction on March 19th when a 5-4 Supreme Court majority ruled that many immigrants who had been held in criminal custody are subject to mandatory detention by Immigration and Control Enforcement (ICE) at any time after their release. Eduardo Vega Padilla, one of the litigants in Nielsen v Preap, came to America in the 1960s as an infant and soon became a lawful permanent resident. In the late 1990s, he was twice convicted for possessing drugs and, in 2002, for illegally owning a firearm as a prior felon. In 2013, 11 years after finishing his six-month sentence for the gun conviction\u2014now a father of five and grandfather of six American citizens\u2014Mr Padilla answered a knock at his door and was taken into custody by immigration officials. He found himself on the cusp of being deported to Mexico, a country he left when he was 16 months old.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe question the justices tackled in Preap was how to interpret a 1996 law\u2014the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act\u2014requiring the detention of immigrants \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d following offences ranging from serious felonies to drug possession or \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d misdemeanours like jumping a turnstile or illegally downloading music. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2016 that green-card holders may not be nabbed and held indefinitely without a bail hearing long after being released from criminal custody. The law, the appeals court said, permitted ICE to swoop in only at the time of the immigrant\u2019s release. If authorities wanted to detain an alien at a later time, they\u2019d have to give him a hearing where he could try to prove he neither posed a danger to the community nor was a flight risk.\n\nFor Justice Samuel Alito, author of the majority opinion, that reading is \u201chard to swallow\u201d. Requiring that the \u201calien must be arrested on the day he walks out of jail\u201d\u2014whether at the prison door or in the parking lot\u2014unreasonably constrains ICE authority. With a granular analysis of the law's disputed adverbial clause (\u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d) and its relationship to \u201ca series of adjectival clauses\u201d, Justice Alito reversed the Ninth Circuit on grammatical grounds, throwing in a number of rhetorical digs. The law would amount to \u201cnonsense\u201d if it were understood to favour Mr Padilla and his fellow plaintiffs. It would be \u201cridiculous\u201d to see the law as distinguishing between different classes of criminal aliens. Mandatory detention would be \u201cdownright incoherent\u201d if it did not require the detention of every alien who has committed an offence listed in the law, at any time. In sum, the Secretary of Homeland Security \u201cmust arrest those aliens guilty of a predicate offence\u201d. What of the immigrants\u2019 claims that their \u201cstrong ties to the country\u201d make a difference and raise \u201cconstitutional doubts\u201d about being rounded up years after release from custody? That\u2019s all quite irrelevant, Justice Alito responded. The law, as written, is clear.\n\nIf the majority opinion was penned with a schoolmarm\u2019s icy attention to adverbial phrases, the dissent was crafted with a professor\u2019s horizon-scanning view of the immigrant experience and the limits of government power. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that Preap concerns \u201cbasic American legal values\u201d. It has \u201cconsequences\u201d for green-card holders who have \u201cestablished families and put down roots in a community\u201d. The ruling threatens to deprive people of their liberty without \u201cdue process of law\u201d\u2014in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2014and to strip them of \u201cthe longstanding right of virtually all persons to receive a bail hearing\u201d when held in custody. Yet Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent does not cede exegesis to the majority. \u201cThe language of the statute\u201d, he wrote, \u201cwill not bear the broad interpretation the majority now adopts.\u201d Instead, the law\u2019s \u201cordinary meaning\u201d and its \u201cstructure\u201d, together with traditional interpretive tools, \u201call argue convincingly to the contrary\u201d.\n\nCapping his 14-page interpretive foray into the 1996 law, Justice Breyer addressed how the phrase \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d should be read. The majority\u2019s inclination to permit immigrants to be grabbed at any time in the future is wrong, he wrote, but the Ninth Circuit\u2019s immediacy standard errs, too: when a parent asks a child to \u201cmow the lawn, please, when you get home from school\u201d, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean at the precise moment the child walks in the door. (\u201cShe can do a few other things first.\u201d) A six-month limit, Justice Breyer wrote, is reasonable and squares with other detention timeframes.\n\nA long-running disagreement over how to read statutes fuels the split between the court\u2019s liberals and conservatives. Whereas the Alito majority in Preap takes a magnifying glass to the words on the page and strives to understand them without reference to anything outside the four corners of the document\u2014an approach known as \u201ctextualism\u201d\u2014the Breyer dissent takes a broader view. As he wrote in his 2010 book \u201cMaking Our Democracy Work\u201d, Justice Breyer \u201clooks for the problem that Congress enacted the statute to resolve\u201d and considers how the law was intended to resolve it. He also \u201cexamines the likely consequences of a proposed interpretation\u201d to ask whether it serves the law\u2019s purposes within America's constitutional design.\n\n\u201cI would have thought that Congress meant to adhere to [America's] values and did not intend to allow the government to apprehend persons years after their release from prison\u201d, Justice Breyer wrote. To interpret the 1996 law otherwise is to do \u201cserious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood\u201d. In an era when immigrants\u2014both legal and undocumented\u2014face mounting pressure, Nielsen v Preap will do little to reassure them. Green-card holders with criminal records\u2014no matter how distant\u2014now have fresh reason to keep looking over their shoulders."

    "text": "MILWAUKEE HAS fine breweries, a Harley Davidson museum and a history of attracting lively socialist settlers from Europe. It offers views over Lake Michigan. And it is just big enough, with 17,000 hotel rooms, to host hefty conferences. But none of that explains why the city beat Miami and Houston, bigger rivals, to host the Democratic convention in July 2020. When party delegates gather to pick a candidate to run against Donald Trump for the presidency in Milwaukee they will be signalling a renewed focus on the Midwest. Milwaukee will be the first Midwestern city to host a Democratic convention since Chicago in 1996. After Hillary Clinton\u2019s neglect of the region in 2016, the party wants to make amends. \u201cWe are ready to set an example, proving Democrats can be strong where many counted us out\u201d says Mandela Barnes, a Milwaukee native and the lieutenant-governor in Wisconsin.\n\nHad Miami or Houston been picked that might have suggested a Democratic plan to win over new voters in the South in 2020. But Mr Trump won because he scooped the electoral-college votes of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, states where Mrs Clinton considered her support rock-solid and barely bothered to campaign. Mr Trump won by a whisker\u201423,000 votes\u2014in Wisconsin, the first Republican to take the state since Reagan in 1984. He wasn\u2019t popular\u2014Mitt Romney got more votes than he did there four years earlier\u2014but he was more popular than Mrs Clinton. She did poorly in Milwaukee, a Democratic stronghold with a large African-American population. Blue-collar workers, including many blacks, who lost factory jobs over the years, saw Mrs Clinton not as their champion but as a supporter of the free trade they believed had weakened American manufacturing. Their low turnout was a reminder to Democrats not to assume African-Americans will automatically show up for the party.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nMrs Clinton and her team were also neglectful. She was thrashed in Wisconsin in the Democratic primary by Bernie Sanders, who won 71 out of 72 counties there. Perhaps bruised, she then left much of the on-the-ground campaigning in the general election to him. Dan Kaufman, author of \u201cThe Fall of Wisconsin\u201d, which traces the decline of Democratic clout in the state, notes that Mrs Clinton became the first presidential candidate of either party since 1972 to fail to visit Wisconsin in the general election. Compounding that mistake, she did not buy many TV ads in Wisconsin or Michigan, despite Mr Trump\u2019s furious campaigning in the region. In the final weeks of the campaign, Mrs Clinton\u2019s ad-buyers spent more in Omaha (with a single electoral college vote at stake) than in Wisconsin and Michigan combined (worth 26 votes together).\n\nDemocratic bosses want to show that the Midwest\u2014and especially Wisconsin\u2014won\u2019t be forgotten in that way again. Philip Rocco, a political scientist at Marquette University, in Milwaukee, talks of the \u201cacrid tang of 2016\u201d as Democrats try \u201cto counteract their failure to truly campaign\u201d there. He expects the party will emphasise \u201chow the state\u2019s working class has failed to flourish under Republican leadership\u201d, after eight years of Scott Walker as governor (he was thrown out by voters in November) and four years of Mr Trump. He also expects much attention on Mr Trump\u2019s promises to the Midwest on trade and the revitalisation of manufacturing.\n\nA prime example of the difficulty of getting big new investments lies just a few miles south from the convention hall. Foxconn is supposed to be building an enormous assembly plant, much boasted about by Mr Trump, near Racine. The Taiwanese firm was promised enormous state subsidies if it creates 13,000 jobs in the coming years. But the project is at risk of going off the rails, as Foxconn backs off from manufacturing activities and tries instead to create a campus for high-skilled engineers, designers and IT folk. Few jobs for the local and low-skilled have been created at all.\n\nCan Democrats expect to do better in Wisconsin in 2020, assuming they pay greater attention? There are some positive signs. In November, Tony Evers, a Democrat, managed to turf out Mr Walker from the governor\u2019s mansion. A Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin, held her seat, and 53% of the votes cast for the state assembly went to Democrats (though gerrymandering meant Republicans won more seats). Much depended on urban votes. \u201cDemocrats can win with a high turnout in the urban areas, but they need the young and African-Americans to turn out in high numbers\u201d, says Barry Burden, of the University of Wisconsin, in Madison. That requires lots of enthusiasm and \u201cit just \u2013 only just \u2013 worked in 2018, it\u2019s a risky strategy\u201d he says.\n\nAn alternative and perhaps preferable approach is to return to ways of old, picking up some votes from rural areas and small towns, appealing to progressive farmers, he says. The dilemma between appealing to urban voters alone, or trying to bring in some rural votes, is a common one across the Midwest. The Democratic governor of Kansas, Laura Kelly, has a long record of appealing both to rural and urban voters, but more often Democrats rely heavily on city-dwellers\u2019 support. In Illinois, Democrats have broadened their appeal from cities alone to capture more suburban districts, but most rural areas are solidly Republican. In Minnesota, a once-safe Democrat state, rural and small-town voters are fervently Republican.\n\nThe strategy Democrats adopt in the Midwest will largely depend on which candidate dominates at the convention in Milwaukee. Mr Sanders is considered to have a big advantage in Wisconsin. He can also draw on well-established local activist groups to serve as his campaign infrastructure. Joe Biden, who has not yet announced, could also do well among traditional Democratic supporters, notably in places, like southern Wisconsin, long dominated by manufacturing.\n\nOnly two true Midwesterners are in the running so far and could plausibly talk of Milwaukee as being near to home. Amy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, has shown she can pick up votes from rural areas. She has already been campaigning in Wisconsin. But as a centrist, with no obvious appeal yet to African-Americans or blue-collar voters, she might struggle. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, in Indiana, is young and articulate. But he remains the longest of long shots for now.\n\nIf others such as Cory Booker, Kamala Harris or (assuming he will run) Beto O\u2019Rourke do better in the primary race, then a Democratic focus on the Midwest might prove less appealing. Mr Rocco, of Marquette, notes that Democrats could risk \u201cfighting the last fire\u201d if they bet all on winning back blue-collar workers and the Midwest from Mr Trump. The alternative is to excite new voters\u2014in the ever-more populous southern states of Florida and Texas, or heading west to Arizona, for example\u2014by wooing Latinos, African-Americans, women and the young. The choice of Milwaukee this week suggests the Midwestern route is currently favoured. By July 2020, much could change."

    "text": "T HE KEY TO understanding Texas is the state Capitol in Austin. It is there that legislators meet only every other year to pass new laws and set the state budget. The elegant domed building is several feet taller than the Capitol in Washington, and that matters to Texans. Gun-owners with a concealed-carry licence can enter through a separate security lane and do not have to go through the indignity of a metal detector, as lowly journalists do. The Capitol is built of pinkish granite, a suitable material for a red state now facing the prospect of diluted Republican influence.\n\nAfter years of pushing to the right on social issues and immigration, Texas Republicans have shifted their tone during the current legislative session. \u201cThere\u2019s been a rush to the middle,\u201d explains Jason Sabo of Frontera Strategy, a lobbying firm. Evidence of that lies in the list of priorities presented by Greg Abbott, the recently re-elected Republican governor. His \u201cemergency\u201d items, which he wants the legislature to focus on, include financing public schools, paying teachers more, reforming the property-tax regime, funding for special education and expanding access to mental-health services.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nHow unlike the previous session of the biennial legislature, in 2017. Back then Republicans passed a hugely controversial immigration bill, giving law-enforcement officers the right to stop people and ask to see papers confirming their citizenship. Some compare this action to Proposition 187, an anti-immigration bill that passed in California in 1994 and turned Hispanics in that state against the Republican Party. Another contentious legislative item that session was a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, designed to regulate where transgender people are allowed to pee. Mr Abbott declared it a priority at the time, though ultimately it withered after opposition from businesses.\n\nRepublicans \u201chave moved over to our issue set and the things we had been talking about,\u201d says Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. Culture wars are still playing out in this legislative session, including over abortion, but they are fewer. Republicans are \u201cnot talking about divisive social issues any more,\u201d says Joe Straus, who served as Speaker of the Texas House for a decade before stepping down in January. Republicans moved to the right to win primaries against other Republicans, but now they face more challenging general elections. Today \u201cthere\u2019s more fear of the November voter than there is of the primary voter. But there\u2019s fear of both,\u201d says Mr Straus.\n\nThere are several reasons for the Republicans\u2019 change of tone and approach, but the 2016 and 2018 elections are central to it. In 2016 Hillary Clinton lost Texas by the smallest margin of any Democrat since 1996. In 2018, when Democrats picked up 12 House seats and two state Senate seats, many right-wing Republicans lost what were thought to be safe districts or won by slimmer margins than expected. This had more than a little to do with Beto O\u2019Rourke, who was challenging Republican Ted Cruz for the US Senate. Although he lost, Mr O\u2019Rourke helped get many down-ballot Democratic state legislators and judges elected.\n\nDonald Trump has also cast a shadow over state Republicans. \u201cThe worst thing that ever happened to Texas Republicans was the election of Donald Trump,\u201d says Mark Jones of Rice University in Houston. Mr Trump has alienated many white Republican women in Texas, and has also pushed away Hispanics, who account for around 40% of the state\u2019s population. Long after Mr Trump leaves office, demographic change in Texas will continue to exert an influence on the fortunes of Republicans, as the Hispanic population grows, millennials vote in increasing numbers and people continue to move to Texas from other states, bringing their more liberal politics with them. According to a recent poll by the University of Texas and Texas Tribune, more Texans say they would sooner vote for a candidate running against Mr Trump than re-elect the president.\n\nShowing voters that they can bring about change on bread-and-butter issues may help Republicans fend off competition in 2020. Legislators are broadly in agreement that the state needs to do something about property taxes, which have risen considerably as Texas\u2019s economy has boomed and pushed up property values. Texas does not have a state income tax, so it relies disproportionately on property taxes to fund schools. But because the property tax is a very transparent levy, voters frequently complain about their high bills.\n\nMr Abbott has suggested capping the rate by which local governments can raise taxes at 2.5% without a special vote (today, that threshold is 8%); this is probably just a starting point for negotiation. But how the state will manage to reduce property-tax growth rates while doing more to fund public schools equitably and boost their performance\u2014another legislative priority\u2014is unclear. Restricting the ability of local districts to raise revenue when they have so few other sources available to them could damage the state\u2019s educational prospects in the long run.\n\nThe property-tax issue points to a broader theme in Texas politics: the clash between state and local control. In theory, Republicans tend to be in favour of light-touch regulation and leaving governance and policymaking to local authorities. But as cities have turned into Democratic bastions and forged their own liberal visions for the future, Republicans have changed their stance. For example, last year Austin and San Antonio passed ordinances that require employers to offer paid sick leave. But a bill making its way through the state Senate would hamstring cities\u2019 ability to set such policies.\n\nMuch is at stake. If Republicans lose the state House, Democrats will have a stronger influence on the redistricting process. (A Democrat-controlled House would presumably not agree with a Republican-controlled Senate plan.) In another twist, next year\u2019s election will be the first when \u201cstraight ticket\u201d voting (ie, ticking a single box to vote for every candidate from that party on a ballot) is eliminated, thanks to efforts by Republicans in the previous legislative session. Candidates will have to compete more on their own merits rather than rely on party loyalty. This could contribute, sometime between 2020 and 2026, to the end of the Republicans\u2019 20-year dominance of all statewide offices, according to Mr Jones of Rice University."

    "text": "AT A Supreme Court oral argument on March 18th, justices sparred with four lawyers over whether the electoral map for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s bar on racial discrimination. The hearing in Virginia House of Delegates v Bethune-Hill was bracing but, given its context and timing, rather belated. The map under scrutiny was drafted in 2011, following the 2010 census. Challengers filed suit in 2014 against 12 majority-black districts which, they say, were drawn with too much of an emphasis on race. The Supreme Court first addressed the matter in 2017, when it blessed one of the districts and sent the other 11 back to the district court for another look. On reconsideration, and with the replacement of one of the three original judges, the lower court declared all 11 districts unconstitutional. Now the justices will have the final say.\n\nIf the map is found to violate the constitution\u2019s promise of equal protection of the laws, well, most of the damage has been done. While Bethune-Hill was wending its way through the federal judiciary, Virginia used the map for elections in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017. With another census coming up in 2020 and a new round of redistricting to follow, the only question is whether the map will have one more go in 2019 before it expires on its own. But such a last hurrah may hold big consequences. Virginia Republicans are clinging to a 51-49 edge in the statehouse; the 2011 map could help them keep it. Meanwhile, a scholar\u2019s alternative map\u2014drawn in late 2018 at the lower-court\u2019s request to fix the infirmities of the 2011 version\u2014could push Democrats over the threshold in this autumn\u2019s election, handing them the chamber and, if they muster a Senate majority too, the cartographer\u2019s pen to redistrict for the coming decade.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThese political considerations remained largely in the background during the Bethune-Hill hearing. Upstaging them were two thorny legal questions. The more esoteric\u2014but possibly determinative\u2014matter asks who is authorised to speak for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Early in the litigation, Virginia\u2019s attorney-general permitted the House of Delegates to respond to the constituents\u2019 gerrymandering complaints. The tables turned when Ralph Northum, a Democratic governor, took the helm in 2018. Rising to challenge the House\u2019s standing\u2014or eligibility\u2014to appeal was Toby Heytens, Virginia\u2019s new solicitor-general. \u201cVirginia law has been clear since before the Civil War that the state's attorney-general has the exclusive authority\u201d to decide how litigation should proceed. It shouldn\u2019t be the Supreme Court\u2019s job, he said, to \u201creferee\u201d a tussle \u201cwithin the Virginia state government\u201d.\n\nPaul Clement, a veteran Supreme Court litigator who argued for the House of Delegates, called this position \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d with \u201cenormous consequences\u201d for all-too-common situations when a state government\u2019s legislative and executive branches are at loggerheads. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg responded that the House of Delegates \u201cisn't even the legislative branch; it's one house of the legislature\u201d. Justice Sotomayor agreed. The 2011 map \u201cdoesn't belong to the House\u201d, she said. \u201cAt best, it belongs to the legislature as a whole\u201d or to \u201cthe people of Virginia\u201d. But Mr Clement\u2019s contention found some support from Justice Stephen Breyer, who worried that finding the House lacked standing would mean \u201cnobody's going to be able to attack\u201d a court decision adverse to a state law. All this led Justice Samuel Alito to suggest asking the Virginia Supreme Court to clarify who, exactly, speaks for the Commonwealth.\n\nThe hearing did not get much clearer when it turned to the heart of the issue: whether the 2011 map violated the constitution. Virginia says it aimed at a black voting population in each of the 11 districts of at least 55% to satisfy the terms of the Voting Rights Act, a 1965 law that protects minorities\u2019 right to elect \u201ccandidates of choice\u201d. But the maps\u2019 challengers said the 55% target was, in effect, too much of a good thing that diluted black voters\u2019 influence in neighbouring districts. Areas with a bevy of white liberals, for example, ensure minorities\u2019 ability to elect their preferred candidates with far less than a 55% share of black voters. But the House did not undertake district-by-district analysis to take account this so-called \u201ccrossover vote\u201d or other factors, Mr Heytens said. According to Marc Elias, another lawyer arguing against the map, Virginia used a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d racial metric for all 12 districts akin to a loose-fitting suit rather than (as previous Supreme Court rulings have required) a narrowly tailored outfit carefully fitted to the facts on the ground.\n\nFor Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mr Elias\u2019s position denies states the \u201cflexibility\u201d they need to abide by the terms of the Voting Rights Act while also avoiding a constitutional violation. If Virginia had aimed to create districts that were just \u201c52% or 53%\u201d African-American, Justice Kavanaugh said, it \u201cwould be hammered from the other side\u201d. Mr Elias\u2019s response was sensible if subtle: the key isn\u2019t the percentage itself but the method by which the state arrives at it. If the House of Delegates had done \u201ceven a modicum of district-by-district analysis, this would be a very different case\u201d. But a \u201cblanket rule\u201d with any particular racial target, Mr Elias, is constitutionally out of bounds.\n\nThis exchange demonstrated another sense in which Bethune-Hill is a relic. In its 2013 Shelby County v Holder ruling, the Supreme Court struck down the section of the Voting Rights Act that Virginia says compelled it to use the target of 55% black voters. So when the next round of redistricting comes early in the coming decade, states with chequered histories of racial discrimination will no longer be required to get their maps approved by the Department of Justice. It is unclear what that new lenience will mean for minority voters. But one thing is certain: states will not be able to justify racial gerrymandering by purporting to comply with the old rule."

    "text": "NEAR the end of his bewildering ordeal in Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial\u201d, Josef K. gets some advice from one Titorelli, the court artist. So-called \"actual acquittals\" are the stuff of legend, Titorelli tells K. More realistic options are \u201cprotraction\u201d (keeping one\u2019s case simmering forever) or \u201capparent acquittal\u201d\u2014release with a looming possibility of re-arrest and re-trial at an unspecified future point. The follow-up brush with the law could happen years later, as soon as the poor soul arrives home or any time in between. The court \u201cforgets nothing\u201d. Whenever the authorities renew their charges against the released defendant, Kafka writes, \u201chis life as a free man is at an end.\"\n\nAmerican law imitated Kafka\u2019s fiction on March 19th when a 5-4 Supreme Court majority ruled that many immigrants who had been held in criminal custody are subject to mandatory detention by Immigration and Control Enforcement (ICE) at any time after their release. Eduardo Vega Padilla, one of the litigants in Nielsen v Preap, came to America in the 1960s as an infant and soon became a lawful permanent resident. In the late 1990s, he was twice convicted for possessing drugs and, in 2002, for illegally owning a firearm as a prior felon. In 2013, 11 years after finishing his six-month sentence for the gun conviction\u2014now a father of five and grandfather of six American citizens\u2014Mr Padilla answered a knock at his door and was taken into custody by immigration officials. He found himself on the cusp of being deported to Mexico, a country he left when he was 16 months old.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe question the justices tackled in Preap was how to interpret a 1996 law\u2014the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act\u2014requiring the detention of immigrants \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d following offences ranging from serious felonies to drug possession or \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d misdemeanours like jumping a turnstile or illegally downloading music. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2016 that green-card holders may not be nabbed and held indefinitely without a bail hearing long after being released from criminal custody. The law, the appeals court said, permitted ICE to swoop in only at the time of the immigrant\u2019s release. If authorities wanted to detain an alien at a later time, they\u2019d have to give him a hearing where he could try to prove he neither posed a danger to the community nor was a flight risk.\n\nFor Justice Samuel Alito, author of the majority opinion, that reading is \u201chard to swallow\u201d. Requiring that the \u201calien must be arrested on the day he walks out of jail\u201d\u2014whether at the prison door or in the parking lot\u2014unreasonably constrains ICE authority. With a granular analysis of the law's disputed adverbial clause (\u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d) and its relationship to \u201ca series of adjectival clauses\u201d, Justice Alito reversed the Ninth Circuit on grammatical grounds, throwing in a number of rhetorical digs. The law would amount to \u201cnonsense\u201d if it were understood to favour Mr Padilla and his fellow plaintiffs. It would be \u201cridiculous\u201d to see the law as distinguishing between different classes of criminal aliens. Mandatory detention would be \u201cdownright incoherent\u201d if it did not require the detention of every alien who has committed an offence listed in the law, at any time. In sum, the Secretary of Homeland Security \u201cmust arrest those aliens guilty of a predicate offence\u201d. What of the immigrants\u2019 claims that their \u201cstrong ties to the country\u201d make a difference and raise \u201cconstitutional doubts\u201d about being rounded up years after release from custody? That\u2019s all quite irrelevant, Justice Alito responded. The law, as written, is clear.\n\nIf the majority opinion was penned with a schoolmarm\u2019s icy attention to adverbial phrases, the dissent was crafted with a professor\u2019s horizon-scanning view of the immigrant experience and the limits of government power. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that Preap concerns \u201cbasic American legal values\u201d. It has \u201cconsequences\u201d for green-card holders who have \u201cestablished families and put down roots in a community\u201d. The ruling threatens to deprive people of their liberty without \u201cdue process of law\u201d\u2014in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2014and to strip them of \u201cthe longstanding right of virtually all persons to receive a bail hearing\u201d when held in custody. Yet Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent does not cede exegesis to the majority. \u201cThe language of the statute\u201d, he wrote, \u201cwill not bear the broad interpretation the majority now adopts.\u201d Instead, the law\u2019s \u201cordinary meaning\u201d and its \u201cstructure\u201d, together with traditional interpretive tools, \u201call argue convincingly to the contrary\u201d.\n\nCapping his 14-page interpretive foray into the 1996 law, Justice Breyer addressed how the phrase \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d should be read. The majority\u2019s inclination to permit immigrants to be grabbed at any time in the future is wrong, he wrote, but the Ninth Circuit\u2019s immediacy standard errs, too: when a parent asks a child to \u201cmow the lawn, please, when you get home from school\u201d, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean at the precise moment the child walks in the door. (\u201cShe can do a few other things first.\u201d) A six-month limit, Justice Breyer wrote, is reasonable and squares with other detention timeframes.\n\nA long-running disagreement over how to read statutes fuels the split between the court\u2019s liberals and conservatives. Whereas the Alito majority in Preap takes a magnifying glass to the words on the page and strives to understand them without reference to anything outside the four corners of the document\u2014an approach known as \u201ctextualism\u201d\u2014the Breyer dissent takes a broader view. As he wrote in his 2010 book \u201cMaking Our Democracy Work\u201d, Justice Breyer \u201clooks for the problem that Congress enacted the statute to resolve\u201d and considers how the law was intended to resolve it. He also \u201cexamines the likely consequences of a proposed interpretation\u201d to ask whether it serves the law\u2019s purposes within America's constitutional design.\n\n\u201cI would have thought that Congress meant to adhere to [America's] values and did not intend to allow the government to apprehend persons years after their release from prison\u201d, Justice Breyer wrote. To interpret the 1996 law otherwise is to do \u201cserious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood\u201d. In an era when immigrants\u2014both legal and undocumented\u2014face mounting pressure, Nielsen v Preap will do little to reassure them. Green-card holders with criminal records\u2014no matter how distant\u2014now have fresh reason to keep looking over their shoulders."

    "text": "\u201cT HERE IS NO such thing as a base voter,\u201d says Stacey Abrams, who last year came closer than any Democrat this century to becoming Georgia\u2019s governor. Ms Abrams embraced identity politics\u2014she contributed an article to the current issue of Foreign Affairs entitled \u201cIdentity politics strengthens democracy\u201d\u2014and made registration and mobilisation of young and non-white voters central to her campaign. \u201cTo win we had to activate voters [in] communities that had been discounted because they were seen as not viable. Republicans didn\u2019t worry about them because they could never win. And Democrats didn\u2019t engage because they didn\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nIn purely strategic terms, it is not obvious that Democrats need make a special effort to court black voters. The last Republican to win a majority of their votes was Herbert Hoover, in 1932. No American ethnic group is as reliably and deeply partisan. Since 1964\u2014when Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who voted against that year\u2019s Civil Rights Act\u2014no Democratic presidential candidate has captured less than 80% of the black vote.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThis loyalty leaves many African-Americans feeling taken for granted, as though Democrats have not so much courted their votes as assumed they will show up. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the past,\u201d explains DeJuana Thompson, whose group Woke Vote helped propel Doug Jones to victory in Alabama\u2019s Senate race in 2017, is \u201ccandidates who show up in black churches two weeks before\u201d election day, expecting parishioners to \u201ctrust, vote, and get out and work for their campaigns for free.\u201d\n\nThings are different as the Democratic Party\u2019s marathon primary gets under way. Not only are two African-American senators, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, among the top tier of Democratic candidates. Both they and their rivals have discussed racism and racial inequities openly, in ways that previous Democratic candidates have shied away from. The Democrats\u2019 directness about race reflects both shifting priorities within their coalition and a tactical bet on how to best mobilise and expand their base.\n\nAs recently as the primaries of 2008, when Barack Obama was picking up delegates thanks to his strength with African-Americans and white progressives, Hillary Clinton was appealing to \u201chard-working Americans, white Americans\u201d. Such rhetoric would be immediately disqualifying for a Democrat today. As whites without a college degree have left the party, the Democratic coalition of well-educated whites with members of ethnic minorities has grown more unified around questions of racism. In 2009 just 28% of Democrats agreed with the statement \u201cRacial discrimination is the main reason why black people can\u2019t get ahead these days\u201d; by the summer of 2017, that share had risen to 64% (see chart).\n\nRhetoric from the party\u2019s candidates reflects that consensus. Elizabeth Warren mentioned racial wealth gaps in the first minute of her campaign announcement. Soon after Kirsten Gillibrand announced, she acknowledged \u201csystemic, institutional and daily individual acts of racism\u201d, and decried racial income gaps, as did Ms Harris in her announcement speech, along with the state of criminal justice and police killings of young black men. Cory Booker backs \u201cbaby bonds\u201d\u2014a plan to give each child $1,000 at birth, followed by annual payments, tailored to family wealth, until the child turns 18\u2014as a way to narrow the racial wealth gap. Ms Harris, Ms Warren and Juli\u00e1n Castro, a former mayor and cabinet secretary also seeking the nomination, have all endorsed some form of reparations for slavery, but have all stopped short of calling for direct financial transfers.\n\nSome might consider these positions pandering. But as Leah Wright-Rigueur, a Harvard professor who wrote \u201cThe Loneliness of the Black Republican\u201d notes, voters might ask, \u201cDo I really care that they\u2019re pandering? Maybe I want to be pandered to. Republicans pander to their base all the time.\u201d\n\nThe tactical bet, that lots of people who have not voted before can be led to the polls, is one that Ms Abrams and Andrew Gillum made in their governors\u2019 races, in Georgia and Florida respectively. According to this theory, the limited time and energy of a campaign is better spent mining untapped black voters than trying to win back wavering white ones. Some fear this strategy may turn off white voters, who still comprise a majority of the electorate. After all, both Ms Abrams and Mr Gillum lost\u2014the latter in a swing state, in a year that was otherwise favourable to Democrats.\n\nThat suggests the bet may be mistaken. It may also be a category error. When it comes to issues, black Democrats are not very different from Democrats of other hues. Criminal-justice reform, investing in public education and expanding access to health care all have particular appeal to black voters, who bear the brunt of mass incarceration and poor schools. They also appeal to Democratic voters of all stripes. Ultimately, says Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a state representative from South Carolina, black Democrats are looking for the same thing as every other Democrat. \u201cIn the past it\u2019s been kind of like a beauty contest: who\u2019s speaking to your heart. But what I\u2019m picking up now is a real sense of, \u2018I want a winner\u2019. And the winner is going to be the candidate who can beat 45.\u201d\n\nThat candidate need not be black to win black votes. But he or she will need to court their support more vigorously than in past cycles. That is not only an acknowledgment of past oversight. Ms Abrams argues it will, be \u201ccost-efficient. These communities are already tilted toward the value system and policies of Democrats. The mission isn\u2019t to get someone to change their ideology. The mission is to get them to act on their beliefs.\u201d"

    "title": "Private jets receive ludicrous tax breaks that hurt the environment",
    "authors": [

    "text": "T HE BLUE jeans and T -shirts of the global elite are no more comfortable than those worn by the middle class. They drink the same coffee, watch the same films and carry the same smartphones. But a gulf yawns between the rich and the rest when they fly. Ordinary folk squeeze agonisingly and sleeplessly into cheap seats. The elite stretch out flat and slumber. And the truly wealthy avoid the hassles and indignities of crowded airports entirely, by taking private jets. This would be no one else\u2019s business but for two things. First, private jets are horribly polluting. Second, they are often\u2014and outrageously\u2014subsidised.\n\nPrivate aviation was hit hard by the global financial crisis, when both companies and individuals sought to pare expenses. But now private jets are booming again. This is partly because new booking services and shared-ownership schemes are cutting the cost of going private and luring busy executives away from first- and business-class seats on scheduled flights (see article). But the boom is also a result of tax breaks, which are even more generous than those lavished on ordinary airlines. In Europe firms and individuals can avoid paying value-added tax on imported private jets by routing purchases through the Isle of Man. This scheme has cut tax bills by \u00a3790m ($1bn) for imports of at least 200 aircraft into the European Union since 2011. America\u2019s rules are loopier still. Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform allowed individuals and companies to write off 100% of the cost of a new or used private jet against their federal taxes. For some plutocrats this has wiped out an entire year\u2019s tax bill. For others, it has made buying a jet extraordinarily cheap.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe case for flying on a private jet is that it can save time for someone, such as a chief executive, whose time is extraordinarily valuable. Hence companies can offset the cost of these flights against their corporate-tax bills. In some countries the use of a private jet is a tax-free perk for executives. But a growing volume of research suggests that flying the boss privately is often a waste of money for shareholders. One analysis, by ICF , a consultancy, found that the jets are often used to fly to places where corporate titans are more likely to have holiday homes than business meetings, such as fancy ski resorts. A study by David Yermack of NYU Stern School of Business found that returns to investors in firms that allow such flights are 4% lower per year than in other companies. Users of such planes are also more likely to commit fraud: a careless attitude to other people\u2019s money sometimes shades into outright criminality, it seems.\n\nThe environmental effects of corporate jets are dire. A flight from London to Paris on a half-full jet produces ten times as much in carbon emissions per passenger as a scheduled flight, according to Terrapass, a carbon-offset firm. New supersonic business jets under development will make that a lot worse. On one estimate, their emissions will be five to seven times higher than for today\u2019s models. Amazingly, these emissions are largely unregulated. Aviation is not covered by the Paris agreement to limit climate change, and most private jets are excluded from CORSIA , a carbon-offsetting scheme involving most airlines. All in all, private planes could produce 4% of American emissions by 2050 compared with 0.9% today.\n\nAll air travel is bad for the environment. Business class is worse than economy class, because it burns more jet fuel per passenger. Private jets are more damaging by an order of magnitude. The tax breaks for cooking the planet in this way cannot be justified. They should all be scrapped. Carbon emissions should be taxed, not subsidised by the sleepless masses in steerage and the even less fortunate souls who never fly."

    "text": "AT A Supreme Court oral argument on March 18th, justices sparred with four lawyers over whether the electoral map for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s bar on racial discrimination. The hearing in Virginia House of Delegates v Bethune-Hill was bracing but, given its context and timing, rather belated. The map under scrutiny was drafted in 2011, following the 2010 census. Challengers filed suit in 2014 against 12 majority-black districts which, they say, were drawn with too much of an emphasis on race. The Supreme Court first addressed the matter in 2017, when it blessed one of the districts and sent the other 11 back to the district court for another look. On reconsideration, and with the replacement of one of the three original judges, the lower court declared all 11 districts unconstitutional. Now the justices will have the final say.\n\nIf the map is found to violate the constitution\u2019s promise of equal protection of the laws, well, most of the damage has been done. While Bethune-Hill was wending its way through the federal judiciary, Virginia used the map for elections in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017. With another census coming up in 2020 and a new round of redistricting to follow, the only question is whether the map will have one more go in 2019 before it expires on its own. But such a last hurrah may hold big consequences. Virginia Republicans are clinging to a 51-49 edge in the statehouse; the 2011 map could help them keep it. Meanwhile, a scholar\u2019s alternative map\u2014drawn in late 2018 at the lower-court\u2019s request to fix the infirmities of the 2011 version\u2014could push Democrats over the threshold in this autumn\u2019s election, handing them the chamber and, if they muster a Senate majority too, the cartographer\u2019s pen to redistrict for the coming decade.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThese political considerations remained largely in the background during the Bethune-Hill hearing. Upstaging them were two thorny legal questions. The more esoteric\u2014but possibly determinative\u2014matter asks who is authorised to speak for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Early in the litigation, Virginia\u2019s attorney-general permitted the House of Delegates to respond to the constituents\u2019 gerrymandering complaints. The tables turned when Ralph Northum, a Democratic governor, took the helm in 2018. Rising to challenge the House\u2019s standing\u2014or eligibility\u2014to appeal was Toby Heytens, Virginia\u2019s new solicitor-general. \u201cVirginia law has been clear since before the Civil War that the state's attorney-general has the exclusive authority\u201d to decide how litigation should proceed. It shouldn\u2019t be the Supreme Court\u2019s job, he said, to \u201creferee\u201d a tussle \u201cwithin the Virginia state government\u201d.\n\nPaul Clement, a veteran Supreme Court litigator who argued for the House of Delegates, called this position \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d with \u201cenormous consequences\u201d for all-too-common situations when a state government\u2019s legislative and executive branches are at loggerheads. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg responded that the House of Delegates \u201cisn't even the legislative branch; it's one house of the legislature\u201d. Justice Sotomayor agreed. The 2011 map \u201cdoesn't belong to the House\u201d, she said. \u201cAt best, it belongs to the legislature as a whole\u201d or to \u201cthe people of Virginia\u201d. But Mr Clement\u2019s contention found some support from Justice Stephen Breyer, who worried that finding the House lacked standing would mean \u201cnobody's going to be able to attack\u201d a court decision adverse to a state law. All this led Justice Samuel Alito to suggest asking the Virginia Supreme Court to clarify who, exactly, speaks for the Commonwealth.\n\nThe hearing did not get much clearer when it turned to the heart of the issue: whether the 2011 map violated the constitution. Virginia says it aimed at a black voting population in each of the 11 districts of at least 55% to satisfy the terms of the Voting Rights Act, a 1965 law that protects minorities\u2019 right to elect \u201ccandidates of choice\u201d. But the maps\u2019 challengers said the 55% target was, in effect, too much of a good thing that diluted black voters\u2019 influence in neighbouring districts. Areas with a bevy of white liberals, for example, ensure minorities\u2019 ability to elect their preferred candidates with far less than a 55% share of black voters. But the House did not undertake district-by-district analysis to take account this so-called \u201ccrossover vote\u201d or other factors, Mr Heytens said. According to Marc Elias, another lawyer arguing against the map, Virginia used a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d racial metric for all 12 districts akin to a loose-fitting suit rather than (as previous Supreme Court rulings have required) a narrowly tailored outfit carefully fitted to the facts on the ground.\n\nFor Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mr Elias\u2019s position denies states the \u201cflexibility\u201d they need to abide by the terms of the Voting Rights Act while also avoiding a constitutional violation. If Virginia had aimed to create districts that were just \u201c52% or 53%\u201d African-American, Justice Kavanaugh said, it \u201cwould be hammered from the other side\u201d. Mr Elias\u2019s response was sensible if subtle: the key isn\u2019t the percentage itself but the method by which the state arrives at it. If the House of Delegates had done \u201ceven a modicum of district-by-district analysis, this would be a very different case\u201d. But a \u201cblanket rule\u201d with any particular racial target, Mr Elias, is constitutionally out of bounds.\n\nThis exchange demonstrated another sense in which Bethune-Hill is a relic. In its 2013 Shelby County v Holder ruling, the Supreme Court struck down the section of the Voting Rights Act that Virginia says compelled it to use the target of 55% black voters. So when the next round of redistricting comes early in the coming decade, states with chequered histories of racial discrimination will no longer be required to get their maps approved by the Department of Justice. It is unclear what that new lenience will mean for minority voters. But one thing is certain: states will not be able to justify racial gerrymandering by purporting to comply with the old rule."

The survey, which compares prices across 160 products and services, finds that living costs in all three cities are 7% higher than in New York, the benchmark city. Two Swiss cities, Zurich and Geneva, and Osaka in Japan also have higher prices than New York; Copenhagen and Seoul cost the same as the Big Apple.\n\nStrong economic growth in the United States in 2018 led to a sharp appreciation of the dollar and a rise up the rankings for 14 of the 16 American cities for which prices are collected. The highest climbers were San Francisco (up 12 places to 25th) and Houston (up to 30th from 41st); New York itself moved up six spots to seventh and Los Angeles rose by four places to tenth.

    "text": "WHEN 15,000 female garment workers went on strike in New York City more than a century ago, their goal was to secure higher wages, shorter hours and better working conditions. Women today are still pursuing those aims. Although working conditions have improved significantly since the protest in 1908, which led to the creation of International Women\u2019s Day (now celebrated on March 8th), the median pay gap for full-time working women is still around 14%. And figures from The Economist\u2019s latest glass-ceiling index, which measures where women have the best chance of equal treatment at work, show that, after decades of improvement, progress for women in the workplace has stalled in recent years.\n\nMany of the measures associated with equal treatment at work, including pay, seniority and the decision to enter the workforce at all, remain relatively stable. Our index is based on performance across ten indicators including educational attainment, labour-market attachment, pay and representation in senior jobs. In the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, the gender pay gap, which measures the difference between what a typical woman and man earn, remains largely unchanged from last year at around 14%. The share of women on company boards, at 23%, has slightly increased, but the proportion of women in management has barely budged. Although the share of women in the labour force has crept up a little, to 64%, it is still 16 percentage points below the male average.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nWith few changes in the underlying data, it is little wonder that the countries doing best in this year\u2019s glass-ceiling index are mostly the same ones that received top marks in previous years. The Nordics are particularly good at getting women to complete university (around half earn a degree) and secure a job (some 75% are in the labour force). They also have a large share of women in senior positions; in Sweden and Norway the figure is around 40%. Mandatory quotas for women on boards have helped boost female representation. The Nordics also offer better parental-leave systems. Flexible schedules help parents who want to juggle work and child care. More than half the employees in those countries have at least some control over their working hours.\n\nThe OECD countries with the worst environment for working women tend to be in Asia. In South Korea, which ranks last in our index, the pay gap is a whopping 35%. The female labour-force participation rate there is just 59%, compared with 79% for men. Moon Jae-in, South Korea\u2019s president, would like women to hold 10% of senior government positions and make up 20% of public-company executives and 40% of government committees by 2022. But there is a long way to go. Boards of directors at publicly traded South Korean firms are 98% male; out of 109 companies, only one has a female boss. Just over one in ten managerial positions in the country are held by women. While paternity leave is generous, uptake is still low.\n\nThings are little better in Japan, which ranks second-to-last in our index. Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, has tried to promote more women in the workforce to address labour shortages. On this narrow measure, he has succeeded: their number has gone up by 2m since 2015. But most of this work is part-time and poorly paid. The wage gap in Japan is still a hefty 25%. And despite Mr Abe\u2019s support for \u201cwomenomics\u201d, last October he appointed just one woman to his new cabinet. (In his defence, Mr Abe said she has the \u201cpresence of two or three women\u201d.)\n\nCultural and societal norms appear to be a decisive influence on gender equality at work. In Asia, many women are expected to choose between having a family and a career. Moreover, the division of labour at home is often woefully unbalanced. In Japan and South Korea, for example, women do roughly five times more housework, food shopping and other unpaid activities than men do. Women who want to climb the career ladder often struggle to secure spots at top firms. Men are typically favoured for promotions.\n\nStill, there have been some bright spots, particularly in the governments of western democracies. Last June Spain\u2019s prime minister appointed the first female-majority cabinet since the country returned to democracy in 1975. Last November more women than ever were elected to office in America\u2019s mid-term congressional elections. And despite threats to their leadership, Angela Merkel and Theresa May still hold the top political positions in their respective countries. Having women in positions of power should improve the chances of public policies that promote equality in the workplace."

    "text": "T HE GIRL looks like a typical teenager sitting on the bench of a fire station in Manchester, New Hampshire. But she is not. Just 19 years old, with acne still marking her face, she is here seeking help for opioid addiction. Already she has been hooked for four years. At 15 she started with Percocet, a prescription drug. Now homeless, these days she uses fentanyl, a cheap, synthetic opioid. After checking herself out of treatment two weeks ago, she went on a meth- and fentanyl-fuelled bender.\n\nSoon a taxi arrives. It will deposit her at Granite Pathways, the treatment centre she left two weeks ago. She gathers up her few possessions, which are neatly lined up on the concrete floor. The firefighters wish her well as she climbs into the taxi, encouraging her to stick with her recovery this time. She promises to try but, once she has gone, they do not sound hopeful. They have seen this story too many times before.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nSuch episodes occur regularly now across Manchester. The city has set up a programme, known as Safe Stations, whereby anyone struggling with drug addiction can walk into a fire station seeking help. About 200 people come every month. \u201cPeople trust firemen,\u201d says Daniel Goonan, the station\u2019s chief. \u201cWe don\u2019t ask for insurance or anything\u2014there\u2019s no stigma.\u201d It is an innovative strategy for dealing with the American opioid epidemic in one of its centres. In 2017 New Hampshire had the third-highest opioid death rate in America, after Ohio and West Virginia. Shelters are full so those who are homeless and addicted wander the streets in the freezing cold. At a local hospital, 5.5% of newborn babies delivered have been exposed to opioids in utero. Mr Goonan vividly recalls the case of a ten-year-old boy who performed CPR on his overdosing parents and then went back to eating his breakfast cereal. It was not the first time the boy had done it.\n\nDrugs now kill about 70,000 Americans every year\u2014more than car crashes or guns (both 39,000), more than AIDS did at the height of its epidemic (42,000), and more than all the American soldiers killed in the entire Vietnam war (58,000). In 2017 about 47,600 of those deaths were caused by opioid overdose\u2014a fivefold increase since 2000. Only 32% of those opioid deaths involved prescription pills; the rest were from illegal heroin and fentanyl (see chart 1). But three out of four heroin users first became addicted to pills.\n\nChart the overdose death rate in America since 1980 and a terrifying graph emerges (see chart 2)\u2014an exponential curve increasing at a constant clip of 7.6% per year. Estimates suggest that the epidemic will rage for at least a further five to ten years, killing more than 50,000 people each year. An urgent and sensible response would be able to bend this death curve somewhat, to reduce the harm yet to come. But the response has been slow and fitful at best, even though measures that would help are well-known. What started as a problem of abused prescription drugs has been transformed by corporate greed, a failure of the health system and a lack of political will into a social disaster.\n\nOrigins of a crisis\n\nThe risks of opioid addiction have long been downplayed. Alexander Wood, who invented the hypodermic needle in 1853, touted his invention by claiming that morphine would not cause addiction if injected rather than smoked or swallowed. After needles and morphine were deployed in the American civil war, as many as 100,000 veterans were left addicted. In 1895 scientists at Bayer, a German pharmaceutical firm, began selling a strong morphine compound called diamorphine. To market it, they called it \u201cheroin\u201d from the German word meaning heroic.\n\nIn the 20th century, heroin became a controlled substance in America, associated with poor blacks in inner-city ghettos. Medicinal opioids were legal, but used for limited purposes, such as surgery and palliative care. Then in 1996 Purdue, a private pharmaceutical firm, launched OxyContin, a pill that releases oxycodone, an opioid that, like heroin, is twice as strong as morphine. Other firms developed similar drugs, available on prescription.\n\nOxyContin was aggressively marketed to doctors as a wonder drug that could safely dissipate chronic pain for 12 hours at a time with what it claimed was \u201cless than 1%\u201d risk of addiction. Yet the sales pitch was deeply misleading. In many patients the effect of the pills wore off after eight hours, leading to cravings for more. Moreover, evidence of long-term efficacy of opioids for chronic pain is limited, according to scientists for the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ).\n\nDespite the quantity of opioid pills prescribed since the 1990s, the amount of pain Americans report has not decreased. To explain drug-seeking behaviour that doctors began observing in their patients, Purdue promoted the theory of \u201cpseudoaddiction\u201d\u2014that what looked like addiction was really patients trying to avoid untreated pain. The basis of the \u201cless than 1%\u201d claim was a single-paragraph letter to a medical journal in 1980 about opioids administered in hospitals, not homes.\n\nAs opioid sales quadrupled from 1999 to 2011, deaths from overdoses rocketed. Prescribing patterns were slow to change even as addiction became difficult to overlook. The number of opioid prescriptions peaked in 2012, at 255m\u2014more than one for every American adult. States began implementing prescription-drug monitoring programmes, which detect if patients are seeking opioids from more than one doctor. Pills like OxyContin were made harder to crush, snort and inject. In 2015, even as doctors had begun reducing prescriptions, Americans were still getting four times as many opioids per head as Europeans. The CDC only released its revised guidelines to limit access to them in 2016. By then the crisis had already mutated from one of prescription pills, over which the government had some control, to one of illicit opioids\u2014first heroin and then fentanyl.\n\nJust like any epidemic, opioid addiction can be modelled. Allison Pitt, Keith Humphreys and Margaret Brandeau, a trio of public-health experts at Stanford University, estimate that on the current course, just over 500,000 people will die of overdoses from 2016 to 2025. They also modelled the effects of 11 different policy responses possible in today\u2019s political climate. Most would reduce the projected number of deaths marginally.\n\nIncreasing distribution of naloxone, a life-saving drug that reverses overdoses, would decrease deaths by 4.1%; moderately expanding medication-assisted treatment ( MAT ), which reduces craving for drugs and helps users lead a more normal life, would cause another 2.4% drop. Other responses, like tightening drug-prescribing guidelines and instituting programmes to prevent \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d, would, perversely, trigger a short-term increase in deaths by incentivising those addicted to prescription painkillers to switch to heroin or fentanyl. Even if America introduced all the policies likely to save lives, deaths over the next decade would drop by just 12.2%, the academics calculate. That would spare tens of thousands of lives. Yet, given the sluggish federal response, it is likely that today\u2019s high drug-death rates have become the new normal.\n\nSmack, stock and flow\n\nThe problem of drug addiction, whether to crack or to heroin, can be reduced to stocks and flows. As a drug gains notoriety, new users flow in. As an epidemic rages and matures, the wave of new addictions dwindles. \u201cA lot of people have real experiences\u2014a brother who got shot over drugs, or a mother who overdosed,\u201d says Mr Humphreys. \u201cThat cuts off the new flow of initiates.\u201d There is some evidence that the opioid crisis is entering this phase. The number of teenagers reporting misuse of prescription opioids has fallen by more than half in the past five years. But the stock of those already addicted remains.\n\nAccording to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( SAMHSA ), a government agency, 2.1m Americans meet the medical criteria for opioid addiction. Only 20% of them are receiving treatment. Although the official total is large, it is thought to be a severe underestimate. SAMHSA \u2019s own statistics show that 11.5m Americans misused prescription opioids in some way in 2016. Even with treatment, the condition is chronic and relapse is frequent. John Kelly of Harvard Medical School has estimated that it takes eight years, and four or five treatment attempts, for someone addicted to opioids to achieve a single year of abstention. Bit by bit, the stock atrophies. Some go into remission, others to prison. Each year, anywhere between 1% and 4% of them will die of an overdose.\n\nAnother team of modellers argues that the death curve might even continue its acceleration, whether from fentanyl or another drug as yet undiscovered. \u201cAnyone who tells me otherwise has to show me why that curve should bend now when it hasn\u2019t in the face of the war on drugs and the rise and fall of other drugs,\u201d says Donald Burke, the dean of public health at the University of Pittsburgh. As long as there is a reservoir of at least 2m people addicted to opioids, there is significant room for the crisis to spread. With prescription pills selling for about $50 each on the streets, and a hit of heroin or fentanyl selling for $5 or less, that seems highly likely.\n\nThe one silver lining is that America is treating this epidemic more as a public-health crisis than one of criminal justice. This change is unquestionably related to race. During the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when users were disproportionately black, authorities responded with punitive crackdowns. As the New Hampshire fire-station initiative shows, it is quite different for opioids, which kill whites at nearly twice the rate as blacks.\n\nThough the newfound compassion is welcome, the public-health response remains woeful. The policies that help reduce death and harm from opioids are no mystery. Organised under the umbrella term \u201charm reduction\u201d, these approaches limit the negative consequences of drugtaking without expecting that people will stop. They include expanding naloxone distribution, needle exchanges and access to MAT . No policy can reverse the opioid crisis by itself\u2014each of these chips away at the likely future death toll. Harm reduction has been shown to save lives and, by avoiding future policing, emergency and health costs, also save public money.\n\nThe approach has been successful in Europe. After France suffered a heroin epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s, the country established needle exchanges and drastically expanded access to MAT by allowing all doctors to prescribe buprenorphine, which reduces cravings. Four years later, heroin deaths had dropped by 79%. In the 1980s Switzerland had the highest AIDS incidence rates in Europe because of shared needles among heroin users. In the mid-1990s the government began a programme of heroin-assisted treatment, providing medical-grade heroin with clean needles in sterile facilities. Deaths from overdoses and AIDS declined by more than 50% in a decade.\n\nSubstituting one for the other\n\nAmerica is not Switzerland. Taxpayer-sponsored heroin therapy is unlikely any time soon. But even less controversial harm-reduction policies are being stymied by governmental inertia and a misunderstanding of the evidence.\n\nIn Kensington, a poor district of Philadelphia, drugs are sold in broad daylight. Men without coats sway in the frigid air, before crumpling against a wall. There is rubbish everywhere, blown by the wind alongside discarded orange caps from syringes. Pawn shops that will buy anything line the main street. Philadelphia has the highest opioid-overdose death rate of America\u2019s big cities.\n\nJose Benitez, the director of a needle exchange in the city, is working to set up a safe-injection site in Kensington, which he thinks would save more than 100 lives a year. It would be the first of its kind in America, but the legal issues are immense. It is a federal felony to maintain a place for illicit drug use, and the justice department has made clear it will not tolerate what the deputy attorney-general calls \u201ca taxpayer-sponsored haven to shoot up\u201d. Retorts Mr Benitez, \u201cIt\u2019s too important not to try it, because it\u2019s clear what the benefits are.\u201d\n\nEven MAT , known as the gold-standard treatment for opioid addiction, faces hurdles. Tom Price, Donald Trump\u2019s former health secretary, unhelpfully dismissed the treatment as \u201csubstituting one opioid for another\u201d. Half of drug courts, which divert users from jails and into treatments, require abstention and do not allow MAT .\n\nAccess to treatment remains shackled by excessive medical regulations as well as the high costs and chaotic structure of American health care. To prescribe buprenorphine, doctors need a special waiver which requires eight hours of training. There is no such hurdle to prescribing of opioids that cause addiction. In fact, a doctor can prescribe buprenorphine without a special waiver if the purpose is to treat pain, but not if the purpose is to treat addiction. Methadone can only be distributed through speciality clinics, and cannot be given by primary-care doctors, as it is in Britain or Canada.\n\nSometimes the only place to help is in hospital after an overdose. Giving buprenorphine in the emergency room staves off withdrawal symptoms that might lead a patient to go straight out to find a new fix. Initial studies show that it is effective in preventing relapse. But it is still not commonly used in America. \u201cAddiction should have parity,\u201d says William Goodman, chief medical officer of Catholic Medical Centre in Manchester. \u201cYou come into the emergency room with a heart attack, we\u2019ll treat you. You come in with addiction, we give you a card and tell you to call a number.\u201d\n\nBecause many opioid users are indigent, much substance-abuse treatment and behavioural therapy is paid for by Medicaid, the government health-insurance programme for the very poor. As the programme is administered by each state, the quality of care varies. Some Republican-led states have refused the Medicaid expansion out of their dislike for Obamacare, limiting access to treatment for residents. In 17 states Medicaid does not cover methadone treatment. In West Virginia, the state with the highest opioid-death rate in the country, Medicaid only began paying for it in January 2018.\n\nThis tendency\u2014of sensible drugs policy emerging in fits and starts several years after the crisis has taken off\u2014seems set to continue. But some regional leaders are fighting it. Two years ago, Chris Sununu, the governor of New Hampshire, met a woman in the rural north of the state who was struggling with addiction. She complained that all the treatment centres were more than 100 miles away from her home. \"That\u2019s the problem right there,\u201d says Mr Sununu. \u201cThe geographic barrier between where people live and where they can get treatment.\u201d The incident inspired him to draw up a \"hub-and-spoke\" network of treatment centres to minimise travel time for the state\u2019s rural residents. He wants to link the treatment network with sophisticated data analysis. It is a good idea, but it began only last month.\n\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the total social cost of the opioid crisis to the country in 2015 was as high as $504bn, or 2.8% of GDP . Prosecutors of all sorts, from states to tiny towns, are trying to establish culpability, suing large opioid manufacturers and drug distributors in an effort to recoup some of those social costs. In 2007 Purdue\u2019s parent company paid $600m in fines over charges of \u201cmisbranding\u201d.\n\nWhether a big financial settlement, like the $206bn deal reached with tobacco companies, will materialise is uncertain. The manufacturers might be able to argue that regulators were asleep at the wheel, and that doctors and the addicted patients themselves were responsible, thus avoiding a calamitous civil judgment. Even if a settlement does happen, it will be years in the future."

    "text": "AT A Supreme Court oral argument on March 18th, justices sparred with four lawyers over whether the electoral map for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s bar on racial discrimination. The hearing in Virginia House of Delegates v Bethune-Hill was bracing but, given its context and timing, rather belated. The map under scrutiny was drafted in 2011, following the 2010 census. Challengers filed suit in 2014 against 12 majority-black districts which, they say, were drawn with too much of an emphasis on race. The Supreme Court first addressed the matter in 2017, when it blessed one of the districts and sent the other 11 back to the district court for another look. On reconsideration, and with the replacement of one of the three original judges, the lower court declared all 11 districts unconstitutional. Now the justices will have the final say.\n\nIf the map is found to violate the constitution\u2019s promise of equal protection of the laws, well, most of the damage has been done. While Bethune-Hill was wending its way through the federal judiciary, Virginia used the map for elections in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017. With another census coming up in 2020 and a new round of redistricting to follow, the only question is whether the map will have one more go in 2019 before it expires on its own. But such a last hurrah may hold big consequences. Virginia Republicans are clinging to a 51-49 edge in the statehouse; the 2011 map could help them keep it. Meanwhile, a scholar\u2019s alternative map\u2014drawn in late 2018 at the lower-court\u2019s request to fix the infirmities of the 2011 version\u2014could push Democrats over the threshold in this autumn\u2019s election, handing them the chamber and, if they muster a Senate majority too, the cartographer\u2019s pen to redistrict for the coming decade.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThese political considerations remained largely in the background during the Bethune-Hill hearing. Upstaging them were two thorny legal questions. The more esoteric\u2014but possibly determinative\u2014matter asks who is authorised to speak for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Early in the litigation, Virginia\u2019s attorney-general permitted the House of Delegates to respond to the constituents\u2019 gerrymandering complaints. The tables turned when Ralph Northum, a Democratic governor, took the helm in 2018. Rising to challenge the House\u2019s standing\u2014or eligibility\u2014to appeal was Toby Heytens, Virginia\u2019s new solicitor-general. \u201cVirginia law has been clear since before the Civil War that the state's attorney-general has the exclusive authority\u201d to decide how litigation should proceed. It shouldn\u2019t be the Supreme Court\u2019s job, he said, to \u201creferee\u201d a tussle \u201cwithin the Virginia state government\u201d.\n\nPaul Clement, a veteran Supreme Court litigator who argued for the House of Delegates, called this position \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d with \u201cenormous consequences\u201d for all-too-common situations when a state government\u2019s legislative and executive branches are at loggerheads. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg responded that the House of Delegates \u201cisn't even the legislative branch; it's one house of the legislature\u201d. Justice Sotomayor agreed. The 2011 map \u201cdoesn't belong to the House\u201d, she said. \u201cAt best, it belongs to the legislature as a whole\u201d or to \u201cthe people of Virginia\u201d. But Mr Clement\u2019s contention found some support from Justice Stephen Breyer, who worried that finding the House lacked standing would mean \u201cnobody's going to be able to attack\u201d a court decision adverse to a state law. All this led Justice Samuel Alito to suggest asking the Virginia Supreme Court to clarify who, exactly, speaks for the Commonwealth.\n\nThe hearing did not get much clearer when it turned to the heart of the issue: whether the 2011 map violated the constitution. Virginia says it aimed at a black voting population in each of the 11 districts of at least 55% to satisfy the terms of the Voting Rights Act, a 1965 law that protects minorities\u2019 right to elect \u201ccandidates of choice\u201d. But the maps\u2019 challengers said the 55% target was, in effect, too much of a good thing that diluted black voters\u2019 influence in neighbouring districts. Areas with a bevy of white liberals, for example, ensure minorities\u2019 ability to elect their preferred candidates with far less than a 55% share of black voters. But the House did not undertake district-by-district analysis to take account this so-called \u201ccrossover vote\u201d or other factors, Mr Heytens said. According to Marc Elias, another lawyer arguing against the map, Virginia used a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d racial metric for all 12 districts akin to a loose-fitting suit rather than (as previous Supreme Court rulings have required) a narrowly tailored outfit carefully fitted to the facts on the ground.\n\nFor Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mr Elias\u2019s position denies states the \u201cflexibility\u201d they need to abide by the terms of the Voting Rights Act while also avoiding a constitutional violation. If Virginia had aimed to create districts that were just \u201c52% or 53%\u201d African-American, Justice Kavanaugh said, it \u201cwould be hammered from the other side\u201d. Mr Elias\u2019s response was sensible if subtle: the key isn\u2019t the percentage itself but the method by which the state arrives at it. If the House of Delegates had done \u201ceven a modicum of district-by-district analysis, this would be a very different case\u201d. But a \u201cblanket rule\u201d with any particular racial target, Mr Elias, is constitutionally out of bounds.\n\nThis exchange demonstrated another sense in which Bethune-Hill is a relic. In its 2013 Shelby County v Holder ruling, the Supreme Court struck down the section of the Voting Rights Act that Virginia says compelled it to use the target of 55% black voters. So when the next round of redistricting comes early in the coming decade, states with chequered histories of racial discrimination will no longer be required to get their maps approved by the Department of Justice. It is unclear what that new lenience will mean for minority voters. But one thing is certain: states will not be able to justify racial gerrymandering by purporting to comply with the old rule."

    "authors": [
      "The Economist"

    "text": "T HE FBI called it Operation Varsity Blues. It was an investigation centred on William Singer, an enterprising college counsellor, who earned $25m from all manner of powerful people by fraudulently securing spots for their children at highly selective universities like Stanford and Yale. Among his clients charged with crimes were Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, two well-known actresses; Gordon Caplan, the co-chairman of an international law firm; and William McGlashan, a Silicon Valley private-equity executive who champions ethical investing.\n\nTo grease the lucrative scheme, Mr Singer bribed proctors of admissions exams to fake scores and bribed athletics officials to accept wealthy children with concocted sports r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, according to court documents unveiled by federal prosecutors on March 12th. The lurid details have provoked embarrassment for universities and Schadenfreude for the public.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThere is also an entirely legal way to corrupt the elite admissions system, which for some reason generates less outrage. Mr Singer grasped this dynamic: There is a front door \u201cwhich means you get in on your own\u201d and a \u201cback door\u201d secured by multimillion-dollar donations to universities, he explained in a recorded call to a client. What Mr Singer did\u2014for 761 buyers, he claimed\u2014is create a \u201cside door\u201d by bribing university officials and faking test scores that would achieve the same result at one-tenth of the cost. In effect, his scheme granted mere multimillionaires access to the billionaires\u2019 entrance.\n\nGetting in through the side door was a sordid undertaking. According to prosecutors, Mr Singer bribed Rudy Meredith, then a women\u2019s soccer coach at Yale, to accept a student who did not play competitive soccer. The relatives paid $1.2m for the slot. Ms Laughlin, one of the actresses, and her husband paid $500,000 to get their daughters, both Instagram influencers and minor celebrities in their own right, designated as crew-team recruits for the University of Southern California\u2014despite the fact that neither one rowed. Mr Caplan, the international lawyer, allegedly faked a learning-disability diagnosis for his daughter and paid $75,000 for a boosted admissions score. The prosecutors, who flipped Mr Singer, enumerate several other jaw-dropping tales, backed up with wiretaps of the various notables admitting the finer details of the schemes.\n\nRich children are already unfairly advantaged in the game of elite university admissions. They start out with stabler families, better schools and helpful networks. Elite American colleges then operate a large, entirely legal affirmative-action programme for the rich. Most highly selective American universities indulge in \u201clegacy preferences\u201d\u2014positive discrimination for relatives of alumni\u2014that disproportionately benefit the already rich. Such universities also have lax standards for recruited athletes, which helps rich children. Opportunities to row, fence or play golf do not abound in the ghetto.\n\nFunding a new building just as a mediocre child applies to college, in the hope of boosting their admission chances, remains perfectly legal so long as there is no established quid pro quo. The strategy seems common and successful. Emails recently revealed by a lawsuit show one Harvard dean \u201csimply thrilled\u201d about admissions decisions because one unnamed person had \u201calready committed to building and building\u201d and two others \u201ccommitted major money for fellowships.\u201d\n\nThe result is that, for all the paeans sung to racial diversity, socioeconomic diversity in the hallowed ivy quadrangles remains woeful. A survey conducted by Yale\u2019s student newspaper found that twice as many students come from families in the top 5% of the income distribution as from the entire bottom half."

      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "IT IS hard not to notice it, when you first meet David Autor: the earring, there in the lobe of his left ear, in the shape of a gecko. It has become something of a theme among his students and colleagues, who have given him all sorts of gecko-related paraphernalia. The earring is one half of a pair bought with his wife, before they were married and long before he became the Ford Professor of Economics at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology. It is an eye-catching accessory, fitting for a man whose career has followed unconventional paths.\n\nMr Autor is an ever-so-slightly manic figure, who speaks quickly and engagingly. He is not a household name but he is enormously influential, in large part because of his groundbreaking work on the effects on American workers of China\u2019s extraordinary rise. Economic models have long allowed for the possibility that trade between rich countries and poorer ones with an abundance of cheap labour could harm workers in the richer country. But economists generally assumed that any such negative effects would not be of much consequence. In a series of papers Mr Autor and his two primary collaborators\u2014David Dorn, of the University of Zurich, and Gordon Hanson, of the University of California, San Diego\u2014painted a very different picture.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn regions where the products manufactured by local firms were most vulnerable to an influx of cheap, Chinese imports, wages and labour-force participation remained depressed a decade after the onset of the \u201cChina shock\u201d. Subsequent work by Mr Autor and his co-authors found that the shock contributed to deep social disruption as well: in marriage patterns, for instance, and in the appetite for fringe political ideas. The results surprised the authors and sent a jolt of disbelief through the profession. They also inspired a wave of new research into the effects of globalisation,and enjoined economists and policymakers alike to think more seriously about how workers survive and thrive amid major economic shifts.\n\nThirty years ago Mr Autor had no great ambition to launch new areas of economic investigation. Three semesters into an undergraduate degree at Columbia University he dropped out, in order to work out what exactly he wanted to do with his life. He had always been a tinkerer and interested in computers, and so he spent some time working in tech jobs: as a programmer for a hospital and then for a friend\u2019s tech startup. The rigorously analytical way in which programming required him to think appealed to him, but the problems he was tackling sometimes felt trivial. Before the money he was earning grew too large to walk away from, he returned to university to study psychology.\n\nThat experience, too, frustrated him. His psychology work was the mirror image of his time spent coding: he was working on important problems which were maddeningly resistant to systematic analysis. Unsure what to do next, Mr Autor moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and began working with a Methodist church to teach computer skills to disadvantaged kids. That contributed to a budding interest in what exactly the computer age was likely to mean for workers. In the Bay Area, Mr Autor also met the woman he would marry, acquired the gecko earrings and decided, before long, to give academia another go. In 1992 he entered a public-policy graduate programme at Harvard University, and there, at the relatively ripe age of 28, he took his first economics course.\n\nEconomics hit the intellectual sweet spot. Here was the opportunity to apply systematic ways of thinking to important, real-world problems. And the problem in which he found himself most interested at the time was the way that new technologies affected labour markets. His thesis explored the impact of computerisation on temporary help workers. Upon finishing his work at Harvard he made the extremely unlikely leap from a public-policy graduate programme to the economics department at MIT, one of the most prestigious in the country.\n\nFrom his new perch Mr Autor\u2019s early work focused on when, how and with what effects firms decided to use new, and potentially labour-displacing, technologies. For a fascinating paper published in 2002, with Frank Levy, of MIT, and Richard Murnane, of Harvard, Mr Autor and his co-authors spent two years exploring every aspect of the operation of a large bank. Their investigation dug into the limits of automation: as in the case of the stubborn 3% of cheques which persistently elude efforts to computerise the entirety of the cheque-processing system, and which must be parsed by human workers.\n\nAs a result both of this research and his experience as a programmer, he realised that the way many economists were thinking about automation was flawed. Researchers often used the education level of the workers employed in a particular job as a good-enough proxy for the complexity of the role and, correspondingly, for how susceptible it might be to automation. On this reckoning workers with some post-secondary education ought to be less vulnerable to march of the robots than those who lacked even a college degree.\n\nMr Autor suggested that it was not the skill set of the worker which mattered, but the task to which the worker applied her skills. Some tasks that are trivially easy for machines (like multiplying 15-digit numbers) are very difficult for humans. Others that humans handle effortlessly, like manoeuvering around furniture while tidying an office, are incredibly difficult for machines. The \u201ctask approach\u201d to labour markets that emerged from this work has become a critical tool in analysing the ways in which all sorts of disruptive events affect workers.\n\nAt the time, in the early 2000s, the importance of this contribution was not obvious, including to Mr Autor himself. America had just experienced one of the best decades for workers in a very long time. The disruptions wrought by the introduction of powerful new kinds of computing software seemed to be petering out. But as the decade wore on, the continuing relevance of Mr Autor\u2019s work became clear.\n\nThe connection he drew between the extent to which tasks were routine or not, and the ease with which they could be automated away, proved important as policymakers began to grow worried about a \u201chollowing out\u201d of the workforce. The production and office work done by respectably paid, \u201cmiddle-skill\u201d employees was disappearing; data entry and repetitive production tasks could be given to computers or cheap foreign labourers in a way that neither low-skill janitorial tasks, say, nor well-compensated professional work could be.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, by the early 2010s, it became clear that the tools Mr Autor had developed could be used to assess the effects of another big source of disruption: expanded trade with China. Along with Mr Hanson and Mr Dorn, he pointed out in a paper published in 2013 that routine sorts of work might also be susceptible to competition from abroad, either through offshoring or trade with low-wage countries. Western firms might not wish to send abroad complex jobs like design, but production work looks much the same whether it is done in Chicago or Shenzhen.\n\nWhere the economic affects of automation tend to be spread broadly across the whole of an economy, however, displacement of routine work by trade tends to have a more focused geographic impact. In subsequent work, the authors showed how it was these concentrated costs of trade with China which made the China shock so powerful. Communities hit hard by the shock could not recover easily. Trade left long-run economic, social and political scars.\n\nThe researchers knew their work would be explosive. They were themselves surprised by the results, and checked and rechecked their findings in preparation for the storm of criticism they expected to face. The profession was indeed sceptical at first. Mr Autor chuckles that economists\u2019 initial reaction was to insist the work was wrong, then to shift to allowing that it was right but meaningless, before eventually grappling with the work\u2019s implications.\n\nThose implications were significant. Mr Autor\u2019s China-shock work has heavily informed debates in Washington about how to manage globalisation. It has made it easier to discuss the real-world challenges associated with China\u2019s rise\u2014from the encouragement states give to cutting-edge industries to the national-security dimensions of trade in advanced technology\u2014without being labelled a protectionist or a crank.\n\nChina\u2019s integration into the world economy was a one-off. But the disruptions faced by American workers are not over. Even as Mr Autor and his co-authors were beginning their landmark China papers, fresh concern was growing about mass automation, brought about by striking improvements in artificial intelligence.\n\nBy now, however, the economics profession has become much more preoccupied by the shocks that ordinary workers suffer. At the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Atlanta earlier this year, Mr Autor drew a crowd of thousands for a keynote address that focused on the bleak prospects of workers without a college degree. He has been asking himself questions such as these for two decades. But today the fast-talking economist with the gecko stud in his ear has everyone\u2019s attention."

    "title": "The politicisation of white evangelical Christianity is hurting it",
    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "A RMS OUTSTRETCHED , the congregation at Hyde Park Baptist Church welcomed the Holy Spirit into their two-storey, stained-glass sanctuary. Along with the spirit came their pastor, Kie Bowman, accompanied by a full jazz orchestra. He summed up his sermon as: \u201cto impact culture, love the Bible\u201d. But interspersed with this joyful invitation to share the Gospel were some spiky remarks, such his assertion that \u201cyou have to be convinced by the media that God does not exist.\u201d Such has been the transformation of white evangelical Christianity over the past half-century. But conservative politics in church have also caused a backlash.\n\nMr Bowman\u2019s statements reflect the battle that evangelical denominations have been fighting since the 1980s, when evangelical leaders began to move past discussions about morality and embraced conservative rhetoric about individual rights. Andrew Lewis, author of a book about this phenomenon called \u201cThe Rights Turn\u201d, says that Republicans and conservative Christians now have a shared approach to the law. As examples, he points to the use of free-speech rights to defend anti-abortion legislation and to argue against regulating campaign finance. That fusion seemed complete in 2016, when 81% of white born-again Christians voted for Donald Trump, according to data from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nYet this coupling seems to be hurting membership of evangelical churches. Several polling firms have detected a decline in the share of Americans who describe themselves as white evangelicals over the past decade. The Pew Research Centre found a two-percentage-point drop from 2007 to 2012. PRRI found a six-percentage-point drop in the share of the population that identify as white evangelicals, from 23% in 2006 to 17% in 2016. ABC and the Washington Post found a still larger decline of eight percentage points, larger than the drop among mainline white Protestants. The problem is partly generational: in the PRRI data just 8% of young Americans aged 18-29 say they are white evangelicals, while 26% of those aged 65 or older are white evangelical Protestants. Together with the decline in the share of whites who identify as Catholics, this has caused anxiety among some of the faithful that white Christian America is under threat.\n\nThe argument about how to restore lost greatness has been running for 40 years. In the late 1970s the Southern Baptist Convention ( SBC ), an umbrella organisation for evangelical churches, was roiled by a confrontation between modernisers, who were in charge of the organisation, and traditionalists, who blamed them for presiding over a levelling-off in church attendance. The traditionalists won, but on their watch the malaise has worsened. Nor are falling numbers the only problem: an exhaustive investigation by the Houston Chronicle and the San Antonio Express-News identified more than 250 church leaders who have been accused of sexually abusing people who worshipped at SBC churches.\n\nMany churches remain committed to preaching conservative politics from the pulpit on Sundays. The SBC \u2019s leadership, however, has been critical of Mr Trump. Russell Moore, a theologian who heads its work on public policy, is among the president\u2019s most eloquent critics.\n\nThis may be too little, too late for a group of former evangelicals who are trying to organise \u201cex-vangelicals\u201d\u2014or \u201cexvies\u201d\u2014into a nascent political movement. Christopher Stroop, a journalist, has emerged as a leader among the exvies. Mr Stroop was raised in a fundamentalist evangelical household, where he went to non-denominational Christian schools and was surrounded mostly by friends who shared his beliefs. In high-school, biology lessons about DNA would be interspersed with preaching from the teacher, and sometimes with documentaries on \u201cflood geology\u201d and the search for Noah\u2019s ark. \u201cThere was strong pressure to be a young-Earth creationist,\u201d Mr Stroop says. He also recalls a class field-trip during school hours to a prototype Tea Party convention. Mr Stroop says his education was \u201call about isolating children in the subculture so they\u2019ll grow up to be the culture warriors the church wants them to be.\u201d\n\nHe typifies a larger pattern. In a paper published in 2017 Paul Djupe, Jacob Neiheisel and Anand Sokhey, all political scientists, found that people stop attending church when they have intellectual disagreements with their religion and when they lose social attachments to their congregations. Since Americans have become yoked to their political tribe with an intensity that often rivals religious fervour, those with moderate political disagreements frequently find their faith hard to reconcile with their politics and end up leaving their churches."

    "text": "D ANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN , the sociologist and senator who died in 2003, once said that America\u2019s longstanding preference for bureaucratic social services for the poor over simply handing them cash was like \u201cfeeding the sparrows by feeding the horses\u201d. The universal child-care plan offered by Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts and Democratic candidate for 2020, falls into such a snare. Given the cost of American child care, which is the least affordable among developed countries, some plan is clearly needed. Her ambitious proposal calls for publicly funded child-care centres nationwide, which would be free to those making less than 200% of the poverty line (or $51,500 for a family of four) and cost no more than 7% of income for those above it. The complicated infrastructure it envisions would be less efficient than simple cash transfers to poor families with children\u2014and would give uncertain returns.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Canadian province of Quebec introduced a universal child-care scheme backed by large subsidies\u2014out-of-pocket costs were limited to $5 a day. When social scientists tracked the life outcomes for the children and parents who took part in the programme, the results were unexpectedly terrible. Children came out no cleverer and with worse health, life satisfaction and rates of criminal offence. Although women worked more, the taxes generated on their additional labour fell far short of the costs of running the programme. Studies of European programmes have found more positive results, but the outcomes of the recent experiment in North America are troubling. \u201cIt tells us that a poorly funded programme that was rapidly rolled out did not generate the benefits that were promised,\u201d says Amitabh Chandra, a professor of economics at Harvard. And \u201cwe have a history of underfunding programmes in the US when they disproportionately benefit the poor.\u201d\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn practice, the universal child care envisioned by Ms Warren would operate as more of a middle-class entitlement than a well-targeted anti-poverty programme. The costs of child care vary enormously by place. In Washington, DC , it costs around $22,000 a year. Assuming identical costs, Ms Warren\u2019s plan would grant a well-to-do professional couple in the city making $150,000 an $11,500 subsidy to deposit Junior in day care. And although it is true that a poor working mother would receive the same service free of charge, the public costs of looking after her child might well exceed her annual earnings. Giving even a fraction of that amount in cash to mother and child would probably be better for both.\n\nPoor and ethnic-minority mothers are also less likely to use formal day-care centres in the first place. They tend to stay at home to look after children or to use informal child care, such as relatives. \u201cThere\u2019s this amazing tone-deafness to the cultural implications. It\u2019s not just a technocratic policy to close the female wage gap or to grow the earnings of kids,\u201d says Sam Hammond of the Niskanen Centre, a think-tank. The Quebec experiment showed a significant crowding out of informal child-care arrangements in favour of cheap, government-run facilities.\n\nMs Warren herself once grasped this conundrum. In her book \u201cThe Two-Income Trap\u201d, co-written with her daughter in 2003, she dismissed the \u201csacred cow\u201d of free day care. \u201cSubsidised day care benefits only some kids\u2014those whose parents both work outside the home. Day-care subsidies offer no help for families with a stay-at-home mother,\u201d Ms Warren wrote then. She also recognised its possible exacerbating effect on inequality. \u201cEvery dollar spent to subsidise the price of day care frees up a dollar for the two-income family to spend in the bidding wars for housing, tuition, and everything else,\u201d she continued.\n\nA better way to reduce child poverty is to provide a basic monthly child allowance which could be spent on food, rent or formal child care. Michael Bennet and Sherrod Brown, two Democratic senators, have proposed paying families $250-300 per child each month\u2014which would cut the child-poverty rate by almost half, and at the same cost as Ms Warren\u2019s plan. If child care is to be subsidised, it is probably better done through means-tested tax credits. Sadly, the phrase \u201cfully refundable child tax credits\u201d does not stir the soul of Democratic primary voters quite like \u201cuniversal child-care\u201d does."

    "title": "The Trump administration and the Indo-Pakistan crisis",
    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "F OREIGN POLICY savants had long worried about what Donald Trump\u2019s administration would do when faced with its first global crisis. Yet when the metaphorical \u201c3am call\u201d came last month, relaying news of the slaughter of 40 Indian policemen by a Pakistani militant group, months away from an Indian general election, the administration\u2019s initial response was to roll over and go back to sleep. This Indo-Pakistan confrontation, which included tit-for-tat air strikes across their border in Kashmir, is the first such crisis in which America has not played a leading role since both countries tested nuclear weapons in 1998.\n\nPrevious crises, similarly sparked by attacks on India by jihadists connected to Pakistan, prompted high-powered American delegations to rush to both countries: for example in 2001 and 2008. They also involved the president directly\u2014including in 1999 when Bill Clinton harangued Nawaz Sharif to end a small war Pakistan had launched in Kashmir. By contrast, neither Mr Trump nor Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, appear to have paid much attention to the early stages of the current crisis. The initial American response consisted of a phone call by John Bolton, the national security adviser, to his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, in which he was reported in India to have acknowledged India\u2019s right to \u201cself-defence\u201d against \u201ccross-border\u201d terrorism. Mr Trump later said he understood India was \u201clooking at something very strong\u201d. This was tantamount to an American green light for the Indian air strikes that followed, which were the first by either country since the 1971 war that led to the division of Pakistan. Only afterwards did Mr Pompeo issue the customary plea to both sides for restraint.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nIn part, this reflects America\u2019s changing relations with the subcontinent. Until recently it had closer ties to Pakistan, its former cold-war ally and partner, of sorts, in the war on terror. Yet as America\u2019s need for the Pakistanis has diminished, with its drawdown in Afghanistan, so frustration with the \u201cinternational migraine\u201d that is Pakistan, in Madeleine Albright\u2019s phrase, has increased. America has meanwhile got much closer to India, which it views as a counterweight to China. Out of respect for an important new partner, whose anger at Pakistan\u2019s complicity in jihadist violence it shares, the Trump administration was therefore more content than its predecessors to leave it to India to decide how it wanted to respond to the latest Pakistan-linked attack.\n\nThe Obama administration, whose South Asia policies Mr Trump has broadly continued, acted similarly. After jihadists killed 19 Indians in Kashmir in 2016, Mr Obama did not send a heavyweight delegation to the subcontinent either. And in a post-attack call to Mr Doval, Susan Rice, Mr Obama\u2019s national security adviser, also omitted the traditional American call for restraint. Mr Obama had reached the limits of his patience with Pakistan. He had also moderated his earlier insistence on the need to resolve the two countries\u2019 dispute over Kashmir as a means to ending their nuclear-armed rivalry. So the Trump administration has in a sense merely made Mr Obama\u2019s growing partiality for India more explicit. It has shown no interest in the Kashmir dispute, which it says is a matter for the two countries to resolve (or not). In this context, Mr Bolton\u2019s tacit support for India\u2019s right to launch a retaliatory strike into Pakistan looks not just reckless\u2014though it was that. It looks like a final repudiation of Pakistan\u2019s effort to turn any Indo-Pakistani confrontation into an international discussion on the status of Kashmir.\n\nThat is logical: India resisted outside advice on Kashmir even when it was far more evenly matched with Pakistan than it is today. Yet the combination of passivity and partiality in the Trump administration\u2019s response to this crisis also reflects its broader lack of interest in solving problems abroad. This week the State Department provided another illustration of that, by announcing that it had folded its 175-year-old diplomatic mission to Jerusalem, which had served as a de facto embassy to the Palestinians, into its new Israeli embassy. It suggests America may no longer be committed to a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict.\n\nThe main downside to America\u2019s retreat from problem-solving is that the world still needs its leadership. It also seems self-defeating. America\u2019s efforts to keep the peace have tended to enhance its power. As Jake Sullivan, a Democratic foreign-policy expert, argues, America\u2019s claim to have an exceptional responsibility for the global good has helped it win domestic support for the ambitious foreign policy its national interests require. Moreover, if aspiring to global leadership may be irksome, forfeiting it carries costs. Having helped establish a precedent whereby India feels able to launch air strikes on Pakistan in response to a terrorist attack, Mr Bolton has made the prospect of a nuclear exchange in South Asia more likely. Exerting such little pressure on the Israelis to treat fairly with the Palestinians is probably making both sides more radical, and the Middle East less stable.\n\nMere cash and Kashmir\n\nAnother concern is the Trump administration\u2019s conception of the national interest. Its management of the State Department, the country\u2019s premier foreign-policy institution, has been a fiasco. As the Indo-Pakistan crisis has highlighted, America has no permanent ambassador in Pakistan; nor has it in Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. It is also, despite the administration\u2019s friendliness to India, increasingly incoherent in its approach to the country. This week Mr Trump told Congress he planned to end the preferential trade terms India enjoys with America because of its high tariffs on goods such as whiskey. This is liable to be as damaging to America\u2019s reputation in India as Mr Bolton\u2019s amenable view of its right to self-defence was helpful. Yet the cost of the trade programme to America, at around $190m a year, is modest. It is the policy of a president compelled by tactics but devoid of strategy. Sun Tzu called that the noise before a defeat."

    "title": "Political competition is moderating Texas Republicans",
    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "T HE KEY TO understanding Texas is the state Capitol in Austin. It is there that legislators meet only every other year to pass new laws and set the state budget. The elegant domed building is several feet taller than the Capitol in Washington, and that matters to Texans. Gun-owners with a concealed-carry licence can enter through a separate security lane and do not have to go through the indignity of a metal detector, as lowly journalists do. The Capitol is built of pinkish granite, a suitable material for a red state now facing the prospect of diluted Republican influence.\n\nAfter years of pushing to the right on social issues and immigration, Texas Republicans have shifted their tone during the current legislative session. \u201cThere\u2019s been a rush to the middle,\u201d explains Jason Sabo of Frontera Strategy, a lobbying firm. Evidence of that lies in the list of priorities presented by Greg Abbott, the recently re-elected Republican governor. His \u201cemergency\u201d items, which he wants the legislature to focus on, include financing public schools, paying teachers more, reforming the property-tax regime, funding for special education and expanding access to mental-health services.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nHow unlike the previous session of the biennial legislature, in 2017. Back then Republicans passed a hugely controversial immigration bill, giving law-enforcement officers the right to stop people and ask to see papers confirming their citizenship. Some compare this action to Proposition 187, an anti-immigration bill that passed in California in 1994 and turned Hispanics in that state against the Republican Party. Another contentious legislative item that session was a \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, designed to regulate where transgender people are allowed to pee. Mr Abbott declared it a priority at the time, though ultimately it withered after opposition from businesses.\n\nRepublicans \u201chave moved over to our issue set and the things we had been talking about,\u201d says Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. Culture wars are still playing out in this legislative session, including over abortion, but they are fewer. Republicans are \u201cnot talking about divisive social issues any more,\u201d says Joe Straus, who served as Speaker of the Texas House for a decade before stepping down in January. Republicans moved to the right to win primaries against other Republicans, but now they face more challenging general elections. Today \u201cthere\u2019s more fear of the November voter than there is of the primary voter. But there\u2019s fear of both,\u201d says Mr Straus.\n\nThere are several reasons for the Republicans\u2019 change of tone and approach, but the 2016 and 2018 elections are central to it. In 2016 Hillary Clinton lost Texas by the smallest margin of any Democrat since 1996. In 2018, when Democrats picked up 12 House seats and two state Senate seats, many right-wing Republicans lost what were thought to be safe districts or won by slimmer margins than expected. This had more than a little to do with Beto O\u2019Rourke, who was challenging Republican Ted Cruz for the US Senate. Although he lost, Mr O\u2019Rourke helped get many down-ballot Democratic state legislators and judges elected.\n\nDonald Trump has also cast a shadow over state Republicans. \u201cThe worst thing that ever happened to Texas Republicans was the election of Donald Trump,\u201d says Mark Jones of Rice University in Houston. Mr Trump has alienated many white Republican women in Texas, and has also pushed away Hispanics, who account for around 40% of the state\u2019s population. Long after Mr Trump leaves office, demographic change in Texas will continue to exert an influence on the fortunes of Republicans, as the Hispanic population grows, millennials vote in increasing numbers and people continue to move to Texas from other states, bringing their more liberal politics with them. According to a recent poll by the University of Texas and Texas Tribune, more Texans say they would sooner vote for a candidate running against Mr Trump than re-elect the president.\n\nShowing voters that they can bring about change on bread-and-butter issues may help Republicans fend off competition in 2020. Legislators are broadly in agreement that the state needs to do something about property taxes, which have risen considerably as Texas\u2019s economy has boomed and pushed up property values. Texas does not have a state income tax, so it relies disproportionately on property taxes to fund schools. But because the property tax is a very transparent levy, voters frequently complain about their high bills.\n\nMr Abbott has suggested capping the rate by which local governments can raise taxes at 2.5% without a special vote (today, that threshold is 8%); this is probably just a starting point for negotiation. But how the state will manage to reduce property-tax growth rates while doing more to fund public schools equitably and boost their performance\u2014another legislative priority\u2014is unclear. Restricting the ability of local districts to raise revenue when they have so few other sources available to them could damage the state\u2019s educational prospects in the long run.\n\nThe property-tax issue points to a broader theme in Texas politics: the clash between state and local control. In theory, Republicans tend to be in favour of light-touch regulation and leaving governance and policymaking to local authorities. But as cities have turned into Democratic bastions and forged their own liberal visions for the future, Republicans have changed their stance. For example, last year Austin and San Antonio passed ordinances that require employers to offer paid sick leave. But a bill making its way through the state Senate would hamstring cities\u2019 ability to set such policies.\n\nMuch is at stake. If Republicans lose the state House, Democrats will have a stronger influence on the redistricting process. (A Democrat-controlled House would presumably not agree with a Republican-controlled Senate plan.) In another twist, next year\u2019s election will be the first when \u201cstraight ticket\u201d voting (ie, ticking a single box to vote for every candidate from that party on a ballot) is eliminated, thanks to efforts by Republicans in the previous legislative session. Candidates will have to compete more on their own merits rather than rely on party loyalty. This could contribute, sometime between 2020 and 2026, to the end of the Republicans\u2019 20-year dominance of all statewide offices, according to Mr Jones of Rice University."

    "title": "Amid the opioid crisis, a different drug comes roaring back",
    "authors": [
      "The Economist"
    ],
    "text": "L ONDON BREED , the mayor of San Francisco, recently announced a new drugs task-force, which is the kind of thing mayors do. This task force, though, was unusual because it was not aimed at opioids but at methamphetamine. In 2017 meth overdoses killed 87 people in the city, more than twice as many as heroin. Open-air dealing, uninterrupted by the police, is a common sight in the poor Tenderloin district. Use is widespread among the city\u2019s many homeless. Because the drug induces aggression, frenzy and paranoia, passers-by often feel unsafe. Half the people now admitted for psychiatric emergencies to the city\u2019s general hospital are suffering from the effects of meth-induced psychosis.\n\nThe problem is not confined to San Francisco. Although politicians and journalists are understandably transfixed by the 50,000 people killed by opioids each year, the rise in meth-overdose deaths has attracted less attention (see chart). In 2000 only 578 Americans died of an overdose. By 2017, deaths had increased 18-fold to 10,333 people. Meth addiction mostly afflicts western and south-western states like Arizona, Oklahoma and New Mexico, where fentanyl and heroin deaths are less common than in the east. For that reason, states tend to either have a meth problem or an opioid problem\u2014with the exception of West Virginia, which leads the nation in overdose deaths for both.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nMuch of this deadly surge is caused by supply. Little meth is now made in America. The number of domestic meth labs busted by police dropped from 15,000 in 2010 to 3,000 in 2017. Most of these are amateurish operations that cops call \u201cBeavis and Butthead labs\u201d, incapable of producing more than two ounces of the stuff per batch. \u201cMexican cartels dominate the market. They manufacture meth in superlabs across the border,\u201d says Chris Nielsen, the special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s ( DEA ) San Francisco division. Left unmolested, the chemists have perfected their technique. The purity of Mexican-produced meth has surged from 39% in 2007 to 97% today. At the same time, competition between cartels has increased supply, quartering prices. \u201cThey\u2019re becoming more brazen now. The loads are becoming bigger,\u201d says Mr Nielsen. His division seized 830kg of meth in 2018\u201447% more than the year before.\n\nAnother reason for the meth surge is the growth of so-called polydrug abuse. Half of those who died of meth overdoses in 2017 also had opioids in their system. Users usually have a drug of choice\u2014opioids, which numb feeling, or stimulants such as cocaine and meth. When they cannot cheaply or easily obtain their preferred hit (or if they are afraid that the local batch is tainted), they will often substitute another drug. In robust urban markets, doses of fentanyl-laced heroin or meth can be obtained for as little as $5.\n\nOne factor that had limited the spread of meth is that it is a pain to use. Injecting it requires dissolving it in acid and high heat, which then damages veins. Smoking it harms the lungs. But that too may now be changing, as manufacturers are experimenting with putting the drug in pill form. A husband and wife were recently arrested for running a meth-pill operation from their business, a care home in Vallejo, California. They had 31lb of pills embossed with reproductions of American icons like the Kool-Aid man, Tesla and Donald Trump. Widespread introduction of such pills would not just make the drug easier to take; it could also be sold as a party drug to unsuspecting youngsters.\n\nIn San Francisco, where the death rate in 2017 was nearly triple the national average, rates of use are especially high among gay residents, who take it as a party drug, and the homeless. Its cheapness has accelerated \u201ca problem that has existed for decades among the LGBT community around meth use,\u201d says Raphael Mandelman, a member of the city\u2019s board of supervisors. It is also used by \u201cfolks who are homeless who are trying to get through a cold night or stay awake,\u201d he says.\n\nLike opioids, meth is highly addictive and difficult to quit. But unlike opioids, it lacks effective pharmacological treatments. There is no approved medication-assisted treatment for addiction which substantially decreases the chance of relapse. There is also no equivalent of naloxone, a life-saving drug that reverses an opioid overdose. Meth kills by overloading blood vessels, eventually resulting in aneurysms, heart failure and strokes. As a result, longtime older users are likeliest to die\u2014in San Francisco, the average age of those who die of a meth overdose is 49."

    "text": "In a bright, airy studio in east London, Joanna Dai shows me her latest collection of women\u2019s workwear. The tapered trousers, collarless blazers and short-sleeved shift dresses are simple and stylish, featuring blocks of oxblood, navy and cream over intricate patterns. Anyone would think she had been designing clothes for years, but in fact she only founded her label, Dai, two years ago, after a dramatic career change. Before she picked up her dressmaking shears, Dai spent eight years as an investment banker. Her worklife was typically hectic, involving long hours and a lot of travel, and it was on her way home from one trip that she had what she describes as her \u201ceureka moment\u201d. On a return flight from Stockholm, 16 hours after she had got dressed, \u201cthe waistband was digging in, I couldn\u2019t move my arms. I thought to myself: \u2018why can\u2019t workwear feel like yoga, and still look like a power suit?\u2019\u201d\n\nOver the years she had often felt that her clothes weren\u2019t up to the job. Her trousers didn\u2019t fit properly, and her dresses were made of heavy, sweaty fabrics. Nothing could be put in the washing machine, and so time would have to be carved out of her busy week to drop things off at a dry cleaner and pick them up again. She sensed she was not alone in her frustrations. Women worldwide spend $35bn on workwear every year. A good proportion of this was surely spent on clothes that chafe, crease and confine; that were dry-clean-only and got thrown away after a few years.\n\nWicker woman A blouse and trousers from Dai\n\nDai retrained as a fashion designer and set out to realise her dream: making work clothes from the same kinds of fabrics you might see at the gym. She is one of a number of female entrepreneurs addressing what they see as the market\u2019s failure to deliver what women want: flattering, comfortable, machine-washable clothing that doesn\u2019t need to be ironed. Yehua Yang and Evelyn Frison, two friends from New York with \u201ca shared hatred of women\u2019s pants\u201d, set up Pivotte to offer \u201clow-maintenance clothing for high-performing women\u201d. Sarah LaFleur, tired of \u201cblah-feeling pantsuits\u201d from her career in finance, is the founder of MM.LaFleur, another New York-based brand. Its clothes have \u201cstretchy sleeves for hailing cabs\u201d and pockets \u201cfor holding presentation notes\u201d. Elizabeth & Clarke, a clothing company founded by Melanie Moore, another former investment banker and also based in New York, recently released the Unstainable Workwear Collection. Its shirts, skirts and blazers are designed to repel liquid, including coffee spillages, lunch splatters and sweat.\n\nWhat these clothes have in common is their hi-tech fabric \u2013 the companies variously claim to have worked with textile experts, engineers and scientists to produce breathable, moisture-wicking clothes that won\u2019t pill or crease. The response from consumers has been enthusiastic. MM.LaFleur\u2019s \u201cEtsuko\u201d dress, a simple knee-length design with an adjustable belt and three-quarter length sleeves, has apparently made the company more than $3m. One journalist, invited to test the dress for Business Insider, wrote that \u201cit\u2019s as comfortable as anything else I own, T -shirts included\u201d. Pivotte\u2019s \u201c24/7\u201d trousers, which boast \u201cfour-way stretch\u201d and \u201cexceptional recovery\u201d, have sold out four times. Dai says she is \u201cconstantly\u201d contending with a waiting list.\n\nShake a leg Pivotte\u2019s 24/7 trousers have sold out four times\n\nWhen I try on Dai\u2019s clothes, I understand why. The dresses are flattering and shapely without giving me a welt across my waist (unlike one expensive number in my wardrobe, bought for my first internship). The \u201cStraight Up\u201d trousers \u2013 made from Lycra and microfibre \u2013 are soft, stretchy and light. I put them \u2013 and the \u201cNow and Forever\u201d blouse \u2013 through their paces over the course of a full working day. I shove the shirt into my gym bag in the evening, and it emerges in the changing room the next morning looking crisp. Unfortunately I don\u2019t get a chance to see how the clothes fare in the wash (such is the level of demand that Dai needs the stock back) and I\u2019m sad to give them up.\n\nIt feels like progress, certainly, but it doesn\u2019t come cheap. A MM.LaFleur dress will set you back $195; Pivotte\u2019s trousers are $220 a pair. Dai says her clothes are best thought of as investments to be made back over many wears and many years. Most of us, however, will just have to wait for the high street to sit up and take note."

    "title": "Mickey Mouse at 90: how a star was born",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "As a child, when asked when my birthday was, I would reply: \u201cNovember 18th, the same day as Mickey Mouse\u2019s\u201d. On that day in 1928, some decades before I was born, I should add, \u201cSteamboat Willy\u201d premiered at the Colony Theatre in New York. The drawings and story were exemplary, but it was Walt Disney\u2019s idea to add synchronised sound that was truly revolutionary. It was the first time an animated character had appeared to talk, sing and play music \u2013 and the audience gasped and cheered. In an instant, it seemed, Mickey was heading for the stars, taking with him Disney and his burgeoning studio.\n\nDespite my lifelong affinity with Mickey, it wasn\u2019t until reading \u201cWalt Disney\u2019s Mickey Mouse: The Ultimate History\u201d by David Gerstein, JB Kaufman and Daniel Kothenschulte that I realised how little I knew about him. This monster of a book (it weighs in at 5.1kg) is a minute-by-minute, lavishly illustrated account of the plucky little fellow\u2019s first 90 years, taking in his work (with plot summaries of his films), his family (Walt Disney, the animators who drew him, and the characters he loved and fought), as well as his wider cultural significance.\n\nHe was conceived, I learnt, during the spring of 1928, on a transcontinental train, somewhere between New York and Los Angeles. Disney needed to come up with a new character after his previous animated hero \u2013 Oswald the Lucky Rabbit (remember him?) \u2013 had been effectively stolen from him by unscrupulous distributors. Legend has it that Mickey was inspired by a mouse that had scurried into his study some years earlier. Disney dubbed him \u201cMortimer\u201d \u2013 a name that was nixed by his wife, Lillian. His personality, Disney claimed, owed much to Charlie Chaplin: \u201cWe thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the wistfulness of Chaplin,\u201d he said, \u201ca little fellow trying to do the best he could.\u201d\n\nAfter \u201cSteamboat Willy\u201d, which also marked the debut of Mickey\u2019s girlfriend, Minnie, more films followed and, in time, comic strips, television, merchandise and, in the 1950s, amusement parks. Mickey Mouse won a special Academy Award in 1932, and two years later, was unanimously voted into the League of Nations by its member states. In keeping with the responsibilities of his growing celebrity, Mickey continued to evolve, moving into technicolour in 1935, acquiring gloves, and whites to his eyes, as well as a more-statesmanlike persona. As the war approached, his star began to be eclipsed by that of Donald Duck and other, more raucous studio-mates. But the supersonic launchpad that he had given to the Disney Studio has never been forgotten. \u201cI only hope that we never lose sight of one thing,\u201c Walt Disney said in 1954, \u201cthat it was all started by a mouse.\u201d"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "They make an unusual team. Amal Clooney is an Oxford-educated human-rights lawyer married to a film star. Nadia Murad was born in a poor Iraqi village and once aspired to become a teacher. Clooney is tall, dazzling and so recognisable that people walk up to her in the street and tell her they love her. Murad is small, shy and avoids eye contact. Yet among her people, the Yazidis, Murad is better known and more admired than any other woman on Earth. Murad is a symbol of survival for a minority threatened with extermination. She was once a slave of Islamic State ( IS ). And, almost alone among former prisoners of IS , she is willing to testify publicly and repeatedly about the terrible things the jihadists did to her.\n\nClooney is Murad\u2019s lawyer, and the two women are working to bring the leaders of IS before an international court for inflicting genocide on the Yazidis. The story of their campaign is an extraordinary one: a tale of pious savagery pitted against truth, law and the soft power of celebrity.\n\nIt begins in August 2014, when Murad was a 21-year-old student. That month, IS fighters arrived in her village, Kocho, on the Nineveh plain. They were a terrifying mob, all of them heavily armed and many speaking languages that no one in Kocho understood.\n\nThe jihadists saw Nadia and her neighbours as the worst sort of infidels. The Yazidi faith has no holy book, but draws on a mix of Mesopotamian traditions. Yazidis revere a peacock angel that temporarily fell from God\u2019s grace; many Muslims regard this as devil-worship.\n\nEstimates of how many Yazidis there are range widely, from 70,000 to 500,000, mostly in Iraq but also in Syria and Germany. IS set out to reduce that number to zero, by forced conversion or Kalashnikov.\n\nOn August 15th the IS fighters in Kocho summoned everyone to the village school and separated the men from the women and children. Nadia watched from a second-floor window as they marched the men away. They slaughtered 312 in an hour, including six of Nadia\u2019s brothers and stepbrothers. They murdered the older women, too, including Nadia\u2019s mother. They forced the young women and children onto buses and took them to Mosul, IS \u2019s main stronghold in Iraq, which, as 1843 went to press, was under siege by Iraqi government forces.\n\nFleeing hell Yazidi refugees crossing into Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq\n\nNadia was shut in a building with 1,000 other families. The women were sick with fear; they knew what was coming. The fighters were about to divide the spoils. A man came up to Nadia and said he wanted to take her. She looked up and saw that he was enormous, \u201clike a monster\u201d. \u201cI cried out that I was too young and he was huge. He kicked and beat me. A few minutes later, another man came up to me\u2026I saw that he was a little smaller. I begged for him to take me.\u201d\n\nThe jihadist who took Nadia told her to convert to Islam. She refused. One day, he asked for her hand in \u201cmarriage\u201d. She said she was ill. A few days later, he forced her to get dressed and put on make-up. \u201cThen, on that terrible night, he did it.\u201d\n\nFrom then on, she was raped daily. When she tried to flee, a guard stopped her, forced her to strip and put her in a room with several guards, \u201cwho proceeded to commit their crime until I fainted\u201d. She finally escaped when her captor left a door unlocked. She could not return home, because IS still controlled her village. Eventually, she found sanctuary in Germany, where she now lives.\n\nTemporary refuge\n\nWomen and children in a makeshift camp after escaping from IS jihadists\n\nI first heard about Nadia from Amal, whom I was interviewing for a different article. (It was about free speech; Clooney had just got another client, a graft-exposing journalist called Khadija Ismayilova, out of prison in Azerbaijan.) Over lunch at a club in Notting Hill, she outlined Nadia\u2019s story, and explained how the two of them were planning to put IS leaders in the dock.\n\nThe evidence of genocide is exceptionally clear-cut, she pointed out. Not only are there mass graves and eyewitnesses, but IS has boasted about its intentions, filmed its massacres and posted videos of them online. In the case of the Yazidis, IS propaganda was chillingly specific. An article in Dabiq, an IS newsletter, says of this \u201cpagan minority\u201d that \u201ctheir continual existence\u2026is a matter that Muslims should question as they will be asked about it on Judgment Day.\u201d\n\nAnother leaflet explains that enslaving kuffar (infidel) women is in accordance with sharia (Islamic law). It also answers what one must assume are common questions, such as:\n\n\u2022 \u201cIs it permissible to beat a female slave?\u201d [Answer: Yes];\n\n\u2022 \u201cIs it permissible to have intercourse with a female slave who has not reached puberty?\u201d Answer: \u201c[Yes]; however if she is not fit for intercourse, then it is enough to enjoy her without [that].\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cIs it permissible to sell a female captive?\u201d Answer: \u201cIt is permissible to buy, sell, or gift female captives and slaves, for they are merely property.\u201d\n\nDespite such overwhelming evidence, putting IS leaders on trial will be hard. For one thing, they are tricky to capture. For another, international law moves slowly and often faces geopolitical roadblocks.\n\nClooney\u2019s first priority is to gather as much evidence as possible before it is lost. Some of this she does herself, painstakingly recording interviews with survivors (\u201cthe most harrowing witness statements I\u2019ve ever taken,\u201d she says). At the same time, she is pressing the UN Security Council to order a formal investigation on the ground, with a proper budget to excavate mass graves and collect DNA and documentary evidence (certificates of slave ownership, for example).\n\nIdeally, she would like IS leaders to stand trial before the International Criminal Court ( ICC ), the world\u2019s permanent human-rights court in The Hague. \u201cIf the ICC can\u2019t prosecute the world\u2019s most evil terror group, what is it there for?\u201d she asks. However, she is open to other options, such as a hybrid court backed by the UN and the government of Iraq, so long as it meets international standards of justice.\n\nGetting governments to co-operate is tricky. Most agree in principle that IS should be brought to justice. But Russia and Iraq are doubtless nervous about what investigators might unearth, and others drag their feet. (Britain is an honourable exception). Clooney is trying to shame them all into action.\n\nA few weeks after lunching with Clooney, I flew into Iraqi Kurdistan to find out more about Murad\u2019s people. I could not visit her village: it would have been both suicidal (since IS controlled it) and pointless (since all its Yazidi inhabitants were either dead, or had run away, or were captives of IS ). Instead, I headed for Mount Sinjar, the craggy stronghold of the Yazidis, near Iraq\u2019s border with Syria. This is where thousands of Yazi\u00ad\u00addis fled when IS first swept across the Nineveh plain. The jihadists were prevented from capturing it only through a combination of NATO air power and Kurdish boots on the ground. It is a sanctuary of sorts, though IS was still sporadically shelling it when I visited.\n\nThe search for justice Nadia Murad, voice of the Yazidis\n\nGetting to Mount Sinjar meant driving across the desert, past bombed-out ruins and sandbag-flanked machinegun nests. Goats and sheep wandered back and forth across the border. Tobacco sprouted in untended fields. The route led through a confusion of roadblocks manned by different Kurdish and Iraqi factions. Only the skill of Nick Pelham, The Economist\u2019s Middle East correspondent, got us through \u2013 he speaks flawless Arabic and, more importantly, knew exactly which bigwigs to call to make the men with guns let us pass.\n\nWe stumbled on the funeral of a Yazidi militiaman who had died fighting IS . Women were clustered round the body, wailing. Men sat separately in a room decorated with photographs of martyrs. They insisted that we join them for lunch.\n\nThe younger ones laid a plastic sheet on the carpet and heaped it with huge bowls of rice and couscous topped with sheeps\u2019 heads. The men put aside their AK -47s, grabbed the skulls and cracked them open. Then they scooped out the brains and ate them with relish. When they had eaten, they talked. All had stories of the day the jihadists came: of the panic, the headlong flight and the friends and relatives who did not escape. \u201cMy uncle\u2019s wife was paralysed. We couldn\u2019t get her out of [the village]. She was 80,\u201d recalled Khader Jassim, a Yazidi man with a grey moustache.\n\nThese were traditional people, with a strong sense of honour and its ugly twin, shame. I wanted to know how they felt about Nadia. She stands up in public and describes how IS fighters gang-raped her. No topic could be more taboo. Did the stern and conservative men of her home region think she was bringing shame on their community, I wondered? Far from it. \u201cNadia Murad? I love her so much, I hope she becomes president of Iraq,\u201d said Kharbo Khader Mardos, a man who fled from a village near Nadia\u2019s.\n\nAziz Haji Khalaf, a Yazidi police chief, put it like this: \u201cI think of her as a sister, an incredible person. I see her strength. With all that happened to her, she goes around the world and describes her suffering to get support for the Yazidis and to win freedom for the men and women who are still captives.\u201d In dozens of interviews, I found only one old man willing to criticise her, and his complaint was speculative. He worried that she might one day go into politics and lose her ideals.\n\nMost interviews were held in the camps for displaced people where 90% of Yazidis in Iraq live. These are grim places. The ones on Mount Sinjar (ie, on Yazidi territory) are ramshackle and poorly provisioned. The more formal ones, in the Kurdish areas, have neat rows of tents and plenty of food but simmer with tension, since Yazidis live side by side in them with Muslims who have also fled from IS . Many Muslims despise Yazidis; many Yazidis do not feel safe near Muslims. \u201cPerhaps you are a Muslim, so forgive me, but I want to live in a place where there are no Muslims,\u201d one Yazidi man told me. I talked to a number of people who, like Nadia, had been prisoners of IS . They were all young or middle-aged women. All the adult-male prisoners had been killed, along with all the women too old to rape.\n\nTalking to survivors, it quickly became clear how exceptional Murad really is. None admitted to having been raped, though all said that most of the other captive women were. To respect their privacy, I\u2019m not going to use their real names. Khatoon, a weary mother, said she suggested to her captor that she had AIDS . \u201cI said, do what you want. But I\u2019m sick. If you want to suffer in the same way, go ahead.\u201d So he made her a house slave instead. Sabrin, another ex-slave, was ransomed along with three of her children. She said that while they were prisoners, she protected one of her teenage daughters by shaving her hair and pretending she was paralysed. \u201cThere were four bombing raids while we were in Raqqa, and she didn\u2019t move at all or say a word. That\u2019s how she [avoided being raped].\u201d\n\nThe stories the survivors tell about what happened to fellow captives are sickening beyond belief. \u201cAny woman found with a mobile phone, the punishment was to be raped by five different men,\u201d recalled Khatoon. Some girls slashed their own wrists. \u201cWhen [the jihadists] found them, they undressed the bodies and raped the dead girls in front of us.\u201d\n\nThe effect on Yazidi families has been devastating. Two of Sabrin\u2019s children are still in captivity. Her husband and one of her daughters are almost certainly dead. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to think about where my children or my husband are, because I have to look after the rest of my family. But I think about it all the time,\u201d she said.\n\nGathering evidence Inspecting a Yazidi mass grave discovered in the Sinjar region\n\nThe Yazidis I met typically voiced three wishes. First, they want to return home. Second, they want the world to acknowledge that what happened to them \u2013 and is still happening \u2013 is genocide. Third, they want justice. The first of these wishes can only be fulfilled by military force. Yazidis can go home when IS is driven out of their villages, which will probably happen sooner in Iraq than in Syria. Fulfilling the second and third wishes requires grabbing the world\u2019s attention, jolting its conscience and pressing governments to act. That is where Nadia and Amal come in.\n\nPeople are seldom moved by statistics. When they hear that 5,000 Yazidis have been murdered by IS , or that 3,000 Yazidi women and children remain in slavery, they struggle to process the information. But when a little, mouse-like Yazidi woman describes how she was violated by gloating, self-righteous thugs who called her a \u201cdirty unbeliever\u201d, they are outraged. It is the details that provoke the most horror. For instance: Nadia\u2019s nephew, who was captured as a child, has been brainwashed into joining IS and now rings her up to threaten her.\n\nI met Nadia in New York, shortly before she addressed the UN in September. She seemed tired, stressed and nervous. But when she took the microphone, her gentle voice filled the cavernous hall. She spoke in a Kurdish dialect, which was simultaneously translated into the audience\u2019s headsets. Every word rang with pain. By the time she had finished, hundreds of faces were tear-sodden. Ban Ki-moon embraced her. Diplomat after diplomat rose to applaud. In the end, a bulky UN official had to rescue her from the adoring crowd.\n\nI asked her later about her new life, living in Germany and jetting around the world giving speeches and interviews. \u201cEvery\u00adthing is different,\u201d she said. She marvels at German trains, the damp climate, and the fact that she is respected as a human being. But she hates flying, and struggles with unfamiliar food. She yearns to return to her village, to see the family farm and the sheep and to enjoy Yazidi festivals, when people paint their houses white and follow fasting with feasts. \u201cMy life was easy and simple [there],\u201d she recalled. But she keeps going. She has endured far, far worse.\n\nWhile Nadia makes people weep, Amal does multiple jobs: framing a legal strategy, keeping the case in the headlines and lobbying governments to take it seriously. Because she is a celebrity, many people underestimate her. The most common question I was asked after interviewing her was: \u201cWhat was she wearing?\u201d (There\u2019s a website entirely devoted to this topic, so it is obviously of great interest to many people, but don\u2019t ask me. I can\u2019t tell the difference between a Vera Wang dress and one from Walmart.)\n\nSome people assume that, because Clooney wears nice clothes and walks on red carpets, she is just a figurehead. Some of the nastier tabloids go further. The Daily Mail totted up the price of all the outfits she wore while lobbying the UN in September, and insinuated that a woman who flaunts such luxury must be insincere in her professed concern for the downtrodden. This is plainly wrong. She was doing the same work before she was rich and famous. \u201cI knew her when she was unknown,\u201d says Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor of the ICC . \u201cShe was hugely impressive.\u201d\n\nShe was also intrepid. She speaks Arabic; her Lebanese parents moved to England when she was four. More than 20 years later she returned to Beirut to work for a UN tribunal investigating the assassination of Lebanon\u2019s prime minister in 2005. The day after she arrived, Israel bombed the airport. She lived in a fortified compound in a city plagued by car bombs. Suspects targeted by the tribunal included Hizbullah, a terrorist group, so investigators lived in fear of assassination. \u201cThere were times when I would look at parked cars with trepidation,\u201d she recalls.\n\nToday, her celebrity may sometimes be a distraction, but it has undoubtedly made her more effective as an advocate. She can guarantee media coverage of any case she takes on. And powerful people make time for her: the first time I met her, she had just had an audience with the pope.\n\nUnited in suffering\n\nNadia visiting a refugee camp in Idomeni, Greece, in April 2016\n\nFame is a currency. When combined with a noble cause, it is sometimes irresistible. Suppose you are a politician, possibly male. Hundreds of people want to bend your ear every day about a plethora of subjects. You cannot meet them all. One of them, a lawyer promoting justice for the victims of terrorists, just happens to be one of the most beautiful women on the planet. It is completely appropriate for you to sit down with her to discuss human rights in the Middle East, a region of great strategic importance to your government. Plus, you might enjoy it. David Cameron, Justin Trudeau, Boris Johnson and John McCain clearly did.\n\nIn person, Clooney is warm, charming and wonkish. She asks after my 13-year-old daughter, remembering that they have a fiercely academic Buckinghamshire girls\u2019 school in common. She talks me through legal points with great precision and sends follow-up emails packed with notes.\n\nIn public, she is the kind of orator who writes her own lines and delivers them with force and fury. Her speech to the UN in September was a barnstormer. She spoke after Nadia, reminding the assembled dignitaries that the slave market where her friend was sold was still running, and that not a single member of IS had been prosecuted for crimes against the Yazidis.\n\nThe voice of her people\n\nNadia with Amal, addressing the United Nations in September 2016\n\n\u201cThis is\u2026the first time I have had a chance to address an audience in front of the UN secretary-general. I wish I could say that I was proud to be here. But I am not,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI am ashamed, as a supporter of the UN , that states are failing to prevent or even punish genocide, because they find that their own interests get in the way. I am ashamed, as a lawyer, that there is no justice being done and barely a complaint being made about it. I am ashamed, as a woman, that girls like Nadia can have their bodies sold and used as battlefields. I am ashamed as a human being that we ignore their cries for help.\u201d\n\nThe case could take years. But when investigators have dug up enough graves and collected enough slave certificates, Amal hopes that the pressure to prosecute will be overwhelming. Nadia vows not to give up. \u201cEvery single one of them must be brought to justice,\u201d she says."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump\u2019s second Supreme Court nominee, faces a dramatic hurdle today in his quest for confirmation by the Senate. Three women have accused him of sexual misconduct; yesterday a woman said that she was gang-raped at a party at which Mr Kavanaugh was present. He denies all of the allegations. A judiciary committee is to hear testimony from his first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. She says Mr Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party in the early 1980s. Not keen on the optics of male senators grilling a possible victim of attempted rape, Republicans are turning over their time to Rachel Mitchell, a sex-crimes prosecutor. They hold a 51-49 majority, but several have said they haven\u2019t made up their minds. Democrats must hold their caucus unanimous\u2014not guaranteed\u2014while picking off waverers. Among the targets are two Republican women and a few rebels. Even two could block Mr Kavanaugh from a lifetime on America\u2019s highest court."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Today America\u2019s Supreme Court wraps up its hearings for the term with a historic test of presidential power. Trump v Hawaii asks whether the president\u2019s third attempt to bar travel from seven countries\u2014five of them overwhelmingly Muslim\u2014satisfies America\u2019s immigration laws and constitution. Opponents say the ban is fuelled by anti-Islam prejudice rather than national-security considerations. Defenders insist presidents should have wide latitude over immigration. A final ruling in the 15-month bicoastal legal battle, which began days after Mr Trump took office, is not expected before June. For the third time, meanwhile, a federal judge has ruled against Mr Trump\u2019s efforts to scrap DACA, a programme that protects an estimated 700,000 immigrants who entered the country as children from deportation. And a decision in another immigration case is due today. The department of homeland security must choose whether to deport some 9,000 Nepalis who were granted temporary protection following a devastating earthquake in 2015."

    "text": "Hello and thanks for looking at this survey. I\u2019m thinking of building a community of people who want to discuss what should be the most important political priorities and values in the 21st century.\n\nSince 1843, The Economist has championed classic liberalism. We do not mean liberal as in any one political party, such as the Democrats in America. We mean it as a worldview founded on liberty and equality. From these principles stem freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, free markets, civil rights, democratic societies, secular governments, gender equality and international cooperation.\n\nMany of these tenets are under threat today, so perhaps it is time to re-think or re-frame them. I\u2019m considering how to host an ongoing discussion about this in a Facebook Group, connected to The Economist\u2019s main Facebook Page. Your answers will help me. Thank you for taking part.\n\n\u2014Adam Smith, audience engagement editor, The Economist"
