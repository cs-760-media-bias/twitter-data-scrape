    "text": "Betsy DeVos defended the Trump administration's planned attack on Special Olympics, and Congress let her have it.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos was slammed by members of Congress for her \"appalling\" plan to completely eliminate federal funding for the Special Olympics.\n\nDeVos appeared before the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday to defend the proposal in Trump's budget, which reiterated the administration's previous threat against the program.\n\n\"You have zeroed out Special Olympics, once again,\" said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA). \"I still can't understand why you would go after disabled children in your budget. You zero that out. It's appalling.\"\n\nIf the Trump administration had its way, Special Olympics would lose the $17.6 million from the federal government that it relies upon.\n\nAfter voters rejected the Trump agenda in last November's election and put Democrats in control of the House, such draconian cuts and policies will not be enacted.\n\nIn her opening testimony, DeVos defended the attack on special needs children, along with proposals for $7 billion in cuts that would hurt millions of children as \"tough but necessary choices.\"\n\nIt's a heartless statement to make coming from an uber-rich woman who is only in her position thanks to her family's lavish donations to the Republican Party and owns a $40 million yacht that flies under a foreign flag so she can avoid paying taxes on it.\n\nDeVos has no qualifications to be education secretary, and her tenure has reflected that. Her nomination was so unpopular that every Democrat in the Senate voted against her, as did two Republicans. Mike Pence had to break the tie, a first for a Cabinet official.\n\nTwo years later, DeVos continues to stumble through hearings, showing that she still hasn't learned the details of her vital position.\n\nIn an exchange Tuesday with Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), DeVos was unable to say how many children would be affected by the attack on Special Olympics.\n\n\"It's 272,000 kids that are affected,\" Pocan informed her.\n\nStill defending the cuts, DeVos was dismissive and said Special Olympics could be supported \"by the philanthropic sector.\"\n\n\"Shame on you. This is your watch,\" committee chair Rep. Rose DeLauro (D-CT) said, addressing DeVos' role in Trump's budget process. The congresswoman also decried the Trump budget as \"cruel\" and \"reckless.\"\n\nDeVos also defended transferring money to educationally dubious charter schools, a longtime conservative project. She also refused to say that schools shouldn't be allowed to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nAiming at Special Olympics is perfectly in tune with Trump's distorted values. Trump infamously mocked a disabled reporter during his 2016 campaign for the presidency.\n\nDeVos is the embodiment of Trump's callous, reckless, and inept approach \u2014 and average citizens are on the receiving end of their missteps.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "It's both pointless and dangerous.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are trying yet again to push an unnecessary, dangerous bill that threatens doctors with jail time for no good reason.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) told reporters Monday that next week he plans to use a rare parliamentary procedure to force the Democratic-controlled House to vote on an abortion restriction that doesn't have enough votes to pass Congress \u2014 but that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy vows the GOP will push \"again, and again, and again,\" just to try to make women's health supporters look bad.\n\nThe GOP-led Senate tried and failed to pass the same bill in February, and pushed it for the same cynical reasons as House Republicans.\n\n\"For all the Democrats who ran saying they were pro-life, this is going to be the true test,\" Scalise said \u2014 failing to mention that there are only a handful of Democrats in Congress left who both personally oppose abortion and are willing to vote to restrict it.\n\nRepublicans are trying to claim that the bill, which has been repeatedly introduced and shot down in Congress over the years, is a commonsense measure to protect infants.\n\nIn reality, however, it's a deeply cynical, unnecessary law that would expose innocent doctors to criminal charges \u2014 and up to five years in prison \u2014 even if they are exercising their best medical judgment and working in the best interests of their patients.\n\nThe bill, called the \"Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,\" promotes an ugly right-wing myth that demonizes doctors by falsely claiming that infants are frequently \"born alive\" and then murdered after botched abortions. It threatens doctors with up to five years in jail if they fail to take this theoretical infant to a hospital \u2014 even if it is not viable and has no chance of surviving.\n\nIt's already illegal to kill or deny appropriate medical care to a newborn; that's called infanticide.\n\nBut Scalise's bill isn't just redundant; it's also dangerous. It would impose unclear and uncertain regulations that could force doctors to act against their best medical judgment.\n\nIt could also force women in heartbreaking situations, like women who need an abortion very late in pregnancy due to a deadly fetal anomaly, to endure even more trauma for no reason.\n\n\"If you're a medical provider, this bill would supersede your years of medical training and your oath to deliver the best possible medical treatment to your patients,\" Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) said when the Senate debated the same bill. \"It would apply a one-size-fits-all set of requirements that do not reflect the reality that every pregnancy is different. And it would subject you to criminal penalties if you choose to let medical standards, not politics, drive the care you offer your patient.\"\n\nRepublicans have been dangerously escalating their anti-abortion rhetoric for years. It's gotten so absurd that GOP leaders, all the way up to Trump and Mike Pence, argue with a straight face that Democrats actually endorse infanticide.\n\nIt's the same dangerous lie that inspired Scalise's bill, and it's also the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that inspires anti-abortion extremists to murder doctors and patients.\n\nAnd it's now the GOP party line.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's attorney general is making sure the American people will never know the truth.\n\nAfter special counsel Robert Mueller finished his report last week, Democrats warned that Trump's cronies would scheme to conceal the full results of the investigation from the American people.\n\nThey were right.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Trump's attorney general, William Barr, said he will allow Trump to review Mueller's final report before Congress or the public can see it. The news was shared by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), one of Trump's staunchest supporters in Congress.\n\nGraham said Barr intends to give the Trump White House the opportunity to preview the report and claim executive privilege on any parts they want to keep hidden. These are exactly the kinds of shady tactics Democratic leaders warned about when Mueller announced he completed his report.\n\n\"Now that Special Counsel Mueller has submitted his report to the Attorney General, it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement on Friday. They added that \"the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.\"\n\nOn Monday night, congressional leaders demanded the full, uncensored report from the Department of Justice by April 2. Some members were already frustrated by the four-page summary Barr sent to Congress. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) called it an \"elaborate public relations ploy\" that was \"purged and sanitized of any facts and details.\"\n\nNow Barr wants to let the White House further censor and sanitize what the public sees. Trump has repeatedly lied about Barr's summary of the report, which has been made public, falsely claiming the Mueller report exonerates him. In fact, one of the few quotes from the Mueller report in Barr's letter specifically says that Mueller did not exonerate Trump on the issue of obstruction of justice.\n\nNow Barr is giving Trump the opportunity to hide whatever evidence Mueller gathered that suggested Trump might have obstructed justice and prevented Mueller from exonerating him on this issue.\n\nBarr was opposed to the Mueller investigation from the beginning. Long before he was tapped for his current role, he sent a lengthy unsolicited memo to the Justice Department explaining why he believed the investigation was unjustified and that Trump should not be investigated for obstruction.\n\nNow, as attorney general, Barr is essentially ensuring that the American people will never know the full results of that investigation.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Yet somehow, Trump thinks it's a good idea to try one more time \u2014 even as yet another poll indicates that Americans don't want him to.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, less than 24 hours after his lawyers announced they wanted to completely eliminate the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Trump bragged that Republicans \"will become 'The Party of Healthcare!'\"\n\nBut in a Monday court filing, Trump's Department of Justice announced that it advocates striking down the entire ACA. If this happens and Trump gets his wish, 30 million people stand to lose access to health care. Millions more would lose protections for pre-existing conditions, one of the ACA's most popular mandates. And 1.2 million people could lose their jobs.\n\nNo wonder a new poll shows once again that Americans don't want Trump and Republicans to scrap the ACA. Instead of destroying the current health care system, voters want to improve it \u2014 which the new Democratic majority in the House is committed to doing.\n\nA majority of voters (55 percent) want to improve the current health care system, while fewer than 1 in 3 voters want to replace it, according to a new Quinnipiac poll released on Tuesday.\n\nEven among Republicans, 49 percent want the nation's health care system improved, compared to 36 percent who want it replaced.\n\nThe Trump administration is trying to use the courts to do what Republicans in Congress tried but failed to accomplish.\n\nThroughout 2017 and 2018, Republicans repeatedly tried to weaken and eliminate the ACA, including provisions protecting people with pre-existing conditions. When the House of Representatives passed one such measure, Trump and Republicans gloated in a Rose Garden celebration.\n\nUltimately, however, Republicans failed in their efforts to take health care away from millions when the Senate rejected the measure.\n\nTrump's actions in court are sure to bring health care back into the headlines \u2014and polling shows he and Republicans are on the wrong side of the issue.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, health care was one of the biggest issues on voters' minds, and Democrats made historic gains in the House of Representatives. At the time, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll showed voters overwhelmingly trusted Democrats over Republicans on health care issues.\n\nNear the end of the campaign, Republican candidates and Trump made a last-ditch effort by lying to voters about their position on health care and pre-existing conditions. But voters saw through the act, and sent an overwhelming rebuke to Republicans who tried to sabotage health care.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Democrats announced a plan to strengthen and improve the ACA. The new legislation would focus on protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and improve the current law to help lower health insurance premiums for families.\n\nIt's clear that voters reject the GOP's destructive, nonsensical ideas about health care \u2014 yet Trump and Republicans keep trying the same failed strategy.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A radical new abortion ban puts every pregnant woman in danger.\n\nGeorgia Republicans are trying to force through a ban on abortion that's so extreme, it could land you in jail for having a miscarriage.\n\nFirst of all, the bill would ban abortion before most women know they're pregnant \u2014 around six weeks \u2014 which means women would have only a week or two after a missed period to seek an abortion. The only exceptions are for rape or incest, if the traumatized victim manages to go through the rigamarole of filing a police report.\n\nIt gets even worse. Because of the way Georgia law is already written, women seeking an abortion after that point, and doctors who perform the procedure, could be thrown in jail for up to ten years.\n\nAnd because an abortion is often medically identical to a miscarriage, making women criminals for having an abortion also means exposing women who have miscarriages to legal investigation and prosecution.\n\nThe radical bill has passed the state Senate with amendments and is awaiting another vote in the state House. It's likely to be signed by Gov. Brian Kemp (who narrowly defeated pro-choice Democrat Stacey Abrams in the 2018 governor's race, amid a cloud of scandal over anti-black voter suppression).\n\nState Sen. Jen Jordan (D-Atlanta) blasted her Republican colleagues' callous move in a powerful speech on Friday, during which she disclosed that she had suffered eight miscarriages.\n\n\"Yes, I am talking about stuff I don't want to talk about in this chamber, but let me tell you something,\" Jordan said. \"If you're going to get into the most private areas where women are, then you're going to have to listen to it.\"\n\nAnd Jordan, who is also a lawyer, pointed out the chilling reason that her personal story about miscarriages is relevant to the debate over an abortion ban:\n\nAny woman who suffers a miscarriage could be subject to scrutiny regarding whether or not she intentionally acted to cause that miscarriage. She would be at risk of a criminal indictment for virtually any perceived self-destructive behavior during pregnancy which could cause miscarriage, to wit: Smoking, drinking, using drugs, using legal medications; driving while under the influence, or any other dangerous or reckless conduct. And taken to its extreme, prohibitions during pregnancy could also include the failure to act, such as the failure to secure adequate prenatal medical care. Any issue of whether a woman who has participated in this risky behavior intended to cause her subsequent miscarriage \u2014 as a lawyer, I can tell you \u2014 would be a jury question. In other words, a pregnant woman who suffers a miscarriage could be subjected to criminal investigation, indictment, prosecution long before a jury is asked to determine whether she intentionally did anything to cause the loss.\n\nBecause it's not always clear whether a pregnancy loss is due to a spontaneous miscarriage or a self-managed abortion, women actually do get arrested for miscarriage in America, today, when abortion is supposedly legal.\n\nFor instance, if your nosy friend hears about your miscarriage and suspects you really took abortion pills, she could call the police, and you could get arrested and prosecuted if your state criminalizes abortion outside of a clinical setting. Even you're acquitted later, an arrest typically means at least some jail time, and a potentially nightmarish and expensive legal ordeal.\n\nThe new Georgia bill exposes every woman over six weeks pregnant to this threat. And it also sneaks radical new language into state law that defines a fertilized egg as a person \u2014 which makes jailing women for miscarriage more likely.\n\nIn states like Texas, fetal \"personhood\" language like this has been used to prosecute pregnant women \u2014 including those who aren't seeking an abortion, and even those who are still pregnant and didn't miscarry \u2014 because they allegedly took illegal drugs or did something else that could have endangered their wanted pregnancies. This happens even though Texas law is supposed to protect pregnant women themselves from being prosecuted for crimes like \"fetal homicide.\"\n\nJordan also pointed out that the justification for the new Georgia law, banning abortion after a fetus has a \"heartbeat,\" is a cruel misnomer.\n\n\"At the earliest stages of pregnancy, certain embryonic cardiac activity can be detected with a transvaginal ultrasound,\" she said. \"I don't think any of the men that spoke today have ever had a transvaginal ultrasound. I have. And it is not pleasant.\"\n\n\"I have laid on the cold examination table while a doctor desperately looked for a \u2018heartbeat,\u2019\" Jordan said. \"I have been escorted out the back door of my physician\u2019s office so as not to upset the other pregnant women in the waiting area, my grief on full display and uncontainable. \u2026 It is not for the government or the men of this chamber to insert itself in the most personal, private, and wrenching decisions that women make every single day.\"\n\nThe only thing stopping Georgia from criminalizing pregnant women is the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion in Roe v. Wade. The Georgia law would probably be immediately blocked by courts after it gets signed because it's unconstitutional under Roe, just as similar laws in other states have been blocked for the same reason.\n\nThe only thing stopping this is the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion in Roe v. Wade. The Georgia law would probably be immediately blocked by courts after it gets signed because it's unconstitutional under Roe, just as similar laws in other states have been blocked for the same reason.\n\nBut if Roe were to be overturned, these laws would go into effect. And even if Roe stays in place, laws like Georgia's could still send pregnant women to jail.\n\nThis kind of thing already happens more than we'd like to think in America.\n\nBetween 1973 and 2005 \u2014 after abortion was supposedly legalized under Roe v. Wade \u2014 researchers have documented 413 cases in which women were arrested, prosecuted, jailed, or given a forced medical intervention because law enforcement officials thought a woman was endangering her pregnancy or had attempted to give herself an abortion. This included women who had tried and failed to commit suicide while pregnant.\n\nAnd just since 2005, another 600 or more such cases have been found \u2014 largely thanks to draconian new state laws like Georgia's.\n\nWomen's rights have been under attack by Republicans for a long time, but the damage already done is worse than most people realize. And now GOP lawmakers are trying to make that nightmare a reality for even more women.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The NRA was giving the Australian group guidance on how to fight efforts to enact gun safety laws.\n\n\"Just shame them to the whole idea,\" NRA public relations official Lars Dalseide said, discussing the rhetoric that should be used against citizens pushing gun laws after a shooting. He told them to say, \"If your policy, isn't good enough to stand on itself, how dare you use their deaths to push that forward. How dare you stand on the graves of those children to put forward your political agenda?\"\n\nThe NRA has used similar techniques after mass shootings in America, such as the Sandy Hook School massacre and the Parkland mass shooting. Aided by its allies within the Republican Party, the NRA has repeatedly insisted that the death of innocents during such shootings not be invoked to advocate for gun reform.\n\nImmediately after a shooting, NRA media liaison officer Catherine Mortensen told One Nation to \"say nothing,\" conceding that gun groups like hers often are at their weakest when a shooting is fresh in people's minds.\n\nAfter American shootings the NRA usually goes silent, declining to make posts to social media and lowering its profile in the media in general.\n\nThe NRA also revealed its strategy of secretly writing opinion columns on behalf of people, designed to give the appearance of more support for the pro-gun position.\n\n\"A lot of the times, we'll write them for like a local sheriff in Wisconsin or whatever. And he'll draft it or she will help us draft it,\" Mortensen explained. \"We'll help them, and they'll submit it with their name on it so that it looks organic. You know, that it's coming from that community. But we will have a role behind the scenes.\"\n\nThe NRA also advised the Australians to hire reporters to \"print up stories\" about crime victims \"that could have been helped had they had a gun,\" and to produce videos for social media with pro-gun messages so \"they kind of get you outraged.\"\n\n\"We call it like 'the outrage of the week',\" Mortensen bragged.\n\nThe NRA playbook revealed in the video has been used time and time again as the organization's response to gun violence. Combined with their financial support for the Republican Party and through in-house propaganda, the NRA has worked to oppose efforts to protect citizens, even young children.\n\nBut voters have begun to push back against them. Teenage survivors of the Parkland shootings rallied at last year's March for Our Lives and in the fall millions of Americans voted against the NRA's slate of candidates, electing Democrats who have vowed to push gun safety.\n\nDemocrats in the House recently passed two gun-safety bills after years of Republican opposition, and while Senate Republicans beholden to the NRA continue to hold them up, the momentum is against gun extremism.\n\nThe video reveals the craven opportunism of the NRA and their pleasure and zeal in lying and deceiving while innocents are killed. The NRA's agenda enables mass death but their hold on power is fading.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Robert Neller noted that Trump's fake border crisis and national emergency declaration created an \"unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and solvency.\"\n\nInstead of Marines participating in training exercises, funding was siphoned off to Trump's wasteful wall.\n\nThe further \"theft\" of funds, as the senators put it, continues Trump's strategy of hurting the troops for a wall the country doesn't need and has repeatedly said it doesn't want.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Rep. Jamie Raskin slammed Attorney General Barr's Mueller report summary as 'an elaborate public relations ploy.'\n\nAfter a 22-month investigation, Congress will settle for nothing less than the full, unredacted Mueller report.\n\nOn Monday, the chairs of six House committees sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr calling his four-page summary \"not sufficient\" and demanding the full Mueller report and all underlying evidence be delivered to Congress no later than April 2.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, very few people know what is in the full report submitted by special counsel Robert Mueller. The only information publicly available is a brief letter that Barr, Trump's hand-picked attorney general, sent to Congress over the weekend. In the letter, even Barr admits that Mueller did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice charges.\n\nIn the demand letter to Barr, top Democrats remind him that the House voted unanimously to call for the full, public release of the Mueller report. The letter, from the chairs of the Oversight, Intelligence, Judiciary, Financial Services, Ways and Means, and Foreign Affairs Committees, notes that Congress needs to \"make an independent assessment of the evidence regarding obstruction of justice.\"\n\n\"We don't want to read the CliffsNotes to Macbeth. We want to read Macbeth itself,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) told Shareblue Media. It is unlikely Raskin selected Macbeth \u2014 a Shakespearean tragedy describing an unstable ruler's quest for unbridled power \u2014 by accident.\n\nA member of both the Oversight and Judiciary committees, Raskin said the entire episode \"smells of a whitewash.\" He slammed Barr for engaging in an \"elaborate public relations ploy\" by sending a letter \"purged and sanitized of any facts and details.\"\n\nIn his letter to Congress, Barr declared \u2014 without providing any evidence to support his conclusion \u2014 that Trump would not face charges from the Justice Department related to obstruction of justice.\n\nCongress needs to make its own assessment because Barr is \"perhaps the single most biased person in the country\" to make such a determination, according to Raskin. Before he became attorney general, Barr wrote a 20-page missive declaring his belief that no president could be brought up on charges of obstruction of justice.\n\nAnd less than 48 hours after receiving the Mueller report, Barr adamantly declared that the conclusion he came to months ago is the same conclusion he has today.\n\n\"The cake was baked from the beginning,\" Raskin says.\n\nTrump has already lied about what little we know about the Mueller report. Congress has no way to know what, if anything, Barr is hiding without seeing the full report and every piece of evidence Mueller examined.\n\n\"We've gotta see the facts,\" Raskin added.\n\nThe Department of Justice is on notice and has until April 2 to get Raskin and the rest of Congress the full report and all the facts.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

At the same event, Abraham falsely claimed that the expansion of Medicaid to the state \"mandated\" that people drop their private insurance plans.\n\nAbraham's comments, which were made behind closed doors amongst allies and supporters, betray the truth behind Republican actions. Instead of viewing Americans depending on Medicaid for health care as citizens facing hardship who need help, Abraham attacked them for \"voting for a living\" instead of working.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation found in a study that Medicaid expansion led to \"sharp declines in uninsured rates among the low-income population\" and \"significant coverage gains\" for families, especially poor ones.\n\nEven conservative states who opposed expansion have begun to change their position after voters demanded they do so.\n\nLike most Republicans, Abraham has been a longtime opponent of Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion that has been key to the program expanding health care access to millions of Americans.\n\nHe voted along with the majority of Republicans in the House in 2017 to repeal the program, which would have led to 24 million Americans losing coverage, including for some pre-existing conditions.\n\nLast November millions of Americans punished Abraham's party for their cruel approach and put Democrats back in control of the House.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly opposed health care reform, standing up against Obamacare's passage, challenging it in court and pushing to repeal it in Congress.

    "text": "Trump's Department of Justice wants the entire Affordable Care Act overturned.\n\nThe Trump administration really wants to take health care away from millions of people.\n\nTrump's 2020 budget proposal called for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but now, thanks to the Department of Justice, he may not even have to wait for a budget to pass.\n\nLate last year, in a ruling that even conservatives called \"embarrassingly bad,\" an activist federal judge in Texas struck down the entirety of the ACA. He threw out the whole law because Congress repealed one part of the law, the tax penalty. He reasoned that because one provision was repealed, the entire law was null and void \u2014 even though Congress could have repealed the whole law and didn't.\n\nUnder Jeff Sessions, the DOJ had only argued that certain portions of the law, including protections for pre-existing conditions, should be struck down. Now, under William Barr, the department is calling for the entire law to be repealed. They did this with no fanfare, filing a four-line letter with the appellate court overseeing the appeal in the case.\n\nMake no mistake, though. If the DOJ prevails, the results for Americans would be devastating. Nearly 52 million people with pre-existing conditions were already put at risk when the administration began to tell courts that they could strike down the provision requiring coverage of those conditions. Nearly 30 million people will lose their healthcare coverage if the ACA is repealed.\n\nPart of what makes this so appalling is that it runs counter to what the DOJ is obliged to do. Even Jeff Sessions noted that the \"Executive Branch has a longstanding tradition of defending the constitutionality of duly enacted statutes if reasonable arguments can be made in their defense.\"\n\nHere, under Barr, the DOJ is entirely abandoning that principle. The DOJ's letter to the Fifth Circuit makes no mention of that longstanding tradition, nor does it explain why it is critical for the DOJ to depart from it in this instance.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, when it came to the issue of healthcare, Americans voted overwhelmingly in favor of Democrats. Exit polls showed health care was the most important issue to 41 percent of American voters. But the Trump administration doesn't care about the will of the voters. Attacking the ACA via the courts allows them to ignore the results of elections entirely.\n\nThe administration's behavior makes it even more imperative that Democrats organize around healthcare issues and show up in 2020. Getting Trump out of the office is the only way this is going to stop.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Mitch McConnell (R-KY) doesn't want Americans to be able to read the Mueller report.\n\nOn Monday, he blocked Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) nonbinding resolution that called for Mueller's report to be made public. As Schumer said on Twitter, what are they trying to hide?\n\nMcConnell's not shy about making bad-faith arguments when it comes to the Mueller report. He believes that the public shouldn't get to see the report any time soon because the president had to wait two years for the investigation to complete and \"it's not unreasonable to give the special counsel and the Justice Department just a little time to complete their review in a professional and responsible manner.\"\n\nThat argument might hold water but for the fact that Trump's attorney general, William Barr, only took 48 hours to review 22 months of work in order to determine that Trump should not be charged with obstruction of justice.\n\nIf Barr can review all of that material and come to a complicated legal decision so swiftly, then surely he's able to release the entire report equally swiftly.\n\nIn a surprise to no one, McConnell is also trying to say that Russian interference is Obama's fault. He went on the floor today to fault Obama's administration for being \"apparently insufficiently prepared to anticipate & counter Russian threats.\"\n\nThis is rich, even coming from Mitch, who refused to agree even to sign a statement condemning Russian interference back in 2016. And when Congress did finally let state election officials know about cybersecurity concerns, McConnell made sure that the language was \"dramatically watered down.\"\n\nNow, though, McConnell finally seems to think that the Russians interfering with American elections is problematic. After Barr's letter on Sunday, he said that Russia does pose a threat, but he wouldn't go so far as to say that his party will actually do something to stop them from interfering again in 2020.\n\nMcConnell has always gone out of his way to make sure the GOP and Trump remain in power. He'll do whatever it takes, including making sure the Mueller report never sees the light of day, to keep propping up Trump.\n\nLuckily, McConnell doesn't control both bodies of Congress. Over in the House, the chairs of six different committees have called for the full report to be provided to them no later than April 2, and there's no way Mitch can stop them, much as he might want to do so.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

In fact, cars might cost thousands more for American consumers under the terms of the Trump-negotiated trade deal with Canada and Mexico.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nEconomists who examined the text of the trade deal say that even if it helps the overall U.S. economy, the impact will likely be \"tiny,\" Politico reported on Monday. And some economists say there is a good chance it will hurt the American economy.\n\nA congressional report of the deal by the International Trade Commission (ITC) is due in the next few weeks, and the outcome could be worrisome.\n\nThe analysis \"is likely to show a negative number\" in terms of the deal's impact on growth, Dan Pearson told Politico. Pearson spent a decade working on the ITC, beginning in 2013.\n\n\"If you tasked me with trying to show this would be a significant boost to growth, it would be really hard to do,\" Philip Levy, a trade official who worked for George W. Bush, told Politico.\n\nUnfortunately, harm from the deal is easy to find.\n\nIn a 2018 analysis, the Center for Automotive Research says the deal, known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, will hurt the auto industry in the United States. Their analysis shows the deal will create tariffs that essentially put up to a $3.2 billion tax on American families. What that means for consumers is that cars could cost up to $2,200 more.\n\nTrump has repeatedly bragged about scrapping the Clinton-era North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and negotiating a new agreement with Canada and Mexico. He falsely claimed it was the largest trade deal ever made, and declared the new agreement, \"changes the trade landscape forever\" and will lead to booming economic growth.\n\nIn December 2018, Levy told the Associated Press that Trump \"has seriously overhyped this agreement.\"\n\nThe USMCA was signed by the leaders of the United States, Mexico, and Canada in November 2018, but needs approval by Congress (and the legislatures in Canada and Mexico) before it goes into effect. But the fact that the agreement is not yet law has not stopped Trump from pretending it is.\n\nIn mid-March, Trump falsely claimed an announcement by Toyota was proof that the \"USMCA is already fixing the broken NAFTA deal.\"\n\nTrump's statement is sadly unsurprising. Janet Yellen, former chair of the Federal Reserve, recently told a reporter that she doesn't think Trump understands how the global economy works, especially international trade.\n\nTrump may indeed change the landscape, but in doing so, he might make cars more expensive for American families.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

All six people have made comments about Trump and Russia that the Trump team disagrees with.\n\nTim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump campaign, claims in the memo that Brennan, DNC Chair Tom Perez, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Eric Swalwell (D-CA), have all made \"outlandish, false claims\" about the likelihood that Trump or members of his campaign colluded with Russia on its election-meddling.\n\nMurtaugh then begs producers to \"employ basic journalistic standards\" when considering whether these members of Trump's enemies list \"warrant further appearances\" \u2014 or, in other words, to never book them again. If producers do decide to book them, Murtaugh begs that anchors at least \"challenge them to provide the evidence which prompted them to make the wild claims in the first place.\"\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here.\n\nFirst of all, Trump is routinely represented on TV by serial liars like Kellyanne Conway, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Rudy Giuliani. Even if the claims about Trump critics lying were true, it would take a lot of chutzpah for the Trump campaign to try to take the high road on facts and truth on cable news.\n\nBut more to the point, the claims about lying aren't true.\n\nThe Trump campaign, like the Trump White House, is promoting the bogus idea that the Mueller report has completely exonerated Trump \u2014 even though almost no one, including the White House, has gotten the chance to read that report in full.\n\nThe only thing made public so far is a four-page summary of Mueller's report that is written by a biased source: William Barr, Trump's hand-picked attorney general.\n\nAnd even that likely skewed summary included a quote from the Mueller report making clear that the report \"does not exonerate\" Trump on the question of obstruction of justice.\n\nIt's true that Barr's report also says the Mueller report \"did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"\n\nBut we don't know what else the Mueller report said about the Trump campaign's dealings with Russia. And being unable to \"establish\" collusion beyond a reasonable doubt is not the same thing as saying there was no evidence for it.\n\nThat's what the six people on the Trump campaign's list were talking about: evidence of collusion. And there's plenty of that \u2014 both in public reports, and potentially as part of investigations still being conducted by Congress.\n\nIt's hard to say whether the Trump campaign's stunt is more pathetic, or more scary. It's a chilling attempt to stifle freedom of the press, but it's also a flatly absurd gambit from a group of serial liars.\n\nIn other words, it's typical Trump behavior.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Attorney General William Barr issued a letter summarizing the Mueller report and hastily clearing Trump. The House isn't going to let that stand.\n\nOn Sunday. Trump's handpicked attorney general William Barr released a letter outlining his review of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. The letter contains very little from Mueller, but a great deal of spin from Barr. While the White House tries to paint this as a victory, the House will be working on getting to the truth.\n\nIt's impossible to make any judgments about the actual report, as Barr's letter contains only five very brief quotations from the report itself. Instead, the letter is mostly Barr's discussion of the report. And where the obstruction of justice question is concerned, the letter is nothing but Barr's conclusions.\n\nRather than make a prosecutorial decision, Barr noted, the special counsel laid out evidence both in favor of and opposed to the conclusion that Trump obstructed justice. However, in one of the very few quotations Barr provided from the actual report, Mueller stated: \"While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\" That's a strong statement, but it is one that Barr chose to entirely ignore.\n\nWilliam Barr was chosen by Trump precisely because he wrote an unsolicited memo to the DOJ explaining why Trump shouldn't be investigated for obstruction and wrote op-eds saying the DOJ should investigate Hillary Clinton instead. During his confirmation hearing, he freely admitted he might hide the Mueller report from the public. It's therefore no surprise that he took only 2 days to review 22 months of Mueller's work and decide that there was insufficient evidence to conclude Trump committed obstruction.\n\nNow that Democrats control the House, Barr's attempt at whitewashing Trump's conduct won't stand.\n\nA joint statement from House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chair Adam B. Schiff, and Committee on Oversight and Reform Chair Elijah E. Cummings called Barr out for his hasty decision:\n\nIt is unacceptable that, after Special Counsel Mueller spent 22 months meticulously uncovering this evidence, Attorney General Barr made a decision not to charge the President in under 48 hours. The Attorney General did so without even interviewing the President.\n\nThe crime of obstruction requires a finding of \"corrupt intent\" \u2014 a determination about Trump's mindset when he took certain actions, such as firing James Comey. Did Trump intend, in that moment, to prevent an investigation into Michael Flynn? Did Trump dangle a pardon in front of Michael Cohen in the hopes Cohen would not flip? These are things that can only be answered by interviewing Trump.\n\nBecause Barr cleared Trump in such a swift and slapdash fashion, Nadler is now planning on having Barr testify before the House Judiciary Committee. Nadler, Schiff, and Cummings' joint statement notes that Barr's interpretation of the facts uncovered by Mueller may very well be partisan, and the \"shortcomings in today's letter are the very reason our nation has a system of separation of powers.\"\n\nWilliam Barr is providing cover for Trump. Under Republican control, the House did too. But those days are over, and Barr will now be forced to explain his actions. It's about time.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Katie Hill (D-CA), vice-chair of the House Oversight Committee, said in a Monday CNN interview that Congress will not back down from its many investigations into Trump's shady activities \u2014 including \"highly suspicious\" activity that went beyond the scope of Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"We have evidence over the last two years that the Mueller investigation was not covering that is highly, highly suspicious,\" Hill said.\n\nHill said Democrats in Congress are looking into the \"security clearances issue, we're dealing with possibly giving nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, we're dealing with ... thousands of children that haven't been reunited with their families.\"\n\n\"It's so many issues that we have to continue our investigations on, and it's just not related to the Mueller report,\" she added.\n\nOver the weekend, Attorney General William Barr released his own spin on the Mueller report, but refuses to release the report itself in its entirety. Yet even Barr's biased summary of the Mueller report includes Mueller's conclusion that the report \"does not exonerate\" Trump on allegations of obstruction of justice.\n\nAs Hill noted, however, Mueller's investigation was limited in scope, and Trump's alleged criminal activity has not stopped since he was sworn into office.\n\nTrump reportedly gave his daughter and son-in-law top security clearances over the objections of intelligence agencies and his own White House counsel. Congress needs to know if and how seriously Trump's nepotism endangered U.S. national security.\n\nHill also noted the Trump administration may have ignored national security concerns in a rush to hand over nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia. New evidence shows Trump officials may have discussed the issue using personal email, not their secure government accounts.\n\nBeyond the numerous investigations being conducted by the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), chair of the Judiciary Committee, has sent out letters to more than 80 individuals and entities demanding documents related to Trump's potential obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and corruption.\n\nThus far, Nadler has received tens of thousands of documents as part of his far-reaching investigation.\n\nAnd Congress isn't the only branch of government investigating Trump. A number of federal prosecutors and state offices are investigating Trump, his family, his businesses, his foundation, and his inaugural committee for a number of potential crimes.\n\nAt this year's State of the Union address, Trump tried to threaten Congress out of investigating him and his corrupt administration. But the new Democratic majority refuses to back down.\n\n\"We will not be bullied by the president of the United States,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), chair of the House Democrats, said at the time.\n\nHill's comments Monday morning show once again that Democrats will not be intimidated, and will keep working to uncover the truth.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "'It's hard for me to say even what my role will be there,' Trump nominee Stephen Moore said.\n\nTrump's pick to sit on the vitally important Federal Reserve says he doesn't understand what the job is.\n\n\"I'm kind of new to this game, frankly, so I'm going to be on a steep learning curve myself about how the Fed operates, how the Federal Reserve makes its decisions.\" Stephen Moore told Bloomberg on Friday.\n\n\"It's hard for me to say even what my role will be there, assuming I get confirmed,\" he added.\n\nThis is a man who Trump wants to exert a major influence over economic policy that will affect the lives of billions around the world.\n\nMoore is a cable news regular best known for spouting crackpot economic theories. He is a fellow at the right-wing Heritage Foundation and founded the Club for Growth, which incessantly advocates for lower taxes for the uber-wealthy.\n\nEven in the world of conservative economics, which is extremely tolerant of poor economic ideas, his nomination to the Federal Reserve is being questioned and opposed.\n\n\"He does not have the intellectual gravitas for this important job,\" said Greg Mankiw, who served as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush. \"It is time for senators to do their job. Mr. Moore should not be confirmed.\"\n\nEconomists have blasted the nomination, the latest in Trump's seemingly never-ending parade of picks for key positions based on his television-watching habits.\n\n\"Detestable\" is how Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, described the Moore nomination to Bloomberg. Dutta pointed out that in 2011 Republicans opposed President Barack Obama's nomination of Nobel Prize-winning economist Peter Diamond, but now a crank like Moore \"has a plausible path to confirmation.\"\n\nMoore has pushed ideas like calling unemployment insurance \"paid vacation,\" among his wackier ideas and comments. In the recent past he whined about a \"hate-the-rich mentality\" and described the Democratic Party as \"the party of greed and envy\" because they favor economic policies that support the middle class.\n\nLike Trump he also harbors racist attitudes, lamenting in December about children in \"inner city\" schools who are \"beaten up by other black students.\"\n\nIn Moore, Trump picked someone who appeared before him on television, spouting nonsense and absurdities. Even his fellow conservatives consider him a ridiculous choice and even Moore admits he doesn't know what the job even entails.\n\nIn so many ways, he is the perfect pick for Trump's disastrous approach to everything.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump -- not Russians,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-SC).\n\n\"It was not 'Russians' who elected Donald Trump \u2014 it was the 63 million Americans who voted for him,\" Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said in a statement.\n\n\"The Trump Administration can now focus on implementing the America first policies President Trump campaigned and won on fair and square,\" said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL).\n\nTheir statements echo Putin's official stance.\n\n\"Our country has not interfered in the domestic affairs of other countries, including the United States,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday.\n\n\"All of the accusations were proved to be trumped up,\" wrote Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the Russian senate's information committee.\n\nPutin has long maintained, with Trump's help, that the Russian government didn't meddle in the election.\n\nPutin, Trump, and congressional Republicans stand on the opposite side of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, who investigated Russia's activities before the 2016 election. They concluded that Russia was attempting to sway the race's results in favor of Trump, who they viewed would be softer on them than Sec. Hillary Clinton.\n\nEven the summary offered by Barr \u2014 despite its flaws and conclusions based on material Americans have not seen \u2014 makes the case that Russia pushed for a Trump victory by clandestine means.\n\n\"The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts,\" Barr states in his summary.\n\nBarr's letter also notes that Mueller \"determined that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.\"\n\nOne effort was to \"conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election.\" The second was \"the Russian government's efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election.\"\n\nAccording to Barr's summary, the special counsel concluded that \"Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks.\"\n\nIn their zeal to side with Trump and defend his compromised presidency, Republicans in Congress are more than willing to denigrate the work of American law enforcement and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Putin.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Mueller report is only the beginning.\n\nThe conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is far from the end of Trump's legal worries.\n\nWhile Trump's attorney general is declining to prosecute Trump or pursue evidence that he committed crimes, that's not the case for other law enforcement officials in Trump's Department of Justice. Federal prosecutors from New York to Los Angeles are still conducting about a dozen investigations into Trump, his family, his businesses, and his activities.\n\nSome of the highest-profile investigations come from the Southern District of New York (SDNY), stemming from the prosecution of Trump's longtime lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen. The SDNY already indicated that Trump committed multiple felonies during the 2016 election when he ordered Cohen to illegally pay hush money to multiple alleged mistresses in order to buy their silence.\n\nCohen was sentenced to three years in prison for his part in these and other crimes.\n\n\"The important thing to remember is that almost everything Donald Trump did was in the Southern District of New York,\" John Martin Jr., a retired federal judge who served as an SDNY attorney during the Carter and Reagan administrations, told the New York Times. \"He ran his business in the Southern District. He ran his campaign from the Southern District.\"\n\nAccording to the Times, the SDNY is also looking into the role the Trump Organization and its executives played in the hush money scheme, as well as possible irregularities with insurance claims.\n\nSDNY investigators, as well as federal prosecutors in Los Angeles, are also looking into irregularities in donations to Trump's inaugural committee, including the possibility that Trump's team illegally accepted donations from foreign nationals.\n\nIn Virginia, federal prosecutors are gearing up for the trial of Trump's longtime adviser, Roger Stone, who was charged by Mueller's team for a variety of crimes.\n\nAlong with federal prosecutors, state agencies are also looking into Trump and his gang of shady associates. The state of New York recently charged Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, with a variety of state crimes related to mortgage fraud. Manafort was recently sentenced to more than seven years in prison for a number of crimes.\n\nNew York state is also looking into the Trump Foundation for a litany of allegations, including civil inquiries into whether the company violated tax laws.\n\nAll in all, the Times concludes that there are about a dozen investigations that the public knows about \u2014 and the exact number is unknown, due to the secrecy surrounding ongoing investigations.\n\nMueller's investigation didn't lead to an indictment of Trump, but it also did not exonerate Trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice.\n\nThat damning fact might only be the tip of the iceberg. Trump's alleged criminal enterprise is so sprawling that investigators at numerous offices across the country are needed to get to the bottom of it.\n\nTrump's own Department of Justice has already implicated Trump in some felonies \u2014 and there's no telling what else the many other ongoing investigations could reveal.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

While there's still a lot we don't know about the full report, one of the few direct quotes included in Barr's summary made clear that the report \"does not exonerate\" Trump on the question of whether he committed a crime by obstructing justice.\n\nBut you wouldn't know it from listening to Trump, his family members, or his press secretary.\n\n\"No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!\" Trump tweeted on Sunday. (He only tweeted about it once, though, which is pretty mild by Trumpian standards.)\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made an official statement to that effect as well. She falsely claimed that the special counsel \"did not find any obstruction,\" and said that because Trump's hand-picked attorney general refused to prosecute him, that means a \"total and complete exoneration\" of Trump.\n\nThe Trump children decided to tweet about this, too. Don Junior definitely took the oddest tack, tweeting out a picture of him and his Trump super PAC-helming girlfriend, Kim Guilfoyle, and saying: \"Can everybody stop calling us Russian bots for being hot Trump supporters now?\"\n\nIvanka went with a more classic approach, googling to find an Abraham Lincoln quote about truth and slander that she somehow found apt. Eric wants an apology from CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, the New York Times, and the Washington Post.\n\nTrump also gave a brief statement at the airport where he again called the letter a complete and total exoneration \u2014 even though the letter itself literally says that the report \"does not exonerate\" Trump.\n\nAnd even though Trump now wants everyone to take the conclusions of the Mueller report, as filtered through Bill Barr, as gospel, he still attacked the investigation. He faulted the special counsel for \"not looking at the other side\" \u2014 presumably a reference to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats \u2014 and grumbled that the investigation \"began illegally.\"\n\nTrump seems to forget that the Democrats didn't have any hand in creating the special counsel investigation. Trump's deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein \u2014 who Trump himself nominated \u2014 did that.\n\nLater, Trump inexplicably decided the matter warranted yet another statement, taking 15 seconds outside the White House to say, without any context, that America is the greatest place on Earth.\n\nTrump and those who surround him can make as many statements as they want about how the Mueller report exonerates him, but that won't make it true.\n\nAnd the real truth will come to light.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, is set to call Barr to testify about his impossibly speedy decision not to charge Trump, and the House voted 420-0 to make the report public.\n\nTrump shouldn't get too complacent, because more trouble is coming his way.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump claims he has nothing to hide \u2014 so why is he going to such great lengths to make sure no one ever finds out what he discussed with Putin?\n\nThe White House on Thursday rejected a request from House Democrats to turn over documents pertaining to Trump's conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, arguing that such communication is off-limits to Congress, and therefore to the public as well.\n\nIn a letter sent to Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Eliot Engel (D-NY), and Adam Schiff (D-CA), White House counsel Pat Cipollone cited executive authority as his rationale for refusing to divulge any information about Trump's talks with foreign leaders, including Putin.\n\nBut the White House didn't just reject this specific document request \u2014 it also laid out an argument claiming that any presidential communication related to the \"conduct of foreign affairs\" is not subject to congressional oversight, and that no one can compel the White House to release any information pertaining to such communication.\n\n\"[S]ince the Founding, the Executive Branch has correctly and successfully asserted that information concerning the conduct of foreign affairs is, constitutionally, within the exclusive control of the Executive Branch and Congress cannot demand its disclosure,\" Cipollone wrote.\n\nHe also contended that \"the law does not require the Executive Branch to provide Congress with documents relating to confidential diplomatic communications between the President and foreign leaders.\"\n\n\"The President must be free to engage in discussions with foreign leaders without fear that those communications will be disclosed and used as fodder for partisan political purposes,\" Cipollone added. \"And foreign leaders must be assured of this as well.\"\n\nOf course, what he didn't say is that the rationale for the document requests is not to obtain information for \"partisan political purposes,\" but to ensure that Trump did not make any promises or give away any state secrets that could affect foreign relations or imperil national security.\n\nEngel, Cummings, and Schiff \u2014 the chairs of the Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Reform, and Intelligence committees, respectively \u2014 sent the requests to both the White House and State Department in early March seeking documents and transcripts from interviews with senior aides and advisers related to an inquiry into Trump\u2019s communications with Putin.\n\nThe request came after a January report in the Washington Post revealed that Trump had withheld details of his talks with Putin from top officials in his administration, including confiscating notes from an interpreter who was present during one of the meetings.\n\nAccording to the Post, there is a lack of detailed records for at least five of Trump's face-to-face meetings with Putin.\n\nA short time later it was revealed that Trump had also quietly met with Putin at last year's G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, without a translator or anyone from his administration present during the exchange. Beforehand, the White House had denied that any such meeting would take place.\n\nThis is not the first time congressional investigators have attempted to get more information on Trump's conversations with Putin.\n\nLast year, House Democrats tried to get the White House to turn over documents related to Trump's one-on-one meeting with Putin in July that even Trump's own intelligence chiefs weren't briefed on afterward.\n\nThat meeting took place at the disastrous Helsinki summit, where Trump appeared to side with Putin over his own intelligence chiefs.\n\nRepublicans rejected that effort by House Democrats and opted instead to help the White House keep Trump's talks with Putin a secret.\n\nIn a statement responding to Thursday's White House letter, Reps. Cummings, Engel, and Schiff said the refusal to comply with the document request \"continues a troubling pattern by the Trump Administration of rejecting legitimate and necessary congressional oversight with no regard for precedent or the constitution.\"\n\nDespite the White House's claim that there is no precedent for turning over such documents, the lawmakers cited examples of previous presidential administration's complying with similar records requests, adding, \"President Trump's decision to break with this precedent raises the question of what he has to hide.\"\n\n\"We will be consulting on appropriate next steps. Congress has a constitutional duty to conduct oversight and investigate these matters, and we will fulfill that responsibility,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nFor someone who claims that he has nothing to hide, Trump sure is going to great lengths to make sure no one ever finds out what he discussed with Putin \u2014 now or in the future.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Research shows counties that hosted Trump rallies saw a massive 226 percent increase in hate crimes.\n\nTrump spews hate and inspires others to commit hate crimes. Now there's clear evidence that wherever Trump holds one of his notoriously anti-immigrant, anti-media campaign rallies, he leaves an increase in hate crimes in his wake.\n\nNew research reported Friday by the Washington Post shows just how dangerous Trump's rhetoric really is. The report found hate crimes increased 226 percent in counties where Trump held a 2016 campaign rally compared to counties that did not hold a rally.\n\nThe research backs up claims by politicians like Sens. Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who have called Trump out for inspiring violence and bigotry.\n\nThe new research is especially relevant after a string of terror attacks inspired by Trump dominated the headlines.\n\nIn New Zealand, a white supremacist terrorist who killed 50 Muslims at a mosque said that Trump was a \"renewed symbol of white identity.\" Trump's campaign often demonized Muslims, going so far as to call for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. Trump also repeatedly attacked Khizr and Ghazala Kahn, the Gold Star parents of Humayun Khan, who died while serving in Iraq.\n\nAnti-Muslim terrorists in Kansas even used Trump's hate-filled rhetoric to plead for a shorter sentence. Attorneys for the terrorists said, \"As long as the Executive Branch condemns Islam and commends and encourages violence against would-be enemies, then a sentence imposed by the Judicial Branch does little to deter people generally from engaging in such conduct if they believe they are protecting their countries from enemies identified by their own Commander-in-Chief.\"\n\nTrump's repeated attacks on Democratic politicians and the media also seemed to inspire the so-called \"MAGA Bomber,\" who lived in a van plastered with pro-Trump paraphernalia and sent pipe bombs to high-profile Democratic politicians Trump regularly attacked, including Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), and President Obama. He also mailed bombs to other Trump targets, including CNN, philanthropist George Soros, and political activist Tom Steyer, and recently pleaded guilty to 65 criminal charges.\n\nThere is even frequent violence at Trump rallies. During the campaign, Trump encouraged those at his rallies to physically assault protestors, even promising he would pay their legal bills. More recently, Trump's repeated tirades about the free press being \"the enemy of the people\" inspired one supporter to attack a member of the media covering a Trump rally. The publisher of the New York Times called out Trump's rhetoric for \"encouraging threats and violence against journalists at home and abroad.\"\n\nFBI data also supports the theory that Trump is inspiring hate crimes, showing hate crimes continue to spike in the Trump era, increasing by 17 percent in 2017 compared to 2016.\n\nTrump not only inspires terrorists, but he defends them as well. After neo-Nazis and white supremacists held a hate-fueled rally in Charlottesville and murdered a protestor, Trump defended white supremacists as \"very fine people.\"\n\nAfter years of decline, the Trump era has seen an increase in hate groups, reports the Southern Poverty Law Center. \"Rather than trying to tamp down hate, as presidents of both parties have done, President Trump elevates it \u2014 with both his rhetoric and his policies,\" Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project, said.\n\nNo matter how much damage and violence he inspires, Trump adamantly refuses to stop spewing hate. Now, with the 2020 campaign around the corner, more counties will be forced to deal with the violent aftermath of Trump invading their community.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and John Kennedy of Louisiana introduced a bill on Thursday that would force major banks to do business with the gun industry or else face punishments like restricting their access to discounted Federal Reserve loans.\n\n\"A small number of banks controlling most of the financial sector could effectively illegalize legal commerce by refusing to finance certain industries or process certain transactions,\" Cramer said in a news release. \"Look no further than pro-Second Amendment industries where such discrimination has already occurred. Big banks should not be the arbiters of constitutionality.\"\n\nThe bill is a response to moves by two major banks \u2014 Citigroup and Bank of America \u2014 that decided to take matters in their own hands on gun control thanks to Republican inaction after numerous mass shootings.\n\nIn response to the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Citigroup announced in March 2018 that its business customers who either didn't pass background checks or were not over the age of 21 could not purchase weapons. Citigroup also banned business customers from buying bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.\n\nShortly after Citigroup's move, Bank of America announced it would stop lending to companies that manufacture military-style guns for civilian use.\n\nGun control groups, such as former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' organization, have lauded moves like the ones from Citigroup, Bank of America and others like Dicks Sporting Goods, which have made strategic business decisions on guns in the wake of mass shootings.\n\nAfter those announcements, the gun lobby demanded Congress pass legislation punishing these banks for their moves.\n\nAnd it appears both Cramer and Kennedy took notice, tossing aside Republican free-market principles in order to do the National Rifle Association's bidding and punish Citibank and Bank of America for their gun rules.\n\nIt's clear to see why Cramer and Kennedy did what the NRA asked.\n\nThe NRA has bankrolled both men, spending $123,822 for Kennedy's 2016 election and a smaller $1,522 to support Cramer's Senate bid in 2018, according to data from OpenSecrets.\n\n\"I don't think we should be startled by the fact that when corporate interests give tens of millions of dollars to our president \u2014 and lesser amounts to senators members of Congress and local officials \u2014 that the people who donated that money will expect certain things to happen,\" David Chipman, a senior policy adviser for Giffords' group, said in an interview.\n\nStill, trying to dictate what private industry can and can't do is decidedly not a Republican principle.\n\n\"It\u2019s quite clear that the Republican Party for years has been very concerned about insuring that the corporate world has free reign to do what\u2019s best for their business,\" Chipman said. \"And the thought that two Republican senators are pushing forward a bill that would block businesses from doing what\u2019s best for their business model is quite extraordinary.\"\n\nYet when it comes to abortion rights, protections for LGBT Americans, and now, apparently, gun control, the GOP has proven it's willingness to abandon those principles and force private industry to do what Republicans want.\n\nIt's yet another hypocritical action from the GOP.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Robert Neller, sounded the alarm in two internal Pentagon memos that say Trump's fake national emergency and his made-up border crisis have created an \"unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and solvency.\"\n\nThe memos, first reported on Thursday by the Los Angeles Times, lay out some of the consequences Marines face because Trump is unnecessarily redeploying military personnel to the southern border and siphoning funds from military projects in order to fund a border wall he repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for.\n\nIn part because of Trump's actions, Marines will not participate in scheduled training exercises in Indonesia, Scotland, and Mongolia, and will reduce their participation in exercises in Australia and South Korea.\n\nCanceling these training exercises \"will degrade the combat readiness and effectiveness of the Marine Corps,\" Neller wrote, adding that the loss of these experiences for Marines \"at a critical time in their preparation cannot be recouped.\"\n\nDegrading Marine readiness isn't the only way Trump is endangering their lives. Neller warns that Marines, sailors, and civilians in Georgia and North Carolina are \"operating out of severely compromised structures\" even though hurricane season is only three months away. Additional funds are needed to address the \"severely degraded posture\" at some bases, Neller said.\n\nThe difficulties the Marine Corps faces stem from Trump's obsession with attacking people migrating to the U.S. from Latin America. Before the 2018 midterm election, Trump made up a fake \"border crisis\" to try to drum up turnout among his racist base, and demanded that thousands of troops go to the border as a pure political stunt.\n\nSince no real crisis awaited those troops, there was very little for them to do \u2014 and some troops even got stuck spending their days shoveling horse manure.\n\nAfter the election, Trump threw a tantrum and demanded Congress hand over $5.7 billion to pay for a border wall. When Congress refused, Trump forced a record-long shutdown of the federal government to try to force Congress to comply. When that didn't work, he declared a fake \"national emergency\" that allows him to circumvent Congress and steal money from various military projects to fund the wall.\n\nDemocrats in Congress passed a resolution to repeal his national emergency declaration, and got enough Republican votes in the Senate to send it to Trump's desk. Trump vetoed the bill, however, and it would take a lot more Republican senators to override that veto than are likely to turn against Trump.\n\nRepublicans in Congress could stop this \u2014 but they're not going to. And now, Trump's irresponsible actions are causing real readiness issues for the military.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Steve King thinks people in New Orleans ask for help too much, while people in Iowa 'take care of each other.'\n\nRep. Steve King (R-IA) is being slammed for another racist outburst \u2014 this time, attacking the predominantly black victims of Hurricane Katrina, a storm that killed over 1,800 Americans in 2005.\n\nKing tried to denigrate the people hardest hit by Katrina by claiming that they are less self-reliant than Iowans.\n\n\"Here\u2019s what FEMA tells me: \u2018We go to a place like New Orleans and everybody\u2019s looking around saying, who\u2019s gonna help me, who\u2019s gonna help me?\u2019\" King said.\n\nBy contrast, he claimed, FEMA is \"always gratified when they come and see Iowans take care of each other, so that\u2019s a point of pride that spreads across the country.\"\n\nThe population of New Orleans, where the storm hit hardest, was 67 percent black at the time, and black people made up the majority of deaths from Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana.\n\nMeanwhile, King represents a district in Iowa that is 95 percent white.\n\nLouisiana leaders quickly slammed King for his racist comments, which invoked ugly stereotypes about black people and public assistance.\n\n\"When people show you who they are, believe them. Steve King is a white supremacist and I won\u2019t stand for it,\" said Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-LA).\n\n\"These comments are disgusting and disheartening,\" said Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat. \"When communities are affected by disasters, we come together to help each other, not tear each other down.\"\n\nEddie Rispone, the Republican gubernatorial candidate running against Edwards, said King's comments were \"illogical and offensive.\"\n\nKing is infamous for making flagrantly racist comments.\n\nJust in the last week, he's promoted the idea that a white society could be superior to a nonwhite society, and fantasized about killing liberals in a new civil war.\n\nIn recent years, he has shared Nazi propaganda and even met with white supremacists in Europe.\n\nDespite all of this, he remained a member in good standing of the Republican House caucus for many years. It wasn't until recently, when King went so far as to say he didn't understand why white supremacy was offensive, that Republicans made something of a show of condemning him by revoking his committee memberships.\n\nStill, King continues to serve in Congress and was recently re-elected thanks in part to support from national Republicans.\n\nIt's clear that King can't help himself. Racism is central to his identity and his politics. And every day he has a national platform as a Republican congressman is another day he can advance white supremacy.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The government spent a ton of money to keep an attraction at Trump's hotel open while the rest of the government was shut down.\n\nThe General Services Administration (GSA) of the federal government, which is headed by a Trump appointee, arranged to spend $600,000 to keep open a historic site inside Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel for up to a year. Meanwhile, other parks and national monuments were shut down during the federal government shutdown.\n\nE&E News uncovered documents from the National Park Service detailing the funding agreement between the service and GSA.\n\nThe clock tower of the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C., is on the site of Trump International Hotel. GSA leases the property to a holding company owned by Trump. While much of the rest of the federal government was shut down as Trump demanded billions for his racist border wall, the clock tower stayed open.\n\nAs a result, while much of Washington's tourist attractions were closed, the facility directly connected to Trump had staff in place and was operational. It was a convenient and cozy deal.\n\nEmails between the Park Service and GSA show an awareness of how unseemly it appeared that the structure connected to Trump was receiving unusual treatment.\n\n\"I don't want to get sucked into a question about the political implications,\" said Mike Litterst, chief of communications for the National Mall and Memorial Parks.\n\nAfter the Associated Press quoted a ranger working at the site in early January while the shutdown was in place, Litterst noted in another email, \"We've reminded the staff to be extra careful about what they say when talking to visitors.\"\n\nTrump personally profits from traffic to the hotel and the attraction within it. He refused to put his holdings in a blind trust or sell them when he became president, so when somebody spends money at the hotel he profits. As a result, the hotel has become something of a corruption hub from people seeking to get influence with Trump.\n\nThe current head of GSA is Emily Murphy, a former staffer at the Republican National Committee and for former Rep. Jim Talent (R-MO). She was part of the Trump presidential transition and he nominated her to head GSA in 2017, after which she was confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTrump's appointees helped to arrange a state of affairs benefitting Trump's hotel. The operations of Trump's hotel benefit Trump personally.\n\nKeeping the tower open at taxpayer expense helped Trump's bottom line, and continued to refill the \"swamp\" with more Trump corruption.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Sen. Martha McSally refuses to publicly condemn Trump's repeated attacks on the late Sen. John McCain.\n\nTrump's dominion over his own party is so complete that Arizona's Republican senator, Martha McSally, refuses to publicly condemn Trump's repeated attacks on the late Sen. John McCain.\n\nMcSally could only muster platitudes about McCain this week, refusing even mild public criticism of Trump after his repeated, vicious attacks.\n\n\"I love John McCain. John McCain is an American hero. This state reveres John McCain. And his family deserves respect by everybody,\" McSally said on Thursday.\n\nMcSally also told reporters that she spoke to Trump privately on Wednesday to \"make sure he understood how I felt about Sen. McCain and how Arizona felt about Sen. John McCain\"\n\n\"And he heard me,\" McSally added.\n\nMcSally might like to pretend Trump listened to her, but Trump has a habit of ignoring women who express what they want. In an interview that aired Friday morning on Fox Business, Trump once again trashed McCain as he has been doing nearly every day for a week.\n\nStarting with unhinged attacks on Twitter last weekend and continuing through this interview, Trump has relentlessly berated McCain for both his vote on a GOP bill to repeal Obamacare as well as McCain's small role in providing the FBI with the infamous Steele dossier. Trump even complained that no one thanked him for his non-existent role in McCain's funeral.\n\nOn health care, Trump is still fuming about McCain joining Democrats in the Senate to defeat a Republican health care bill in the summer of 2017. The bill would have ripped away health care from millions, caused premiums to increase, and removed protection for people with a pre-existing condition.\n\n\"He was horrible, what he did with repeal and replace,\" Trump told Fox Business even after McSally said Trump heard her concerns.\n\nOn the other issue, Trump is upset that McCain handed over the Steele dossier to the FBI after it came into his possession. The dossier, originally funded by a conservative media outlet and then later funded by Hillary Clinton's campaign, compiled intelligence about Trump. While some of the most salacious allegations in the document have yet to be substantiated, other parts of the dossier have been corroborated by subsequent reporting.\n\nOver the past week, Trump accused McCain of sending the dossier to the FBI prior to the 2016 election for \"very evil purposes.\" The truth of the matter is that McCain sent the dossier in December 2017, a month after the election.\n\nAll through Trump's attacks on McCain, including his academic record at the Naval Academy, McSally has refused to push back against Trump in public. She is content to speak to him privately, with little obvious impact.\n\nMcSally may be concerned about her upcoming 2020 election. She lost the 2018 election to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), but after her defeat she was appointed by the governor to fill out the remainder of McCain's term.\n\nIn her short time as a senator, McSally has proved herself to be obediently subservient to Trump, going so far as to vote to allow Trump to steal money from Arizona military families to fund a border wall.\n\nAfter Trump declared a fake national emergency at he southern border, Congress had a chance to terminate it. McSally, who previously claimed to fight for Arizona's military bases, opted to turn her back on those families to side with Trump. Now, Trump could swipe funding for five projects, including $40 million for two F-35 related projects at Arizona's Luke Air Force Base.\n\nTime and again, McSally chooses to kowtow to Trump rather than stand up for the people of Arizona.\n\nIt is unclear why Trump has decided to resurrect his feud with a dead senator. But it is clear that McSally can't even muster the courage to speak publicly against Trump attacking the man who recently held the very Senate seat she currently holds.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

John McCain, noting that it seems counterproductive for Trump to have spent so much time over the last week attacking a dead man who cannot respond.\n\nTrump didn't like that one bit.\n\n\"I didn't bring it up, I didn't mention John McCain until you asked me a question about John McCain. Now I could say I have no comment, but that's not me,\" Trump blustered.\n\nAnd then he indicated that he thought he had an agreement with Fox not to even discuss the issue.\n\n\"But you shouldn't have brought it up,\" he said. \"Actually, I thought you weren't supposed to bring it up, but that's okay \u2014 fake news every once in a while.\"\n\n\"It's not fake news,\" Bartiromo objected. \"You just told me why you have an issue with him, it's real.\"\n\nThe right-wing propaganda network is clearly concerned that Trump might have spilled the beans and made it look bad. Fox released a brief video clip of Bartiromo strenuously denying that questions were set up ahead of time.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time something like this has happened. Just a few months ago Trump's then-EPA head, Scott Pruitt, had his office feed Fox News friendly questions to be asked on-air.\n\nTrump has largely avoided serious news outlets asking him questions. And his reaction to Bartiromo was unhinged, especially since the interview largely consisted of the reporter \u2014 a fan of his \u2014 asking him softball questions.\n\nIt's been almost a week since Trump started raging about John McCain again, seven months after the Arizona Republican senator passed away, and his petty cruelty sparked widespread shock and outrage.\n\nTrump insists that the controversy is the media's fault for asking him questions about McCain \u2014 but Trump himself is the one who started it by insulting McCain, and Trump himself is the one keeping the story going by complaining about being asked about it.\n\nDuring one of those complaints, Trump sunk to a new low by complaining that no one thanked him for approving McCain's funeral \u2014 even though his approval wasn't needed for it.\n\nTrump appeared to still be upset about the interview on Friday morning as he left the White House on the way to Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"Upset with Fox?\" ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked on Twitter, referring to Trump, and noting that Trump \"took questions from several reporters, but ignored [Fox News reporter John Roberts], avoiding eye contact with him until he started walking away and glared at him.\"\n\n\"It was a rather chilly March morning,\" Roberts noted, replying to Karl's tweet.\n\nTrump is fragile and lashes out viciously at anyone who deigns to point out how weak he truly is \u2014 even if it's Fox.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

As part of the propaganda effort, she handed reporters a map purportedly showing that the territorial holdings of ISIS in Syria had been completely eliminated.\n\nBut ISIS apparently didn't get the memo.\n\nWithin a few hours of Sanders' statement, CNN aired live video of reporter Ben Wedeman, who is in eastern Syria.\n\n\"The White House now says ISIS is 100 percent defeated, is that what you're seeing?\" asked anchor Brianna Keilar.\n\n\"No,\" replied Wedeman, \"For the last two and a half hours we've seen airstrikes, repeated air strikes, and these of course are American airplanes.\"\n\nThe reporter then pointed out, as it was visible on camera, that flares had been fired as part of the combat operations, along with tracer fire.\n\n\"There has been gunfire coming out of the ISIS positions,\" he added. \"The fighting is not over.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted that ISIS is completely defeated, seeking to take credit for the fight against the terrorist group that began long before he was sworn in.

Jerry Nadler (D-NY), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Scott Lloyd, former head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), saying his committee was \"troubled\" by Lloyd's misleading testimony before the committee during a February 2018 hearing. ORR is the federal agency that oversees most unaccompanied minors.\n\nDuring the hearing, members repeatedly asked Lloyd about reports he \"compiled spreadsheets to track the pregnancies and menstrual cycles of young women\" in ORR care. Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-PA) asked Lloyd directly if he is denying that he tracked the menstrual cycles of women in ORR custody.\n\nLloyd answered directly, saying, \"I am denying that I tracked menstrual cycles of women in my custody.\"\n\nHowever, in late March, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show obtained a 28-page spreadsheet used by Lloyd and his employees at ORR to track the pregnancies and menstrual cycles of girls aged 12-17 in their custody. The spreadsheet tracked how the girls became pregnant (whether through rape or consensual sex) as well as which girls requested abortions.\n\nBut Lloyd's misleading testimony didn't end there. Dean also asked him if he had \"personally visited pregnant minors to pressure them to continue their pregnancies.\" Once again, Lloyd denied the accusation, saying, \"No, that is not true.\"\n\nNadler's letter points out that Lloyd gave sworn testimony in a December 2017 deposition that he did, in fact, visit at least one unaccompanied minor while she was in custody. He also admitted to speaking on the phone with at least one additional pregnant unaccompanied minor \"where the topic of abortion was discussed.\"\n\nPrevious reporting uncovered that Lloyd regularly denied requests for abortions by young women in his custody, going so far as to telling staff that any abortion must be personally approved by him. An extreme anti-abortion zealot, his posture resulted in lawsuits filed by the ACLU after he illegally denied young women access to health care.\n\nLloyd joins a long list of current and former Trump officials who lied in the course of investigations.\n\nTrump's first National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about Russian contacts. Trump's longtime attorney and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's involvement in Russian business interests. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker have all misled or outright lied to Congress over the past two years.\n\nWhile Trump officials seem to lie as easily as Trump himself, Lloyd holds the distinction of being the creepiest of the bunch.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

That does not include the possibility of further indictments from other investigations, which are still ongoing, including in the Southern District of New York.\n\nProsecutors there have also been investigating many members of Trump's inner circle, and last week charged former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort with 16 additional crimes, on top of the crimes for which he was already tried and convicted in Mueller's investigation.\n\nOver the past many months, Mueller has amassed a stellar track record for prosecutions. According to the New York Times, every person Mueller charged with a crime who is not awaiting a trial has pleaded guilty or been found guilty.\n\nThat includes several close Trump associates, including former campaign chair Paul Manafort; deputy campaign chair Rick Gates; his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn; campaign aide George Papadopoulos; and longtime lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen.\n\nIncluding those within and outside Trump's orbit, the Mueller investigation charged at least 34 people and three companies with a variety of crimes.\n\nTrump, who is once again spending his weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, has not yet responded to news that Mueller has completed his extensive investigation.\n\nHowever, Trump has an extensive record of incessant complaints and attacks on the investigation, the investigators, the former friends and associates who have flipped on him, and anyone else even remotely associated with the investigation. So it is likely just a matter of time before Trump takes to Twitter and starts raging.\n\nDan Desai Martin also contributed to this report.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Everyone should take notice and review their own activities to ensure they are not involved in North Korea\u2019s sanctions evasion.\"\n\nTrue to Trump administration fashion, however, the left hand clearly didn't know what the right hand was doing. And aides had to quickly figure out why Trump would tweet out a policy reversal that clearly hadn't been discussed within the West Wing.\n\nEventually, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders offered a shocking reason why Trump was reversing the new sanctions.\n\n\"President Trump likes Chairman Kim and he doesn\u2019t think these sanctions will be necessary,\" she told reporters.\n\nBasically, Trump unilaterally decided to reverse sanctions on a brutal dictator because the two men are friends.\n\nIt's the latest capitulation to North Korea Trump has made, despite the fact that North Korea has given up little in exchange for more lenient treatment on its nuclear program from the U.S.\n\nTurns out Trump simply has a soft spot for murderous dictators.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Nobody who understands space or the military wants Trump's 'space force' \u2014 but he is pushing to waste nearly $14 billion on the idea every year.\n\nThe Trump administration is trying to ensure that Trump's widely ridiculed \"space force\" obsession will cost American taxpayers nearly $14 billion a year.\n\nThe so-called \"space force\" will have \"a budget the size of SOCOM,\" said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Wednesday. SOCOM is the U.S. Special Operations Command, which has an annual budget of about $13.5 billion.\n\nSOCOM has in the past been responsible for major military operations like taking on the Taliban in Afghanistan, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, and capturing Saddam Hussein in Iraq.\n\nBy comparison, \"space force\" is just an applause line in Trump's rambling, nonsensical, racist speeches, and a slogan he can sell on campaign hats.\n\nMore importantly, it's a massive waste of tax dollars that military experts and Congress do not want.\n\nShanahan recently announced the establishment of the Space Development Agency, which Space News noted \"surprised many, even inside the Pentagon.\" As Space News explained: \"The decision has not been well received by organizations in the Air Force that currently develop space systems such as the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center in Los Angeles, and the Air Force Space Rapid Capabilities Office, based at Kirtland Air Force, New Mexico.\"\n\nCurrently, the Pentagon is requesting $2 billion from Congress \u2014 reluctantly, and under Trump's orders \u2014 to set up a space force.\n\nShanahan is now on Capitol Hill attempting to convince skeptical lawmakers to waste many times more than that on Trump's boondoggle, and it hasn't gone great.\n\nIt has been repeatedly pointed out to Trump that the military is already working in space (particularly in the Air Force) and that his applause line idea is an impractical approach that could disrupt existing operations.\n\n\"I would just urge you \u2026 to fully utilize the existing R&D assets as you stand up SDA so that we\u2019re not losing a few years of reorganization to make the whole system work better,\" Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) told Shanahan in a Senate hearing.\n\nIt doesn't help Shanahan's cause that, even as he is working as the front man for \"space force,\" he is also under investigation by the Pentagon. They are probing his role as a former Boeing executive and how he may be using his current position to promote his old company.\n\nTrump's administration has been an ethical sewer of graft and corruption, from Trump himself all the way down to his Cabinet secretaries and other officials.\n\nAides to members of Congress have also been telling reporters that there are concerns about the size of Trump's proposal. At first, they said \"space force\" would have 15,000 people. Now Shanahan has increased the number to as many as 20,000 people.\n\nThey also are asking for at least two four-star generals to run the operation.\n\n\"Three more four-star generals are not going to make us stronger in space,\" said Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, at a March 13 conference.\n\nTrump loves \"space force,\" especially because his most rabid and devoted fans cheer so loudly for it. But Congress and the military are skeptical at best \u2014 and America might be on the hook for billions so Trump gets an applause line and hats he can sell.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) says that Trump won't escape criminal charges, whether it's after he leaves office or before.\n\nOne day, Trump will probably be indicted for an array of crimes \u2014 and that day could very well come while he's still in office.\n\nThat's the view of Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), a former U.S. Attorney, former attorney general of Connecticut, and a member of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"There are indictments in this president's future,\" Blumenthal told hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski Thursday morning on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\n\"They're coming,\" Blumenthal added. \"Whether they're after his presidency or during it.\"\n\nBlumenthal mentioned the crimes Trump and his campaign may have committed with the help of Vladimir Putin, as well as \"obstruction of justice that was done by the president of the United States in real time.\"\n\nScarborough noted that Trump could escape justice for criminal activity, like the felonies he allegedly directed his attorney Michael Cohen to commit, if he is re-elected in 2020 \u2014 because the statute of limitations on some crimes will come before 2024.\n\nWhen Scarborough mentioned a longstanding Department of Justice opinion advising against indicting a sitting president, Blumenthal dismissed that policy.\n\n\"The Supreme Court is under no obligation to give it any weight,\" Blumenthal said. \"It deserves no weight, in my humble opinion.\"\n\nAnother Democratic lawmaker is working on a fix for the statute of limitations problem, which Trump could use to avoid accountability.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) is writing legislation that would extend the statute of limitations on crimes committed by presidents. \"I don't think any person should be above the law,\" Swalwell said recently, and added that he believes indictments are in store for Trump one way or another.\n\nBlumenthal and Swalwell are part of a growing chorus of members of Congress who believe Trump faces indictment. In December 2018, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who now chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said he thinks there is \"a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office, the Justice Department may indict him, and that Trump \"may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.\"\n\nTrump's own Department of Justice implicated him in an illegal scheme to use hush money to silence alleged mistresses prior to the 2016 election. Trump's longtime lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, is going to prison for his part in that and other crimes. Cohen has stated that Trump directed him to make the hush money payments.\n\nAt the moment, the Trump campaign, the Trump Foundation, Trump's inaugural committee, and Trump himself are all under state or federal investigation for a variety of potential illegal activity. Trump's former campaign chair, deputy campaign chair, and a handful of people from the Trump campaign are facing jail time for a litany of crimes.\n\nAnd if Blumenthal is correct, Trump will soon join them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

McFarland \"conducted official business on her personal AOL.com account,\" and that McFarland used her account as part of efforts to \"transfer sensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThe Saudi Arabian information transfer was done, Cummings notes, \"in coordination with Tom Barrack, a personal friend of President Trump\" and the chairman of his inaugural committee.\n\nThe Trump inaugural committee is currently under criminal investigation.\n\nMcFarland was deputy to Michael Flynn, Trump's disgraced former national security adviser. She was also a frequent Fox News talking head for years, who was hired as part of Trump's obsession with surrounding himself with people who he has seen on television. McFarland frequently expressed an affinity for Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin during her Fox appearances.\n\nCummings notes that the Oversight Committee found a document indicating that Steve Bannon, who was Trump's chief White House Strategist, received documents \"pitching the plan\" about the technology transfers from Barrack \"through his personal email account.\"\n\n\"These communications appear to be sent while Mr. Bannon worked at the White House in order to inform Mr. Bannon's official work relating to developing 'broader middle east policy',\" Cummings wrote.\n\nMcFarland and Bannon's communications \"raise questions\" about whether they complied with the Presidential Records Act, which requires official business to be conducted on official government accounts so information can be stored and preserved. To do otherwise would violate federal law.\n\nThose weren't the only explosive revelations in Cummings' letter.\n\nCummings also revealed that Trump's son-in-law and aide Jared Kushner used a private email account and the encrypted messaging program WhatsApp to conduct official business. Cummings noted that a \"major security breach\" could have possibly occurred if Kushner used his accounts to transfer classified information.\n\nTrump cleared Kushner to receive classified data despite concerns that were raised by the CIA. Kushner's lawyer told Cummings that he sends \"screenshots\" of his conversations to his official account.\n\nAlong with Kushner, Cummings also noted in his letter that Ivanka Trump has continued to receive official government communications at her personal email account. Both Kushner and Ivanka Trump may also be in violation of the Records Act, which would mean they broke federal law.\n\nThe Chairman slammed the White House for failing to comply with records requests for over two years, and gave the administration until April 4 to comply with several lines of inquiry.\n\nIf the stonewalling continues, Cummings notes he \"will be forced to consider alternative means to obtain compliance.\" That could include an official subpoena, which Democrats have authorized already in other probes.\n\nMany of these potential security violations, and the subsequent stonewalling of congressional requests, happened when Republicans were in charge of the House and barely bothering to conduct oversight of the Trump administration.\n\nThings have changed with Democrats in the majority \u2014 and they're revealing just how reckless the Trump administration has been in handling America's most sensitive secrets.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

In at least 83 of those cases, the requests were rescinded \u2014 which suggests the agency discovered that it wrongly identified U.S. citizens as undocumented.\n\nThe ACLU notes that since ICE often fails to actively cancel detainers for U.S. citizens, the total number of citizens detained is likely more than 83.\n\n\"If Miami\u2019s experience is representative, ICE may now be targeting hundreds of U.S. citizens each year in states like Florida,\" the ACLU report said.\n\nCitizens have also been wrongly targeted by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which was recently caught detaining an American citizen \u2014 specifically, a 9-year-old California girl, Julia Isabel Amparo Medina, who was separated from her mother and kept in CBP custody.\n\nMedina lives in Tijuana, Mexico but attends elementary school in San Diego. She is an American citizen with a U.S. passport. But when she crossed to the border to go to school, CBP officials allegedly said she did not look like the picture in her passport. They accused her and her 14-year-old brother of lying to them, and said they could not see their families.\n\n\"I was scared. I was sad because I didn't have my mom or my brother. I was completely by myself,\" Medina told the local NBC affiliate.\n\nThey were released only after the Mexican consulate was notified and intervened.\n\nTrump is hostile to both legal and illegal immigrants, and has targeted Latinos as part of an all-encompassing anti-immigrant push. Agencies like ICE and CBP are executing an aggressive strategy dictated from above, and expanding the use of already-controversial policies.\n\nThe policies are unnecessarily cruel to everyone \u2014 but now the rights of native-born American citizens, including children, are also being violated thanks to Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The woman, Li \"Cindy\" Yang, had also set up a business aimed at Chinese clients selling access to Trump and high-level Republican officials.\n\nIn light of the reports, Congress asked the FBI to open both a criminal investigation into Yang related to potential human trafficking and sex slavery, as well as a counterintelligence inquiry. Congressional leaders are concerned that Yang could be providing opportunities to foreign agents \"to acquire potential material for blackmail or other even more nefarious purposes,\" whether she intended to or not.\n\nBut the Palm Beach Post reveals that access to Trump is even easier than going through someone like Yang. For the Super Bowl party Yang attended with Trump, there were glossy advertisements telling anyone how to purchase tickets available at the front counter of Mar-a-Lago days ahead of the game. The Post reports that tickets to events open to the public cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000. Events are also published in a local newspaper.\n\nWhereas anyone with means can party with Trump, the White House keeps the list of those people a closely guarded secret. The Secret Service does not keep a record of who attends soirees with Trump or which high-level government officials accompany him to the luxury resort he owns and profits from. The general public does not know who Trump is soliciting advice from, which he often does while visiting his club.\n\nThe Post perused social media accounts that tagged Mar-a-Lago to uncover what kinds of characters are able to gain access to Trump's exclusive club. The list includes at least a few individuals who caught the eye of special counsel Robert Mueller for ties to Russia.\n\nIn April 2018, Andy Wigmore and Aaron Banks posted selfies from the resort. The two are part of a group from Britain that describes themselves as the \"Bad Boys of Brexit\" for their role in bankrolling the campaign for Brexit. But in doing so, they cultivated close ties to Russian operatives, while at the same time cozying up to the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nBanks is currently under investigation by British authorities and is wrapped up in the Mueller investigation, according to the Washington Post. Some on Congress, after looking at communications from Banks, wonder if he served as a conduit between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.\n\nThe porous access to Mar-a-Lago troubles not only congressional leaders but government watchdog groups.\n\n\"There should be more transparency,\" John Wunderlich, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, told the Palm Beach Post in September 2018. \"The fact is he's having all these meetings at a private resort where people have paid six figures to join ... people with business interests and foreign governments all have access to Mar-a-Lago and Trump's hotel in D.C.\"\n\nAccess to Trump goes to those with money, even if the public never knows who they are or what their motivations may be.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump's economic advisors concede that the GOP tax bill won't produce the results they promised.\n\nIt turns out that a tax scam designed to lavish Wall Street investors and billionaires with tax cuts won't help grow the economy for millions of American families. Even Trump's White House is admitting failure.\n\nA report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), released on Tuesday, admits that the U.S. economy will not sustain 3 percent growth for the foreseeable future, even under the rosiest scenario. That's a far cry from their \"predictions\" before the tax scam became law.\n\nIn October 2017, Trump's CEA came out with an analysis showing that cutting taxes for wealthy corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent would increase America's economic growth by three to five percent. Even that analysis fell short of Trump's boast of 6 percent growth. In the end, Republicans slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, but the predictions of growth were way off.\n\nThe rest of the bill was focused on lavishing the richest 1 percent of Americans with more than 80 percent of total benefits. Meanwhile, middle-class families are left with higher tax bills and smaller tax refunds. And on top of all of that, promises of broad-based economic growth couldn't hold up to reality.\n\nThe 2019 CEA report admits total failure, acknowledging growth will slow to 2.5 percent in 2022, and decrease to 2 percent in 2026. Yet even those numbers are higher than many economists project. The Washington Post reports that many economists predict growth closer to 2 percent in 2020, or perhaps a recession.\n\nReaction from one group that anticipated this kind of failure was swift and unrelenting.\n\n\"Despite Trump and Republican lawmakers' campaign promises, it could not be more clear that the GOP's tax law will not produce the economic growth they claimed it would,\" Ryan Thomas, spokesperson for Tax March, told Shareblue Media. \"Instead, working people and middle-class families are paying the price for corporate tax breaks and for the wealthiest Americans to buy more yachts.\"\n\nThomas may have been alluding to Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-FL), who purchased a multi-million dollar yacht on the same day he voted in favor of the Republican tax scam. Or perhaps he was referring to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who refuses to fly the American flag on her $40-million dollar yacht.\n\nThe Trump White House scammed the public with unrealistically rosy predictions before the tax scam became law. Now that rich corporations and the yacht-owning class are making out like bandits, the truth is emerging.\n\nAnd to no one's surprise, the truth is not even close to what Trump claimed.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan may have used his official position to help his former employer, Boeing.\n\nAnother scandal in the Trump administration is unfolding, this time at the Pentagon.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pentagon's inspector general announced an investigation into Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan after allegations arose that he used his official position to steer money to his former employer, Boeing, and away from competitors like Lockheed Martin.\n\n\"The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General has decided to investigate complaints we recently received that Acting Secretary Patrick Shanahan allegedly took actions to promote his former employer, Boeing, and disparage its competitors, allegedly in violation of ethics rules,\" a Defense Department spokesperson said.\n\nShanahan is accused of \"putting his finger on the scale\" for Boeing around spending projects, based on reporting from Politico. When Shanahan was deputy secretary, he allegedly slammed Boeing rival Lockheed Martin for their work on an F-35 fighter jet, saying the plane is \"fucked up\" and Lockheed \"doesn\u2019t know how to run a program.\"\n\nIn addition, Bloomberg reports Shanahan prodded the Defense Department to purchase several F-15 fighter jets made by Boeing despite the Air Force saying they did not want them. The cost of the unwanted fighter jets was $1.1 billion.\n\nThe investigation was opened just weeks after the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington lodged a formal complaint about Shanahan's alleged behavior.\n\nDespite the ethics cloud swirling around Shanahan, several media outlets report that Trump is likely to nominate him to become the permanent defense secretary. Shanahan is already the longest-serving acting secretary in Defense Department history.\n\nThe investigation comes on the heels of two civilian Boeing 737 Max planes crashing in the last six months, killing more than 450 people. As many countries grounded that aircraft after the second crash, Trump dithered after he received a call from Boeing's CEO \u2014 the same CEO who donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration.\n\nShanahan joins a long list of Trump administration officials facing scandals. The list includes: former HHS Secretary Tom Price (taxpayer-funded travel), former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt (lavish spending), former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke (shady land deal), former VA Secretary David Shulkin (taxpayer-funded travel), Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (unconstitutional acts on 2020 Census), and numerous White House officials.\n\nOne former official, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about ties to Russia and has been cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nIn addition to his high-level appointees, Trump himself is at the center of investigations dealing with unlawful hush-money payments to alleged mistresses and colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign.\n\nSo maybe a scandal involving Shanahan helps him fit in with the rest of the unethical cronies in Trump's orbit.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "House Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings blasted Trump's White House for its 'unprecedented level' of obstruction.\n\nThe new majority in Congress is dutifully investigating Trump's smorgasbord of criminal and corrupt activities.\n\nBut Trump's White House has engaged in \"unprecedented level of stonewalling, delay and obstruction,\" according to Congress's chief investigator. He also hinted that subpoenas may be on the horizon.\n\nIn a Wednesday Washington Post op-ed, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) says the Trump White House has refused to turn over any documents at all.\n\n\"Let me underscore that point,\" Cummings says. \"The White House has not turned over a single piece of paper to our committee or made a single official available for testimony during the 116th Congress.\" The stonewalling comes despite a dozen letters sent by Cummings on topics ranging from the mundane to allegations Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen for illegal hush-money payments made during the 2016 election.\n\nCummings is also looking into the use of personal email by White House staffers, nepotism surrounding the security clearance process, and the administration possibly violating the law in a rush to sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrump's obstruction is not limited to Cummings. According to a recent Politico investigation, the White House has refused to cooperate with requests from 17 different congressional committees.\n\nTrump's actions are \"truly extreme,\" Walter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics, said in reaction to Cummings' op-ed. Shaub added that \"subpoenas may be in order.\"\n\nThe Trump White House has \"an arrogant attitude toward Congress, Charles Tiefer, former solicitor and deputy general counsel of the House, told Politico. \"You have to go back to the Nixon administration to find this.\"\n\nPast administrations of both parties cooperated with Congress no matter which political party was in control. George W. Bush turned over more than 20,000 pages of documents related to that administration's disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina. President Obama turned over documents to a Republican Congress that tried to exploit the murder of American diplomats in Benghazi for political gain prior to the 2016 election.\n\nBut Trump apparently thinks he is above the law. Immediately after the 2018 midterm election, where voters elected Democrats in part to hold Trump accountable, Trump hinted he would stonewall any and all investigations. Trump used his 2019 State of the Union address to threaten the new congressional majority about investigating him for potential criminal activity.\n\nBut Trump's empty threat backfired.\n\n\"We will not be bullied by the president of the United States,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), chair of the House Democrats, said immediately following the address.\n\nCummings is taking the same posture, standing up not only for the will of American voters but for the values enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTrump's actions \"violate our Constitution's fundamental principle of checks and balances,\" Cummings says. \"If our committee must resort to issuing subpoenas, there should be no doubt about why. This has nothing to do with presidential harassment and everything to do with unprecedented obstruction.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The change would limit the amount of debate allowed on Trump's judicial and executive branch nominees \u2014 speeding up the pace at which the GOP-controlled Senate can ram through Trump's extremist picks.\n\nCurrently, Senate rules say each nominee gets 30 hours of debate. But McConnell and the GOP want to lower that number to just two hours, which would let Republicans speed through confirmation on judges who receive lifetime appointments.\n\nMcConnell once loudly criticized Democrats for changing the rules on judicial confirmations under former President Barack Obama. Democrats, however, were forced to make the rule change because Senate Republicans, led by McConnell, obstructed a massive amount of Obama's judicial picks.\n\nFor now, Republicans are debating whether to require 60 votes on the rules change \u2014 which would necessitate Democratic votes and allow Democrats to block the change.\n\nYet it seems like McConnell is prepared to make the change with just a simple majority of 51 votes, which Senate Republicans say they have the votes to achieve.\n\n\"We're still hoping to have bipartisan support to go forward with the standing order, which would require 60 votes. In the absence of that, it is still my desire to try to achieve that, and that's ... a discussion will have among Republicans,\" McConnell told reporters earlier this month, according to the Hill newspaper.\n\nTrump has confirmed a large number of judges with the GOP Senate since taking office, a number of whom have extremist views on everything from racial- and gender-based discrimination, same-sex marriage, and abortion rights. A number have even been deemed \"not qualified\" by the American Bar Association.\n\nAnd now that McConnell is likely to once again blow up the Senate institution to limit the amount of debate on Trump's nominations, that number could grow.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The Washington Post reports that this is the first time the administration has been held to account for the climate impact of its energy agenda, which has been designed by the wealthy fossil fuel donors to Trump's campaign.\n\n\"It calls into question the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s entire oil and gas program...This forces them to pull their head out of the sand and look at the bigger picture,\" said Jeremy Nichols, climate and energy program director for WildEarth Guardians. Nichols' group, along with Physicians for Social Responsibility, sued the administration to force a review of the process.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama's administration, the climate impact of federal oil, gas, and coal leasing was considered as part of the process. But Trump undid that and is now paying the price.\n\nTrump is a conspiracy theorist who does not believe in climate change. He has for years insisted that it is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese government. His administration's policies and appointees reflect his indulgence in such crackpot beliefs.\n\nThe failed federal case becomes just one of the many court cases that Trump's team has lost since he assumed office, thanks to incompetence and ignorance.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

It was a huge win for racial justice; because black people are arrested and jailed at a disproportionate rate, keeping former felons from voting also meant keeping nearly 20 percent of African Americans in Florida from voting.\n\nThe new law restores voting rights for nearly 1.5 million people in Florida, 418,000 of whom are black.\n\nBut now Republicans in the state legislature are attempting to trample on those rights, with a proposal that would force Americans who have served their sentences to pay back all court fines and fees before they can register to vote.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) blasted the proposal as \"a poll tax by any other name\" \u2014 referring to Jim Crow-era laws that suppressed the votes of minorities and low-income people by charging a fee to vote.\n\nThe measure passed out of a state House committee on Tuesday, which suggests Florida Republicans are serious about overturning the will of 64.5 percent of Florida voters who backed the amendment restoring voting rights.\n\nThe bill would \"nearly guarantee that people will miss election after election,\" Julie Ebenstein of the ACLU told NBC News. \"It's an affront to the Florida voters.\"\n\nIf the Republicans had their way, 17.9 percent of black Floridians would still have a harder time voting \u2014 which is probably not a coincidence, since black voters have overwhelmingly supported the Democratic Party.\n\nRepublicans in Florida won their gubernatorial and U.S. Senate elections by the slimmest of margins in 2018, by 0.4 and 0.12 points respectively. The party has an incentive to do everything it can to keep nonwhite voters away from the polls.\n\nFlorida is also a key presidential battleground. In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton there by only 1.2 points. President Barack Obama won it in 2012 and 2008. He has gone from 56 percent approval in the state in 2017 to 46 percent approval in January.\n\nFormer Tallahassee mayor and 2018 senatorial candidate Andrew Gillum has just announced a voter registration group, Bring It Home Florida, aimed at defeating Trump.\n\n\"Voters were intentional \u2014 we believe in second chances. Lawmakers impeding the will of voters by putting a price on restoring civil rights is wrong & unconstitutional,\" Gillum wrote on Twitter, commenting on the Republican legislation. \"We will not allow lawmakers to roll back progress. We must keep Florida moving forward.\"\n\nGillum narrowly lost the 2018 Florida governor's race to Ron DeSantis \u2014 who became notorious during the campaign for his many racist statements, and who has since tried to slow-walk the implementation of restoring felon voting rights.\n\nTrump will need all the help he can get, and his fellow party members appear to understand that.\n\nFlorida Republicans, like Republicans in Michigan and Wisconsin, are disregarding the clear will of the voters in order to help their own political fortunes.\n\nThat they are doing so while playing the most virulent form of racial politics just makes matters worse.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

By the middle of 2020 there will not be enough money to cover benefit payments.\n\nThe tax was cut on Jan. 1, during Trump's federal government shutdown for his racist border wall \u2014 and it has not been restored.\n\nLast October, McConnell told a reporter that a restoration of the tax rate \"be taken care of before we get into an expiration situation.\" He also said, \"It just won't be allowed to be unfunded.\"\n\nBut that never happened, and legislation to bring back the funds is now tied up in a Senate committee.\n\n\"These miners and retirees have given so much to fuel our country, and they deserve the peace of mind that their pensions and health care benefits will not be taken away,\" said Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), in a statement urging passage of the legislation.\n\nSeveral Democratic senators from states with coal plants \u2014 Alabama, West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania \u2014 have cosponsored the bill.\n\nWhen recently asked about the fund running out of money, according to AP, McConnell's spokesman \"didn't repeat\" McConnell's earlier pledge to restore the money. Instead, he mouthed platitudes simply reaffirming that the fund is currently funded. That doesn't help the situation.\n\nTrump didn't make any mention of the tax rate in his recently released budget proposal, but it did suggest cuts to Medicare, education and payments to veterans. And Trump did ask for billions for his racist wall.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised miners that he is an advocate for them and mining jobs. But in reality Trump has done the bidding of coal companies \u2014 who pushed for the black lung tax rate to be dropped \u2014 while miners are left out in the cold.\n\nMcConnell and Trump are major beneficiaries of donations from coal businesses. Between his election campaign and inaugural committee (currently under investigation), Trump received over $1.5 million in donations. McConnell has received over $297,000 from the coal industry since his last election in 2014.\n\nBoth men are providing a good return on investment for the businesses who bought their influence and apparently see little reason to help the miners who are suffering in the same industry.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Iowa Republican's refusal to deny that a white society is 'superior' comes days after he fantasized about killing liberals in a civil war.\n\nThere he goes again.\n\nDuring a town hall in his district Tuesday night, Rep.

That\u2019s so hypothetical,\" King replied.\n\n\"I\u2019ll say this, America is not a white society \u2014 it has never been a completely white society,\" King continued. \"We came here and joined the Native Americans.\u201d\n\nHe added that he's \"long said that a baby can be lifted out of a cradle anywhere in the world and brought into any home in America, whatever the color of the folks in that household, and they can be raised to be American as any other.\"\n\nIt should have been an easy \"no\" answer when King was asked whether he believes a white society is superior to a nonwhite society. Instead, his answer sounded a lot like a \"maybe.\"\n\nThis is just the latest racist blunder from King \u2014 who has long openly sympathized with neo-Nazis and white nationalists.\n\nOver the weekend, King posted a meme to his Facebook page in which he seemed to call for a civil war between \"red states\" and \"blue states.\"\n\nThe meme featured red states and blue states in the shape of humans fighting each other. A caption over the image read: \"Folks keep talking about another civil war. One side has about 8 trillion bullets, while the other side doesn't know which bathroom to use.\"\n\nKing added his own commentary to the post, writing, \"Wonder which side would win....\" with a winking emoji.\n\nKing has made virulently racist comments for years.\n\nHe smeared DREAM Act recipients \u2014 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as minors through no fault of their own \u2014 as being drug mules who had \"calves the size of cantaloupes.\"\n\nAnd in 2017, he tweeted: \"We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies.\" That's an eerily similar sentiment to one espoused in the manifesto of the white supremacist terrorist who murdered 50 people in a pair of mosques in New Zealand."

Under Trump, that win rate has been reduced to a pathetic 6 percent.\n\nThe Trump team makes it \"very easy for the courts to reject them because they\u2019re not doing their homework,\" Georgetown Law's William W. Buzbee, an expert on administrative law, told the Post.\n\nThe incompetence even frustrates Trump's conservative allies.\n\nSeth Jaffe, a pro-deregulation lawyer working for corporations, told the Post, \"It\u2019s not just that they\u2019re losing.

And Trump's own words are often enough to convince a judge of this.\n\nIn at least a dozen cases, Trump's nonsensical and bigoted comments have been cited in court and used against him. In one instance, Trump's reference to countries with large nonwhite populations as \"shithole\" countries helped convince a judge to rule against Trump's anti-Muslim travel ban because it was so clearly motivated by bias.\n\nThankfully, Trump's failures in the courts have slowed his attempts to roll back environmental protections and regulations that keep millions of Americans safe.\n\nWhen campaigning for the presidency, Trump promised the country that if elected, he would win so often that people would get \"tired\" of his winning.\n\nBut Americans know the truth \u2014 which is why they continually give him losing marks for job performance.\n\nTrump promised to hire \"the best people\" to work under him, but he has consistently been unable to attract top talent thanks to his repeated bumbling and overall corruption.\n\nTrump values loyalty above all. Loyalty matters more than patriotism or even basic competence. As a result, the Trump administration is staffed with sycophants instead of competent federal employees who are capable of doing the intense work needed to run the government.\n\nThe team Trump assembled is losing because Trump has set himself and the country up to fail through poor leadership.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "GOP senators voted to let Trump rob millions of dollars from military families in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and North Carolina.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing between military families in their own state or pledging their loyalty to Trump, many vulnerable Republican senators chose Trump.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Jack Reed (D-CT) unveiled a list of military projects Trump may steal from to pay for his border wall, including more than millions of dollars from military bases in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and North Carolina. Each of those states has a Republican senator running for re-election in 2020, and yet they still voted to let Trump rob military families in their own backyard.\n\nAfter Trump failed in his efforts to get Congress to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, he made up a fake national emergency at the southern border. In doing so, he planned to steal money from military projects, defying the will of Congress and possibly the Constitution.\n\nCongress had the opportunity to block Trump's fake emergency, but the majority of Republicans in both the House and Senate opted to side with Trump and abandon their loyalty to the Constitution.\n\nIn Arizona, Sen. Martha McSally was one of those who picked Trump, voting to allow him to swipe up to $150 million from military bases in her state. McSally risked funding for five projects at four locations, including $40 million for two F-35 related projects at Luke Air Force Base.\n\nJust last month, McSally bragged to a local radio station that she has \"fought for Luke Air Force Base.\" But when Trump demanded that McSally prove her loyalty to him, she promptly gave up that fight in order to do Trump's bidding.\n\nIn Colorado, embattled Sen. Cory Gardner rankled past supporters by siding with Trump on the fake national emergency. With his vote, Gardner may have cost Fort Carson $77 million desperately needed for upgrades. The money was intended to \"provide troops with a long-awaited, improved vehicle maintenance shop to repair the post's aging fleet of trucks, tanks and Humvees.\"\n\nInstead, Gardner wants Trump to steal it for a border wall. Gardner's inability to stand up for his own state led one hometown newspaper to call its 2014 endorsement of Gardner a mistake.\n\nIn Georgia, Sen. David Perdue is completely supportive of Trump's desire to take up to $260 million from military bases in his state and use it for a border wall. Trump theft could include \"$99 million for a cyber instructional facility at Fort Gordon, nearly $31 million for a hangar at Moody Air Force base and more than $75 million for a combat vehicle warehouse and body repair shop at Albany's Marine Corps Logistics Base.\"\n\nPerdue, a staunch Trump ally who has been described as within Trump's circle of trust, could face a stiff re-election challenge if Stacey Abrams enters the race. Abrams narrowly lost the 2018 race to be Georgia's governor, unable to overcome years of voter suppression efforts led by her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp.\n\nIn North Carolina, the flip-flopping Sen. Thom Tillis was initially opposed to Trump's fake emergency, but then went back on his word and voted exactly how Trump told him to. In doing so, he jeopardized more than half a billion dollars worth of funding for the military in his state. Tillis is willing to abandon water treatment plant improvements and a new health care facility for Camp Lejeune just so Trump can build a vanity wall along the border. He's also willing to deprive his state of funding for airfield security at Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station.\n\nTillis's vote \"is a slap in the face to our active duty service members and our veteran community,\" Robert Howard, spokesperson for the North Carolina Democratic Party, said in a Monday statement. \"Tillis chose his political career over our military, and North Carolina will not forget this easily,\" he added.\n\nThe Trump administration has not made a final decision on which military projects will be robbed. But in just four states, Trump might steal millions of dollars from military personnel just so he can build a wall along the border.\n\nAnd the elected senators in those states are not only refusing to stop Trump from taking the money, they are actively supporting his efforts.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

There's an inherent vulnerability in the care for children.\"\n\nUnder a 1997 court agreement known as the Flores Settlement, the federal government must let attorneys representing jailed children know where each child in ORR custody is being held. It appears that ORR did not follow this court mandate in these cases.\n\n\"Detained unaccompanied children with mental health issues are some of the most vulnerable children, and when the government does not provide access to their whereabouts, it calls into question the basic underpinnings of our democratic institutions,\" Holly Cooper, an attorney representing the class of unaccompanied minors in ORR's care, told Reveal.\n\nCooper first discovered one of the secret child jails months ago, and has since pressed ORR for more information. She told Reveal that she believes ORR is withholding information about more undisclosed sites \u2014 and more children being secretly jailed there.\n\nThe new revelations are the latest in a string of Trump administration scandals related to its detention practices of immigrant children.\n\nIn July 2018, the Trump administration was caught detaining children in an unlicensed Phoenix facility with no kitchen and only a few working toilets. Additional investigations uncovered staffers \"imposing psychotropic drugs on children who don't know what they're taking or what its effects may be.\"\n\nTrump's policy of ripping children away from their parents and placing them in cages resulted in national and international outrage. While Trump claims to have stopped separating children \u2014 including infants and toddlers \u2014 from their parents and throwing them in baby jails, new reports of family separation continue to surface.\n\nEvery day, Trump and his administration show how little they care for the health and well-being of immigrant children \u2014 even to the point of hiding their very existence.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

If the program malfunctions, as the report indicates is likely to occur, veterans will be left in the lurch while they need medical care.\n\nThe new system is tasked with integrating data from six separate VA systems, but those connections are not ready yet. The lag in connecting all those systems is likely to lengthen each appointment with VA doctors by five to 10 minutes, creating a ripple effect that would exclude 75,000 veterans from treatment every day.\n\n\"By suggesting that VA\u2019s planned IT solutions are inadequate, and that VA has not given itself enough time to develop a workable system, this report raises real concerns that implementation may be delayed and could even disrupt healthcare for 75,000 veterans every day,\" said Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA), chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, in a statement.\n\nThe faulty system and its implementation can be traced directly to Trump and his underlings.\n\nProPublica, which broke the story by obtaining the U.S. Digital Service report, noted that the VA's IT division \"was led by a Trump campaign alumnus\" for most of 2018 while the VA was without a permanent IT chief (one finally joined in January).\n\nThat Trump crony also worked with the \"Mar-a-Lago Three,\" three friends of Trump's and club members of his Mar-a-Lago resort who held improper influence over VA policy.\n\nTogether, Trump's Mar-a-Lago cronies pushed the VA toward privatization \u2014 and toward the implementation of the flawed software system.\n\nCongress is currently investigating the VA and how Trump's friends were given a wide range of unaccountable power over the system.\n\nTrump professes to be a supporter and advocate for veterans and the military. But on a vital issue for them, their health care, he instead did what he always does and gave his cronies and underlings free reign to screw things up for their own profit.\n\nVeterans will be hurt, and face delays in their health care.

Gardner was rebuked by his hometown newspaper, which revoked its endorsement of the senator after Gardner's vote to uphold the fake emergency.\n\nNeither does Sen.

That's a huge discrepancy.\n\nDespite this, Deutsche Bank decided to loan Trump a whopping $2 billion over the years \u2014 much of which he defaulted on.\n\nThe bank has been secretive about why it kept approving hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to Trump, despite the fact that Trump often defaulted on these loans and in the process caused financial harm to the bank's clients.\n\nIn fact, the Times reports, the bank appeared so worried about its ties to Trump that after he won the 2016 election, Deutsche Bank employees were banned from using the word \"Trump.\"\n\nYet the bank will now finally have to start handing over documents and testifying publicly about its cozy relationship with Trump, after two Democratic-led committees in the House \u2014 the Intelligence Committee and the House Financial Services Committee \u2014 launched a probe into the bank's ties to Trump.\n\nFailing to do due diligence on picking its clients is already a problem for Deutsche Bank, which is also caught up in a Russian money laundering scandal involving oligarchs smuggling tens of billions in wealth out of Russia.\n\nBut the congressional investigations could bring even more trouble for the bank, as well as Trump himself, as Deutsche Bank will be forced to reveal what it knew about Trump's troubled finances and why it decided to overlook those troubles to give him huge loans.\n\nSome of the biggest revelations in the investigation could come from testimony from Rosemary T. Vrablic, a managing director of Deutsche Bank who was responsible for helping Trump secure a number of risky loans to Trump that no one else on Wall Street would entertain. Vrablic expects to be called to testify in the investigations, the New York Times reported.\n\nUltimately, Trump and Deutsche Bank's relationship is bizarre. And Congress may soon finally get to the bottom of it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

One of the accounts, @DevinNunesMom \u2014 a parody account impersonating Nunes' mother \u2014 says Nunes was so busy \"cradling the president's balls full time\" that he no longer had time for his constituents.\n\nThe account also posted a graphic \"diagram\" about how the relationship between Nunes, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin worked. (We won't describe the diagram here, but it can be found on page 18 of the 40-page complaint.)\n\nOf course, public figures have a far higher bar to prove libel or slander. And given that Nunes is a very public figure, it will be hard to prove that mean tweets from throwaway Twitter accounts amount to anything other than mean tweets.\n\nThere's even a law on the books that may protect social media sites like Twitter from being held liable for tweets sent by accounts on its site.\n\nIn the end, all the lawsuit may have accomplished is drawing attention to otherwise obscure Twitter accounts that no one cared about until Nunes filed his dumb lawsuit.\n\nMaybe Nunes will finally learn his lesson about the Streisand Effect.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But rather than invite both beat reporters (who regularly cover the State Department) and faith-based outlets, the department intentionally excluded anyone who did not meet their religious litmus test.\n\nThe department went so far as to rescind an invitation accidentally emailed to a non-faith-based reporter from the New York Post. The exclusions were first reported by CNN.\n\nNBC's Andrea Mitchel said that she \"can't recall religion being a test before for journalists.\" Mitchell also said that Cabinet secretaries usually provide transcripts for all on-the-record interviews, but the State Department is refusing to do so in this case. They won't even provide a list of who participated and what, if any, criteria were used to determine whether a reporter was religious enough to be invited.\n\nReporters from CNN tried to RSVP for the call but were ignored. However, a EWTN Global Catholic Television reporter who was not originally invited to participate told CNN they were allowed to join the call after they reached out to the State Department.\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost, the State Department defended their decision to exclude reporters based on religion. \"The Department regularly engages in a broad array of media activities. Some of those engagements .... are open to any interested domestic or international press,\" the statement said. \"Other engagements are more targeted or designed for topic, region, or audience-specific media. This has always been the case.\"\n\nThe secrecy and lack of transparency did not sit well with former State Department spokesperson John Kirby.\n\n\"These officials are public servants,\" Kirby told CNN. \"What they say \u2014 in its entirety \u2014 is inherently of public interest. It's inappropriate and irresponsible not to observe that obligation.\"\n\nHe added that \"to exclude beat reporters from something as universally relevant as religious freedom in the Middle East strikes me as not only self-defeating but incredibly small-minded.\"\n\nFor years, Trump has regularly attacked the media as the \"enemy of the people.\" Now his administration is picking and choosing who gets access to top officials, and they are using a religious litmus test to do it.\n\nThat's not only unfair. It's downright un-American.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

At the time, Nadler criticized Republicans for their failure over the past two years to \"conduct responsible oversight,\" adding, \"Congress must provide a check on abuses of power.\"\n\nThe committee said that they have heard back from \"a large number of recipients,\" and that many \"have either sent or agreed to send documents\" to the committee. In an MSNBC interview Monday evening, Nadler said that Trump's former campaign chair and White House chief of staff Steve Bannon turned over thousands of pages of documents to the committee.\n\nFor legal reasons, some recipients of the letter requested a subpoena from the committee before they are able to comply and send even more information to Nadler and his team.\n\n\"I am encouraged by the responses we have received since sending these initial letters two weeks ago,\" Nadler said in a statement. \"It is my hope that we will receive cooperation from the remainder of the list, and will be working to find an appropriate accommodation with any individual who may be reluctant to cooperate with our investigation.\"\n\nWhile many entities are cooperating with the investigation, Politico reports that Trump's personal lawyers are stonewalling Nadler's request.

Yang owns several south Florida massage parlors and was the original owner of the massage parlor where New England Patriots owner (and Trump friend) Robert Kraft was arrested for soliciting prostitution. Since the initial report, photos have surfaced of Yang at numerous Trump events, posing with high-profile Republicans including Trump's adult sons, Don Jr. and Eric.\n\nThe first part of the letter asks for an investigation into Yang's possible involvement in \"prostitution and human trafficking in which immigrant women are forced to serve as sex workers\" at the massage parlors she currently owns and operates.\n\nIn addition, Yang is accused of selling access to Trump and his family to clients from China. In addition to massage parlors, Yang reportedly operated a business which advertised \"the opportunity to interact with the president\" and promised access to the Trump family, especially at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort owned by Trump.\n\n\"If true,\" the letter states, \"these allegations raise serious counter intelligence concerns.\" The letter quotes from FBI Director Christopher Wray, who told Congress that Chinese counterintelligence is \"more deep, more diverse, more vexing, more challenging, more comprehensive and more concerning than any counterintelligence threat I can think of.\"\n\nThe members of Congress are concerned that Yang could have knowingly or unknowingly allowed foreign government agents to politicians \"to acquire potential material for blackmail or other even more nefarious purposes.\"\n\nEven before this latest scandal erupted, Democrats in Congress were concerned about Trump's willingness to discuss policies with Mar-a-Lago members, who pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to become a part of the club.\n\n\"One of things that we have been concerned about is security,\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told ABC News. \"We don't know how safe it is from a communications standpoint.\"\n\nA joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer encouraged Director Wray to heed the request from Congress and open an investigation, saying the situation is \"very concerning.\"\n\nAn investigation will shed light on whether or not Trump, his family, or his advisors made themselves available to foreign spies who knew access to Trump could be easily bought.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The Daily Beast reports that focus on domestic terror within the Department of Homeland Security has \"waned\" since the end of the Obama administration.\n\nYet the recent data on the internal terror threat led DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to admit on Monday that the danger has grown.\n\nEven as New Zealand continued to deal with the fallout of the massacre, Trump appeared to be in denial still.

But it turns out that was just another broken promise by a boastful liar.\n\nInstead, an embarrassed Trump melted down this weekend in reaction to a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that recently stopped production.\n\nTrump tweeted Saturday, \"Because the economy is so good, General Motors must get their Lordstown, Ohio, plant open, maybe in a different form or with a new owner, FAST!\" \"G.M. MUST ACT QUICKLY. Time is of the essence!\"\n\nThe next day, Trump decided to blame union workers \u2014 falsely \u2014 for GM's decision to shutter the plant, going so far as to call out the president of the local union by name.\n\n\"Democrat UAW Local 1112 President David Green ought to get his act together and produce. G.M. let our Country down, but other much better car companies are coming into the U.S. in droves. I want action on Lordstown fast. Stop complaining and get the job done! 3.8% Unemployment!\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's meltdown comes months after GM initially announced, in November 2018, that it would close five North American plants, including the one in Lordstown. At the time, GM noted that Trump's disastrous trade wars cost the company more than $1 billion. Between the five plants, GM said almost 15,000 workers would lose their jobs.\n\nIn early March, the final car \u2014 a Chevy Cruze \u2014 rolled off the Lordstown assembly line.\n\nOn Monday morning, GM made clear to Trump that they were, in fact, working closely with the union when making decisions about which plants to close. But an angry, and perhaps humiliated, Trump was apparently looking for someone to blame in light of his broken campaign pledges.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly told workers in Ohio that he would single-handedly save manufacturing in the region. Trump promised to make Ohio a \"manufacturing behemoth,\" saying companies would flood the region with manufacturing plants and provide jobs.\n\nEven after he was in office, he kept making the same boasts. \"I was looking at some of those big, once-incredible job-producing factories...Those jobs have left Ohio,\" Trump said in Youngstown, Ohio in July 2017. \"They're all coming back. They're all coming back. Don't move. Don't sell your house,\" he advised people.\n\nGM's announcement to shutter five plants came a year after those comments, and Ohio workers know who's to blame.\n\nNanette Senters worked in the Lordstown plant. After news broke that the plant would close, she organized a letter-writing campaign to Trump, asking for him to help. As of early February, she never heard from him. \"He lied,\" Senters said of Trump. \"He doesn't care.\"\n\nYet Trump absolutely refuses to accept responsibility for either his broken promise, or the fact that his failed trade war played a role in the massive layoffs and plant closures.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Trump administration proposed a 56 percent cut to work-study funding for low-income and middle-class college students.\n\nCollege affordability and swelling student loan burdens for students across the country has become a growing problem in recent years.\n\nAnd the Trump administration is hell-bent on making it worse, proposing draconian cuts to work-study and other student loan programs that make it easier for low-income and middle-class students to obtain a college degree.\n\nAccording to top-line numbers from Trump's budget, Trump wants to slash a whopping 56 percent from the federal work-study program \u2014 in which both undergraduate and graduate students with a demonstrated need are paid by the federal government to work part-time jobs at their colleges or universities to help them pay for their education.\n\nThe cut is extremely significant and immediate. For the 2019 fiscal year, Congress appropriated $1.13 billion in federal work-study aid. The Trump administration wants to immediately cut that by 56 percent for the 2020 fiscal year, allocating just $500 billion for the program. That would instantly impact students who count on those funds to pay for their college programs.\n\nThat's not the only massive cuts Trump wants to make to education spending.\n\nTrump also wants to eliminate two kinds of student loans that help students afford college.\n\nThat includes nixing subsidized student loans \u2014 in which certain low-income students are offered loans that do not accrue interest while a student is in college. That lowers the amount of interest a student accrues, making the loan somewhat easier to pay off down the road. Eliminating this program would save $24.3 billion over the course of 10 years, according to Trump's budget.\n\nTrump also wants to get rid of Public Service Loan Forgiveness, in which the government forgives student debt for students who work in certain government or nonprofit organizations.\n\nFor example, many law students utilize this program in order to become public defenders. The program incentivizes law students to become public defenders \u2014 a necessary public service in our legal system \u2014 instead of higher-paid corporate lawyers, as it provides a way for these students to avoid crippling debt that could follow them their entire professional careers.\n\nThe Trump administration says eliminating this loan forgiveness program would save $53 billion over the course of a decade.\n\nOf course, these budget cuts come as Republicans passed Trump's tax scam, which slashed taxes for the richest Americans.\n\nClearly the burden of those tax cuts for the rich has now fallen on lower- and middle-class Americans, whom Trump wants to hamper from getting ahead with hefty cuts to beneficial student loan programs and other parts of the social safety net like food stamps, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThe one bright spot for Americans scared that they could lose these crucial benefits is that the House is now controlled by Democrats \u2014 who would never vote to approve these cruel cuts.\n\nElections matter.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump called on Fox to \"stay strong and fight back with vigor.\"\n\nHe also said the network should \"Keep fighting for Tucker [Carlson], and fight hard for @JudgeJeanine.\"\n\nThe attack on the mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, happened on Friday, in what Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described as one of the nation's \"darkest days.\" Trump refused to acknowledge that the attacks were terrorism in his official statements and remarks, nor did he note that the attack targeted Muslims.\n\nA few hours after the attack, Trump echoed the shooter's rhetoric that immigration is an \"invasion\" of outsiders.\n\nFox News quietly moved Pirro's Saturday program from its lineup after she stoked worldwide condemnation with a bigoted attack on Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN). The previous week Pirro said that because Omar \"wears a hijab\" it was possibly \"indicative of her adherence to sharia law which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution.\"\n\nHer comments were the latest salvo in a long line of bigoted commentary, which is the pro-Trump network's stock in trade.\n\nPirro has referred to an \"Islamic cancer\" and said Muslims have \" conquered us through immigration\" and accused adherents of the religion of engaging in a \"reverse crusade.\" She implored President Barack Obama to \"stop defending Islam, start protecting Americans.\" Pirro also said, \"we've got to start having a conversation about surveillance in mosques.\"\n\nTrump's support of Pirro's fellow Fox News host Tucker Carlson comes after comments of his supporting child rape were reported. On one recording of an interview he did with a \"shock jock,\" Carlson said he wanted a presidential candidate who would vow to kill Muslims and went on a rant about how \"white men\" deserved credit for \"creating civilization.\"\n\nTrump is a racist and Islamophobe who likes to hear his bigoted opinions repeated ad nauseum. In Fox News, he has had a quasi-official propaganda arm spreading the type of bile and hate he enjoys.\n\nThe criticism of Pirro and Carlson rankles Trump because it reflects an American rejection of his hateful ideals.\n\nTrump wants his propagandists operating at full force no matter the blood that is shed in the name of their common cause.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is risking the long-term health of the American economy to keep waging his unnecessary trade war with China.\n\nTrump's reckless trade war is on track to cost America tens of billions of dollars this year and more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years, according to a new study.\n\nThe study, published Friday by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Rhodium Group, shows the staggering economic consequences of Trump's decision to provoke a trade war with China. Over the past year, both countries have placed tariffs on various goods and commodities imported from the other country, which has had harmful ripple effects across the entire economy.\n\nIf Trump continues down this path, the annual cost to U.S. GDP could be up to $60 billion in the first year and $125 billion in the fifth year \u2014 and a total of $1 trillion over 10 years.\n\nIt's hard to imagine numbers that big. But to put it in perspective, $1 trillion over ten years would be more than enough to eliminate child poverty in America.\n\nThe New York Times notes that the escalating trade war is hurting one of the industries Trump was most trying to protect: the information technology sector. He was hoping to win concessions from China over the way the country treats these businesses, but instead, his trade war is already making the industry less competitive.\n\nTrump's trade war has hurt a number of other sectors, as well. General Motors said the trade wars have cost the company about $1 billion, and it has closed several of its North American plants. Farmers across the country are having a hard time exporting their goods, and bankruptcies are skyrocketing. The Republican governor of South Dakota said Trump's trade wars have devastated her state.\n\nThe cost to ordinary Americans is high, too. American families and businesses are basically paying an additional $3 billion in taxes every month because of the higher cost of goods coming from countries like China.\n\nAnd Americans could lose even more. One report says Trump's policies could force more than 2 million Americans out of their jobs.\n\nIt's clear that Trump doesn't understand the first thing about how international trade works, or why his meddling is so destructive.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Janet Yellen, the former chair of the Federal Reserve, if she thinks Trump even understands basic economic concepts, she said, \"No, I do not.\" She said Trump's comments about trade in particular proved that he doesn't understand \"appropriate policy goals.\"\n\nYet Trump continues to bluster his way forward, leaving a trail of bankrupt farmers and devastated states in his wake. And if he doesn't find a way to fix it, the trade war could be a massive, $1 trillion mistake.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Previous reporting by the New York Times has linked Broidy to shady foreign influence schemes.\n\nIn addition to donating more than $160,000 to the Republican National Committee (RNC), Broidy helped raise $108 million for a joint fundraising venture for the Trump campaign and the Republican Party in 2016.\n\nBroidy played a high-profile role in Trump's 2016 campaign, and was rewarded by Trump after the election with a job as a deputy finance chair of the RNC.\n\nBut Broidy abruptly resigned in April 2018 after the Wall Street Journal uncovered evidence that he secretly paid hush money to a former mistress in order to hide the affair. Trump's longtime lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, who served as a deputy finance chair of the RNC alongside Broidy, had arranged the $1.6 million payments from Broidy to his former mistress, Playboy model Shera Bechard.\n\nCohen also arranged illegal hush money payments to Trump's alleged mistress, Stormy Daniels, prior to the 2016 election.\n\nThrough his lawyers, Broidy has previously claimed to be innocent of allegations that he took money from or worked on behalf of foreign governments.

Cory Gardner \"a mistake,\" which they now regret. The scathing editorial came hours after Gardner's no vote on a resolution to terminate Trump's fake national emergency declaration.\n\n\"We endorsed Sen. Cory Gardner in 2014 because we believed he'd be a statesman,\" the editorial begins, saying they expected Gardner to bring fresh leadership and ideas to the Senate.\n\n\"We see now that was a mistake \u2014 consider this our resolution of disapproval.\"\n\nGardner joined most of his Republican colleagues in abandoning their oath to the Constitution to side with Trump on the issue of the southern border. Trump spent two years trying to convince Congress to fork over billions of dollars to build a wall he previously promised Mexico would pay for.\n\nWhen Congress repeatedly rejected his demand, Trump decided to declare a national emergency at the border and steal money from troops and military families to build a wall, usurping Congress's authority to allocate government spending.\n\nThe Senate voted 59-41 to terminate Trump's declaration, with Gardner doing exactly what Trump told him to.\n\nThe entire fake emergency declaration was \"a constitutional crisis and one of Colorado's two senators has failed the test,\" the board wrote.\n\nGardner's vote on the fake emergency was not the first time he abandoned his principles in the Trump era. The Post also criticizes him for flip-flopping on his support of Trump.\n\nIn 2016, after a video surfaced of Trump bragging about being a sexual predator, Gardner said that he \"cannot and will not support someone who brags about degrading and assaulting women.\"nBut three years later, Gardner suddenly embraced someone who assaults women, gleefully endorsing Trump's 2020 candidacy.\n\nThe endorsement of Trump did not sit well with the Post editorial board, but it was the vote on the fake emergency that they described as \"the last straw.\"\n\n\"We no longer know what principles guide the senator and regret giving him our support in a close race against Mark Udall.\"\n\nGardner is already a top 2020 target for Democrats, who are eyeing his seat as one necessary to reclaim the Senate majority. In 2018, Democrats swept all statewide offices and took control of both legislative chambers, making the state look increasingly blue. And a poll in December 2018 put Gardner in \"politically toxic territory,\" said Ian Silverii, executive director of ProgressNow Colorado, the group that commissioned the poll.\n\nThe Denver Post did not forswear endorsing Cory Gardner in his 2020 re-election campaign, but it seems unlikely.

Yesterday, a New York appellate court told him he's wrong. Now Trump will be spending part of his summer sitting for depositions in the case of Zervos v. Trump.\n\nSummer Zervos was a contestant on \"The Apprentice.\" She also, along with a dozen other women, came forward in October 2016 and accused Trump of a variety of sexual misconduct. In her case, she alleged that Trump kissed her, pressed his genitals against her, and groped her.\n\nEven though Trump had been caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women, he immediately declared that Zervos and her fellow accusers were all liars, saying they came forward to hurt his campaign and that he would sue them all after the election was over.\n\nInstead, in 2017 Zervos sued Trump for defamation for saying she lied.\n\nTrump and his legal team have fought this for nearly two years. First, they argued that he wasn't defaming her, because calling her a liar was expressing a political opinion. They also argued that Trump couldn't be sued in state court while he is still in office.\n\nTurns out he can. And it is, in part, due to Bill Clinton. In Clinton v. Jones, the United States Supreme Court held that then-President Clinton could be sued while in office for an \"unofficial\" act \u2014 something unrelated to his duties as president.\n\nClinton was sued in federal court, so the Trump team tried to say that holding doesn't apply to state courts. But the New York appellate court didn't buy that argument, reminding Trump that the United States is a government of laws, not men \u2014 which means that even Trump isn't above the law.\n\nNow, the lawsuit goes forward. The deposition deadline is June 28, which means that before then Zervos' lawyers get to question Trump, under oath, about his sexual assault of Zervos. It also means that unless the sides choose to settle or Trump's attorneys get this ruling overturned, we will soon see Trump take the stand to defend his terrible behavior.\n\nFor a long time, Trump has treated the presidency like a get out of jail free card.

In fact, more than half of the Judiciary Committee's document requests, 52 out of 81, include requests for information about Ivanka Trump.\n\nThe congressional probe's main focus is whether and how Donald Trump obstructed justice, abused his power, or engaged in public corruption.\n\nBut the committee also appears to be looking at Ivanka Trump's potential financial conflicts of interest \u2014 and even whether she violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by profiting from foreign governments while serving as her father's adviser in the White House.\n\nWhen it comes to Ivanka's shady financial dealings, there's a lot to investigate. Some of it could also spell trouble for her father, since their family business dealings have long been intertwined.\n\nEmails uncovered by ProPublica and WNYC showed that while she was still an executive at the Trump Organization, Ivanka directed suspicious spending on behalf of Trump's inaugural committee that may have illegally enriched her family.\n\nThe New York Times notes that Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, never fully divested from their companies even after making their White House roles official, and that they make tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars from investments they're still involved in.\n\nIvanka made money off of her fashion brand while representing the U.S. government, and continues to pursue lucrative trademarks in China \u2014 one of which was approved the same day her father lifted sanctions on a big Chinese corporation.\n\nFormer Trump attorney Michael Cohen told Congress last month that Ivanka was one of the people he kept apprised of updates on the Trump Tower Moscow project \u2014 a deal so shady and potentially problematic for Trump that Cohen, when he was still representing Trump, lied to Congress about how long Trump and his team had pursued it.\n\nCohen's testimony throws doubt on Ivanka Trump's claims that she knew \"literally almost nothing\" about the Moscow project \u2014 which the Trump team was still pursuing at the same time Russia was meddling in the 2016 election to help Trump.\n\nAnd while this was before Trump ran for president, another investigation by ProPublica and WNYC found that Ivanka routinely helped her father mislead buyers and investors on Trump Organization real estate projects. In order to attract more money and outside investment, the Trumps overstated how many units had been sold and lied about how much stake the Trump family had in the projects.\n\nIvanka Trump tries to cultivate a soft, moderate, professional image that's very unlike her boorish father (or her brothers, for that matter). Some reporting even indicates that Democrats are worried about backlash if they directly target Ivanka right out of the gate.\n\nBut she's not out of the woods yet. In fact, her troubles may be just beginning.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Worst of all? No one seems to know who these \"volunteers\" would be.\n\nIt might be literal volunteers \u201a\u2014 totally random people that want to go down to the border and \"help.\" The problem is that the people most allured by Trump's hateful rhetoric about the border tend to be far-right vigilantes and unregulated militia members.\n\nPerhaps mercifully, no one is even sure if it's possible to allow just anyone volunteer. One Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official said, \"The lawyers are trying to figure out whether it's possible at all.\"\n\nIt could also be the \"Surge Capacity Force\" maintained by DHS. That's a group of volunteers \u2014 not from the general population, but from DHS and other federal agencies \u2014 who are used during catastrophic incidents like hurricanes and floods. They're basically used when FEMA is stretched too thin, like during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. But there's no record of them having been used for non-catastrophic occurrences.\n\nNo matter how Trump tries to spin it, there is no border crisis. Yes, illegal border crossings have been rising of late, but they remain drastically below their peaks in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump's national emergency declaration is entirely unnecessary, but that isn't stopping him from demanding more and more people go to the border to participate in this charade.\n\nLast Thanksgiving, he kept troops away from their family, having them instead perform the vital task of shoveling horse manure at the border. Approximately 4,500 troops have been at the border since October 2018 and are scheduled to remain until September 2019. They're busy doing things like stringing concertina wire.\n\nAn additional volunteer force is not just unneeded \u2014 it's outrageous. At best, it would serve just to prop up Trump's lie that there is a national emergency at the border. At worst, it could be comprised of people who would actively harm immigrants. No matter what, it's a terrible idea.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

In fact, the release \u2014 titled \"EPA Bans Consumer Sales of Methylene Chloride Paint Removers, Protecting Public\" \u2014 gave the impression that the Trump administration was banning the substance altogether.\n\n\"After analyzing the health impacts and listening to affected families, EPA is taking action to stop the use of this chemical in paint removers intended for consumers,\" EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler said in the release. \"Today\u2019s decision reflects EPA\u2019s commitment to ensure that chemicals in the retail marketplace are safe for the American public.\"\n\nYet Wheeler did not let on that the new ban is weaker than the ban Obama's EPA proposed.\n\nFor now, the chemical will be available for use for contractors while the EPA takes public comments on whether contractors should also be banned from using the substance.\n\nFamilies of people who died from the chemical are outraged over the EPA's decision to implement a weaker ban on the chemical.\n\nThey include Wendy Hartley, whose 21-year-old son Kevin died from the chemical in 2017 while finishing bathtubs for his family business. Hartley filed a lawsuit in January against the government for having failed to ban the substance.\n\n\"I am deeply disappointed that the EPA has decided to weaken its proposed ban on methylene chloride,\" Hartley said in a statement to the Washington Post. \"Getting this deadly chemical out of consumers\u2019 hands is a step in the right direction \u2014 a step that was started by retailers nationwide. Workers who use methylene chloride will now be left unprotected and at risk of health issues or death. I will continue my fight until the EPA does its job.\"\n\nBut given recent history, it's hardly shocking that Trump's EPA would green-light the sale of toxic chemicals.\n\nIt has, after all, weakened a ban on cancer-causing asbestos, contemplated allowing minors to handle pesticides that cause brain damage and cancer, and has refused to set limits on the levels of toxic chemicals in drinking water.\n\nAllowing workers to continue handling a chemical that has caused dozens of deaths is simply par for the course for Trump's EPA.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The USMCA is already fixing the broken NAFTA deal,\" he wrote.\n\nBut there's a problem with that \u2014 the deal is not law, nor has it even come to a vote in Congress.\n\nUSMCA (the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) has not been ratified by Congress, as is required of all international agreements.\n\n\"Congress has not ratified the USMCA,\" said Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL), mocking the embarrassing pronouncement from Trump. Rush also noted reports that Trump has deferred to Speaker Nancy Pelosi's schedule for when a vote can be presented on it.\n\nUSMCA has also not been ratified by the legislatures in Mexico or Canada.\n\nTrump appears to believe the signing ceremony he had with Mexican President Enrique Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is all he needs. Or he is lying.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's trade war policy, which has been implemented, has been devastating to farmers and a multibillion-dollar drain on the American economy.\n\nTrump loves to take victory laps for job announcements (and far too often much of the press has been happy to play along).\n\nBefore he was sworn in, he and Mike Pence patted themselves on the back for arranging millions of tax dollars to go to Carrier in Indiana. But at the end of the day, the deal did not prevent thousands of jobs from going overseas.\n\nSimilarly, Trump worked with then-Wisconsin governor Scott Walker to hand $4 billion in subsidies to Foxconn, promising that the promised facility would be a jobs bonanza. The deal was a complete flop and the factory is not being built. The company gets to keep the money, however.\n\nTrump is a terrible dealmaker who touts \"The Art of the Deal,\" but more often than not he's ended up putting America on the losing side of bets. He can't work out deals with foreign adversaries, businesses, or governments.\n\nSo whenever he can, he just makes up lies and misleads about how the deal that isn't even on the books is \"already fixing\" things.

Once he was the Acting Attorney General of the United States, but now he is merely a civilian who appears to have perjured himself before the House of Representatives.\n\nIn early February, Whitaker testified before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee in a public session. It didn't go well. He was evasive about things like the child separation policy and tried to run out the clock on answering the chair of the committee, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), when he didn't like the question.\n\nAll that evasiveness got him was a letter from Nadler telling him his answers were \"unsatisfactory, incomplete, or contradicted by other evidence\" and that he had to come back to the House to \"clarify\" his testimony, this time behind closed doors.\n\nWhitaker did so yesterday, and that didn't go well either. Speaking with reporters, Rep. Nadler said that, unlike during his public testimony, Whitaker didn't deny that Trump reached out to him to talk about Michael Cohen's case. Contradicting or seriously diverging from his sworn testimony is a bit of a problem for Whitaker. It's also a bit of a problem for Trump, as it goes towards whether Trump was trying to obstruct the Cohen matter.\n\nThat wasn't all.\n\nWhitaker also told the committee that he had talked about Cohen's case with DOJ staff and said some of the charges were \"specious\" since John Edwards wasn't convicted on similar charges.\n\nNadler also said that Whitaker didn't deny talking with U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman about his recusal from the Cohen case. Berman had recused himself from the Cohen matter prior to the FBI's raid on Cohen's offices, a recusal that was probably deeply troubling to Trump, who had hand-picked Berman. Relatedly, Whitaker didn't deny he was \u201cdirectly involved in conversations about whether to fire one or more U.S. attorneys.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who were also in the room insist that Nadler is mischaracterizing the conversations, but Whitaker himself has been notably silent. Perhaps he's reached the end of his ability to cover for Trump. Or maybe, as Elise Jordan of TIME speculated, he's just terrified:\n\nAt this stage, we should expect that plenty of Trump officials are lying to us, but it is still just jaw-dropping to me that the acting attorney general of the united states blatantly lied to Congress and was concerned enough about going to prison that he came back a week later to clean up.\n\nWhitaker isn't the only one who should be scared. His testimony directly implicates Trump in yet another obstruction attempt. The guy just can't help himself.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Mark Takano wants to know just how many more wealthy Mar-a-Lago members are trying to influence policy at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe House Veterans' Affairs Committee is broadening its investigation into the growing scandal around wealthy members of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort who have exerted undue influence on American veterans policy, despite having no official government position and no experience with veterans issues.\n\nUntil recently, the scandal centered around three Mar-a-Lago members in particular \u2014 but a recent report from ProPublica offered evidence that the problem was even more widespread.\n\nThat's why Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA), chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, sent a letter Thursday afternoon to the Department of Veterans Affairs demanding to know just how deep the corruption goes.\n\nProPublica reported that a cosmetic dentist with no known experience in government or the military wrote a note on Mar-a-Lago stationary to Trump (whom the dentist affectionately referred to as \"King\"), advocating for a new committee to partner with the American Dental Association to oversee federal spending related to veterans, Native Americans, and poor children.\n\nTrump not only read the letter, but also apparently ordered his staff to send the letter to the head of the Veterans Affairs department.\n\nIn his letter to the VA, Takano demanded any and all documents the department has that indicate influence from Mar-a-Lago. Takano told the department to turn over \"any documents or communications on stationary bearing the name, 'The Mar-a-Lago Club,'' as well as any and all \"documents or communications sent or received from members or associates of the Mar-a-Lago Club in the possession of the Department.\"\n\nTakano wrote that he is alarmed by the volume of influence peddling by wealthy Mar-a-Lago elites \"over policy, personnel, and program decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\" Trump often spends long weekends at the club he still owns and where members \u2014 who must pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to join the club \u2014 have intimate access to him and his advisers.\n\nPrior to this new development, Takano was already investigating the so-called \"Mar-a-Lago three,\" a triumvirate of members who seemed to exert influence over the VA despite having no official position within the government. According to a previous ProPublica investigation, the men \u2014 Ike Perlmutter (chairman and CEO of Marvel Entertainment), Bruce Moskowitz (a doctor), and Marc Sherman (an attorney) \u2014 reviewed confidential, multi-billion projects on record-keeping, even though none of the men have any relevant experience.\n\nIn 2018, voters demanded that Trump and his culture of corruption be held accountable. Takano is heeding that call, and veterans groups are praising the effort.\n\nThe committee's work \"is absolutely crucial to getting to the bottom of this, and all veterans should encourage him to continue,\" Jon Soltz, chairman and co-founder of Vote Vets, told Shareblue Media. While Vote Vets has its own lawsuit regarding this matter, Soltz added, \"congressional oversight is indispensable.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Takano said, rather than cooperate with Congress, the Trump administration \"keeps stonewalling our document request.\"\n\n\"It's time for transparency \u2014 our veterans deserve to know who is making their healthcare decisions,\" Takano said.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) spoke on CNN about Trump's hateful rhetoric, and called out those who continue to enable him despite the repercussions.\n\n\"Words do have consequences,\" Blumenthal told host Alisyn Camerota. \"We know that at the very pinnacle of power in our own country, people are talking about 'good people on both sides,'\" he added, alluding to Trump's praise of neo-Nazis and white supremacists who rallied in Charlottesville in the summer of 2017. One of those white supremacists murdered a counter-protester.\n\nCamerota jumped in, clarifying that Blumenthal is, indeed, talking about Trump.\n\n\"I think it's more than the president \u2014 it's the people who enable him and who fail to stand up to him and speak out,\" Blumenthal said.\n\nHe brought the conversation back to Trump's rhetoric about immigrants when describing the need for a national emergency at the southern border.\n\n\"Words have consequences, like saying we have an invasion on our border and talking about people as though they were different in some fatal way,\" he said.\n\nBlumenthal then went on to link Trump directly to the terrorist attack in New Zealand, saying, \"I think the public discourse from the president on down is a factor in some of these actions.\"\n\nCamerota adds that the shooter put out a manifesto \"connecting the dots\" between hateful rhetoric and his own violent actions.\n\nTrump campaigned on divisive rhetoric demonizing not only Muslims but also a wide range of immigrants. He kicked off his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists.\" By the end of 2015, Trump called for a Muslim ban.\n\nOnce in office, Trump maintained his appeal to white nationalists, hiring advisors linked to Nazi groups and, as Blumenthal mentioned, praising those carrying Nazi flags as \"very fine people.\" He referred to the homeland of many Black immigrants as \"shithole countries,\" and has repeatedly demonized immigrants along the southern border as murderers and drug dealers as a way to energize and encourage his supporters.\n\nTrump banked on using xenophobic and racist language to rally voters in the 2018 midterm election, but the plan largely backfired. Democrats won historic victories across the country and regained control of the House of Representatives.\n\nBut Trump has not slowed down, as Blumenthal mentioned, and continues to use anti-immigrant language in his reasoning for declaring a national emergency at the southern border.\n\nAnd now, the world is seeing what that type of hateful rhetoric can lead to as a terrorist praised Trump before murdering 49 innocent people.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Ed Markey of Massachusetts.\n\n\"With our futures at stake, we call for radical legislative action to combat climate change and its countless detrimental effects on the American people,\" the organizers wrote on their website. \"We are striking for the Green New Deal, for a fair and just transition to a 100 percent renewable economy, and for ending the creation of additional fossil fuel infrastructure. Additionally, we believe the climate crisis should be declared a national emergency because we are running out of time.\"\n\nOf course, Republicans have denounced the Green New Deal at every turn. They've made false and ridiculous claims about what the deal would do, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is attempting to play gotcha politics on the legislation rather than hold a genuine debate about it in the Senate.\n\nOne GOP lawmaker even likened the deal to \"genocide,\" in perhaps the most outrageous attack on the proposed deal yet.\n\nBut if these young people are any indication, Republicans' policy of climate denial won't be a winning one in the future.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He \"wrote that a trip to France in 2017 convinced him that the country was under 'invasion' by 'nonwhites,'\" the Washington Post reported.\n\nIt's also very common for white supremacists to argue that immigrants or other groups are \"invading\" white countries or trying to \"replace\" whites.\n\nTrump made the remarks as he signed a veto of legislation passed by Congress that would repeal his fake declaration of a \"national emergency\" at the border.\n\nThe emergency declaration itself is also racist, since Trump is trying to use it to fund an unnecessary border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. He consistently uses racist rhetoric to demonize the immigrants he says need to be kept out of the U.S., in order to justify building his wall.\n\nTrump didn't just echo white supremacist rhetoric during the veto signing; he also denied that white nationalism is a growing threat, suggesting that it's just a small group of people. In reality, however, white nationalism and white supremacy are on the rise and are a bigger threat than other extremist ideologies.\n\nTrump has also been specifically criticized for his anti-Muslim rhetoric, which \u2014 amplified by his fellow Republicans \u2014 has fueled increased hostility against Muslims in the United States and worldwide.\n\nYet even as New Zealand doctors are still working on victims of a massive terrorist attack against Muslims, Trump could not contain or constrain himself.\n\nBigotry defines who Trump is at his core.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chair of the powerful House Oversight Committee, wants to hear from the Fox News reporter whose bosses refused to let her run a story about Trump's hush money payments to adult actress Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election.\n\nThe reporter, Diana Falzone, uncovered the story \u2014 but was told it would not run because those in charge of Fox News wanted Donald Trump to win the 2016 election.\n\nMSNBC's Ari Melber broke the story Thursday night that Congress wanted to hear from Falzone. Melber readon air parts of a letter Cummings sent to Falzone, requesting documents and information related to \"women alleging extra marital affairs with President Trump, payments by the President or anyone on behalf of him to silence those people.\" The request also seeks any documents about potential campaign finance violations.\n\nThe letter is necessary because Falzone no longer works for Fox News and signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) forbidding her from discussing her work during her time there. But Falzone's lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, told Melber that this letter from Cummings \"is an exception to the NDA.\"\n\n\"Nobody can enter an NDA that will interfere with a government investigation,\" Smith explained.\n\nSmith added that Falzone plans to cooperate with the investigation, provide testimony, and turn over the requested documents.\n\nWhile the story of a presidential nominee paying hush money to his adult film actress mistress would be explosive on its own, Trump's own Department of Justice concluded Trump's conduct in this matter is likely criminal. That's because Trump directed his personal attorney and longtime fixer, Michael Cohen, to make the hush money payments for the express purpose of influencing the 2016 campaign.\n\nFor his part in this crime and others, Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison. Congress, special counsel Robert Mueller, and the DOJ's Southern District of New York (SDNY) office continue to investigate Trump's role in this and other potential criminal activity.\n\nIn addition to Cohen, Trump's former campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, a campaign aid, and Trump's first national security adviser have all pleaded guilty to a variety of crimes ranging from financial fraud to lying to the FBI.\n\nWith this letter, Cummings now frees Falzone from her NDA \u2014 and her testimony may shed light on what Trump knew and when he knew it when his campaign staff and members of his inner circle broke the law.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan has a far too cozy relationship with his previous employer Boeing.\n\nLate last year, after Trump forced out his then-Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, he named Patrick Shanahan as acting secretary. Shanahan had spent time as Mattis' Deputy Director, but otherwise had no foreign policy or military experience. What Shanahan did have, though, was three decades of experience working for Boeing.\n\nNow, it looks like his cozy relationship with his former employee may pose an ethics problem for Shanahan.\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) just filed a complaint with the acting inspector general of the Defense Department. In that complaint, they're asking for an investigation into whether Shanahan impermissibly promotes Boeing's military products while disparaging other companies, such as Lockheed Martin.\n\nDoing that is a violation of the standards of ethical conduct for employees of the executive branch, which Shanahan had to sign when he joined the administration. Those standards prohibit using a public office for private gain and failing to be impartial in decisionmaking. He also signed an additional ethics pledge particular to Boeing, requiring him to recuse himself from anything related to Boeing.\n\nThat isn't happening.\n\nSince becoming acting secretary, Shanahan has relentlessly promoted Boeing, including forcing the Air Force to buy up to 80 of Boeing's F-15Xs in the next five years, in spite of the fact that the Air Force says they don't want them.\n\nShanahan also isn't shy about dissing Boeing's competitors. He called Lockheed Martin's fighter jet \"fucked up\" and said that Lockheed doesn't know how to run a program.\n\nIn any other administration, this behavior would be disqualifying. Here, it will likely get Shanahan a promotion. It looks like no one else wants the job of Secretary of Defense, so Shanahan's acting title may soon become permanent.\n\nBoeing has been trying to buy Trump via other channels as well. They donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and their CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, has made the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to curry favor with Trump.\n\nAnd of course Muilenburg had Trump's ear as the tragedy of the Boeing 737 Max unfolded. While most other countries were grounding the planes, Trump was chatting on the phone with Muilenberg, who was assuring him everything was just fine.\n\nA defense secretary in bed with Boeing, getting the Air Force to waste $1 billion on planes it doesn't want. Boeing's CEO with a speed dial to Trump, telling him everything is just fine even as his company's planes fall out of the sky.

    "text": "Rep. Rob Bishop also implied that death would be preferable to seeing the Green New Deal become law.\n\nOutlandish Republican claims about the Green New Deal, the progressive plan to ensure future generations have clean air and clean water, took a decidedly dark turn Thursday morning when Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT) claimed the ideas found in the Green New Deal are \"tantamount to genocide.\"\n\nThe remarks came at a Republican press conference demanding Democrats hold congressional hearings on the landmark climate legislation. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and, Bishop, the top Republican on the Natural Resources Committee, along with several other members, allege the Green New Deal goes too far. But none of the comments were as startling as Bishop's.\n\nFollowing the press conference, Axios reminded him that genocide means killing a group of people based on their ethnicity or belonging to a certain group. Rather than rephrase, Bishop stood by his remarks, saying, \"I'm an ethnic. I'm a westerner.\"\n\nPushed further and asked if he thought implementing the Green New Deal would literally kill him, Bishop not only said yes, he said that death would be preferable.\n\n\"Killing would be positive if you implement everything the Green New Deal actually wants to,\" Bishop said. \"That's why the the Green New Deal is not ready for prime time.\"\n\nBut the Green New Deal does not call for the large-scale massacre of any group of people. It doesn't call for killing anyone at all. It simply acknowledges that climate change is real and offers a series of policy prescriptions to address and mitigate the man-made causes of climate change.\n\nThe bill, championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), hopes to address climate-change crisis.\n\nA recent report from top scientists says that countries only have about 12 years left to address climate change before devastating outcomes become inevitable. The report warns of famine, refugee crises, sea level rises, increasingly powerful storms, and massive droughts if Republicans have their way and significant changes do not take place.\n\nBut when lawmakers step forward to address the crisis, Republicans mock the efforts and lie about what the impact will be. Trump lied about the plan, saying it would eliminate air travel. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), a member of the House Republican leadership team, lied and said the plan would outlaw cars. Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, went so far as to say the bill would ban ice cream (spoiler: it won't).\n\nBut those lies pale in comparison to Bishop, who blithely likened the bill's passage to atrocities committed by Hitler and other of history's worst murderers.\n\nRepublican hyperbole is nothing new. Republicans have called Social Security a \"folly,\" warned that Medicare and Medicaid would usher in socialism, and predicted \"death panels\" if the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, became law.\n\nBishop's new accusations that liken the Green New Deal to genocide are as wrong as they are appalling.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

I stood by that principle during the Obama administration, and I stand by it now.\"\n\nBut when it came time to vote, Tillis proved himself a liar. Buckling under pressure from the White House, and likely hoping to keep Trump supporters from voting him out of office in 2020, he caved at the last minute and changed his vote \u2014 supporting the action of Trump's that he had just blasted as \"executive overreach.\"\n\nTillis announced his flip-flop in a floor speech moments before the Senate voted to pass a resolution blocking Trump's fake national emergency.\n\nTrump declared his fake national emergency at the border only after Congress denied him $5.7 billion for a border wall that Trump previously promised Mexico would pay for. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a measure to overturn Trump's declaration, forcing the Senate to hold a vote on it as well.\n\nTrump has spent the past several weeks encouraging Republican senators to abandon their principles and their oath to the Constitution and show true loyalty to him.\n\nAnd apparently, it worked with Tillis.\n\nTillis is facing a tough re-election race in North Carolina next year. Washington Post reporter Robert Costa said that prominent conservatives told him they were planning to mount a primary challenge to Tillis if he stuck to his principles.\n\nTillis also drew the ire of the Democratic Party in his home state.\n\n\"Senator Tillis made a big show about how he'd stand up for North Carolina but caved under pressure,\" North Carolina Democratic Party spokesman Robert Howard said in a statement shortly after Tillis's floor speech.\n\n\"Tillis again reminded the entire state who he is: a spineless politician who won't keep his promises and looks out for himself instead of North Carolina.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He noted the policy would remove barriers preventing America \"from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine who can best accomplish the mission.\"\n\nTrump's ban on transgender service, if implemented, is likely to hurt the military and degrade American safety while enshrining bigotry in government policy.\n\n\"Based on my experience, both as a combat arms officer and a medical provider, the answer is unequivocally is that my transition, and those of so many others, has dramatically increased the readiness and lethality of every branch of the Armed Forces,\" said U.S. Army Capt.

Larry Craig was arrested for the same year Carlson made the comment.\n\nExclusive: Tucker Carlson's sexual comments about a Miss Teen USA pageant are some of the most shocking yet - in new unearthed audio. pic.twitter.com/iOrZbp1ANX \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) March 13, 2019\n\nThe comments on the new recording are similar to earlier comments from Carlson that had the conservative calling women \"primitive\" and defending the child rape practiced by cult leader Warren Jeffs.\n\nCarlson also spoke on the same show about wanting a presidential candidate who would promise to kill Muslims. The Fox host also asserted white supremacy, arguing that \"white men\" should get credit for \"creating civilization.\"\n\nAfter the comments were publicized Carlson lashed out at critics and said he would not apologize or back down and noted that he had the full support of the right-wing outlet.\n\nFox News' history backs him up. The network, founded by former Nixon aide and serial sexual assailant Roger Ailes, was designed to be a promoter of conservative ideals and candidates while it tore down progressive politics and Democrats.\n\nTo further that mission Fox regularly promotes racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry. It has been a massive backer of Donald Trump, and through Carlson's program, promoted Trump's brand of white supremacy.\n\nThanks to its close relationship to Trump (Carlson's prime time companion Sean Hannity functions as a shadow White House chief of staff), the Democratic Party recently announced Fox would be excluded from hosting its debates.\n\nCarlson is a perfect fit for Fox. His hateful commentary and his disgusting fantasies about sexual assault are right in line with the organization's core values. They deserve each other.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The disaster has been traced to a flawed automated anti-stalling system that also played a role in the crash of another Boeing 737 Max jet in the ocean near Indonesia on Oct. 29.\n\nBefore the latest crash, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was aware of problems with the system and was reportedly working with Boeing to remedy the issue. But because of Trump's decision to shut down the federal government to try to make Congress fund his racist border wall, work was completely stopped on the solution for five weeks.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of safety hazard that a union representing 60,000 airline pilots warned Trump about during the shutdown.\n\nWhat's more, Trump's FAA has no permanent director and has been sluggish in its response to the crash. Trump only announced that the 737 Max would be grounded on Wednesday \u2014 days after most other governments around the world, including the European Union, had already done so.\n\nWhile the rest of the world was responding to the safety hazard, Trump was on the phone listening to Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's assurances that he was confident in the safety of the troubled jets.\n\nBoeing also donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, and Muilenburg visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nEven while announcing the grounding of the Boeing planes, Trump still plugged Boeing as an \"incredible company.\"\n\nThe FAA said in a statement that it delayed grounding the planes because \"this investigation has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions.\"\n\nBut the Canadian government received information about the Boeing plane at the same time as the United States did, and Canada called for a grounding many hours before the U.S. acted. Many flights using the possibly hazardous jets would have been allowed to take off during that time.\n\nAmerica was behind the rest of the world when the safety of air travel passengers was on the line.\n\nThanks to Trump's management failures with the FAA and his pointless, ego-driven shutdown, the people responsible for keeping travelers safe haven't been able to fully do their jobs when it mattered most.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Workers lose out again under Trump.\n\nThe Trump administration really has no shortage of ways to hurt workers. This time, it's the Department of Labor's turn. They're proposing new rules that would provide overtime pay to millions fewer workers than a plan put together during Obama's time in office.\n\nTrump had only been in office for about six months when his administration first floated the idea of radically altering the rules worked out under the Obama administration. This was even though Obama's Department of Labor had reviewed 300,000 comments before creating its rule.\n\nThe current threshold for mandatory overtime pay is laughably low. It was set back in 2004 and is only $23,660. With a few exceptions, if you earn less than that amount, you get overtime at the rate of 1.5 times your regular hourly salary. If you make over that amount, you're not automatically entitled to overtime pay. It's an amount so paltry that only 7 percent of American workers qualify.\n\nThe Obama-era rule would have raised the threshold to $47,000. Raising it to $47,000 would have provided overtime pay to nearly 4 million additional workers, or 33 percent of the American workforce.\n\nWithout any clearly defined reason why, the Trump administration now proposes to set the threshold at approximately $35,000, That change means that roughly 2.8 million of the workers who would have been overtime-eligible under Obama would no longer be.\n\nPerhaps even worse, the way the rule is now constructed, it gets rid of indexing. Under Obama, the plan would have required the overtime threshold to be adjusted upward each year as a sort of cost-of-living increase. Instead, the threshold will now be frozen at $35,000 until new legislation or rulemaking takes its place \u2014 which is something a lot harder to achieve than just having automatic increases.\n\nUnfortunately, this move by the Trump administration comes as no surprise. From the cavalier way they treated federal workers during the shutdown to their gleeful pursuit of an unwinnable trade war, this is not an administration that is concerned with the rights, health, or happiness of workers. This overtime rule is yet more proof of that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And she said he made these choices in order to \"sustain a lifestyle at the most opulent and extravagant level\" and to buy \"more houses than one man can enjoy, more suits than one man can wear.\"\n\nHer tough words were widely expected, as Jackson had been much harsher on Manafort during the tiral process.

    "text": "Betsy DeVos wanted to delay rule that would have helped school districts address the disproportionate discipline of students of color with disabilities.\n\nIn a welcome rebuke to the racist policies of Secretary of Education Betsy Devos, a federal judge recently ruled that her attempt to block an Obama-era special education rule from taking effect was illegal.\n\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) governs how schools must serve students with disabilities. The regulations that implement IDEA cover everything ranging from school funding to identification of students with disabilities to disciplinary procedures.\n\nUnder a rule passed in late 2016, during the Obama administration, the Department of Education addressed the problem of disproportionality in the \"identification, placement, and discipline of students with disabilities based on race or ethnicity.\"\n\nStudents of color \u2014 particularly African-American students \u2014 with disabilities are often placed in more restrictive educational settings. This meant that those students were removed from non-special education, or \"mainstream,\" classes more often than their white counterparts. This isn't permissible under IDEA, which requires that students be educated in the least restrictive environment possible.\n\nThe statistics are much, much worse when it comes to discipline of students of color who were receiving special education services. The Department's own data underpinned a massive new study that found that in the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years, black students with disabilities lost almost three times the days of instruction as white students with disabilities. This is because students of color who received special education services were removed from the classroom, suspended, or expelled at far greater rates than their white counterparts.\n\nThe 2016 rule sought to address these problems by requiring states to identify school districts with significant racial disproportionality in special education. The rule gave districts a standard by which to determine disproportionality and required those districts to review their policies and learn what the causes were and if changes were necessary.\n\nWhen the Trump administration came in, all that changed. DeVos tried to delay implementation of the rules for two years because the Department needed more time to study the rules as they were concerned it could promote \"racial quotas.\" Only in the fevered mind of DeVos and her cronies could the idea of ensuring that students of color are fairly treated be viewed as a \"racial quota.\"\n\nThe judge's decision means that the 2016 rules must go into effect immediately. The judge also specifically criticized the \"racial quota\" nonsense, noting that the Department hadn't shown how the safeguards in the 2016 rules, which prohibited racial quotas, were lacking.\n\nThis isn't the first time DeVos has shown her racist views when it comes to students of color. In the past, she's said that increased protections for minority students make schools more violent. She used the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, as a way to call for a rollback of Obama-era protections designed to stop students of color from being disproportionately disciplined.\n\nThis is a huge victory for students, parents, and advocates, but it is a battle they should never have had to fight in the first place.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Given the lack of commitment from Trump's administration, Schiff emphasized that he would not take calling Mueller to testify before his committee off the table.\n\nIn 2018, voters sent a clear message that Congress should fairly and vigorously investigate Trump for the litany of allegations swirling around him and those close to him. Robert Mueller's findings are an important component of any such investigation.\n\nSchiff's actions show he is taking the will of voters seriously, and he will not allow the Trump administration to impede Congress's constitutional oversight role.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The new class of Democrats in Congress is bringing accountability back.\n\nSeveral newly elected Democratic congresswomen held Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan's feet to the fire on Tuesday with tough questions about the bank's ethically dubious business practices \u2014 from its role in major bank scandals, to its financing of harmful private prisons and polluting oil pipelines.\n\nIt was the latest proof of what a difference an election can make. While House Republicans routinely ignored corruption of all kinds, Democrats \u2014 especially the rising stars in its historically diverse freshman class \u2014 are facing it head-on.\n\nDuring a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) grilled Sloan about why Wells Fargo \u2014 the fourth largest bank in the world, worth over $308 billion \u2014 chose to finance \"human rights abuses and environmental disasters.\"\n\n\"Why was the bank involved in the caging of children?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked.\n\nAfter Sloan denied this, Ocasio-Cortez noted that the company invested in CoreCivic and GEO Group, two of the firms involved in constructing and running immigration detention centers \u2014 where children were caged and abused as a result of Trump's decision to harshly prosecute border crossers.\n\n\"These companies run private detention facilities run by ICE, which is involved in caging children,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Sloan.\n\nOcasio-Cortez then quizzed Sloan on the environmentally unsound Dakota Access Pipeline, which Trump allowed to be constructed. Over the last two years, there have been multiple fuel spills along the pipeline.\n\nSloan said that the company was not responsible for the spills.\n\n\"Why did Wells Fargo finance this pipeline when it was widely seen to be environmentally unstable?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked.\n\nSloan said that the company did so after doing an analysis of the environmental effect \u2014 and went ahead, because \"we concluded that it was a risk that we are willing to take.\"\n\nSloan's answer to Ocasio-Cortez's pointed question suggested that the company pursued profits despite the risk of environmental harms.\n\nOther freshman Democratic congresswomen asked Sloan to justify the company's ethically dubious business practices and its attempts to cover them up.\n\nIn 2016, reporters uncovered that Wells Fargo was opening up accounts for customers without their permission as part of a strategy to drum up business. Despite this, Republicans in the House did not subject the company's management to questioning (the Senate did hold a hearing).\n\nIn a 2017 statement to investors, Sloan said the company would be working to restore trust after the scandals \u2014 but that letter was later described as \"corporate puffery\" by the company's own attorneys as part of their defense in court.\n\nRep. Katie Porter (D-CA) took Sloan to task for this disparity, and asked him to explain why the lawyers said what they did.\n\n\"I don't know why our lawyers are arguing that,\" Sloan answered.\n\nIncredulous, Porter replied, \"You are a personally named defendant in the case. Are you lying to a federal judge or are you lying to me and this Congress right now about whether we can rely on those statements?\"\n\n\"I can\u2019t wrap my head around why and how every single subsidiary of Wells Fargo was engaging in some kind of fraudulent activity if it wasn\u2019t coming from the top,\" said Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-VA).\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) highlighted the role that Wells Fargo plays in financing gun violence.\n\n\"Wells provided $40 million worth of lines of credit to Sturm Ruger and Company,\" Pressley said, adding that the company is \"one of the largest firearms manufacturers in the country, and their products have been used in the last nine mass shootings.\"\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) pointed out to Sloan that a loan officer at his company \"said they were likely to charge \u2014 and this is intentional \u2014 a higher rate to borrowers with Mexican names.\"\n\n\"Was that some sort of internal memo that was going around?\" Tlaib asked.\n\n\"None of that's true,\" Sloan replied.\n\n\"But the data is there,\" Tlaib pressed.\n\nThe company is currently being sued for discriminatory banking practices.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee is chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA). The longtime congresswoman also took Sloan to task.\n\n\"On and on and on,\" Waters told Sloan at the beginning of the hearing, \"You have not been able to keep Walls Fargo out of trouble. You keep getting fined. Why should Wells Fargo continue to be the size that it is?\"\n\nWells Fargo and other companies who abused and deceived their customers and the country got a pass from Republicans in Congress who just wouldn't do their jobs. Now, under Democratic leadership and led by the rising stars of the party, corporate power is being held accountable.\n\nAnd there is more to come.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "White supremacists know they have a place in today's GOP \u2014 as long as they wear their racism under a MAGA hat.\n\nInspired by Trump's embrace of racism and bigotry, neo-Nazis are now plotting to mainstream their racist ideology by rebranding themselves in Trump's image and climbing the ranks of the Republican Party.\n\nThe plans were revealed in newly leaked chat logs published by the nonprofit media collective Unicorn Riot.\n\nIn the logs, members of the white supremacist group Identity Evropa discuss their strategy to revive their public image following the August 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which resulted in the murder of anti-racist protester Heather Heyer and left many more severely wounded.\n\nThe group and its founder, Nathan Damigo, were involved in organizing the \"Unite the Right\" rally, and have since been named as defendants in a civil rights lawsuit alleging that they conspired to commit violence.\n\nWhile some white supremacist groups tried to lay low to avoid drawing further scrutiny after Charlottesville, Identity Evropa adopted a different tactic.\n\nInstead of avoiding the public eye, the group started to make plans to spread their hate by rebranding themselves as Trump supporters and quietly taking over the Republican Party \u2014 or as they referred to it, \"the White man's party.\"\n\nAs revealed in the leaked chats, which took place between September 2017 and February 2019, the group and its leader, Patrick Casey, clearly view Trump's presidency as a prime opportunity to increase the political power of the white supremacist movement.\n\n\"We have 6 years until he [Trump] is out of office \u2014 6 years that shouldn\u2019t go to waste. 6 years we should all spend on taking over our local GOP in every locality we can,\" wrote one member.\n\nIn another part of the chat, Casey \u2014 who posted under the pseudonym '@Steven Bennet' \u2014 said he had just joined his local Republican Party, and encouraged others to do the same.\n\n\"The GOP is essentially the White man's party at this point (it gets Whiter every election cycle),\" he wrote, saying that the group should take advantage of the opportunity to merge with the Republican Party and use it at as a platform for white supremacy, rather than trying to create their own party.\n\nThe group also talked about increasing their numbers through new recruitment efforts on college campuses. Identity Evropa is known for using propaganda, including flyers and posters, to target white, college-aged men for recruitment. According to the Anti-Defamation League, white supremacist propaganda campaigns on college campuses increased by more than 180 percent in 2018.\n\n\"If we're going to win this, it's going to take time, effort and sacrifice. If you're unable to do activism for various reasons, I'd like to encourage you to join your local Republican party,\" wrote \"Bennet,\" adding, \"It's actually quite easy to run for and win local offices. Let's make this happen!\"\n\nHe advised members of the hate group to \"[p]resent as a Trump supporter/nationalist\" in order to blend in seamlessly with the current Republican brand.\n\nThe chats are a damning indictment of what the Republican Party has become under Trump's leadership.\n\nSince Trump took office, his administration and its GOP allies have helped legitimize far-right extremism and enact it through policies such as the cruel practice of separating families at the border, dismantling civil rights protections, and minimizing or ignoring the threat of white supremacist violence while fear-mongering about the alleged threats posed by immigrants, refugees, and Muslims.\n\nAnd clearly, that signal was received, as reflected in the activity of neo-Nazi, white supremacist, and other hate groups, which have flourished under Trump\u2019s leadership. Deadly right-wing terrorism has surged since Trump took office, and in 2018, every extremist murder in the U.S. was linked to right-wing extremism.\n\nWhile Trump has attempted to deny his role in inspiring violence, experts say right-wing extremists believe Trump is \"offering them tacit support for their cause.\" And they\u2019re right \u2014 he is, as are his GOP allies.\n\nJust last week, 23 House Republicans voted against a resolution condemning hate because it also included language denouncing anti-Muslim bigotry.\n\nWhite supremacists and other extremists are clearly watching the actions of Trump and the GOP. They've seen Republicans open the door to racism, bigotry, and hate \u2014 and they know they have a place in today's GOP, as they long as they wear their racism under a MAGA hat.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Racist and bigoted rants from Fox News host Tucker Carlson reveal him attacking Barack Obama, promoting white supremacy, and advocating the murder of Muslims.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson advocated for the mass murder of Muslims, promoted white supremacy, and said President Barack Obama isn't black because \"he has one white parent.\"\n\nThe racist and bigoted rantings were unearthed on Monday in recordings found by Media Matters for America, culled from a series of interviews Carlson gave from 2006 to 2011 on the \"Bubba the Love Sponge\" radio show.\n\nIn a discussion about his ideal presidential candidate, Carlson fantasized about a nominee that would be openly bigoted against Muslims.\n\n\"It's these lunatic Muslims who are behaving like animals, and I'm going to kill as many of them as I can if you elect me,\" Carlson said, giving an example of the type of rhetoric he would like to hear on the campaign trail.\n\nThe Fox News host described Iraq as \"a crappy place filled with a bunch of, you know, semiliterate primitive monkeys.\"\n\nCarlson also said he believes that \"white men\" deserve credit for \"creating civilization.\"\n\nCarlson told one of the co-hosts of the program he was \"onto something\" when he suggested, \"basically, we need a racist president.\"\n\nHe then laid out a candidacy that largely resembles how Trump would later conduct his campaign.\n\n\"You know, someone who really will \u2014 and everyone claims, 'Oh, I say it like it is.' But nobody actually does. The guy who does, who says, 'I'm unabashedly pro-American. Fuck the French. Who cares what they think? The Belgians? They don't like it, they can pound sand.' You know what I mean? That guy is going to get elected.\"\n\nIn an attack on President Barack Obama, Carlson said he shouldn't be considered black because of his mom.\n\n\"How is he black, for one thing? He has one white parent, one black parent,\" Carlson stated.\n\nCarlson also went after the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n\"The Congressional Black Caucus exists to blame the white man for everything, and I'm happy to say that in public because it's true,\" he said.\n\nOn Sunday night, recordings of Carlson calling women \"primitive\" and defending child rape were released.\n\nAll of the offensive remarks Carlson made in line with the white supremacist message he has promoted night after night on Fox, and which led to him losing many of his advertisers late last year.\n\nThat didn't prevent Mike Pence from appearing on his program in January, and in fact based on Pence's role on the presidential ticket with a racist like Trump, it may have been one of the reasons he went on the program.\n\nFox News is a network that peddles lies and misinformation, coupled with racism, bigotry, and right-wing propaganda. It operates as a quasi-official arm of the Republican Party and hosts like Carlson and their bigoted views are the entire point.\n\nThat open embrace of hate and the network's deep connection to Trump is why the Democratic Party recently declined to host its presidential primary debates on the network. In 2008, Democrats also declined to have Fox host their debates. The eventual nominee, Barack Obama, went on to win an easy general election victory.\n\nCarlson, discussing the controversy around his hate speech, noted that the network supports him. Of course, they do.\n\nPushing hate and lies is what Fox News is all about, and it has been since it launched in 1996.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The New York attorney general is the latest official to open a wide-ranging investigation into Trump's shady dealings.\n\nLate Monday night, the attorney general of New York, Letitia James, dropped new subpoenas on two banks, Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank. Those banks are connected to four different Trump Organization projects, including Trump's unsuccessful attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills. It's all part of the fallout from Michael Cohen's congressional testimony.\n\nWhen Cohen, Trump's former fixer, testified before Congress two weeks ago, he stated that Trump inflated his net worth on financial statements. In fact, Cohen said that Trump gave Deutsche Bank falsified statements that overstated his net worth by $4 billion when he was angling to purchase the Bills.\n\nApparently, even Deutsche Bank, which loaned Trump money when no one else would, knew Trump's estimations of his wealth were absurd. Officials at the bank viewed his estimates as \"wildly optimistic,\" and they would usually decrease them by as much as 70 percent.\n\nOf course, Deutsche Bank is also notorious for being implicated in Russian money laundering, a fact which has already led to a different investigation into Trump's finances. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said last month that his committee was looking into Deutsche Bank's connection with Trump, particularly because it was \"the one bank that was willing to do business with the Trump Organization.\"\n\nThe most recent subpoena issued to Deutsche Bank isn't about the Bills, though. Instead, it opens yet another frontier in the investigations into Trump's shady business dealings. It demands the bank provide the attorney general with information about lines of credit, applications, and mortgages for Trump's hotels in Washington D.C., Doral, Florida, and Chicago. Investors Bank was asked for records relating to Trump Park Avenue.\n\nBesides both Congress and the state of New York investigating his dealings with Deutsche Bank, Trump also faces investigations from Maryland's attorney general and federal prosecutors in New York. That's on top of the myriad investigations from various House committees.\n\nThe attorney general's investigation is civil, not criminal. However, James has the power, under New York law, to investigate fraud and to issue fines. She even has the power to ask a court to dissolve a business that repeatedly engages in illegal behavior. And since this is both at the state, not federal, level and because this is a civil investigation, it isn't a situation that Trump can solve by pardoning anyone.\n\nPrior to being elected, Trump could conduct his business in the shadows. Even after being elected, a GOP-controlled Congress ran interference for him at every turn. Now, with Democrats in charge of the House, with state attorneys general flexing their investigative and enforcement muscle, his time is up.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Military Times notes that the idea \"has been decried by veterans groups in the past as unfairly using their earned benefits to balance the budget.\"\n\nBut Vought said, \"We don't think [the cuts] will have any adverse impact\" when asked about the attack on veterans by Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA).\n\n\"No adverse impact? No adverse impact to decreased cost of living adjustments?\" Moulton asked incredulously.\n\n\"That's correct,\" Vought replied.\n\n\"I think you should speak to some veterans, Mr. Vought,\" the congressman replied, ending the exchange.\n\nThe cold dismissal of veterans' concerns is the latest in a long line of slights and attacks on the military from Trump. He largely views the armed services as a useful backdrop for his presidency, via venues like parades, rather than as an institution to be supported and respected.\n\nTrump also loves to hide behind the military's large public support to prop up his unpopular presidency.\n\nIn the same budget document, Trump fraudulently takes credit for the \"largest\" increase in military pay in a decade, but the military received larger increases twice under Obama.\n\nTrump is again planning to hurt veterans, but instead of expressing some shame or regret for him doing so, his budget director is attempting to say hurting them is in their best interests.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Francis Cissna painted the decision as a cost-savings measure, telling staff in an email that the closures of these offices will \"maximize our agency\u2019s finite resources,\" according to the Post.\n\nThese foreign offices, however, serve a vital role for people living abroad. The Washington Post reports that employees at these offices help military families and spouses of deceased American citizens get legal documents, process backlogs in immigration petitions, and handle emergencies such as lost green cards.\n\nAt least some of those duties may be transferred to other offices, administration officials told the Post. But shuttering the immigration offices is likely to make it harder for people living overseas to migrate to the U.S. or deal with documentation issues.\n\nThis move comes after Trump declared a fake emergency in order to take billions of dollars in funding \u2014 which had already been appropriated for things like military housing construction and troop pay \u2014 and spend it on a needless border wall.\n\nWhile Trump seems to think there's plenty of money for a border wall that experts say won't do anything to make the U.S. safer, his administration is now claiming it doesn't have enough money to fund basic services for legal immigrants.\n\nBut it's not a surprising move.\n\nAfter all, Trump has spent his presidency vilifying immigrants and pushing for cuts to legal immigration.\n\nWith anti-immigrant aide Stephen Miller in his ear, Trump has instituted a draconian Muslim ban that prevents people from select countries from traveling to the United States.\n\nHe slashed the number of refugees the U.S. will allow into the country to the lowest level since 1980, and proposed severe cuts to legal immigration.\n\nTrump has also tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which could put hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children by no fault of their own at risk of deportation.\n\nAnd he's separated families seeking legal asylum at the border, putting children at risk of physical and psychological harm \u2014 with at least two kids dying in U.S. custody.\n\nWith all that said, it's not shocking Trump would try to make legal immigration even harder by closing USCIS offices.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Some Republicans are 'queasy' about Trump using a fake emergency declaration to build a wall along the southern border.\n\nSome Republican senators are hoping Trump will cave on his latest attempt to abuse executive power, Politico reports, because they are \"queasy about the legality and precedent\" of Trump declaring a fake \"national emergency\" just to build a border wall.\n\nBy law, the GOP-controlled Senate will be forced to vote this week on a House-passed resolution to block Trump's emergency \u2014 which will force Republican senators to decide between loyalty to Trump and their oath to uphold the Constitution.\n\nTrump only declared an emergency after Congress refused to fork over $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. By doing so, Trump is abusing his power under the National Emergency Act, stealing money from troops and military families to build his wall, and usurping Congress' constitutional mandate to control government funding.\n\nMost Republican senators, like Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), are having no problem choosing Trump over the Constitution. \"No president wants to constrain their power,\" Cornyn told Politico.\n\nAnd while Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has expressed reservations about the legality of Trump's declaration, he has continued to support Trump doing it.\n\nBut a few Republican senators know how bad this looks for them, and are trying to negotiate a last-minute compromise to get Trump to agree to curtail some of his own power if the senators agree to vote against the disapproval measure. As it stands, the disapproval measure is likely to get enough Republican defectors to pass, and go to Trump's desk, with a simple majority of more than 50 senators.\n\n\"There's a lot of different discussions going on,\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) told Politico. Tillis and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) were in talks with the White House over the weekend about the possible amendment to the National Emergency Act to limit Trump's executive powers.\n\nThat idea also seemed to please Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who is undecided on the measure to disapprove of Trump's fake emergency. Rubio told Politico he would \"consider\" supporting Tillis and Lee's proposed compromise.\n\nBut that compromise is probably doomed. As Politico notes, it's highly unlikely that Trump would sign any legislation curtailing his executive powers. In addition, any such legislation would need 60 votes in the Senate and a majority in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nAt the same time Republican senators are looking for an escape hatch, Trump is ramping up the pressure on them to side with him. He's using the looming Senate vote as a loyalty test, and even openly urging senators to choose him over their oath to uphold the Constitution.\n\nOn Monday, Trump tweeted: \"Republican Senators have a very easy vote this week. It is about Border Security and the Wall (stopping Crime, Drugs etc.), not Constitutionality and Precedent.\" He made similar remarks about \"constitutionality and precedent\" last week to try to harangue Republicans to support him.\n\nAs Republicans struggle with their divided loyalties \u2014 Trump or the U.S. Constitution \u2014 Democrats have no such dilemma. The entire Democratic caucus is united around defending the separation of powers and blocking Trump's fake national emergency.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "God help us all.\n\nWhat the heck is he talking about?\n\nIn the wake of a deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday, Trump sent a series of bizarre tweets arguing that technological advancements in aviation have made planes \"too complex to fly\" and that \"older and simpler\" planes are \"far better.\"\n\n\"Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT,\" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. \"I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger.\"\n\nTrump continued, \"All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!\"\n\nLet's try and break this down.\n\nOne can only assume Trump is talking about the Ethiopian Airlines crash \u2014 which has left aviation experts questioning the safety and reliability of the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft. The Ethiopian Airlines crash is the second such 737 Max 8 to crash in recent months.\n\nHowever, no one is saying that technological advancements in aircraft are a bad thing.\n\nIn fact, as aircraft have been modernized, flying is safer than it's ever been \u2014 something Trump himself pointed out (and ridiculously took credit for) in January 2018, after reports that there were no commercial aircraft fatalities the previous year.\n\nAnd let's just say Trump is not the best judge of airline safety.\n\nThis year, Trump ignored warnings from airline pilots that his pointless, record-long government shutdown was putting lives at risk.\n\nAnd in 1989, a plane owned by Trump's failed Trump Shuttle airlines had to make an emergency landing due to maintenance errors. Footage showed the plane's nose scraping the ground.\n\nHis airline ultimately failed a few years later.\n\nTo be sure, a handful of U.S. senators have begun to demand that the Boeing 737 Max 8 planes be grounded until their safety can be determined.\n\nBut no one has gone as far as Trump by saying that all technological advancement in aircraft is a bad thing.\n\nHowever, we shouldn't be that surprised that Trump would rather keep technology and science in the stone age.\n\nHe is, after all, advocating for gutting funding to science and research agencies in his 2020 budget.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Jeb Bush's super PAC just got fined nearly $400,000 for an illegal campaign donation solicited by his brother, Neil.\n\nAlthough it has been more than three years since he dropped out of the 2016 GOP presidential primary, Jeb Bush's super PAC, Right to Rise, just got slapped with a $390,000 fine from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Turns out they took a significant amount of money from a Chinese-owned corporation, which is forbidden under American election law.\n\nWhile Jeb was terrible at running for president, he was absolutely spectacular at raising money to run for president. In the first six months of his campaign, Jeb Bush and Right to Rise raised $114 million, much more than anyone else in the GOP field.\n\nHowever, $1.3 million of that money came from a Chinese corporation, American Pacific International Capital (APIC). Neil Bush, Jeb's younger brother, sits on the board of APIC and he solicited the contribution. Neil knew, though, that the board members he was hitting up were foreign nationals.\n\nNeil isn't in the news much these days, but back when his dad was president, he did a spectacular job of running a Denver savings and loan association into the ground. The FDIC sued Neil and the other directors of Silverado Banking, Savings, and Loan, alleging Neil violated conflict-of-interest regulations and didn't do anything to stop Silverado from making improper and illegal loans. Somehow, even though the collapse of Silverado cost taxpayers $1 billion, Neil got away with paying just a $50,000 fine and lived to grift another day.\n\nThe fines here are more substantial, though they still won't touch Neil \u2014 or Jeb, for that matter \u2014 directly. Right to Rise pays the $390,000 for accepting the donation, and APIC has to pay $550,000 for making the donation. Taken together, it is the third-largest fine ever imposed by the FEC.\n\nThe entire escapade is a reminder that the Bush children seem to perpetually escape any real consequences for their misdeeds. Even with the mammoth fine, Right to Rise still gets to keep almost $1 million of the illegal donation, and Neil and Jeb aren't even out one dollar of their own money. Consequences for violations of campaign finance law are woefully inadequate.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida Republican donor and massage parlor owner Li Yang is selling Chinese corporations access to Trump and his family, with some measure of success. If the only consequence for her \u2014 or Trump \u2014 down the line is a relatively paltry fine, what's to stop her or anyone else?\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "New tapes show that Tucker Carlson is even more horrible than you already knew.\n\nOver the weekend, Media Matters put together a compilation of Fox News' Tucker Carlson saying some truly repugnant and misogynistic things. From 2006 to 2011, Carlson repeatedly called into the \"Bubba the Love Sponge\" radio show. His remarks ran the gamut of awful, ranging from calling Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan unattractive, to defending child rape.\n\nMany of Carlson's comments consisted of commenting on women's appearance or demeanor in a degrading way. He called Paris Hilton and Britney Spears the \"biggest white whores in America,\" and said Ariana Huffington was a pig. As to women generally, he called them \"extremely primitive.\"\n\nHe also expressed a creepy amount of enthusiasm for a scenario spun by Bubba: young girls at boarding school engaging in sexual experimentation with each other. At the time, Carlson had a 14-year-old daughter at a boarding school, and Carlson said, \"If it weren't my daughter I would love that scenario.\"\n\nPerhaps most appalling, though, is that Carlson defended, at length, cult leader Warren Jeffs. Jeffs was convicted of two felony counts of sexual assault for assaulting two young girls \u2014 one 12, one 15 \u2014 because he asserted they were his \"spiritual wives.\" During his trial, Jeffs' nephew testified that Jeffs had raped him when he was just five years old. Jeffs also facilitated marriages between underage girls and his older male followers.\n\nCarlson told Bubba that he doesn't even believe Jeffs should be in prison, at least for the arranged marriages. And Carlson said that he doesn't think forcing young girls into an underage marriage with an older man is a big deal because \"[t]he rapist, in this case, has made a lifelong commitment to live and take care of the person.\"\n\nReally, these views of Carlson should come as no surprise. He hates women through and through. He thinks Democrats invented the concept of sexual harassment, and he defended Trump when the \"Access Hollywood\" tape surfaced.\n\nOf course, when it suits him, Carlson loves to feign morality about the treatment of women. When the Harvey Weinstein allegations first came to light, Carlson argued that the Department of Justice needed to get involved in the case and knocked Democrats for, he asserted, ignoring the stories of abuse.\n\nWhen Samantha Bee used the term \"cunt\" to describe Ivanka Trump, Carlson went on the air and said the word was \"degrading\" and that he didn't know any man who would use such language. Except he knows at least one man: himself. In one of his many call-ins to Bubba, Carlson described Alexis Stewart, the daughter of Martha Stewart and a television and radio host, as \"cunty.\"\n\nCarlson is following the Trump playbook and absolutely refusing to apologize for his disgusting actions. Instead, he has minimized them, characterizing his remarks as \"saying something naughty on a radio show more than a decade ago.\" He also said that if anyone disagrees with his views, they are welcome to come on his show and explain why.\n\nTucker Carlson, enclosed in the right-wing bubble that is Fox News, might be quite surprised to find out that there are many, many people who would be more than happy to explain why defending child rape is very, very wrong.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump reportedly ran into Virtue and told him, \"The only reason you won is because I couldn't play.\" Trump then played him in a nine-hole challenge match, and when Trump won, Golf.com reports, he said something to Virtue akin to \"This isn't fair \u2014 we'll be co-champions.\"\n\nBut the plaque on Trump's door doesn't say he's a \"co-champion\" \u2014 it suggest he is the sole champion and makes it seem like he participated in the tournaments just like other players did. He didn't. He just himself declared the winner anyway, which is the quintessential Trump style.\n\nThere are striking similarities to the way Trump and his underlings regularly describe the outcome of the 2016 election as a sweeping pro-Trump mandate. when in fact nearly 3 million more votes were cast for Hillary Clinton, who won the popular vote.\n\nThe golf club is Trump's obsession, despite his statement in 2016 saying, \"I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to go play golf.\"\n\nHe has visited the West Palm Beach course 53 times since assuming the presidency, and gone to his various clubs 173 times.\n\nBecause he refused to follow presidential tradition and divest from these holdings, every time he visits he is using the presidency to advertise a business that generates a personal profit for him.\n\nTrump often complained about President Barack Obama's golfing trips, but Trump has golfed every 4.2 days of his presidency, double the frequency that Obama did.\n\nAnd Trump hasn't won any championships in all that time, even though he awarded himself a participation trophy that says he did.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The judge made the ruling after learning that thousands more children were separated from their families at the border than originally thought.\n\nThe Trump administration has already been ordered by a federal judge to reunite the thousands of migrant families it cruelly separated at the border last summer.\n\nBut after a new report found that thousands more migrant children were likely ripped from their parents than previously believed, the judge massively expanded his ruling to try to account for every single stolen child.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled on Friday that the Trump administration must now return children who were separated from their families on or before July 1, 2017.\n\nInitially, his ruling only covered children who were stolen from their parents on June 26, 2018 or later. But since Sabraw's initial ruling, an internal watchdog for the Department of Health and Human Services reported that thousands more children than initially thought were separated from their parents at the border, beginning in summer 2017 \u2014 far earlier than previously thought.\n\nStill, the Trump administration tried to fight against the expanded ruling, telling Sabraw last month that it's a \"significant burden\" to identify the children's families as the children are no longer in custody and instead have been released to other family or guardians in the U.S. The Trump administration argued that they have \"done all things to correct the wrong.\"\n\nSabraw, however, was not convinced.\n\nIn his order demanding that the children be reunited with their families, Sabraw wrote:\n\nThe hallmark of a civilized society is measured by how it treats its people and those within its borders. That defendants may have to change course and undertake additional effort to address these issues does not render modification of the class definition unfair; it only serves to underscore the unquestionable importance of the effort and why it is necessary (and worthwhile).\n\nThe Trump administration, for its part, has fought Sabraw's reunification orders at every turn, missing deadlines and complaining about the \"burden\" reunification would put on the administration.\n\nHowever Sabraw has had none of it, criticizing the Trump administration's incompetence and cruelty that led the children to be taken from their parents in the first place.\n\n\"All of this is the result of the government\u2019s separation, and then inability and failure to track and reunite,\" Sabraw wrote in an August 2018 ruling ordering the Trump administration to reunite families.\n\nUltimately, the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy that led to child separations has been an utter disaster that top administration officials like DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen have been unable to adequately defend.\n\nJust last week, Nielsen claimed she had no idea that separating kids from their parents would be traumatizing \u2014 an idea that is backed up not only by research but also by common sense. And she tried to say that the cages the government has been using to hold migrants, including some children, are nothing like dog cages because they are \"larger.\"\n\nAnd family reunification has only been so difficult because the Trump administration was so careless in its accounting when they did rip kids from their parents.\n\nIt may take time, but Judge Sabraw \u2014 an appointee of President George W. Bush \u2014 is not stopping in his quest to ensure these children are returned to their rightful guardians.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Steve King (R-IA) for their racist remarks, when Trump himself has not done anything of the sort.\n\nIn fact, it was Sanders who made the remark condemning King, while Trump himself has been silent.\n\nRepublicans also deserve little credit for condemning King, who remained a member of the GOP caucus in good standing despite making years of virulently racist remarks. The party only condemned King after the 2018 midterms, when King nearly lost re-election to a Democrat in his otherwise strong Republican district, and thus became a liability for the GOP. Before that, however, Republicans were happy to pal around Iowa with King and beg for his endorsement.\n\nThat wasn't Sanders' only ridiculous remark, however.\n\nShe casually repeated the GOP's dangerous lie that Democrats support infanticide, and blamed Congress for the high deficits in Trump's new budget.\n\nShe also refused to comment on the hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels that Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen for.\n\nAnd she declined to comment on why Trump has yet to rule out a pardon for his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who was just sentenced to nearly four years in prison \u2014 and could get even more jail time at a second sentencing hearing on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Trump will make a decision about a potential pardon for Paul Manafort \"when he's ready,\" Sarah Huckabee Sanders says https://t.co/owiObqeWr1 pic.twitter.com/HMDqaZlXBQ \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) March 11, 2019\n\nInstead, Sanders said Trump will make a decision on a Manafort pardon \"when he's ready.\"\n\nIn all, Sanders' briefing was a complete waste of time. She lied, obfuscated, and hurled offensive insults at Democrats.\n\nYes, it's her job to hold daily briefings, and she's been shirking that duty. But maybe it's not the worst thing in the world if she's absent from the podium instead of spewing vitriolic falsehoods every day.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The lawmakers are \"frustrated by the lack of transparency\" from the Trump administration and want to know \"specific funding sources and additional authorities that would be used and the programs, projects, and activities from which funds would be diverted.\"\n\nThe letter was signed by Budget Committee Chair John Yarmuth, Appropriations Committee Chair Nita Lowey, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, who chairs of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, and Rep. Mike Quigley, who chairs the Appropriations Financial Services and General Government subcommittee.\n\nAfter Congress rejected his demand for $5.7 billion to build a border wall he once promised Mexico would pay for, Trump made up a fake national emergency at the southern border as an excuse to build the wall anyway. In doing so, Trump said he would raid funds from various government programs \u2014 including possibly schools serving military families \u2014 to pay for the wall. According to one report, Trump may swipe $1 billion in funds meant for military pay and pensions in his obsessive quest to construct the wall.\n\nBut as the letter notes, Trump has yet to provide the exact details of what specific programs he will steal from. And Congress is not happy, taking a moment to remind the Trump administration of Congress's constitutional role in American democracy.\n\n\"As the Article I branch, it is essential that Congress remains at the center of funding decisions, especially decisions that Congress has spent considerable time debating and negotiating,\" the leaders wrote. Documentation about what programs will be raided and how those decisions were made are critical, they said, as Congress is \"still responsible for performing their constitutional oversight responsibilities.\"\n\nIn addition to announcing a fake emergency, Trump continues his obsession with funding and building a border wall. In his 2020 budget, Trump is demanding an additional $8.6 billion for wall funding. Democrats immediately dismissed the request, with Lowey saying it was \"not even worth the paper it's written on.\"\n\nVoters sent Democrats to Congress with a mandate to conduct fair and vigorous oversight of an increasingly corrupt Trump administration. With this letter, Congress is showing it means business when it comes to honoring the will of voters.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chair of the House Oversight Committee, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone turned down the committee's recent request to make one of the former Trump lawyers available to answer questions.\n\nAs Cummings informed Cipollone last month, the committee has uncovered new evidence about possible false statements by the Trump attorneys \u2014 and not just Michael Cohen, Trump's former fixer who was convicted of felonies that he says Trump directed him to commit.\n\nThe possible false statements involved hush-money payments from Trump not only to Daniels, but also to other women Trump may have had affairs with. The goal of the payments, according to both Cohen and federal prosecutors, was to influence the 2016 election.\n\n\"It now appears that President Trump's other attorneys \u2014 at the White House and in private practice \u2014 may have provided false information about these payments to federal officials,\" Cummings wrote last month. He specifically named Sheri Dillon, Trump's personal attorney, and Stefan Passantino, the former Deputy White House Counsel for Compliance and Ethics.\n\nBut rather than cooperate with a legitimate congressional inquiry, Cipollone adamantly refused to allow Passantino \u2014 who now works for the Trump Organization \u2014 to speak with Cummings.\n\n\"In response to your request, given longstanding law and practice, we are not inclined to make the former Deputy Counsel to the President available for a transcribed interview inquiring into his conversations and advice he provided while serving as Deputy Counsel to the President,\" Cipollone wrote, according to CNN.\n\nCipollone also used the letter as an opportunity to whine about the way Cummings is conducting his investigation.\n\nThe letter stating the White House will not cooperate is not the end of the story. In an interview with CNN last week, Cummings said he was determining what he might do if this very situation occurred. Cummings has the power to issue subpoenas to demand documents and compel testimony from uncooperative witnesses.\n\nIn 2018, voters opted to empower a new majority in the House, in part to hold the Trump administration accountable. Part of holding Trump accountable means getting to the bottom of his hush money payments to various alleged mistresses that served to prevent voters from hearing their stories.\n\nCipollone's refusal to cooperate raises the obvious question: What is the White House hiding?\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He falsely claimed in 2018 that he had given a military pay raise for the \"first time in 10 years.\" He later repeated the lie and made it seem as if Obama had rejected such increases.\n\nHe even made a tone-deaf \"joke\" about military pay, arguing that the men and women in the service \"don't want it because you're very patriotic.\"\n\nPay isn't the only military deception in Trump's budget.\n\nThe pay falsehood is included in a budget request that also asks for $164 billion to fund overseas operations, which Military Times reported is the largest request since previous troop surges in Afghanistan and Iraq. Yet Trump has continued to prematurely declare victory over ISIS while top military leaders say this isn't true.\n\nTrump has tried to hide behind the troops to shield his unpopular presidency from criticism. But even when discussing a serious issue like military pay Trump is unable to stop himself from outlandish lying.\n\nThe result is disrespect for the troops and the reminder that his predecessor did more for them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's budget makes cruelty a top priority.\n\nIf a president's budget is a statement of priorities, then Trump clearly cares more about being cruel to children than about serving their needs.\n\nThe White House's 2020 budget, released Monday, calls for more money to jail immigrant families and children \u2014 and less money to fund America's schools.\n\nIn the budget request for the Department of Justice, Trump announced his desire to expand \"immigration detention capacity to 60,000 \u2014 including 10,000 family detention beds \u2014 and the hiring of 15,000 Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers.\"\n\nAfter Trump shut down the government for 35 days, the number of detention beds became a major sticking point in congressional negotiations over border security. Democrats wanted to jail fewer immigrant families and cap the number of beds at 35,400.\n\n\"ICE has been overspending and overjailing,\" Kerri Talbot, an advocate with Immigration Hub, a group supporting the lower number, told the Washington Post in February. The Post noted that a lower number of beds would force the Trump administration to focus on detaining violent criminals rather than rounding up undocumented immigrants who had not committed any serious offense.\n\nBut despite calls for a more reasonable approach, Trump, who implemented a cruel policy of ripping immigrant children away from their families, is prioritizing jailing even more immigrants.\n\nTrump is laser-focused on hurting immigrants \u2014 but he can't seem to find room in his $4.7 trillion budget to prioritize American students and teachers.\n\nTrump wants to slash the overall overall budget for the Department of Education by $7.1 billion, or 10 percent from current levels. Cuts are targeted at programs that help teachers and fund after-school programs.\n\nFor example, the budget would eliminate $3.3 billion in funding for teacher development, academic supports, and enrichment programs. An additional $1.1 billion would be cut from a program that helps fund after-school activities.\n\nFor those looking to go to college in the next few years, the news gets worse. Trump wants to cut $207 billion from the student loan program \u2014 a move that will \"cripple college affordability,\" according to Bobby Kogan, a mathematician with the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nOverall, Trump wants to eliminate 29 separate programs in the Education Department.\n\nIn a statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the budget a \"gut-punch to the American middle class,\" full of \"cruel and unthinking budget proposals.\"\n\nTrump's 2020 budget shows just how twisted his priorities really are.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

We're talking on the order of a 1/4 cut to SNAP. How disgusting. I don't care who you are or what you've done. No one should go hungry. pic.twitter.com/2bBfKKt4y0 \u2014 Bobby Kogan (@BBKogan) March 11, 2019\n\nIn all, Trump's budget proposes cutting $327 billion from social safety-net programs over the next 10 years.\n\nOf course, because Democrats have control of the House, a repeal of the ACA and massive cuts to the social safety-net won't happen in the next two years.\n\nBut Trump's budget makes his priorities clear: He wants to spend billions on his needless border wall and jails for immigrants, all while cutting health care and other vital benefits to millions of Americans.\n\n\"The president's budget is a continuation of the administration's years-long war on Americans' health care and a return to the failed policy of repeal \u2013 exactly what Americans voted against in 2018,\" Brad Woodhouse, executive director of Protect Our Care, said in a statement.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Nita Lowey said.\n\nOn Monday, Trump will formally ask Congress to hand over $8.6 billion to build an unwanted wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to Reuters. After rejecting his previous request for $5.7 billion, Democrats remain opposed to paying for a wall Trump repeatedly promised Mexico would fund.\n\nThe request is \"not even worth the paper it's written on,\" Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said.\n\nIn a joint statement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer lamented damage Trump caused the country last time around.\n\n\"Congress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government,\" the two leaders said. \"The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again. We hope he learned his lesson.\"\n\nThe budget request comes even as Trump falsely boasts he's already building the border wall. His own Justice Department recently admitted that Trump lied in a December 2018 statement claiming to have a contract to build a 115-mile section of a border wall. In another instance, Trump posted a video of an old section of the border wall being repaired and falsely claimed it was part of his border wall construction.\n\nThe last time Congress refused to pay billions of dollars to fun a border wall, Trump threw a tantrum and shut down the government for 35 days. During that time, 800,000 federal workers faced all kinds fo difficulty as Trump denied them their paychecks. One survey showed 1 in 4 federal workers had to visit a food pantry just to obtain enough food to feed their families.\n\nIn the broader sense, the Trump shutdown caused $11 billion in economic damage to the American economy.\n\nWith the new request, Trump is once again eager to highlight his obsession with a border wall over the well-being of America. After Trump signed legislation to reopen the government, he declared a fake national emergency at the southern border in order to steal money from other programs to pay for the wall. He's even considering taking money away from the schools attended by children of military families.\n\nIn his 2020 budget, Trump once again prioritizes the wall over programs that actually help Americans. According to the Washington Post, the new budget wants billions for the wall, but also includes cuts totaling $2.7 trillion over 10 years to anti-poverty programs, environmental protection programs, and a host of other domestic programs.\n\nIf Trump wants to fight about the border wall once more, as his budget indicates, he seems to be setting himself up to be humiliated all over again.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Instead, Trump lied and told the donors he accurately pronounced Cook's last name, but that he said it quick and it couldn't be heard on tape.\n\nThe video clearly shows this is false.\n\nEven RNC donors told Axios they were perplexed about why Trump would lie about something so clearly captured on video.\n\n\"I just thought, why would you lie about that,\" a donor told Axios' Jonathan Swan. \"It doesn't even matter!\"\n\nNow, however, Trump is claiming that he meant to call Cook the wrong name, changing his recollection of the event and keeping alive a stupid story that would have died had he just kept his mouth shut.\n\nOf course, one would think Trump has more important things to do than try and explain away a basically meaningless mistake he made days earlier.\n\nThere is, after all, supposedly a \"national emergency\" on the southern border.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Now, it looks like Yang was also selling access to Trump and his inner circle.\n\nLi Yang used to own the \"spa\" where New England Patriots owner (and Trump pal) Robert Kraft was arrested for solicitation. That spa has been linked to a human trafficking pipeline from China to Florida. Yang sold the spa a few years ago, but there's evidence she knew sexual services were offered there when she owned the spa.\n\nAnd Yang isn't just linked to Trump. She's partied with both of Trump's sons and high-level Florida Republicans, like Sen. Rick Scott and Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nAll of this would be swampy \u2014 and sketchy \u2014 enough, but Yang was also using her time hobnobbing with the Florida GOP to literally sell access to Trump.\n\nHere's how it worked. Yang started a consulting and public relations firm that was supposed to help businesses in America get established in the Chinese marketplace. It isn't clear that she actually did that. But the business was helping also Chinese clients connect to United States politicians, and it partially revolved around Mar-a-Lago.\n\nYang's now-defunct website advertised \"the opportunity to interact with the president\" and said the company could arrange for its clients to attend dinner at the White House. It also promised access to New Year's Eve with the Trump family at Mar-a-Lago, including a chance for the Chinese businesspeople to get their picture with Trump family members.\n\nYang also arranged for a group of Chinese executives to attend a private fundraiser for Trump in December 2017. Of course, none of those people are allowed to donate money to Trump, because they are foreign nationals. So, either Yang paid the way for multiple people to attend the fundraiser and hobnob with Trump, or the fundraiser took money from Chinese nationals.\n\nFunnily, it doesn't appear that Yang is all that political. Though she is a registered Republican, before the 2016 election she hadn't voted in a decade.\n\nNow, though, she's a common sight at East Coast GOP parties. Mostly, Yang is just pro-Trump. Her purse is rhinestone-encrusted and spells out MAGA. She's given $42,000 to the Trump Victory PAC and $16,000 directly to Trump's campaign.\n\nSelling access to the president is precisely the sort of thing Republicans accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of doing. Asserting, baselessly, that Hillary Clinton engaged in pay for play with Clinton Foundation donors was a staple refrain of Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nTurns out the people dwelling that deep in this particular swamp are Donald Trump and his cronies.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Then, they just threw all the trees in the Potomac River.\n\nHowever, it turns out that it was a protected area, and therefore removing the trees \u2014 not to mention throwing them in the river \u2014 was completely illegal.\n\nFirst there's the part where tossing the trees in the river is a safety hazard. Then there's the fact that regulations require permits to cut down trees on that part of the river because it is designated as being prone to flood. Next, this was no small removal operation; Loudoun County officials said that the golf course cleared nearly three-quarters of an acre of land. Finally, removing the trees leads to increased sediment in the water and ends up, eventually, polluting the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nBut, apparently, Trump believes his golf courses should not be beholden to any laws, environmental or otherwise. His clubs, for example, employ massive amounts of undocumented immigrants even as Trump viciously rails against the immigrants who enter at our southern border. Trump also battled the government of Scotland for years because he believed the presence of wind turbines to be an abomination. And at his Bedminster golf course in New Jersey, he was cited by that state's Department of Environmental Protection when he cut down trees and disturbed wetlands.\n\nThis isn't even the first time that this particular golf course was in the news for clearing trees. Back in 2011, the Washington Post reported that the Trump Organization had mowed down over 400 trees along the Potomac River, all so that the people paying $100,000 to join and another $700 per month to be members could have a better view of the water.\n\nIn a thoroughly Trumpian move, they replaced some of those trees with a giant American flag, and in the process they created an environmental nightmare, leaving migratory birds and bald eagles with nowhere to go.\n\nNot much, it seems, has changed since 2011 at the golf course, which Trump has visited over 40 times since becoming president.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

That sounds way more like self-preservation than love for one's family.\n\nAnd on top of all that, a U.S. senator tried to play off an extramarital affair and illegal hush-money scheme by trying to build sympathy for the man who had the affair and engaged in illegal acts?\n\nThis is just the latest ridiculous example of Republican senators trying to avoid criticizing Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, two Republican senators claimed to not know about the Daniels hush-money scheme at all, despite the fact that it's been in the news for more than a year and that Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen testified about it extensively just last week.\n\nTheir playing dumb allowed the senators to avoid criticizing Trump's actions, or saying they warranted a congressional investigation.

A search by Trump's administration turned up absolutely no evidence of any contract \u2014 and they were forced to admit so in federal court.\n\nIn the course of litigation over the request, lawyers from the Justice Department, representing the Trump administration, were questioned by Judge William Young of the Massachusetts Federal District Court.\n\n\"So far as you know, is there any such contract?\" Young asked the lawyers.\n\n\"No, your Honor, so far as I know there is no contract of 115 miles as referenced,\" Peter Bryce, representing the Trump administration, answered.\n\nAfter the hearing, Carol Rose, executive director of the Massachusetts ACLU chapter, spoke about the case on Boston Public Radio.\n\n\"The judge was angry and said, 'We all know that just because our president has said that there's a contract that doesn't make it so,'\" Rose said. \"[He] effectively suggested that we all can understand that our president doesn't tell the truth. So that's remarkable.\"\n\n\"There's been no suggestion that there is a contract. Everything, every scintilla of credible evidence here is that there is no such contract,\" Young said from the bench. He also said Trump's statement is \"just inaccurate, there isn't a contract.\"\n\nRose is hoping her litigation, along with activities by others, halts progress on the border wall.

    "text": "Trump opened the gates for bribery \u2014 and T-Mobile decided to spend nearly $200,000 at the hotel he still owns while he was deciding on their merger.\n\nT-Mobile spent $195,000 at Trump's Washington, D.C. hotel \u2014 which Trump still owns and profits from \u2014 after announcing a planned $26 billion merger with Sprint that requires federal approval, the Washington Post reports.\n\nIt's the latest example of how Trump is able to unethically make \"a lot of money\" from his presidency, as House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings put in a recent interview.\n\nT-Mobile disclosed the amount in a letter responding to Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who had inquired about a previous Post report on T-Mobile executives suddenly booking a lot of business at Trump's hotel the day after the merger was announced.\n\nThe spending patterns are striking. Before announcing the planned deal in April 2018, T-Mobile executives had only ever gone to the Trump hotel twice, in 2017. After the deal was announced, records showed they went to the hotel at least 52 times.\n\nWhile previous reports were only able to estimate how much money the executives might have spent at the hotel, T-Mobile has now confirmed it to Congress. And of the $1.4 million that T-Mobile spent on hotels in the Washington, D.C.-area over the last year, 14 percent was spent at Trump's hotel.\n\nThe proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint is valued at $26 billion, and the combined companies would have over 127 million customers. If the merger is approved, it would reduce competition within the industry by reducing the number of major wireless competitors from four to three.\n\nThe exchange of funds from T-Mobile to Trump highlights once again that Trump opened the door to outright bribery and other conflicts of interest when he broke from a bipartisan presidential tradition by deciding not to divest from his companies, notably the Trump Organization and his hotels.\n\nSome of the money spent at the Trump Hotel will inevitably get kicked back into Trump's own pockets \u2014 and with this corruption pipeline wide open, the Trump hotel has raised rates above other D.C. hotels in the same class and become a go-to for those like T-Mobile who might want to influence the administration.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and House and Senate campaigns for Republicans have also spent donor money to host parties and fundraisers at the hotels.\n\nTrump has already made over $1 million from his own 2020 campaign using this method.\n\nCompanies like T-Mobile, as well as foreign governments and entities with business before the American government, can spend lavishly at Trump's properties. Meanwhile, Trump and his appointees are making major decisions involving those same companies. Should Trump's administration choose to approve the merger, the money spent at his hotel would produce a huge return on investment for T-Mobile.\n\nTrump's corruption allowed T-Mobile to make a simple calculation: Spend a few thousand that finds its way into Trump's pocket, and help convince his administration to approve a deal that could earn the company billions.\n\nThanks to Trump, corrupt payoffs and bribery are becoming part of the price of doing business with the American government.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

At just 36 years old, it is entirely conceivable she will spend the next 40+ years of her life using the courts to impose her ultra-conservative and bigoted views.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals is, along with its sister circuit courts, the second-highest court in the land. With that, you'd think that the people nominated to it would be people who have a good deal of experience as lawyers \u2014 perhaps even people who were judges on a lower court first.\n\nWith Trump, you'd be wrong. Rushing has only practiced law for nine years and has never served on a lower court.\n\nShe does, however, have all the qualities that far-right conservatives love in a judge.\n\nAs Charlie Pierce put it over at Esquire, Rushing has \"been nurtured since law school in the carefully manicured terrarium of the conservative legal community.\" She is a member of the Federalist Society, the right-wing group that has been behind most, if not all, of Trump's judicial picks. She clerked for both Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch.\n\nRushing also interned for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2014 and rightly so. The ADF consistently and viciously attacks LGBTQ people and has said that the \"homosexual agenda\" will destroy society.\n\nRushing has written about her beliefs in \"traditional marriage,\" and that heterosexuality is more moral than homosexuality.\n\nTrump is stacking the federal courts with very young judges, all the better to ensure that conservatives keep a stranglehold on the judiciary for decades to come.\n\nLater this week, the Senate will take up the nominations of Eric Murphy, age 40, and Chad Readler, age 46. Both Murphy and Readler are deeply bigoted against LGBTQ people, and both are nominated to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Murphy argued against marriage equality, and Readler has defended Trump's transgender troop ban.\n\nWith a Senate willing to confirm any nominee he puts forward, Trump is shaping the federal courts in his own image: brutal, bigoted and inexperienced.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who criticized the influence of the Israeli lobby on American politics. She was herself criticized for the way she phrased her remarks, which many said echoed anti-Semitic tropes.\n\nBut Republicans were especially eager to accuse Omar, a Muslim woman of color and a Somali refugee, of being a raging anti-Semite who deserves to be punished.\n\nTheir outrage is as hypocritical as it comes.\n\nRemember, the GOP stood by Trump as he refused to condemn the Nazis marching in Charlottesville \u2014 and even called them \"very fine people.\"\n\nRepublicans also stuck by Trump when he tweeted an anti-Semitic image of Hillary Clinton superimposed over a pile of cash with a Jewish Star of David that called her the \"most corrupt candidate ever.\" The image was condemned by Democrats as being a textbook example of anti-Semitism.\n\nAnd Republicans were silent when Trump told a room full of Jewish Republicans during the 2016 campaign that they probably wouldn't vote for him because he didn't need their money. Again, a textbook anti-Semitic trope.\n\nNot to mention, the GOP's 2018 midterm messaging was filled with anti-Semitic undertones, as they claimed Jewish philanthropist and Holocaust survivor George Soros \u2014 a favorite target of white supremacists \u2014 was trying to buy the election.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has himself made anti-Semitic remarks about Soros trying to buy the election. McCarthy eventually deleted the tweet and tried to claim it wasn't anti-Semitic.\n\nEven more, Republicans have also made bigoted remarks as they tried to condemn Omar.\n\nFor example, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) said Omar \u2014 a Muslim woman \u2014 is a threat to national security. This is the same Scalise who admitted to speaking at an event hosted by white supremacists.\n\nAnd a Trump campaign adviser, Jeff Ballabon, called Omar \"filth\" in a Monday interview on Fox Business.\n\nIn the end, 23 Republicans voted \"no\" on the bill.\n\nAll the Republicans who voted AGAINST the anti-hate resolution pic.twitter.com/1DHszREDKz \u2014 Melanie Zanona (@MZanona) March 7, 2019\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) said the resolution should only have condemned anti-Semitism and not other forms of hate, because he considers anti-Semitism \"a very special kind of hatred that should never be watered down.\"\n\nOf course, Gohmert is well-versed in bigotry, having spewed hate against Muslims for years.\n\nThis is also the same Gohmert who baselessly accused Soros of taking property owned by Jews.\n\nNoted racist Steve King of Iowa voted present, a form of protest vote. King himself has spewed hate against people of Hispanic descent for years, but remained a member of the Republican caucus in good standing. He was only rebuked by the GOP in 2019 after he specifically praised white supremacy. No wonder he was uncomfortable voting for a bill condemning hate.\n\nIt's a typically shameful display from the unruly GOP House caucus \u2014 and ultimately, Republicans will have to explain to Americans why they couldn't universally condemn bigotry.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Ellis, who has come under fire for issuing a lenient sentence to Manafort.\n\nEllis, bizarrely, praised Manafort as someone who had lived an \"otherwise blameless life.\" Yes, Manafort \u2014 the guy who not only earned millions working for violent dictators and defrauded the U.S. out of millions in taxes he owed, but also committed more crimes after being indicted and vowing to cooperate with Manafort's investigation. Manafort's own daughter even called her father's fortune \"blood money.\"\n\nEither way, Trump was happy that Ellis pointed out that Manafort's sentencing in this case did not pertain to Russian collusion.\n\n\"Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia,\" Trump tweeted. \"But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!\"\n\nOf course, the judge didn't say there was no collusion. He simply pointed out that the current case he was sentencing Manafort for did not pertain to collusion. Those are two very different things, and Trump is parsing words to give himself a false sense of security.\n\nFor good measure, Trump went on to tweet about the U.S. economy, even after the February jobs report revealed that employers added just 20,000 jobs last month \u2014 a very weak number in comparison to previous months.\n\n\"'This is as good a time as I can remember to be an American Worker. We have the strongest economy in the world.'\" Trump tweeted, quoting another Fox News host Stuart Varney. \"So true!\"\n\nAwkward timing, to say the least.\n\nTrump's day is filled with travel \u2014 first to Alabama, where he's traveling to survey tornado damage \u2014 before heading down to his gaudy Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, for the weekend.\n\nDon't be shocked if you see more unhinged tweets.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The other part was they offered a voluntary change in military pensions, and they overestimated how many people would sign up for it.\" Part of the reason the Army is having trouble recruiting service members is due to the Trump administration's immigration policies that have stopped the Pentagon from recruiting high-quality immigrants who don't possess green cards to serve. And Soltz said that using this money meant for military pay to fund the wall won't help the military achieve their recruiting targets.\n\n\"When we're not meeting our recruiting goals, the one thing that is not going to help attract new recruits is to say, 'We might come after your pay, or not fund your other needs, to build the wall,'\" VoteVets' Soltz said in a statement to Shareblue. \"If the question is whether or not Donald Trump would put his wall ahead of our troops and their families, we have our answer: Yes.\"\n\nUltimately, the only reason why Trump is resorting to raiding funds slated for military pay in order to build the wall is because Congress refused to allocate money for the project.\n\nSo, Trump threw a temper tantrum and declared a national emergency on the border in order to go over Congress' head and get the money anyway.\n\nHouse Democrats already voted to repeal the fake emergency. And the Senate is now slated to vote on the fake emergency repeal by March 15, before Congress heads out of town for recess.\n\nAnd Trump is set to be embarrassed, as a handful of Republicans will join Democrats to repeal Trump's emergency and deliver yet another rebuke to the embattled president.\n\nSad!\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Doug Collins is suddenly claiming investigations violate the Constitution.\n\nThe highest-ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), is complaining that attempts to investigate Trump's crimes and corruptions are in violation of the Constitution. But experts say he's full of it.\n\nThe committee, chaired by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), recently issued a large document request to more than 80 different individuals and entities to investigate Trump and his administration for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and corruption.\n\nCollins, who leads the minority on the committee, sent Nadler a letter in which Collins whined about the \"sprawling investigation.\"\n\nThe Republican described the investigation as \"astounding\" and \"alarming,\" and called into question the \"constitutional insufficiency of this exercise.\"\n\nAs part of his defense of Trump, Collins also cited constitutional oversight expert Morton Rosenberg, who has written that \"the Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment restricts Congress in conducting investigations.\"\n\nBut CNN reached out to Rosenberg and he told them that Nadler's actions do not conflict with the Constitution, invalidating Collins' hysterical response.\n\n\"All they're doing is making an invitation with these letters \u2014 an invitation to cooperate,\" Rosenberg said. He then said Collins is \"exaggerating what's going on here\" and that there is \"no constitutional problem\" with Nadler's investigation.\n\nCollins' over-the-top response is the latest salvo from Republicans in Congress as they continue to defend Trump, no matter what.\n\nThe members are taking their cues from Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who said he doesn't believe Trump did anything wrong when he paid hush money to cover up his extramarital affair.\n\nHowever, congressional Republicans had no problem with investigations into presidential conduct and policy when President Barack Obama was in office.\n\nIn fact, the same House Judiciary Committee was one of many Republican-led committees that investigated the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Those investigations were part of a fruitless attempt to blame President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the deaths that occurred.\n\nJust last year, when Republicans were still in charge of the Judiciary Committee, they were still investigating Hillary Clinton's email server.\n\nWith Trump in the White House, Republicans chose to ignore all the evidence of corruption and crimes that has emerged. Then, in the 2018 midterm election, voters punished the party for being Trump's co-conspirators and put Democrats in charge.\n\nNow that Democrats have begun catching up on Trump, his Republican allies, like Collins, are suddenly trying to cry foul.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He will be working for Trump's re-election campaign as an adviser.\n\nShine's ouster comes as numerous Trump scandals are rising in the public consciousness, some of them directly involving Shine. During his tenure, Shine was unable to do anything to improve Trump's popularity, which has never risen above 45 percent, while his unfavorable rating has held at 54 percent.\n\nTrump reportedly blamed Shine for the overwhelmingly negative public reaction to his decision to shut down the federal government over his racist border wall.\n\nThe New York Times reported that during the shutdown, Trump repeatedly asked people \"whether Mr. Shine has been 'good' for him.\" Trump also belittled a meaningless photo-op at the border that had been arranged by Shine, blaming the propaganda moment on \"these people behind you\" as he pointed to Shine and other aides while speaking to the Times.\n\nDuring Shine's tenure at Fox News, he presided over the massive cover-up of sexual abuse by network founder Roger Ailes.\n\nDespite his work covering up abuse \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014 Trump went ahead and hired Shine. Trump himself is an admitted sexual assailant.\n\nShine was recommended by Fox News host Sean Hannity, a fan of Trump's and one of his most high-profile propagandists, who functions as a shadow chief of staff for the White House. For years, Shine was a producer on Hannity's show.\n\nTrump is also facing multiple revelations about his unethical and possibly criminal conduct, including violating federal law by paying off porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election \u2014 a story Fox News reportedly had and killed prior to the election to help Trump win, while Shine was still at Fox.\n\nTrump has maintained that public relations are the key to avoiding the consequences of his actions, but Shine was unable to convince Americans to look away from Trump's misdeeds. And Trump has struggled to keep communications directors and spokespeople \u2014 as well as Cabinet members and other top officials \u2014 at the White House.\n\nBy comparison, President Barack Obama had five communications directors over eight years. George W. Bush had four during his two terms.\n\nGetting rid of Bill Shine won't stop Trump from being Trump, which is Trump's biggest problem.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And Trump, apparently, can't bring himself to issue the order.\n\nSo, despite the fact that Trump signed the legislation to reopen the government more than three weeks ago, the pay raises have still not gone into effect.\n\nThe glacial pace of the administration to enact the will of Congress does not sit well with some members.\n\nA group of House members sent a letter to Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Russel Vought and OPM Director Margaret Weichert calling the delay \"unacceptable.\" The members reminded Trump officials that federal workers recently endured the 35-day Trump shutdown where many faced significant financial hardship.\n\nTrump initiated the shutdown after throwing a tantrum because Congress would not hand over $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump held the paychecks of federal workers hostage in an attempt to bend Congress to his will, a ploy which failed spectacularly.\n\nA humiliated Trump eventually caved to congressional demands to reopen the government and provide federal workers with both back pay and a raise in 2019.\n\nThe letter demands that the Trump officials provide an update as to when federal workers can expect their pay raise.

The current HHS secretary, nominated by Trump, is Alex Azar.\n\nHHS' own data shows that the department has received 4,500 allegations of sexual abuse and harassment since 2015. Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) revealed the data at a February hearing.\n\n\"Together these documents detail an environment of systemic sexual assault by staff on unaccompanied children,\" Deutch said.\n\nDespite the horrific information, HHS officials won't meet with Congress. Instead, HHS is making the excuse that they want a correction and an apology from Deutch because he referred to the alleged predators as \"staff\" when they were contract employees of the shelters in question.\n\nAt the initial hearing, Deutch clarified his statement and noted, \"It doesn't make what happened any less horrific.\"\n\nThe bottom line is that migrant children were harmed while in U.S. custody, and the government is ultimately responsible for their treatment whether the perpetrators were staff or contractors.\n\nThe HHS argument comes across as a disingenuous dodge and an attempt to avoid oversight. The Trump administration (aided by its Republican allies in Congress) have struck out against attempts by Congress to provide oversight.\n\nThe Trump administration detained children, often in cages, after it decided to shift policy from previous administrations and prosecute all border crossers.\n\nNow that same administration, faced with the possibility that those children are being preyed upon, is avoiding oversight, investigation, and responsibility.\n\nAzar's department already has a track record of simply not caring about the fates of these children, including losing records about their whereabouts after they were taken away from their parents.\n\nIt is a state of affairs that recently led Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chair of the House Oversight Committee, to describe the administration's actions as \"government-funded child abuse.\"\n\nChildren are being hurt and not enough is being done to protect them.

It's part of the bill's other anti-corruption provisions, which would force presidential and vice presidential candidates to release their income tax returns.\n\nBoth Kushner and Ivanka Trump currently serve as unpaid advisers in the White House. Ethics experts raised concerns that their roles were ethically suspect, as Trump's two family members could \"avoid the ethics, conflict-of-interest and other rules that apply to White House employees.\"\n\nEventually, Kushner and Ivanka Trump said they were becoming official White House employees, though still unpaid, in order to comply with federal ethics rules.\n\nHowever, this new amendment would codify into law that ethics laws will apply to \"unpaid employees of the Executive Office of the President and the White House.\"\n\nThe amendment was introduced by Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), who said in a speech on the House floor her amendment will \"ensure that conflicts of interest do not interfere in the operations of our government.\"\n\n\"I come to the floor today to speak on this amendment that simply requires unpaid government employees to comply with the same ethics rules as paid employees,\" Jayapal said. \"President Trump has exploited this ethics loophole for his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who both work in the White House.

Yang appears to be taking a selfie next to Trump, who smiles for the camera. Less than three weeks after the photo was snapped, Kraft was arrested.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Yang opened several Tokyo Day Spas in the South Florida area, one of which she sold in 2013 to another businesswoman who changed the name to Orchids of Asia. The Herald uncovered Internet reviews at the time suggesting sexual services were provided both at Yang's establishments and the new Orchids of Asia.\n\nSeveral of Yang's spas showed up on adult websites created to help people find massage parlors that offer sexual services. One person suggested Tokyo Day Spa was a great place for a \"rub and tug.\" Another person commented on Orchids of Asia in 2013, noting, \"Used to be known as Tokyo Day Spa and Massage \u2014 most of the same girls still work there.\"\n\nKraft, who donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, was filmed entering Orchids of Asia on two consecutive days in late January. In late February, he was arrested as part of an anti-human trafficking sting operation which targeted Orchids of Asia and other massage parlors in the area. Yang was not arrested, but the owner of her former spa was charged with racketeering and running a house of prostitution.\n\nYang is also a financial supporter of Trump, with her and her close family donating more than $55,000 to Trump's campaign or affiliated political action committees.\n\nHowever, Donald Trump is not the only one in his family friendly with Yang. There are photos on Yang's Facebook page of her smiling with Trump's adult sons, Eric and Don Jr. There are also photos of Yang with many Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Rick Scott.\n\nTrump's proximity to Yang is far from his first sex-linked scandal. Trump allegedly had multiple affairs over the course of his three marriages, and is accused of felonies related to paying hush money to more than one mistress in order to keep them quiet in the closing weeks of the 2016 election.\n\nFox News knew of one of the affairs prior to the election, but refused to report the story in an attempt to help Trump win the White House.\n\nSince then, Trump's former attorney and longtime fixer, Michael Cohen, has testified before Congress about Trump's hush-money payments to adult actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nApart from consensual affairs, Trump is also tied to nonconsensual sexual encounters including multiple accusations of sexual assault. In a widely viewed video, Trump can be heard bragging about his prowess as a serial sexual predator.\n\n\"You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful \u2014 I just start kissing them,\" Trump said. \"It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.\"\n\nMany women have come forward to corroborate Trump's admission, including accusations of unwanted groping and unwanted kissing. One campaign volunteer came forward at the end of February \u2014 just a few weeks ago \u2014 accusing Trump of grabbing and kissing her without her consent.\n\nAs of now, neither Trump nor his sons have been accused of frequenting massage parlors for the purpose of soliciting prostitution. But the episode is just one more example of Trump palling around with shady characters.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

That encompasses the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), which serves over 600,000 New Yorkers in various capacities.\n\nUsually, someone with zero expertise in housing and urban development might be expected to spend extra time learning about the job rather than doing television, but not while Trump's in charge.\n\nPatton may have realized just how bad this story looks, regardless of Trump's approval. She took to Twitter attempting to deny this story and calling CNN \"fake news\" for having reported it. In fact, she's insisting that she didn't say she had Trump's blessing. No, per Patton, she said \"the exact OPPOSITE\" and has that on tape.\n\nThis might ring truer but for the fact that CNN also talked to the spokesperson for the show's production company, who confirmed that Patton has already signed an agreement to work on the show. That doesn't seem to be the action of someone who has been told by her boss, the president of the United States, that she does not have his blessing to pursue a reality tv show.\n\nAdditionally, Patton is quoted at length in the CNN piece talking about how the Trumps were supportive and how the HUD lawyers reviewed the deal. A spokesman for HUD also seemed to confirm extensive discussions had taken place, saying that the HUD Ethics Office had provided Patton with advice on outside employment.\n\nPatton's also mad that people keep saying she planned Eric Trump's wedding. In the past, she has insisted that all she did was help as a friend. It doesn't seem to occur to Patton that such a correction makes her thin resume even thinner.\n\nThis is the same woman who padded her resume to say she went to Yale for undergrad and attended law school for two years. She only attended two semesters of law school and she only took some summer classes at Yale. She's not remotely qualified for her job.\n\nShe is, ironically, entirely qualified to star in a reality show.

The new rules will help both big banks and huge non-bank financials institutions avoid government oversight.\n\nFor big banks, the Federal Reserve will change how they administer and grade annual \"stress tests.\" In the past, this was a pass-or-fail test, with the results publicly available. These annual tests evaluate whether or not banks have enough capital in reserve to deal with economic meltdowns like the U.S. saw in 2008.\n\nAfter years of the banks complaining that the tests were too time-consuming, the Federal Reserve is making changes so it \"no longer flunk banks based on operational or risk management lapses,\" according to Reuters.\n\nIn a separate move, also announced Wednesday, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) declared that massive non-bank institutions like insurers and asset management firms will no longer be considered \"systemically important.\" The designation, which formerly applied to companies like insurance giant AIG, led to stricter oversight by government regulators.\n\nThe twin deregulation efforts come on the heels of banks saw their profits soar by billions in 2018 after the corporate tax rate was dropped from 35 percent to 21 percent. Yet these same banks complained about the cost and time required for stress tests to keep the global economy safe.\n\nThe move by regulators drew concern from watchdog groups. The lack of pass-fail grades on the stress test \"reduces transparency and deprives the public of the ability to hold the banks and regulators accountable,\" Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, told the Times. \"The markets are not going to have the full picture.\"\n\nIn the end, the combination of the GOP tax scam and massive deregulation of big banks show the priorities of the Trump administration and congressional Republicans.

The case, initiated by a lawsuit from the state of California, revolves around a citizenship question Ross wants included on the census.\n\nIn his 126-page ruling, Judge Richard Seeborg found that Ross violated both the Administrative Procedure Act and the Enumeration Clause of the Constitution.\n\nSeeborg wrote that Ross engaged in \"a cynical search to find some reason, any reason, or an agency request to justify that preordained result\" rather than working within the confines of the law.\n\nA citizenship question on the census would result in undercounting Latinos and undocumented people living in the United States, thus undermining the very purpose of the decennial census.\n\nIn fact, Ross knew the impact of adding such a question and moved forward with his attempt anyway. Seeborg recognized the \"unrefuted evidence\" from Census Bureau staff showing a citizenship question would depress response rates among Latino and noncitizen communities.\n\nCalifornia, home of the largest number of Hispanic people, argued that any effort to undercount people living in the state could impact their representation in both Congress and the electoral college, since both are based on population. In fact, the Washington Post previously reported that the overall result would benefit Republicans for the next decade.\n\nFurther, census data is used to allocate federal funds, so undercounting certain segments of the population could have dramatic impacts on both state and local funding formulas.\n\nIn the end, Seeborg found that Ross \"acted in bad faith\" throughout the process.\n\nThis was the second federal court to rule against the Trump administration's racist attempts to undercount Latinos in the 2020 census. Earlier this year, Judge Jesse M. Furman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled Ross made \"egregious\" violations of the law in his attempt to add the question.\n\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case based on Furman's ruling, with arguments scheduled to take place on April 23. The court will ultimately decide if the Trump administration's racist attempts to manipulate the census are out of bounds.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump whined in January that briefings would be curtailed because the press covers Sanders \"so rudely & inaccurately\" so he told her \"not to bother\" with the events.\n\nEven when Sanders has held briefings, they are extremely short and with limited questions. She has used them to berate the press and to further Trump's conspiracy theories about the ongoing criminal investigations of him and his campaign.\n\nIn lieu of the briefings, Sanders has preferred to appear for softball interviews on Fox News, where she is able to amplify the administration's lies and propaganda in an overly friendly venue.\n\nWithout the briefings, reporters have only had one opportunity to ask the administration to address several major issues that have surfaced in the last 80 days.\n\nThese include:\n\nCongressional testimony from Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer revealing details of Trump's actions to violate federal law, his racism, and overall ignorant and unethical behavior;\n\nTrump's decision to stonewall congressional investigations into his violations of national security and ethical guidelines, including possible criminal acts;\n\nAnger from Americans after their tax refunds shrunk thanks to the GOP tax scam.\n\nTrump and Republicans presiding over an increase in the national debt after promising for years to lower it;\n\nTrump's humiliating failure on the world stage as he was fooled once again by North Korea;\n\nA new election being ordered in North Carolina after the Republican candidate he supported got caught in an election fraud scandal;\n\nTrump's Homeland Security secretary justifying children being put in cages.\n\nTrump's invocation of a phony \"national emergency\" of constitutionally dubious validity to build his racist border wall;\n\nTrump's hypocrisy in commenting on anti-Semitism while he has offered praise of Nazis;\n\nAnd much, much more.\n\nFor all the chatter that Trump is \"media savvy,\" he has mostly avoided real journalists. He derides them as \"fake news\" for accurately reporting on him while regularly sitting down with his personal fanboy, Sean Hannity, for fawning lovefests.\n\nTrump and his team fear accountability, and they are doing their best to avoid even moderately toned questions that challenge their lies and distortions.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "And the evidence comes from Trump's own Department of Justice.\n\nDuring her disastrous Wednesday hearing on the Trump administration's inhumane family separation policy, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Congress that she didn't know of any parents who were deported without being given the chance to bring their children with them.\n\nBut just hours later, TPM reports, Trump's own Department of Justice filed a court document that contradicted her testimony \u2014 and indicates that Nielsen may have lied to Congress.\n\nThe court filing admits that up to 471 parents may have been deported without being given the chance to reunite with their children. The filing was part of an ongoing class action lawsuit against the government on behalf of those parents \u2014 many of whom say they were tricked into signing away their rights to ever see their kids again.\n\nBut during her testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee, Nielsen acted like she had never heard of this lawsuit or those parents.\n\nRep. Kathleen Rice (D-NY) asked Nielsen, \"Can you confirm that there has never been a parent deported, under your tenure, without finding out if they want their children to go with them?\"\n\n\"To the best of my knowledge every parent was afforded that option,\" Nielsen responded, under oath.\n\nThe question from Rice was a follow-up to an earlier question along the same lines from Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), to whom Nielsen responded, \"There was no parent who has been deported, to my knowledge, without multiple opportunities to take their children with them.\"\n\nAfter Nielsen doubled down on her denial, Rice accused her of breaking the law by lying to Congress.\n\n\"This is a lie,\" Rice said on Twitter. \"Lying to Congress under oath is a felony. The last person who did that is going to prison.\"\n\nThis is a lie. Lying to Congress under oath is a felony. The last person who did that is going to prison. https://t.co/bbjVS4uGGc \u2014 Kathleen Rice (@RepKathleenRice) March 6, 2019\n\nRice was likely referring to Trump's longtime attorney and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's involvement in business dealings about a proposed development in Russia.\n\nEvidence contradicting Nielsen's testimony has been available in news reports for months. But the DOJ's court filing that same day put an especially fine point on it.\n\nIn a joint status report filed in federal court hours after Nielsen testified, DOJ lawyers admitted 471 parents may have been deported \"without their children, and without being given the opportunity to elect or waive reunification in accordance with the preliminary injunction.\"\n\n471 parents is significantly more than the zero parents Nielsen claims she knew of.\n\nDuring the height of the Trump administration's cruel family separation policy, many parents complained that they were tricked into agreeing to be deported without taking their children with them. Buzzfeed reported that some parents who did not speak English were pressured to sign documents they could not read, which gave up their right to reunite with their children. Other parents signed documents thinking it was the only way to be reunited, only to find out later the documents meant the opposite.\n\nEvidence of these atrocities have been in the public domain since at least July 2018.\n\nNielsen either knew this \u2014 which would mean she lied to Congress \u2014 or should have known this yet somehow didn't. That means that at best, she was neglecting one of the most high-profile issues facing her department.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He was convicted in federal court in Virginia.\n\nHe has yet to be sentenced for the other felonies he pleaded guilty to last September in federal court in Washington, D.C., including conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Manafort expressed no remorse for his crimes, and instead seemed to whine about the difficult time he's had in prison \u2014 where he has been held after committing more crimes after he was indicted.\n\nManafort had asked for leniency in a sentencing memo he filed with the court, claiming he did not pose a risk of recidivism \u2014 despite having committed more crimes while under federal indictment.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller was quick to point this out in a sentencing memo his team filed with the federal judge in Virginia.\n\n\"Nowhere does the defendant address the fact that after he was indicted in two districts for crimes spanning a decade, including crimes through 2017, he committed the additional crimes in 2018 of tampering with witnesses while on bail from both courts,\" according to Mueller's memo.\n\nThere's still a question of whether Manafort could receive a pardon from Trump.\n\nHowever, prosecutors in New York state have built another criminal case against Manafort that they'd file if Trump chooses to pardon him.\n\nAnd, if that case is successful, it would make Manafort pardon-proof. That's because presidents can only pardon people for federal crimes, not state ones.\n\nSo, Manafort is pretty much screwed.

The note suggests that Trump set up a meeting with the American Dental Association (ADA) to discuss creating an oversight committee to \"stop the waste\" and \"save the administration $250 million.\"\n\nThe note is vague to a fault, and when Hazzouri was asked about it, he said he'd only sent a note on behalf of the ADA and that he knew there was \"a lot of money\" spent on dental care for veterans and Native Americans, and he thought the ADA \"wanted to have a little hand in it.\"\n\nTrump being Trump, he read this hazy handwritten message and decided it was somehow worth passing along to Shulkin.\n\nAll this comes on the heels of another tawdry and corrupt incident involving Trump's Mar-a-Lago cronies and the VA. Last year it came to light that three of Trump's ultra-rich buddies with no experience in government whatsoever, Marvel Entertainment Chairman and CEO Isaac \"Ike\" Perlmutter, Palm Beach doctor Bruce Moskowitz, and lawyer Marc Sherman, exerted a shocking amount of control over the department.\n\nThe trio of Trump pals was reviewing $10 billion government contracts, setting up electronic records projects, and trying to push the VA to partner with Apple. They also helped vet candidates to lead the department. None of these men were elected or appointed to do anything of the sort.\n\nThanks to Democrats retaking the House during the 2018 midterms, though, this cozy crony arrangement is now under investigation by Congress.\n\nIn an administration rife with corruption, Mar-a-Lago stands out as proof that Trump can be bought for next to nothing.

    "text": "Brian Kemp's years of suppressing the black vote in Georgia might have helped him win his race for governor.\n\nAfter years of actively working to suppress the voting rights of primarily black voters as Georgia's secretary of state, Republican Brian Kemp narrowly won his 2018 campaign to become the state's governor.\n\nBut now, Congress is taking a closer look at the shady tactics Kemp employed while he was secretary of state \u2014 and whether those tactics might have impacted the results of the election.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee is \"investigating recent reports of serious problems with voter registration, voter access, and other matters affecting the ability of people in Georgia to exercise their right to vote,\" Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chair of the committee, wrote in a Wednesday letter to Kemp.\n\nCummings added that the committee is concerned about \"reports that Georgians faced unprecedented challenges with registering to vote and significant barriers to casting their votes during the 2018 election.\"\n\nThe letter was also signed by Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), chair of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.\n\nAs the letter notes, as secretary of state Kemp helped purge 1.4 million people from the Georgia voting rolls and closed 200 polling locations across the state.\n\nAnd in 2018 \u2014 when he was running for governor \u2014 he placed the voter registration applications of 53,000 people, mostly people of color, on hold. During that 2018 election, voters in predominantly black counties waited hours and hours to cast their vote, even though there were unused voting machines sitting in warehouses.\n\nAfter years of these efforts to suppress the black vote, Kemp narrowly defeated Stacey Abrams, who could have been Georgia's first black woman governor.\n\nWhen she was asked during the campaign if she believed Kemp was intentionally suppressing certain voters by putting those 53,000 registrations on hold, Abrams replied, \"Absolutely.\" She added that the schemes were part of a \"pattern of behavior,\" and that Kemp had even settled a lawsuit over the same process in 2016 because it had \"a disproportionate effect on people of color.\"\n\nCongress is looking for documents related to voter purges, polling location closures, and the availability and use of voting machines in the state in order to get a better picture of how Kemp and the Republican-led state of Georgia may have driven down voter turnout.\n\nIn addition to a letter to Kemp, Cummings and Raskin sent a letter to Georgia's current secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. Both Kemp and Raffensperger have until March 20 to provide the committee the requested documents.\n\nThe new Democratic majority in the House is doing more than just investigating previous efforts of voter suppression by Republicans \u2014 it's putting voting rights front and center in the legislative agenda.\n\nThe marquee bill of the new majority, H.R. 1, is focused on promoting voter registration, ending partisan gerrymandering, and increasing the security of America's election infrastructure to safeguard against foreign infiltration.\n\nIn addition, Democrats recently introduced the Voting Rights Advancement Act, a bill to update and modernize the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThrough both investigation and legislation, one party is showing a clear commitment to the most bedrock principle of democracy: the right to vote.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Korean Central TV is the only official source of television news in North Korea and serves to prop up Kim Jong Un's dictatorship.\n\nThe film highlights Trump's decision to elevate the regime and directly negotiate with them, praising him for his \"willingness to meet with Chairman Kim Jong-un more often in order to bring about fruits in improving the North Korea-U.S. relations.\"\n\nYonhap notes the film includes footage of when \"Trump patted Kim on the arm while the North Korean leader smiled.\" It also shows Trump glad-handing with North Korea's foreign minister and one of Kim's top aides.\n\nThe film is more evidence that Trump continues to be played for a fool by North Korea.\n\nAfter the botched summit, satellite images were published that show renewed activity at the Tongchang-ri satellite launch facility, which had been dormant since August of 2018.\n\nTrump has continued to claim that his diplomatic efforts have reduced the threat from North Korea to America's allies like South Korea and Japan, as well as to the United States. But again and again, the regime continues to pursue its nuclear ambitions while Trump makes one mistake after another.\n\nIn the last summit, which also failed to produce an agreement that would denuclearize North Korea, Trump was seen saluting a general from the country's oppressive military, which helped to give the pariah nation another propaganda coup.\n\nThrough Trump's actions, America has elevated a nation that has been ostracized by most of the free world for their oppressive and aggressive stances. Instead of using American diplomatic weight to make the region and the world safer, Trump has served as a backdrop for the legitimization of North Korea.\n\nTrump for many years played the part of a businessman on a television show, while in reality he was a serial failure.

To do so, he's taking aim at domestic programs, including education.\n\nRepublicans rammed their tax scam through Congress at the end of 2017, with the goal of lavishing wealthy corporations with billions of dollars in tax breaks. Wall Street banks saw record profits, and the bill ensured that more than 80 percent of the benefits would eventually make it into the pockets of the wealthiest one percent of Americans. Now, new data shows the GOP tax plan exploded the national deficit at the beginning of this fiscal year.\n\nIn order to pay for the massive debt created by the tax cuts, Trump needs to make correspondingly massive cuts elsewhere. So, Trump is taking aim at America's children, aiming to slash billions from the Education Department, along with other critical programs like environmental protection and foreign aid, all of which could see cuts of 5 percent or more.\n\nThe proposed cuts are already being met with stiff resistance.\n\n\"Instead of funding programs that help communities thrive, Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers sold out working and middle-class families to give massive tax breaks to the country's largest corporations and wealthiest individuals,\" Ryan Thomas, spokesperson for Tax March, told Shareblue Media. \"As Trump tries once again to cut funding for public education, the American people will not forget that Republicans siphoned funding away from students and teachers to give cut taxes for the rich.\"\n\nSadly, this is not the first time Trump has looked to cut education funding. In last year's budget, Trump tried to take away billions from a program that helped train teachers on new instructional methods to improve student outcomes.\n\nFor most of President Obama's administration, Republican deficit hawk frauds like former Speaker Paul Ryan said the national deficit was the single most important issue in the country. But as soon as Republicans gained control of the White House and all of Congress in 2016, those concerns disappeared.\n\nNow Trump wants to pretend to care about fiscal responsibility. And in order to show how much he cares, he is trying to finance tax cuts for billionaires on the backs of teachers and children.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Jerry Nadler (D-CA), to kick off a massive investigation into Trump.\n\n\"Jerry Nadler said that the reason they had to do it is for the first two years of the administration, Sarah, there was no oversight,\" Host Steve Doocy said.\n\n\"What Chairman Nadler is missing is, is that the first two years were not about oversight, they were about success,\" Sanders replied.\n\nIt's stunning that Sanders would admit this \u2014 that Republicans just didn't care about performing the constitutionally mandated oversight duties of Congress, and that they were more worried about their own \"success\" as a party than about holding their leader accountable.\n\nFor over two years, Republicans in Congress, led by then-Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, refused to follow the Constitution and exercise oversight of the executive branch, instead choosing to focus time and resources on pointless topics like Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\nAs they did this, they also failed to accomplish most of their key policy priorities, like repealing Obamacare. Their biggest \"success\" was to pass a deeply unpopular tax scam that favored the ultra-wealthy and shrank ordinary Americans' tax refunds.\n\nMeanwhile, the GOP also ignored the evidence emerging on a near-daily basis about Trump and those in his inner circle, as prosecutors were piling up indictments and guilty pleas.\n\n34 people associated with Trump and/or his campaign have been indicted or pled guilty to federal charges. These include Michael Flynn (Trump national security adviser), Paul Manafort (Trump campaign chairman), Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos (Trump campaign aides), and Roger Stone (Trump political adviser).\n\nAt the same time, key figures like Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen have released the details of how Trump himself played a key role in violating federal law by paying off porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her from telling voters about her affair with Trump.\n\nTrump is also implicated in crimes involving his scam charity and the ongoing use of his hotel properties as a bribery mechanism to influence his presidency.\n\nTrump's executive branch has also been swimming in corruption, including Cabinet officials wasting millions on luxury travel, personal luxuries, and other indulgences.\n\nRepublicans studiously ignored these issues, and instead spent their time passing disastrous tax scams and enabling the abuse of immigrant children.\n\nSince Democrats took over the House, congressional committees have been working furiously to address the backlog of corruption and crime that has gone uninvestigated in two years of Republican complicity.\n\nRepublicans, now in the minority, are continuing to support ignoring Trump's crimes, led by Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).\n\nRepublicans in Congress have been co-conspirators in Trump's crooked enterprise \u2014 and Sanders is right there with them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the highest ranking senator in Congress right now, told CNN Tuesday when asked about whether he was concerned about Trump's hush money scheme. \"So I can't say.\"\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, another Iowa Republican who is up for reelection in 2020, also claimed to be ignorant of Trump's hush money payments when asked about whether the Senate should investigate them.\n\n\"Possibly at some point \u2014 I don't know enough about it,\" Ernst told CNN.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's longtime personal lawyer and self-proclaimed \"fixer,\" testified about the hush money payments just last week in a blockbuster hearing before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThat means Grassley and Ernst want us to believe they paid zero attention to a hearing that took place across the Capitol and which dominated news coverage. Maybe they had blindfolds and earplugs in.\n\nBut even if you believed they didn't pay attention to the Cohen hearing, you'd also have to believe they have paid zero attention to the news for more than a year.\n\nThat's because the hush money payments Trump made to two of his former mistresses have also been in the news for more than a year, including after Cohen himself pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws with the payments last summer.\n\nAs of March 2018, only 16 percent of registered voters had heard \"nothing at all\" about \"adult film star Stormy Daniels receiving a payment of $130,000 from President Trump's attorney before the 2016 election,\" according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll.\n\nThat's a tiny minority of registered voters \u2014 and that was a year ago, before the scandal got even more traction.\n\nOf course, denying knowledge of well-known news stories is nothing new for congressional Republicans who are desperate to avoid criticizing Trump.\n\nFormer House Speaker Paul Ryan used to deny having seen Trump's most offensive tweets to get out of having to comment about them. Maybe Grassley and Ernst learned their head-in-the-sand technique from him.\n\nEither way, these Republican senators are either living under a rock, or they're lying \u2014 neither of which should give the American public confidence in the job they're doing.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Manafort really thought he deserved special treatment. He got smacked down.\n\nLate last week, former Trump campaign chairman \u2014 and convicted felon \u2014 Paul Manafort filed his sentencing memorandum. In it, Manafort argued that the court should show him mercy and impose a shorter prison sentence than that recommended by the United States Probation Office. Now, the special counsel has filed a reply memo, and it couldn't be clearer: Manafort deserves no leniency.\n\nThe government's memo addresses a few different factors that go into determining whether a defendant deserves a lighter sentence. Among them: Did the defendant accept responsibility for their crimes? And how likely is it that the defendant will re-offend, also known as the potential for recidivism?\n\nNeither of those turned out very well for Manafort.\n\nManafort hasn't done a great job accepting responsibility for his crimes. Instead, as the government put it, he \"blames everyone from the Special Counsel's Office to his Ukrainian clients for his own criminal choices.\"\n\nManafort also asked the court to consider that he originally opened foreign bank accounts because his foreign clients asked him to do so. Fine, says the special counsel's office, but the foreign clients aren't the ones that told Manafort not to report those accounts on his taxes and fail to report millions of dollars in income.\n\nIn a genuinely jaw-dropping move, Manafort asked for leniency because he had to forfeit much of his money and property. The special counsel's office had to point out the incredibly obvious: that the money and property can't be said to be Manafort's if he got it via committing crimes.\n\nManafort's assertion that he presents no risk of recidivism didn't fare much better. And how could it? Manafort literally committed more crimes while he was already under indictment for earlier crimes. That doesn't exactly bode well when you're claiming you won't commit more felonies once you get out of prison.\n\nAnd then there's the awkward part where Manafort still hasn't paid back $6 million he owes to the Treasury. It's pretty tough to demand the government take it easy on you when you're still sitting on your ill-gotten gains.\n\nManafort's sentencing is coming up on Thursday, at which point we'll be able to see if the judge decides to stay within the guidelines recommended by the probation office. They've recommended a range from 19 to 24 years. For Manafort, who is 69, there's no way that isn't functionally a life sentence.\n\nUnless, of course, he gets a pardon from his old boss, Donald Trump. If that happens, though, it looks like New York state is waiting in the wings to file state-level charges, and there's nothing Trump can do about that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The same with Turkey. Failure with Iran and failure with Venezuela. Nothing but failures at every turn,\" Kiselyov jeered.\n\nHe then mocked Trump for calling himself a master dealmaker who could talk Kim Jong Un into giving up North Korea's supply of nuclear weapons.\n\n\"Trump, who calls himself the 'master of the deal,' left Vietnam empty-handed,\" Kiselyov said of Trump's failed North Korea summit.\n\nIndeed, while Trump made concessions to North Korea \u2014 including halting joint military exercises with South Korea and canceling two scheduled military drills \u2014 Kim Jong Un walked away from the talks without giving up anything.\n\nAhead of the summit, Trump even dropped the demand that North Korea provide a full accounting of its nuclear arsenal. This is considered a key component of any potential nuclear deal with North Korea, so dropping the demand was essentially an admission that no such deal would be reached at the summit.\n\nCiting these concessions, Russia's former ambassador to North Korea, Gleb Ivashentsev, called the summit a huge victory for North Korea's young leader.\n\nKim Jong Un \"[forced] the head of the largest imperialist nation to negotiate with him as an equal,\" Ivashentsev told Russia's state TV program \"60 minutes,\" according to The Daily Beast.\n\nHe continued, suggesting that Trump used the summit to distract from his failures at home, including the recent government shutdown, his failure to secure funding for a border wall, and the damning testimony of Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen.\n\nOther Russian officials offered similar takes, saying the summit represents a colossal failure for Trump and a monumental achievement for Kim Jong Un, who managed to put himself on equal footing with the leader of the free world \u2014 without giving up a thing.\n\nSimilarly, several Russian officials suggested that Kim Jong Un and other world leaders may be hesitant to make any deals with Trump because the future of his presidency isn't even certain.\n\nThe president of Russia's Institute of the Middle East mockingly referred to Trump as the \"acting president of the United States,\" while Konstantin Asmolov, an expert from the Center for Korean Studies, told Russian state TV that making a deal with Trump \u2014 whom he referred to as a \"clown\" \u2014 would be foolish, since he could soon be ousted from office.\n\nPerhaps the most humiliating part of all of this? Russian state media is offering a more accurate take on Trump's failed North Korea summit than the White House and its personal propaganda arm at Fox News.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

They have a pulpit by which people can take things the wrong way, and there\u2019s a lot of people out there looking toward them for a green light to do bad things.\"\n\nHe added that he does not believe Trump officials are \"intentionally trying to incite violence.\" But, he said, \"I do believe that some of their words unintentionally can give a green light to people, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to be careful of.\"\n\nBefore he was elected to office, Jones led the successful prosecution of Ku Klux Klan members who planted a bomb that killed four black girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, nearly 40 years after they committed the crime.\n\nJones understands how violent bigotry works, and he is correct that it doesn't matter whether Trump officials intend to incite violence. They are still doing it \u2014 and are still refusing to change course despite mounting evidence that their actions are causing harm.\n\nSince Trump's election, the FBI has found that reports of hate crimes have increased in America. Despite this data and the moral crisis it has provoked, Trump's fellow Republicans have largely chosen inaction on hate crimes legislation.\n\nTrump has also refused to stop calling journalists the \"enemies of the people,\" despite evidence that his words have specifically incited violence and attempted violence against journalists. He continues to spread dangerous lies about Democrats supporting \"infanticide,\" despite America's decades-long history of violent anti-abortion terrorism. And he has only reluctantly condemned white supremacy, despite a recent surge of white supremacist terrorism.\n\nSpecifically on the issue of LGBTQ equality, Trump and Pence have been trying to turn the clock back. The administration is currently trying to overturn the right of transgender servicemembers to wear the military uniform, after President Barack Obama changed policy to allow equal service.\n\nTrump is also plotting to manipulate federal law so that LGBTQ people are no longer protected by anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThese actions are a clear attempt to hold on to the loyalty of anti-LGBTQ voters, who support the Trump presidency in part thanks to Mike Pence, a long-time homophobe.\n\nTrump and Pence have embraced hate and even made it official government policy. Violent bigots have taken their words to heart, and hurt and killed innocent Americans.\n\nAnd Jones is calling them out for the harm they are causing every day.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Where'd you get that?\"\n\nBut then the paper read him the direct quote.\n\n\"Pompeo fell silent for about six seconds,\" USA Today reported.\n\nInstead of acknowledging his lie and how it had been quickly disproven, Pompeo simply moved on, replying, \"What they said is they're prepared to continue conversations with us and that\u2019s what we intend to do.\"\n\nBut a senior official at the State Department where Pompeo is in charge told ABC News that the two countries can't even agree on what denuclearization means, which would be a considerable obstacle to future summits.\n\nNational Security Advisor John Bolton has also been in the press, defending Trump's ineptitude and also denying reality.\n\nMeeting North Korea one-on-one in international diplomatic venues is a major concession to the regime, who was treated like an international pariah under the previous two presidencies. But Bolton claimed, \"The President's view is he gave nothing away.\"\n\nFor years North Korea has demanded that joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises be discontinued. Without any deal in hand from the regime, Trump went ahead and canceled the event anyway. But Bolton denied reality, much like Pompeo had.\n\nAsked if it was a concession, Bolton told Fox News, \"I don't think the president sees it that way at all.\"\n\nTrump can \"see\" anything he wants to, but the reality on full display to America, and the entire world, is a massive diplomatic failure and the corresponding flailing attempts to cover up that mistake.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Rand Paul (R-KY) \u2014 himself a doctor, who practiced ophthalmology before coming to Congress \u2014 spewed irresponsible anti-vaccine talking points during a Senate committee hearing on Tuesday, arguing that vaccines are dangerous and that parents should have the choice of whether or not to vaccinate their children.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to say that there are no risks to vaccines,\u201d Paul said Tuesday at a hearing on vaccines, according to the Daily Beast. \u201cEven the government admits that children are sometimes injured by vaccines.\u201d\n\nPaul went on to suggest that giving parents the choice to vaccinate their kids was a matter of personal liberty \u2014 and even went so far as to equate vaccines with a \"false sense of security.\"\n\nAs we contemplate forcing parents to choose this or that vaccine, I think it\u2019s important to remember that force is not consistent with the American story, nor is force consistent with the liberty our forefathers sought when they came to America. I don't think you have to have one or the other, though. I'm not here to say don\u2019t vaccinate your kids. If this hearing is for persuasion I\u2019m all for the persuasion. I\u2019ve vaccinated myself and I\u2019ve vaccinated my kids. For myself and my children I believe that the benefits of vaccines greatly outweighing the risks, but I still don\u2019t favor giving up on liberty for a false sense of security.\n\nSen. @RandPaul on vaccines: \"I still do not favor giving up on liberty for a false sense of security.\" Full video here: https://t.co/iM83n6S3nR pic.twitter.com/vieM5R6bms \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) March 5, 2019\n\nThe CDC asserts that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks, contrary to Paul's claims.\n\nPaul made his remarks even after a massive new study came out confirming once again that vaccines do not cause autism, as many anti-vaccine conspiracy theories baselessly allege \u2014 and which many anti-vaccine parents might think of when they hear Paul talk about vaccine \"risks.\"\n\nSome of Paul's own Republican colleagues made a strong case for vaccination at the hearing.\n\nSen.

    "text": "Trump's trade war has turned into a 'worst-case scenario' for Americans.\n\nWe already know Trump's disastrous, prolonged trade war is hurting farmers, companies, and even entire states. But a pair of new studies published over the weekend expose the depth and breadth of harm Trump is responsible for.\n\nTrump's trade war is costing companies and consumers $3 billion per month in additional tax costs. And those costs aren't being paid by China or other countries, as Trump often claims. No, this study shows American consumers \u2014 teachers, factory workers, and farmers \u2014 along with U.S. companies bear almost all the cost from Trump's tariffs, according to economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University and Columbia University.\n\n\"This is kind of the worst-case scenario in terms of consumers,\" David Weinstein, one of the authors of the study, told Bloomberg.\n\nA different study from four economists, including the World Bank's chief economist, confirms the economic harm caused by Trump. That study puts the annual losses from Trump tariff cost increases at a staggering $68.8 billion. Even after accounting for any gains from Trump's trade war, the analysis pegged the overall harm from Trump's actions at $6.4 billion per year.\n\nThe harm caused by Trump's trade war is hitting his own base the hardest. \"Workers in very Republican counties bore the brunt of the costs of the trade war, in part because retaliations disproportionately targeted agricultural sectors, and in part because U.S. tariffs raised the costs of inputs used by these counties,\" the second study explains.\n\nThe academic study backs up claims by South Dakota's Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican. She recently said her state has been \"devastated by the trade wars that are going on.\"\n\nTrump's incompetence may very well come from a deep ignorance about how the global economy functions. When asked if she thinks Trump understands the basics of macroeconomic policy, former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen responded simply, \"No, I do not.\"\n\nWhile he may not understand how things work, Trump's actions are having immensely negative impacts on American families. These two studies, which Bloomberg calls two of the most authoritative studies on the topic of Trump's trade war, show hardworking families across the country are paying a high price for Trump's decisions.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "William Barr doesn't see any reason to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation even though he is utterly ethically compromised.\n\nIt's official: Trump's newly confirmed attorney general, William Barr, will not recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation.\n\nThis should come as no surprise, given that Trump got rid of Jeff Sessions in large part because Sessions had recused himself from overseeing the probe \u2014 after he \"forgot\" to disclose a number of contacts with Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nThere was no way that Trump was going to replace Sessions with someone who would also recuse.\n\nBarr, arguably, is even worse than Sessions in terms of entanglements that warrant recusal. Before taking office, Barr admitted discussing the Mueller probe with Mike Pence. Pence is represented by a counsel \u2014 a criminal lawyer \u2014 for his interactions with the special counsel investigation.\n\nWorse, Trump actually tried to hire Barr to defend him in the Russia probe. And then there's the matter of the unsolicited 19-page memo Barr sent to the Department of Justice in 2018. In that memo, he explained that he doesn't think Trump can be investigated for obstruction of justice because presidents have the authority to fire someone for any reason, and that therefore the investigation was \"fatally flawed.\"\n\nEven during his confirmation hearing, Barr refused to agree to release the whole of the Mueller report once the investigation is finished. Instead, he's vaguely pledged that his goal \"will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law.\"\n\nBesides the matter of the Mueller investigation, it's always been obvious that Barr was chosen for his utter loyalty to all things Trump. He thinks the border wall is a great idea. He believes that Hillary Clinton should be investigated over the Uranium One deal, a right-wing fever-dream conspiracy theory that has been repeatedly debunked. He seems likely to join Trump in a war on the press, saying there are situations where he would jail reporters.\n\nPerhaps most important to Trump, besides his willingness to likely bury the Mueller report, is that Barr holds an incredibly broad view of executive power. He's a backer of the concept of a \"unitary executive.\" Under that theory, presidents are relatively unfettered by checks and balances, and can use executive orders and decrees to get around Congress and enact policies without legislative buy-in. That view also says that Congress should only have limited ways to control a president's use of executive power.\n\nWith this refusal to recuse, Barr is showing us who he is. He's not, as he insisted at his confirmation hearing, a believer in the rule of law. He's a believer in the rule of Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump sure seems worried about what crimes Democrats will uncover during their investigations.\n\nAn unhinged Trump melted down on Twitter Tuesday morning, lashing out at congressional oversight in a series of misleading morning tweets. In the course of an hour, Trump accused congressional leaders of harassment and of being crazy, and said Democrats themselves are real criminals.\n\n\"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\" was the all-caps text of one statement.\n\nTrump's freak out moment comes a day after the House Judiciary Committee requested documents and information from more than 80 individuals and entities, including Trump's family, businesses, and many within the Trump administration.\n\n\"81 letter[s] sent to innocent people to harass them,\" Trump whined. However, many criminal associates of Trump are on the list; men who have pleaded guilty to multiple felonies.\n\nLetters were sent to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison after being found guilty on eight counts related to fraud and money laundering. Rick Gates, the Trump campaign deputy chairman, is on the list after pleading guilty to a variety of crimes. Other criminal associates of Trump include his longtime lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, and Trump's high-profile campaign surrogate and first National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn.\n\nWhen complicit Republicans were in control, Trump \"evaded accountability for his near-daily attacks on our basic legal, ethical, and constitutional rules and norms,\" Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler said in a statement.\n\nNow that Democrats are upholding their constitutional oversight responsibilities, Trump can't handle it, accusing Nadler and other Democrats of being \"stone cold CRAZY.\"\n\n\"The greatest overreach in the history of our Country,\" he reeled. \"The Dems are obstructing justice and will not get anything done. A big, fat, fishing expedition desperately in search of a crime, when in fact the real crime is what the Dems are doing, and have done!\"\n\nTrump does not elaborate on what specific crimes Democrats have committed. On the other hand, Trump's own Justice Department identified Trump, or \"Individual 1,\" as part of a criminal conspiracy guilty of paying hush money to one of Trump's alleged mistresses in order to influence the 2016 election.\n\nTwice during his meltdown, Trump accused the Democrats of not getting anything done for the country. While Trump seems focused on the far-reaching investigation into a litany of potential crimes committed by himself and his family, Democrats in the House are able to both investigate and legislate.\n\nLast week, the House passed a pair of bills requiring universal background checks and closing the so-called \"Charleston loophole,\" the first major pieces of gun safety legislation in a generation. Despite objections from Republicans, the Education and Labor Committee passed the Pay Equity Act, a bill to address the gender wage gap. And this coming Friday, the House will vote on and likely pass H.R. 1, a landmark bill to fight voter suppression, protect democracy, and ensure fair elections.\n\nAdditionally, Democrats ended the 35-day Trump shutdown, funded the government, and passed a resolution blocking Trump's fake national emergency at the southern border. All this was accomplished even though Democrats have only been in charge of the House of Representatives for two months.\n\nIn November 2018, voters put Democrats in charge to clean up the mess Trump and Republicans created in Washington. Through both serious investigations and a commitment to passing legislation that helps all Americans, Democrats are accomplishing the will of the voters.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But the whereabouts of the four other infants is not clear, according to the CBS News report.\n\nAccording to CBS, ICE blamed the spike in detained infants on an influx of migrants on the southern border.\n\nHowever, ICE usually doesn't detain asylum-seeking mothers with babies unless they are determined to be a danger or flight risk. And given infants are incapable of caring for themselves, it stretches the imagination to think they could pose a risk to the public.\n\n\"It's very disturbing and ludicrous that ICE is saying we have to make an assessment as to whether a five-month-old is a danger or flight risk,\" Katie Shepherd, National Advocacy Counsel for the Immigration Justice Campaign at the American Immigration Council, told CBS News.\n\nThis is not the first time the Trump administration's detention of children and pregnant mothers has caused an uproar.\n\nTwo children have died in U.S. custody since the Trump administration implemented its needless \"zero-tolerance\" policy, which forces migrants exercising their right to claim asylum at the border to be detained until their claims can be heard.\n\nThe first death was on Dec. 8, 2018, when a 7-year-old girl from Guatemala died from shock and dehydration, while another 8-year-old Guatemalan child died in custody on Christmas Day 2018.\n\nSimilarly, the number of pregnant women who have miscarried in U.S. custody also spiked since the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy was implemented.\n\nStill, Trump has touted his zero-tolerance policy and his push to end \"catch and release\" \u2014 in which vulnerable asylum-seeking migrants like pregnant women and families with children are released into the U.S. until they have a court date on their asylum claim.\n\nAnd Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, has defended her boss, Trump, on the issue \u2014 despite the fact that these policies have led to these vulnerable populations being held in unsafe and unsanitary detention facilities.\n\n\"Illegal actions have and must have consequences, no more free passes, no more get out of jail free cards,\" Nielsen said back in June. \"In communities every day, if you commit a crime police will take you to jail regardless of whether you have a family.\"\n\nWhile the White House has claimed to be \"pro-life,\" their jailing of infants and pregnant women suggests they are anything but.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump thought his executive declaration of a national emergency was the way to get a wall. He forgot about the fact that only Congress can seize land for something like a wall in the first place.\n\nIn a textbook example of how to shoot yourself in the foot, Trump's emergency declaration that allows him to build his border wall may actually prevent him from building his border wall. It's all thanks to the principle of eminent domain \u2014 the government's right to seize land from private landholders for a public purpose \u2014 and the fact that only Congress, not the executive branch, can seize that land.\n\nBy all metrics, Trump's national emergency declaration has proven to be a resounding failure. Just over two weeks ago, when he declared the entirely unnecessary \"emergency,\" there were immediately two lawsuits. Then, a third of the country \u2014 16 states \u2014 sued to stop implementation of the fake emergency. The ACLU has also sued.\n\nThings are no better on the legislative front. Last month, the House of Representatives passed a resolution terminating the emergency declaration. With the defections of Republican Sens. Rand Paul (KY), Susan Collins (ME), Lisa Murkowski (AK), and Thom Tillis (FL), it looks like the Senate will also pass something opposing the declaration, forcing Trump into a veto.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the House Judiciary Committee is also going to investigate the declaration, calling it a \"reckless disregard for the separation of powers and [Trump's] own responsibilities under our constitutional system.\"\n\nAll of these obstacles might be surmountable, but it is pretty tough to get around the fact that the power of eminent domain just isn't something the executive branch can exercise, no matter how much Trump wishes it could.\n\nTrump's border wall fiasco requires the government to seize more than 1,000 miles of Texas land along the border, but his emergency declaration is an executive branch decision \u2014 an executive order. He doesn't have the backing of Congress nor the authority of Congress behind him, which means he can't get his mitts on that land.\n\nRep. Will Hurd, a Republican with a district that encompasses 820 miles of the border in Texas, voted with the Democrats in condemning the wall declaration. He doesn't think that there's any need for the national emergency, and he definitely doesn't like the idea of the government taking land away from private citizens in his district.\n\nThat view is generally commonplace among Republicans because they see eminent domain as legislative overreach. But in the topsy-turvy world of Trump, Republicans now need to align themselves with the view that it is a great idea for the government to steal your land when it wants it for a governmental purpose.\n\nBut no matter how much they pretend to like that idea, though, there aren't enough votes to have Congress vote to seize the necessary land.\n\nTrump really managed to outsmart himself here, so much so that even with his utterly fake national emergency, he still won't get the wall he desperately wants.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has clearly made the decision he'll defend Trump, no matter what.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) went on television Sunday morning to defend Trump's every move. McCarthy is solidifying himself as one of Trump's most devoted champions, complete with all the self-delusion that requires.\n\nAppearing on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos,\" McCarthy dug in, insisting Trump has done nothing wrong and everyone is just out to get him. And at times, he defended Trump in a very Trumpian way: by completely making something up.\n\nMcCarthy insists that Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), the chair of the House Judiciary Committee \"decided to impeach the president the day the president won the election.\" As much as McCarthy is trying to paint Nadler as someone devoted to impeaching Trump from the very start, it's just not the case.\n\nNadler, who also appeared on \"This Week\" is proceeding carefully, saying that impeachment is \"a long way down the road,\" that his committee doesn't yet have the facts or evidence, and that he will initiate \"proper investigations.\" This is not the behavior of a wild-eyed zealot, unlike, say, Trey Gowdy's endless Benghazi investigations.\n\nMcCarthy doesn't believe Trump did anything worth impeaching him over, even after Michael Cohen's testimony about hush payments. Instead, McCarthy said both that it was Cohen's fault and it wasn't really a big deal \u2014 just a campaign finance violation where someone is fined. Then he tried to pivot to bragging about the current gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States.\n\nMcCarthy is also unhappy that the Democrats held a hearing while Trump was overseas, ad accused them of putting \"their dislike ahead of their country\" and that \"nobody else in history\" would criticize a president while he was overseas.\n\nOf course, the GOP routinely criticized Obama when he was overseas on behalf of the country. In 2009, Sen James Inhofe (R-OK) was so unhappy that Obama was working to address climate change at a conference in Copenhagen that he decided to send his own representatives to the conference to insist other nations not cooperate with Obama. GOP members like Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and then-Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) also went abroad to criticize Obama's policies.\n\nMcCarthy also doesn't care that Trump granted his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a top-secret security clearance over the objections of the CIA, in large part because they were worried Kushner could be compromised by foreign powers. McCarthy breezily dismissed that as well, saying the president has the right to pick whoever he wants for his national security team. That stance would be a lot more convincing if Kushner had any foreign policy experience whatsoever that made it a necessity he be a member of the national security team.\n\nWithout a doubt, Trump needs all the defenders he can get as he faces investigations into his obstruction of justice, his probable money laundering, Russian collusion, and more. McCarthy is just the latest in a series of Republicans willing to give up any credibility they have to throw their lot in with Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Republican-controlled Senate is poised to reject Trump's national emergency declaration.\n\nA majority of senators announced their intention to block Trump's fake national emergency on the southern border. The vote would be both a stinging rebuke to Trump and an abject failure by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to prop up Trump's failing agenda.\n\n\"I think what is clear in the Senate is that there will be enough votes to pass the resolution of disapproval,\" McConnell said Monday morning.\n\nSenate Democrats have opposed Trump's fake national emergency since he announced it in mid-February. And over the weekend, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) announced his plan to join the Democrats, becoming the fourth Republican to do so. By teaming up with the Democratic-led effort, the handful of Republicans push the total number of votes to block the declaration to 51, ensuring the resolution will pass when it comes to the floor later this month.\n\nIn late February, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a simple, 54-word resolution to block Trump's fake national emergency by a vote of 245-182. Under the provisions of the National Emergencies Act, McConnell is barred from preventing the House-passed resolution coming up for a vote in the Senate.\n\nThe votes come after Trump spent months begging and bullying Congress to hand him $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Congress repeatedly rejected Trump's pleas, even after Trump took the paychecks of 800,000 federal workers hostage during a 35-day government shutdown.\n\nDuring the shutdown, Trump threatened to issue a national emergency if he didn't get his way. At the time, even McConnell opposed the idea. Yet McConnell eventually caved on his own principles and supported Trump's questionably legal decision to declare an emergency.\n\nSome of McConnell's colleagues were not impressed with that decision. \"You're watching Mitch McConnell eat a manure sandwich in this whole process,\" former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) said of McConnell raising the white flag.\n\nIn defense of Monday's admission of defeat, McConnell added that he thinks Trump will reject the advice of Congress and veto the measure. McConnell added that he does not think Congress has the necessary two-thirds majority to override a presidential veto.\n\nIf the Senate does pass the resolution of disapproval, Trump would use the first veto of his presidency in a blatant attempt to usurp Congress' constitutional authority to set funding priorities for the country.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly and explicitly promised Mexico would pay for any wall along the border. After two years in office, Trump failed to convince Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAnd when the Senate votes to reject Trump's emergency, it will be yet another time Trump failed to convince Congress to force taxpayers to pay for it.\n\nBut Trump will toss aside campaign promises and the will of Congress in his unending obsession for a wall on the border.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Almost no one knows what he said to the Russian dictator behind closed doors.\n\nTrump seems to have worked very hard to keep the details of his one-on-one meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin a secret \u2014 and now Congress wants answers.\n\nThree House committee chairmen on Monday announced they are seeking documents and interviews from a host of senior White House officials relating to Trump's conversations with Putin.\n\n\"President Trump, on multiple occasions, appears to have taken steps to conceal the details of his communications with President Putin from other administration officials, Congress, and the American people,\" the Democratic chairs of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House Foreign Affairs Committee, and House Committee on Oversight and Reform wrote in a letter to acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Monday.\n\nThe three committee chairs \u2014 Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Elliot Engel of New York, and Elijah Cummings of Maryland \u2014 wrote in the letter that Trump \"reportedly seized notes pertaining to at least one meeting held with President Putin and directed at least one American interpreter not to discuss the substance of communications with President Putin with other federal officials.\"\n\nAnd they added that Trump's efforts to hide his communications with Putin \"raise profound national security, counterintelligence, and foreign policy concerns, especially in light of Russia\u2019s ongoing active measures campaign to improperly influence American elections.\"\n\nThe three committee chairmen said this attempt at secrecy warrants an expanded investigation into Trump's communications with Putin.\n\nThey're seeking information on:\n\nThe substance of Trump's communications with Putin.\n\nAny documents related to the \"existence and contents\" of Trump's communications with Putin.\n\nDocuments that show whether Trump's talks with Putin \"provided a basis for reconsideration, modification, or implementation of foreign policy.\"\n\nIf Trump \"sought to conceal, obscure, or otherwise misrepresent the substance of those communications.\"\n\nAnd if Trump or anyone working for him \"failed to create records of, or in any way destroyed, suppressed, mishandled, or otherwise withheld any federal or presidential records.\"\n\nAlso included in the information the chairmen are seeking is access to \"linguists, translators, or interpreters who participated in, attended, or in any way listened in on President Trump's in-person meetings with President Putin, as well as President Trump's phone calls with President Putin.\"\n\nSpecifically, the chairmen are seeking access to interview those who staffed Trump's meeting with Putin on July 7, 2017 at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, as well as his disastrous July 16, 2018 meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nThis is not the first major oversight step House Democrats took on Monday.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee announced the launch of a massive new probe looking into Trump's possible obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and public corruption. They launched the probe by demanding documents from more than 80 people and entities, including Trump's businesses.\n\nThis is what real oversight looks like, and is a clear reason why Republicans were so scared to lose the House.\n\nTrump can't hide anymore.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Trump administration rule would deny federal funds to clinics that offer abortions \u2014 or that even let women know where they can go to get an abortion.\n\nThe Trump administration's crusade against health care hit a roadblock on Monday as California became the first state to file a lawsuit against the administration's new restrictions aimed at family planning and abortion services.\n\nAnd by late Monday afternoon, a coalition of 21 additional states, including the District of Columbia, had filed a separate lawsuit over the same restrictions.\n\nThe lawsuits seek to block the implementation of a new rule that would deny federal family planning funds to clinics that offer abortions \u2014 or that even let women know where they can go to get an abortion.\n\nBecause it punishes doctors for offering medical advice, the change is effectively a \"gag rule\" that harms health care providers and hampers women from receiving the abortions they have every legal right to obtain.\n\nThe radical change to Title X of the Public Health Service Act could impact more than 4 million patients from receiving care \u2014 including 1.6 million who go to Planned Parenthood health centers \u2014 with the aim to redirect funds to anti-abortion faith-based health care groups.\n\n\"The Trump-Pence Administration has doubled down on its attacks on women's health,\" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who filed the first lawsuit, in a statement. The new rule, he said, \"denies patients access to critical healthcare services and prevents doctors from providing comprehensive and accurate information about medical care.\"\n\nTrump, Becerra noted, \"treats women and their care as if this were 1920, not 2019.\"\n\nCalifornia is the nation's largest recipient of Title X funds, which cover family planning services like contraception and sexual health screenings. Title X funds already cannot be used to cover abortion services \u2014 but the Trump administration wants to use them as a weapon to bully Title X providers out of using separate funding to offer abortion.\n\nOregon Gov. Kate Brown, in explaining why her state is leading the other Title X lawsuit, called out the Trump administration for its desire to \"rob individuals of the right to complete medical information and full access to the critical health care services they rely on.\"\n\nThis new domestic gag rule is similar to the global gag rule, which has been implemented by every Republican president since Reagan and which the Trump administration expanded in January 2017.\n\nThat rule prevents aid groups around the globe from receiving U.S. funding if they even mention abortion as an option for women.\n\nBecause this denies funding to many groups that provide comprehensive reproductive health services to marginalized women and girls, the real impact of the policy has been more unintended pregnancies, an increase in the number of unsafe abortions, and thousands more women dying in childbirth due to lack of maternal health care worldwide.\n\nNow the Trump administration wants to silence doctors and medical professionals in the United States, too.\n\n\"Patients expect their doctors to speak honestly with them, to answer their questions, to help them in their time of need,\" Dr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a February statement about the rule.\n\n\"Imagine if the Trump administration prevented doctors from talking to our patients with diabetes about insulin. It would never happen,\" Wen added. \"Reproductive health care should be no different. Reproductive health care is health care and health care is a basic human right.\"\n\nStates are leading the charge against this attack on women and health care, but they are not alone. Organizations that advocate for the well-being of women and families, such as the ACLU and Center for Reproductive Rights, recently announced their intentions to sue as well.\n\nTrump is doing all he can to attack women's rights \u2014 but he won't get away with it without a fight.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But when she brought proof to her editors, the bosses at Fox News refused to print the story.\n\nThe reason was simple: Rupert Murdoch, the head of Fox News, wanted Trump to win the election and would not let good reporting hurt Trump's chances.\n\n\"Good reporting, kiddo. But Rupert wants Donald Trump to win,\" Falzone's editor told her, according to the New Yorker. \"So just let it go.\"\n\nIn January 2018, CNN broke the story that Fox News killed the Stormy Daniels story before the election, but the New Yorker lays out the explicit reason for it doing so. One of Falzone's sources told the New Yorker he was confident that if the story had run, it \"would have swayed the election.\"\n\nIf Fox News had exposed the truth, it would have run the same month as the famous \"Access Hollywood\" tape of Trump bragging about his habit of sexually assaulting women.\n\nInstead, Fox News helped cover it up, and Trump's alleged affair with Stormy Daniels was not known to the public until the Wall Street Journal wrote about it \u2014 about a year after Trump was already in the White House.\n\nThe affair has been back in the news after Trump's longtime lawyer and \"fixer,' Michael Cohen, testified before Congress last week. Cohen testified to the fact that he paid $130,000 in hush money to Daniels, at Trump's direction, in order to keep Daniels from speaking about the affair in the final weeks of the campaign. When Cohen pleaded guilty to this action, Trump's Justice Department indicated Trump was involved in the criminal acts.\n\nFox News tried to hide Trump's behavior in the past, but the network can't stop the truth about Trump unethical \u2014 and likely illegal \u2014 behavior from coming out now.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

There is no ordinary policy-development system,\" the adviser explained. As a result, Fox is \"filling the vacuum\" in the White House, where Trump has struggled to fill positions and retain staff thanks to his abysmal management failures.\n\nThe New Yorker reports that critical hiring decisions at the Trump White House are also being influenced by Hannity.\n\nTrump's current communications director and deputy chief of staff, former Fox News executive Bill Shine, was hired shortly after Hannity acted as the \"matchmaker\" between Trump and Shine by arranging a dinner with the two men at the White House.\n\nShine was a key figure in the multi-decade coverup of sexual abuse by Fox News founder and president Roger Ailes. He was also a producer on Hannity's Fox News show for years.\n\nHannity \u2014 who reportedly earned $36 million in 2018 alone for his sycophantic pro-Trump propaganda \u2014 has been criticized even by some of his Fox colleagues for violating basic ethical standards of journalism in his obvious support of Trump, and for appearing to have undue influence on Trump's policy decisions.\n\nFor instance, Trump's wildly unpopular decision to shut down the federal government over a racist border wall was in large part fueled by Hannity and his fellow Fox News cohorts urging Trump to do so. Most Americans railed against the unnecessary move, but Trump catered to Hannity while American families and businesses suffered.\n\nAs Hannity has been whispering in Trump's ear, steering policy and personnel decisions, he also stands to benefit from policies Trump has pushed \u2014 notably the Republican Party's tax scam. The law was written in private to benefit ultra-wealthy people like Hannity.\n\nHannity and Trump are so close that they even shared a lawyer for years. Former Trump fixer Michael Cohen also worked for Hannity, helping him to amass his gigantic portfolio of 870 homes across 7 states worth at least $90 million.\n\nCohen has now revealed how he worked at Trump's direction to violate the law. It is unclear what involvement Hannity had in such affairs, if any \u2014 but he has gotten himself involved recently by publicly claiming that he knows Cohen is lying, which might get him subpoenaed by Congress as a witness.\n\nLike Trump, Hannity has stoked racism and racial animosity using his public platform. He smeared the Black Lives Matter movement, which fights for racial justice and opposes police brutality, as a \"racist group threatening\" to \"kill white people,\" and even compared Black Lives Matter to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAs part of his years of smears against President Barack Obama, Hannity even falsely claimed that a 1985 thesis from First Lady Michelle Obama meant she had a \"race problem.\"\n\nHannity has also repeatedly used his show to defend Trump's racist outbursts. He defended Trump when he said a judge was biased because of his Mexican heritage, and supported Trump's smears of Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of a fallen soldier.\n\nFox News has been the right's premier propaganda outlet for over 23 years. It smears patriotic Americans, furthers racist and misogynistic attacks, and promotes Trump's attacks on democracy.\n\nAnd now it is clearer than ever that, through Sean Hannity, the network also runs Trump's White House.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But the reckless move backfired as Americans aren't buying it.\n\nIn a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released over the weekend, 60 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump declaring a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The poll is the latest setback to Trump's unhealthy obsession with a wall, and his determination to force American taxpayers to pay for it.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged to force Mexico to pay for a wall along the border, using the topic to gin up racist anti-immigrant sentiment among his base of supporters. Two years into an unpopular presidency, Trump pulled a bait-and-switch. Instead of Mexico, Trump tried as hard as he could to force Congress to hand over $5.7 billion in taxpayers funds to build a border wall.\n\nAfter the 2018 midterm election, where immigration was a major issue, Democrats refused to submit to Trump's demands. In a churlish tantrum, Trump forced a 35-day partial government shutdown, holding the paychecks of 800,000 federal workers hostage unless Democrats gave him what he wanted.\n\nIn the end, a defeated Trump caved to Democratic demands, reopening the government with no funding for a wall. But in the process, Trump made up a fake national emergency at the southern border, and is trying to use that declaration to steal money from other federal projects to funnel toward building a wall.\n\nDozens of former officials have made public statements saying Trump is flat-out wrong. There's no emergency at the southern border. Almost two dozen former Republican members of Congress even said the whole national emergency declaration is nothing more than a ploy to circumvent the Constitution, which allows Congress to determine funding priorities.\n\nTrump tried to convince Congress that he needed funds to build a wall, but he failed. When he tried to make his case to the American people, he failed again.\n\nBut since Trump is willing to ignore the Constitution, it is no surprise he will ignore the voices of the majority of the American people, too. After all, Trump only cares about one opinion: his own.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But in a new twist, he's using his Scottish golf course to threaten a change in diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom.\n\nEven before he ran for president, Trump was fighting the Scottish government over a wind farm off the coast of Aberdeen. Trump believed it would spoil the view from his golf course. Trump has a real thing about wind turbines, tweeting that they \"are killing the finances and environment of many countries.\"\n\nTrump lost the lawsuit back in 2015, and Scotland proceeded with the wind farm. Now, after years of wrangling, the courts in Scotland have ruled that Trump has to pay the Scottish government's legal fees in the lawsuit.\n\nOn Saturday, just after the decision was issued, Trump tweeted that he was \"[v]ery proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world.\"\n\nEven by itself, that violates the Emoluments Clause, as Trump is using Twitter to promote his own business. Ethics officials immediately sounded the alarm. Walter Shaub, who was the director of the Office of Government Ethics when Trump took office, tweeted that Trump was engaging in \"shameless, corrupt and repugnant presidential profiteering\" and that Trump's tweet was \"an invitation to graft.\" Want to curry favor with the president? Play his golf course.\n\nSo, the golf course tweet would have been bad enough had it ended there. But Trump went on to say that his golf course \"furthers U.K. relationship!\"\n\nThat's where things get really bad.\n\nEthics watchdog Citizens for Ethics in Washington (CREW) pointed out this was \"making sure everyone knows he ties his business to US relationships with foreign countries.\" Trump's tweet seemed to imply that if he was unhappy with how the Scottish government dealt with him, that might affect diplomatic relations between the United States and the United Kingdom. It's a breathtaking corrupt move, even for Trump. Put in more blunt terms: Trump doesn't want to pay Scotland's legal fees, and if they make him do so, he just might tank relations between the two countries.\n\nMeanwhile, stateside authorities are looking into Trump's Scottish golf courses as well. Brian Frosh, Maryland's Attorney General, just demanded information about the courses to help him prove Trump continues to profit from his businesses.\n\nNot that the businesses themselves are profitable. The Aberdeen course has lost money every year, and Trump has dumped nearly $70 million into the property. He has a better-known course in Turnberry, Scotland. He's thrown $200 million at that, and it still hasn't turned a profit.\n\nNo wonder Trump is using his Twitter account to try to drive business to his golf courses.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Now they have the power to expose the corruption that wrongly gave him that access in the first place.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

David Perdue (R-GA) helped add $2 trillion to the national deficit when he voted for the GOP tax scam that lavished Wall Street banks with billions in kickbacks.\n\nBut even though he happily doled out goodies to corporate benefactors, he's now complaining about the size of the national debt \u2014 and threatening to cut Social Security benefits.\n\nThe national debt is the \"quintessential crisis of our generation,\" Perdue said while attending the far-right Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). \"It's the greatest threat to our national security. And President Trump is moving to deal with that.\"\n\nBut Perdue's supposed convictions about the importance of the national debt are not evident in his voting record. In 2017, he voted to add almost $2 trillion to the national deficit when he supported the GOP tax scam. That bill helped Wall Street banks haul in record profits, and over the course of 10 years it will hand more than 80 percent of its benefits to the richest 1 percent of Americans.\n\nWhen Perdue and Republicans were in complete control of Congress for two years, they helped Trump increase the national deficit to record levels, pushing it above $22 trillion for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump reportedly doesn't care at all about bankrupting future generations. Trump shrugged off worries about increasing the debt, stating he was unconcerned because \"I won't be here\" when the debt becomes untenable.\n\nAnd how does Perdue plan on dealing with the national debt? In the same interview from CPAC, he attacked earned benefits like social security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He called those programs the largest driver of debt and said he wants to start dealing with those programs.\n\nBut Perdue is out of touch with how Americans want to deal with the deficit. According to a 2018 poll, the overwhelming majority of Americans would rather reverse the GOP tax scam (60 percent) to deal with the deficit than reduce Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid (21 percent).\n\nHis vote on the tax scam shows he's just the typical Wall Street-loving, deficit-hiking Republican, despite any claims to the contrary.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He also testified under oath that there was a conduit of information flowing from Wikileaks to Trump that Trump sought to weaponize for the presidential election.\n\nCohen described an illegal payment scheme to hide the affair between Trump and porn star Stormy Daniels, and provided physical evidence of the hush-money transfers. Cohen also explained how Trump had lied about having business in Moscow and that Trump was negotiating to build a Trump Tower there during the campaign.\n\nCohen even discussed how Trump has been engaged in financial crimes, hiding his assets from tax agencies and putting them into a fake charity.\n\nYet none of these revelations gave McCarthy any \"pause.\"\n\nRepublicans ignored these issues for two years under McCarthy's old boss, then-Speaker Paul Ryan. Ryan repeatedly downplayed Trump's scandals and bigotry to pass the Republican Party's legislative agenda.\n\nAt the end of Ryan's sad tenure, the nation was saddled with repeated federal government closures and a GOP tax bill that benefitted the extremely wealthy at the expense of everyone else.\n\nVoters reacted to this state of affairs by kicking Republicans out of power and handing the reins to the Democrats and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. McCarthy leads the minority instead of the majority because Ryan once did what he continues to do.\n\nBut it looks like Republicans are still all-in for Trump's criminality and unethical behavior.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The GOP tax scam was always meant to help the rich and powerful, not middle-class families.\n\nIf your tax refund is smaller than you expected, Republicans have a simple message for you: Stop whining.\n\nGOP lawmakers are sick and tired of families complaining about the smaller tax refunds resulting from the tax scam Republicans rammed through the legislative process at the end of 2017.\n\n\"Isn't it kind of stupid to look at a refund, what your refund is?\" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) asked, effectively calling his constituents stupid.\n\nInitial data from the IRS showed a steep drop in both the number of families who received a refund and a drop in the amount of the average refund. That's not what was promised.\n\nA month before the tax scam was signed into law, then-Speaker Paul Ryan touted higher tax refunds as one of the benefits of the legislation. For a single mother making $30,000, Ryan bragged about \"a $700 increase in her tax refund each year under our tax bill.\"\n\nSo when families across the country learned their refund is smaller, or that they unexpectedly owe thousands of dollars in taxes, they were shocked. When Andy Kraft of Portland, Oregon, found out that he and his wife owe more than $10,000 in taxes this year, he said, \"my jaw hit the floor.\"\n\nBut Republicans don't want to hear from people like Kraft. And it's not just Grassley who has shown contempt for families shocked by their taxes. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), one of the chief architects of the tax scam, has also had enough with families reacting negatively to the bill he championed.\n\n\"The refund picture isn't even accurate,\" Brady said on CNBC. \"The refunds vary from year to year. That's natural.\" Brady and Grassley even wrote an entire op-ed in USA Today trying to convince people of how wrong they are to care about their tax refund.\n\nBut the GOP tax scam is hurting working-class families. In fact, it was never intended to benefit them. Wealthy corporations and Wall Street banks are enjoying multi-billion dollar profits. In fact, companies like Amazon, GE, and Netflix made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits last year, and each of them is still getting tax refunds worth millions. In the end, more than 80 percent of the benefits from the GOP tax scam will go to the wealthiest one percent of Americans.\n\n\"Republicans deliberately made a decision to goose the tax bill so they could get credit in the fall of 2018 and in effect saying it's a long time until the spring of 2019 and maybe everybody would forget,\" Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said recently. \"I'm not forgetting.\"\n\n\"The American people are now seeing plain and simple that the GOP's tax law was written by corporate lobbyists without regard for working families,\" Ryan Thomas, spokesperson for Tax March, told Shareblue Media in a statement. He said the tax scam \"is riddled with so many errors that working and middle-class households now face thousands of dollars in higher tax bills while big corporations and the GOP's wealthy donors reap billions. The Republican Party should be ashamed for the damage they have caused.\"\n\n\"Republicans deliberately made a decision to goose the tax bill so they could get credit in the fall of 2018 and in effect saying it's a long time until the spring of 2019 and maybe everybody would forget,\" Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said recently. \"I'm not forgetting.\"\n\nInstead of lavishing Wall Street companies with billions of dollars, Republicans could have rewritten the tax code to help working families. But they made the decision to prioritize the wealthy, and now families have to deal with the consequences \u2014 all while the GOP calls them stupid.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "They are literally inciting terrorism.\n\nOver the last few months, Republican and conservative leaders have started adopting a bizarre new talking point: that the Democratic Party wants to legalize infanticide.\n\nIf that sounds crazy, it's because it is. No one is advocating for this, and no one outside of a maximum-security penitentiary ever would advocate for this. There's no truth whatsoever to these claims, and anyone who repeats them is either deeply cynical and tribal or deeply gullible and stupid.\n\nYet more and more prominent Republicans and conservative media figures are making these wild accusations more and more frequently.\n\nAnd if they keep doing it, it may only be a matter of time before they get somebody killed.\n\nThe right-wing fever swamps have spent years demonizing doctors with the ugly myth that infants are routinely born alive and then murdered after botched abortions. But the \"infanticide\" meme went mainstream once Fox News started stoking hysteria over some modest abortion-rights bills in New York and Virginia.\n\nBoth measures proposed making it just a little bit easier for doctors to approve a third-trimester abortion, in the very rare event that a woman needs one because her health is at risk or the fetus will not survive. Some Virginia lawmakers accurately described the reality of these heartbreaking situations: that restrictive laws on later abortion can tie doctors' hands in a medical emergency, and that if an infant with no chance of survival is delivered alive, parents have the right to choose palliative care instead of painful, extreme medical interventions for their dying child.\n\nBut, a few out-of-context quotes and deliberate misrepresentations later, conservatives managed to twist these nuanced explanations into the absurd lie that Democrats endorse letting doctors murder infants after delivery.\n\nAt the prominent right-wing conference CPAC on Friday, Vice President Mike Pence accused Democrats of \"standing for late-term abortion and infanticide and a culture of death.\" Another high-profile CPAC speaker, former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, thought the word \"infanticide\" didn't go far enough for what he claims Democrats support: \"It\u2019s not infanticide. It is murder if you take the baby home and kill the baby at home. It\u2019s murder. The same thing is true at the hospital.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly pushed similar talking points \u2014 including in his State of the Union address, at CPAC on Saturday, and in tweets like this one from Monday: \"The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don\u2019t mind executing babies AFTER birth.\" (Before that, Trump's tall tale of choice was that Democrats favor abortions right up through labor \u2014 an idea that doctors say is medical gibberish.)\n\nOn the one hand, these deranged fever-dreams are an excuse for Republicans to stigmatize legal abortion and limit reproductive rights even more than they already have. Trump sent his \"executing babies\" tweet after Senate Democrats blocked a GOP bill that threatened doctors with jail if they didn't try to resuscitate an infant \"born alive\" after an attempted abortion \u2014 a solution to a non-existent problem, since current law already protects the very rare infants who could be born alive after abortion procedures.\n\nBut the harms go even further than that.\n\nBecause every time Republicans with big platforms tell lies like this, they also make it more likely that extremists will take those lies seriously \u2014 and decide that the only way to stop such alleged atrocities is with violence against abortion providers, patients, Democrats, and any bystanders who happen to be in the way.\n\nEvery time Republicans tell these lies, they are quite literally inciting terrorism \u2014 whether they intend to do so or not.\n\nWe've already seen this phenomenon more than once in the Trump era. So far, two people, one white supremacist and one die-hard Trump supporter, have taken it upon themselves to plot or attempt the mass murder of people Trump tells inflammatory lies about \u2014 including, notably, members of the media whom Trump routinely attacks as \"enemies of the people.\"\n\nExperts have started calling this type of violence \"stochastic terrorism.\" It's what happens when public figures use rhetoric that predictably incites violence, without knowing exactly who might heed the call and carry out that violence. As one description put it, it's like committing \"remote-control murder by lone wolf.\"\n\nTragically, this idea is especially relevant when it comes to abortion. When leaders of the anti-choice movement won't stop calling abortion providers \"murderers\" or claiming that abortion is another Holocaust, eventually someone is going to act as if that's really true and decide they need to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThat's what happened when a gunman ranting about \"baby parts\" murdered three people and injured nine at a Colorado Planned Parenthood in 2015. His ramblings came directly from a series of propaganda videos that spread malicious lies about Planned Parenthood \u2014 and after those videos were released, violence and threats against abortion providers spiked nationwide.\n\nNone of these dangerous lies are new. The videos didn't come out of nowhere, and neither did the GOP's latest obsession with fictional post-birth abortions.\n\nAfter all, \"infanticide\" is basically the anti-choice movement's party line on what abortion really is \u2014 that if a woman decides when and whether to let her own body be used as life support for a being that can't survive without it, it's no different than letting her stab a screaming child to death.\n\nThe problem for the anti-choice movement is that most Americans profoundly disagree with them on this. Huge majorities want abortion to stay safe and legal, including many of those who personally identify as \"pro-life.\"\n\nWhile some Americans have personal moral qualms about abortion, they also understand that reproduction is complicated \u2014 that no birth control method is perfect, that not every pregnancy will result in a healthy live birth, that every pregnancy is physically grueling and at least a little bit medically risky, and that women need to have the final say on whether they are willing and able to endure all of that.\n\nAnd because most Americans don't share the extremist view that abortion is inherently infanticide, the anti-choice movement has been trying for years to move the goalposts.\n\nThey can't convince people that abortion is really murder \u2014 so they've started arguing that murder is really abortion.\n\nAnd now this dangerously irresponsible argument \u2014 the kind that could easily get people killed \u2014 is becoming the mainstream party line of the GOP.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

It is a strategy that misfired and badly failed in 2018, resulting in a Democratic House that just passed gun safety legislation long opposed by the NRA.\n\nLike their allies in the Republican Party, the NRA refuses to back away from the ledge and learn from the losses that have come from embracing extremism.\n\nLeaders like Ocasio-Cortez can't be torn down with ridiculous dancing videos and she's going to keep mocking them every time they try.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Mark Meadows (R-NC) angrily denounced criticism of a racist stunt he pulled during the House Oversight Committee testimony of Michael Cohen. But the congressman has a history of racist comments that make his supposed outrage look phony and contrived.\n\nAttempting to defend Trump from Cohen's description of him as racist, Meadows placed HUD official Lynne Patton, who is a black woman, next to him like a prop. Without having Patton speak, Meadows said her role in Trump's campaign disproved the charge.\n\nRep. Ayana Pressley (D-MA) first pointed out how disingenuous Meadows' argument was by asking Cohen about Trump's documented history of racism.\n\n\"Would you agree that someone could deny rental units to African Americans, lead the birther movement, refer to the diaspora as shithole countries and refer to white supremacists as fine people, have a black friend, and still be racist?\" she asked.\n\nCohen replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nLater, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) directly called out Meadows' stunt: \"It is insensitive that some would even \u2014 the fact that someone would actually use a prop, a black woman, in this chamber, in this committee is alone racist in itself.\"\n\nMeadows angrily demanded that Tlaib's comment be struck from the record, arguing that it was a personal attack against him. He noted that he has black nieces and nephews, and cited his relationship with Committee Chair Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who is black, as evidence that he isn't racist.\n\nBut there are multiple instances of Meadows being racist that have been caught on video.\n\nMeadows, like Trump, supported the racist conspiracy theory that falsely alleged that President Barack Obama was not an American citizen.\n\nCampaigning in 2012, Meadows told rally attendees, \"2012 is the time we are going to send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is.\"\n\nMeadows repeated the racist comment at a tea party event in North Carolina. At the same event, he promised attendees that he would pursue an investigation of Obama's birth certificate (like Trump did at the time).\n\nWhat Meadows did at the hearing with Patton was a racist act. It comes from a man with a history of racism who was defending Trump, a noted racist.\n\nReps. Tlaib and Pressley were accurate when they called him out for his actions. Meadows' track record shows that his protestations were the equivalent of crocodile tears and don't change what he did or his sordid history.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

As more and more financially strapped TSA screeners started calling out sick because they couldn't afford to come to work without pay anymore, the agency gave some employees a partial paycheck based on work they performed in late 2018.\n\n\"They were scrambling to keep people on the job because you had a number of sick outs taking place,\" an anonymous official told CNN.\n\nPaying those employees caused an administrative mess, however. \"It appears as though their effort to partially pay people screwed things up and they are still getting their act together,\" the source added.\n\nThe shutdown started in late December when Trump threw a tantrum demanding $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats refused, so Trump and his complicit Republican lackeys in Congress refused to fund the government for more than a month.\n\nThe results were disastrous, as 800,000 federal workers went weeks without pay, with many resorting to visiting food pantries in order to feed their families. Trump put national security at risk, and some airports had to temporarily shut down.\n\nWhen Trump finally relented and ended his pointless shutdown, he promised federal employees that he would make their back pay a priority.\n\nBut more than a month later, yet another of Trump's promises has proven to be empty.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

She was only detained in the first place because the Trump administration changed the rules about locking up pregnant women \u2014 and now, ICE is refusing to count the infant as a death in its custody.\n\nIt's the latest example of how the Trump administration humiliates and harms people who cross our Southern border in search of a better life, especially parents and children.\n\nThe 24-year-old woman, whose name is being withheld, had been arrested in Texas on Feb. 18 when she was six months pregnant. Just a few days later, she went into early labor and delivered a premature child, who was pronounced dead shortly after his birth.\n\nAlthough this woman's child died in the custody of ICE, stillbirths have their own category, along with miscarriages, so that ICE doesn't have to count this tragedy as an in-custody death.\n\nThe fact that a pregnant migrant woman was in custody at all is thanks to a Trump-fueled departure from previous rules. Previously, pregnant detainees were presumptively released. Thanks to a policy change in March of last year, however, pregnant detainees are now presumptively imprisoned, including pregnant women who are seeking asylum.\n\nEven though the Honduran woman was imprisoned by our government, and even though locking up pregnant migrant women in the first place is arguably unjust and can cause serious health risks, ICE is treating the death of this woman's child as something that has nothing to do with the United States or her imprisonment. Rather, it is classified as a mere accident of reproduction.\n\nOver the course of the last year, the Trump administration's commitment to cruelty at the border has been truly breathtaking. And that cruelty has disproportionately fallen on children, two of whom have died in ICE custody just in the last few months.\n\nIn early December of last year, a 7-year-old girl in the custody of the border patrol died of dehydration, a death Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen blamed on the family of the child rather than this administration's senseless imprisonment of children. Just a short time after that, another child, an 8-year-old boy, died of the flu while in Border Patrol custody.\n\nThe only humanitarian crisis at the border is the one Trump and his allies have created. And it's a crisis that harms defenseless children, pregnant women, and their unborn children.\n\n\"Pro-life president,\" indeed.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The average tax refund is down nearly 17 percent. Chuck Grassley and the rest of the GOP wish people would stop talking about it.\n\nRepublicans are scrambling to contain the fallout from the Trump tax cut \u2014 but this latest attempt, by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), is worse than most.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last week, Grassley expressed disbelief that people would care about how big their tax refund is.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of stupid to look at a refund, what your refund is?\u201d he said.\n\nThis isn't surprising coming from Grassley, as he doesn't think much of ordinary taxpayers. Instead, he only loves people rich enough to invest, as opposed to \"those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it\u2019s on booze or women or movies.\"\n\nWhen they passed the Republican tax scam, Grassley and the rest of the GOP made a cynical calculation that they hoped voters wouldn't notice. They lowered paycheck withholding for 2018, which fooled many people into thinking they were getting a big tax cut.\n\nBut they weren't. Instead, they were mostly just paying less in taxes throughout the year \u2014 which meant their 2019 tax refunds would be much smaller than they were expecting, or that they might even owe the government money.\n\nNearly 70 percent of taxpayers get refunds of around $3,000, which they often depend on to pay off debt or cover big expenses. Grassley and Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX) tried to appease people by claiming in an op-ed that lower refunds are proof the GOP is keeping more money in taxpayers' hands all year long.\n\nThe thing is, the tax cut wasn't sold as a small measure whereby you'd see a few extra bucks each week but lose your refund. It was spun as sweeping reform and a massive benefit to all. With each passing day of this tax season, it becomes more and more clear how untrue that was.\n\nThe wheels have been coming off of the GOP tax scam for a while now. Prior to the actual filing season, GOPers like Paul Ryan could still lie to the American public and insist that the tax cuts were great because people saw a whopping extra $1.50 per week in their paycheck.\n\nBut now that tax returns are coming in, it's clear that Trump tax cuts only benefit corporations and the mega-rich.\n\nGiant corporations like Amazon and GM are receiving over $100 million each in refunds, even as they saw profits well over $10 billion, thanks to the Trump tax cuts. United States banks wrapped up 2018 with an extra $28.8 billion in profits because of the tax bill.\n\nMeanwhile, for regular folks, the average refund is down nearly 17 percent, falling from $3,256 to $2,703.\n\nTheoretically, the GOP's withholding scam might have inspired people to turn out for Republicans in the midterms. And by the time the lower refunds kicked in for 2019, it would be too late for electoral consequences.\n\nOf course, the 2018 midterms didn't go as Republicans had hoped \u2014 and they're now learning that people care deeply about their refunds.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The survey counts President Grover Cleveland's non-consecutive administrations as a single presidency, thus sparing Trump from being ranked one spot lower.\n\nThe survey also ranked President Obama 8th overall, making him the the greatest living president, one spot ahead of Ronald Reagan.\n\nBut even among Republican respondents to the survey, Trump could only manage a ranking of 40th out of 44, edging out James Buchanan, Franklin Pierce, William Henry Harrison \u2014 who died in office just one month into his first term \u2014 and Andrew Johnson.\n\nBy contrast, President Obama's first appearance in this survey in 2014 placed him at 18th, and a group of 238 presidential historians ranked Obama 15th after his first year in office.\n\nTrump's first year in office has been marked by historically low approval numbers, an embarrassing trend that was continued by a five-point drop in his weekly approval rating from Gallup.\n\nIf there is any consolation for Trump, it's that he can't possibly drop any lower in this ranking during whatever time he has left in office.\n\nFor the rest of the nation, it's the prospect that that time will be brief."

    "text": "Trump's inaugural committee is under investigation yet again. This time, it's the Washington, D.C., attorney general that would like to know what happened with all that money.\n\nWhile the nation was watching Michael Cohen detail the extent of Trump's crimes, the D.C. attorney general was dropping subpoenas on President Trump's inaugural committee. If that sounds familiar, it's because D.C. is the third governmental body looking into the shady dealings that underpinned Trump's inauguration.\n\nFirst, it was federal prosecutors in Manhattan who decided to take a look at the committee. Better still, one of the reasons they began looking at the inauguration was because of Michael Cohen. When the FBI raided Cohen's office, they found a recording of Cohen discussing the inaugural committee, which is part of what led to the criminal investigation.\n\nNext, New Jersey stepped in, with the state attorney general's office issuing a civil subpoena. New Jersey wants some of the same things the prosecutors in New York want, such as information about times where donors made payments directly to vendors. But this subpoena went further, asking for tax forms, contracts, ledgers, and any documents related to benefits that were provided to donors. Unlike the New York investigation, which is a criminal matter, this is a civil one and could only lead to a civil lawsuit.\n\nD.C is taking a different approach. There, the attorney general is looking into how much the inaugural committee paid to other Trump interests such as the Trump International Hotel or the Trump Organization. Given that news already broke late last year that the inaugural committee paid well above market rate for space at the Trump hotel, it's about time this gets examined.\n\nAnd Ivanka is directly implicated in that overpayment. Inaugural committee planners warned her that her father's hotel was overcharging the committee and that this could be a problem when the committee was audited.\n\nGregg Jenkins, who planned George W. Bush's second inauguration, said that Trump's inauguration was planned by \"a third of the staff\" Jenkins used, raised \"at least twice as much\" as Jenkins did, and held only \"a quarter of the events\" Bush had.\n\nAll that excess cash had to go somewhere, and it's looking a lot like it went to the Trump Organization in some way. With three sets of investigations into the matter, Trump and his family should be very worried.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The investigations into Trump are piling up. Now, the House Judiciary Committee is going to look into Trump's ceaseless attacks on the courts, the press, and more.\n\nThanks to the Republicans controlling both the House and Senate for the last two years, Trump's threatening, bullying behavior has gone largely unchecked.\n\nBut now that the Democrats run the House, the investigations are coming fast and furious. Trump isn't going to like this latest one: a wide-ranging look at his attacks on the DOJ, FBI, the courts, and the media. Though it hasn't been officially announced, it looks like the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), will be helming the investigation.\n\nAn unnamed official spoke to Bloomberg and said that the committee is concerned with whether Trump's continued attacks undermine the rule of law. The rule of law is, essentially, a principle that everyone \u2014 including the President \u2014 is required to follow the law and that laws must be applied in a neutral and fair fashion.\n\nIn some ways, this doesn't seem like a particularly difficult investigation. Trump attacks all of those institutions regularly and very publicly. He routinely tweets that the FBI is corrupt, accuses them of colluding with the Democrats, and approvingly quotes people that think the FBI tried to steer the election to Hillary Clinton.\n\nOf course, his attacks on the courts pre-dated his election. While running for office, he attacked U.S. District Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel from California. He asserted that Curiel wouldn't be fair in ruling on the class action lawsuit against Trump's scammy \"University\" because Curiel is Mexican. Setting aside the breathtaking racism in that statement, his claim ignores the fact that Curiel is actually from Indiana.\n\nSince being elected, Trump has continued berating the courts whenever they issue a decision he doesn't like.\n\nTrump's viciousness toward the press knows no bounds. He regularly tweets about \"fake news\" and calls the press the enemy of the people. He saves his real bile, though, for his rallies. In June 2018, four reporters and a sales assistant for a paper in Maryland were gunned down, but Trump didn't even make it 24 hours before advertising a rally as a chance to connect with Trump without \"the filter of the fake news media.\"\n\nIn October 2018, after CNN was targeted by attempted bombings, Trump went in front of a Wisconsin audience and slammed the media for the tone of their stories.\n\nTrump said nothing when one of his supporters physically assaulted a BBC cameraman nor when rally attendees scream at CNN's Jim Acosta.\n\nThere's no set witness list yet for the House Judiciary investigation, but no matter what, this isn't going to be a comfortable process for Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He's even shameless enough to call on U.S. senators.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas has been working the phones to get his former clerk Neomi Rao a slot on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. It's a startling move, even from a justice that doesn't believe rules apply to him.\n\nBy any measure, Neomi Rao is utterly awful. She believes it is a woman's fault if she gets raped, she loves gutting regulations, and she thinks sexual and racial oppression is a myth. And, because of these things, her nomination is utterly in keeping with the goals of this administration.\n\nBut she apparently didn't initially appear sufficiently anti-choice for at least one senator, Josh Hawley (R-MO). It was a curious stance for Hawley, given that Rao's record of undermining reproductive freedom is pretty solid. In her current job as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, she worked on rules like barring health care providers that perform abortions from receiving federal funds. But Hawley was wobbly, so Thomas and friends swung into action.\n\nFirst, a former clerk of Thomas, Carrie Severino, went after Hawley. Her group, Judicial Crisis Network, threated a $500,000 ad buy against him in Missouri if he didn't vote for Rao. Next, Thomas took a call from Hawley, presumably to soothe Hawley's ruffled anti-abortion feathers. Thomas also called Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) to share his \"positive experience\" with Rao.\n\nThomas' efforts with Hawley paid off, as Rao's nomination made it out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Now it's on to the full Senate, where she will, depressingly, likely be confirmed.\n\nIt's not a secret that Thomas has no real regard for judicial norms or ethics. He routinely refuses to recuse himself from cases even when it is clear he has conflicts. His wife, conservative gadfly Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, traded on her name to get an audience with Trump, and she used that time to talk about a matter \u2014 the transgender troop ban \u2014 that was pending before the Supreme Court.\n\nWith all that, it shouldn't be so surprising that Thomas so nakedly uses his power to lean on senators to lock down votes for his former clerk, but somehow it still is.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Democrats are shining a light on Trump's nefarious anti-science scheme.\n\nOn Thursday, chairs of four different House committees demanded information about Trump's newest scheme to attack the validity of climate science. The Democrats in charge in Congress are refusing to allow Trump to set up the shady climate change-denying advisory group without any oversight.\n\nA letter sent by Armed Services Chair Adam Smith, Energy and Commerce Chair Frank Pallone Jr., Natural Resources Chair Raul M. Grijalva (D-AZ), and Science, Space, and Technology Chair Eddie Bernice Johnson outlines concerns about \"a secret panel, led by a discredited climate change denier,\" meant to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change and the threat it poses to America and the world.\n\nThat \"discredited climate change denier\" is William Happer, who has reportedly been tapped to lead the advisory panel. Happer is a Trump administration official currently serving as a senior director at the National Security Council, who has compared climate scientists to Nazis, mass murderers, and members of the terrorist group ISIS.\n\nThe four congressional leaders are demanding both to know the names of those who will be on the panel and to be updated on a monthly basis of any work the panel does. Further, the chairs want the panel to be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which would allow the public to know more about the work of the panel.\n\nThe letter also lays out concerns about Trump's previous statement on climate change, which \"fly in the face of explicit scientific evidence and the findings of your own DoD [Department of Defense] and Director of National Intelligence.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly ignored, if not outright attacked, evidence of climate change and warnings from scientists \u2014 even those within his own administration. When scientists from 13 federal agencies released the National Climate Assessment \u2014 a comprehensive, 1,600-page report on the devastation that climate change \u2014 Trump blithely dismissed it.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" Trump said. \"No, no, I don't believe it.\"\n\nTrump has no trouble believing racist conspiracy theories about President Obama's birthplace, will fan the flames of voter fraud conspiracies, and repeats ludicrous conspiracy theories about immigrants entering the United States, but he draws the line at believing scientific evidence on climate change.\n\nThe chairs understandably have \"serious concerns\" about any effort by Trump to \"construct a secret committee to question the basic scientific fact of climate change.\"\n\nIn 2018, voters flooded polling locations to elect a Congress that would hold Trump accountable. Democrats prove once again that they are living up to their promise.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The House Oversight and Reform Committee wants to hear from Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. after Michael Cohen implicated them in his testimony.\n\nMichael Cohen's explosive testimony to Congress on Wednesday provided a road map of wrongdoing and criminality carried out not just by Trump, but also Trump's family and longtime Trump Organization employees.\n\nNow Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee want to follow those leads \u2014 with plans to call in high-profile figures such as Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump to testify, Chairman Elijah Cummings told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is follow the transcript,\" Cummings (D-MD) said, according to Politico. \"If there are names that were mentioned or records that were mentioned during the hearing, we want to take a look at all of that.\"\n\nDuring his testimony, Cohen alleged that Trump Jr., the eldest of the Trump children, was involved in illegal hush money payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels. Cohen is already going to prison for that and other crimes, and has already said the elder Trump directed him to carry out the illegal scheme. Cohen suggested during his testimony that federal prosecutors in New York are still probing the Daniels payoff.\n\nCohen further alleged that both Trump Jr. and Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump were both briefed on negotiations for a Trump Tower project in Moscow \u2014 in the midst of the 2016 election that Russia maliciously meddled in.\n\nCohen later lied to Congress about the timing of this project, and said Trump strongly suggested to him that he should lie.\n\nIf it turns out that Ivanka was involved in her dad's shady deal, it wouldn't be the first time. ProPublica has uncovered evidence that she may have violated the law by helping her family profit from Trump's inauguration, and by helping her father mislead buyers by inflating the value of their real estate projects.\n\nCohen's testimony has already helped one prominent Trump ally get dragged before Congress. The Daily Beast reported Thursday afternoon that Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, will be called to testify before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nCohen repeatedly name-dropped Weisselberg during the House Oversight hearing as having been involved in the Daniels payments, as well as tax and insurance fraud that the Trump Organization engaged in.\n\n\"They have a good chance of hearing from us \u2014 at least an interview,\" Cummings said of the two Trump children and Weisselberg. \"We\u2019ll go through it, we\u2019ll figure out who we want to talk to, and we\u2019ll bring them in.\"\n\nFor now, Cummings said it's not clear which committees would call which Trump-world figures to testify. Cohen mentioned multiple potential crimes that could fall under different House committee purviews.\n\nBut it's a bad sign for Trump's children and longtime employees that there is so much potential criminal material to sort through.\n\nThe new Democratic-controlled House is clearly just getting started with exposing Trump, his family, and his company. Get the popcorn ready.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Now that he's back stateside, Trump is responding to Michael Cohen's bombshell testimony with a series of especially unhinged tweets.\n\nHe's baaaack.\n\nAfter returning to the U.S. from Vietnam, where he held an embarrassing failure of a summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, Trump spent his Friday morning responding to Michael Cohen's explosive testimony in a series of deranged tweets that were riddled with lies and bizarre accusations.\n\n\"Wow, just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a 'love letter to Trump' manuscript for a new book that he was pushing,\" Trump tweeted. \"Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki, his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie!\"\n\nMatthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, pointed out that Trump's tweet seems to have come from a Thursday night episode of racist Fox News host Tucker Carlson's show.\n\nThe book Carlson \"just revealed\" was first reported a full year ago in February 2018. And it's not a \"love letter\" as much as it's a tell-all on the saga with porn actress Stormy Daniels, which has now put Trump, his son, and others in the Trump Organization in legal jeopardy.\n\nThe book was reported in February 2018 https://t.co/HSyUHPGoeu \"Just revealed\" = \"was on Tucker Carlson's show last night.\" Left, Fox, 8:01 pm Carlson: \"Cohen wrote the book proposal long after Charlottesville and Helsinki.\" Right, Trump, 8:00 am pic.twitter.com/aJOD3uAT1q \u2014 Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) March 1, 2019\n\nTrump then continued to tweet about Cohen's alleged book.\n\n\"Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen\u2019s new book, given to publishers a short time ago,\" he wrote. \"Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited!\"\n\nOf course, Cohen admitted himself that he had lied in the past about the Daniels payoff. But he also has proof in the form of checks and audio recordings that Trump knew about the hush money payment to the porn star.\n\nTrump's unhinged rantings and ravings didn't stop there.\n\nHe whined about his own legal troubles with a series of typo-riddled and misspelled tweets that are truly a sight to behold:\n\n\"Oh\u2019 I see! Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart, there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, they say, 'gee, I have an idea, let\u2019s look at Trump\u2019s finances and every deal he has ever done. Let\u2019s follow discredited Michael Cohen.....and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday. No way, it\u2019s time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt. Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now!\"\n\nTrump's claim that Democrats were the ones who colluded with Russia is not only obviously false, it's completely irrational. No, Democrats did not collude with a foreign power to ensure they'd lose the 2016 election.\n\nBut since Trump has no better argument to make, he continues to spew that ridiculous lie.\n\nTrump then sent one more tweet complaining about Cohen's book, whose contents he somehow suddenly knows all about, and claiming that Hillary Clinton was behind Cohen's entire testimony \u2014 yet another delusion that suggests Clinton continues to live rent-free in his head.\n\n\"Michael Cohen\u2019s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before,\" Trump wrote. \"He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton\u2019s lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?\"\n\nTrump has nothing on his schedule as he recovers from his utter humiliation in Vietnam.\n\nThat means more \"executive time\" \u2014 which is likely to mean even more deranged tweets.\n\nBrace yourselves.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Pentagon is seeking billions of dollars to fulfill Trump's 'space force' fantasy.\n\nTrump is forcing the Pentagon to beg Congress for $2 billion to waste on his unwanted idea of creating a \"space force.\" In a statement released on Friday, the Pentagon announced its request for $72 million next year for approximately 200 space force personnel and funding to find office space.\n\nThe $72 million is just the beginning, though. The Pentagon wants a total of $2 billion over the next five years to build up the sixth branch of the military, to \"build a space warfighting culture.\"\n\nAt the same time Trump is demanding $2 billion for a project various Pentagon officials have said is an unnecessary waste of time and money, he is threatening to raid funds meant to build schools for the children of military families because of his fake national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe whole idea of a space force already received resistance from Democratic lawmakers. In September 2018, Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), who now chairs the House Armed Services Committee, opposed the creation of a space force because it would \"create additional costly military bureaucracy.\"\n\nResistance is not coming only from Democrats. Last year, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters that \"the Pentagon is complicated enough\" without the increased bureaucracy of a space force. She added that a new branch \"will make it more complex, add more boxes to the organization chart and cost more money.\"\n\nEven though Trump forced the Pentagon to make the multi-billion dollar request, he is not getting what he originally wanted. The original vision for space force was a \"separate but equal\" military branch, on par with the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n\n\"We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the 'Space Force' \u2014 separate but equal, it is going to be something so important,\" Trump said last summer.\n\nBut support for Trump's grand vision failed to materialize, so a defeated Trump signed a presidential directive creating a space force, which will fall under the Air Force, not unlike the way the Marine Corps falls under the Navy. If Congress approves the idea, the United States will soon have a new space force chief of staff who would be a part of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in addition to an \"Under Secretary of Space.\"\n\nIf Congress approves this idea, the Pentagon estimates taxpayers will be on the hook for $500 million every year to pay for it. The idea of the space force may be an applause line at Trump rallies, but the reality looks more like a multi-billion dollar unwanted boondoggle.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The investigations into Trump are piling up. Now, the House Judiciary Committee is going to look into Trump's ceaseless attacks on the courts, the press, and more.\n\nThanks to the Republicans controlling both the House and Senate for the last two years, Trump's threatening, bullying behavior has gone largely unchecked.\n\nBut now that the Democrats run the House, the investigations are coming fast and furious. Trump isn't going to like this latest one: a wide-ranging look at his attacks on the DOJ, FBI, the courts, and the media. Though it hasn't been officially announced, it looks like the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), will be helming the investigation.\n\nAn unnamed official spoke to Bloomberg and said that the committee is concerned with whether Trump's continued attacks undermine the rule of law. The rule of law is, essentially, a principle that everyone \u2014 including the President \u2014 is required to follow the law and that laws must be applied in a neutral and fair fashion.\n\nIn some ways, this doesn't seem like a particularly difficult investigation. Trump attacks all of those institutions regularly and very publicly. He routinely tweets that the FBI is corrupt, accuses them of colluding with the Democrats, and approvingly quotes people that think the FBI tried to steer the election to Hillary Clinton.\n\nOf course, his attacks on the courts pre-dated his election. While running for office, he attacked U.S. District Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel from California. He asserted that Curiel wouldn't be fair in ruling on the class action lawsuit against Trump's scammy \"University\" because Curiel is Mexican. Setting aside the breathtaking racism in that statement, his claim ignores the fact that Curiel is actually from Indiana.\n\nSince being elected, Trump has continued berating the courts whenever they issue a decision he doesn't like.\n\nTrump's viciousness toward the press knows no bounds. He regularly tweets about \"fake news\" and calls the press the enemy of the people. He saves his real bile, though, for his rallies. In June 2018, four reporters and a sales assistant for a paper in Maryland were gunned down, but Trump didn't even make it 24 hours before advertising a rally as a chance to connect with Trump without \"the filter of the fake news media.\"\n\nIn October 2018, after CNN was targeted by attempted bombings, Trump went in front of a Wisconsin audience and slammed the media for the tone of their stories.\n\nTrump said nothing when one of his supporters physically assaulted a BBC cameraman nor when rally attendees scream at CNN's Jim Acosta.\n\nThere's no set witness list yet for the House Judiciary investigation, but no matter what, this isn't going to be a comfortable process for Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But Trump overruled them to demand his son-in-law be granted top-secret clearance \u2014 and then lied about his role.\n\nAfter what has already been a very bad week for Trump and his family, the New York Times on Thursday reported that Trump personally demanded his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, receive top-secret security clearance \u2014 even though the CIA and FBI worried about Kushner's foreign business contacts.\n\nAccording to the New York Times' report:\n\nWhile the president has the legal authority to grant a clearance, in most cases, the White House\u2019s personnel security office makes a determination about whether to grant the clearance after the F.B.I. has conducted a background check. If there is a dispute in the personnel security office about how to move forward \u2014 a rare occurrence \u2014 the White House counsel makes the decision. In highly unusual cases, the president weighs in and grants one himself. In Mr. Kushner\u2019s case, personnel division officials were divided about whether to grant Mr. Kushner a top-secret clearance.\n\nTo make matters worse, Trump then lied about his role in helping Kushner obtain that clearance, which grants Kushner access to the country's most sensitive intelligence.\n\n\"I was never involved with the security\" clearances, Trump said in an interview with the New York Times back in January. \"I know that there was issues back and forth about security for numerous people, actually. But I don\u2019t want to get involved in that stuff.\"\n\nTrump wasn't the only one who lied about how Kushner obtained his clearance. Ivanka Trump, Trump's daughter and Kushner's wife, also lied to ABC News' Abby Huntsman, telling her in an interview earlier this year that her father \"had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband's clearance, zero.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Ivanka Trump says she and her husband Jared Kushner received no special treatment from her father when obtaining their top security clearances. \"The president had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband's clearance, zero.\u201d https://t.co/88dUizY8Ht pic.twitter.com/MsanC4qzQC \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 8, 2019\n\nDemocrats have long raised concerns about Kushner's security clearance, calling in 2017 for the clearance to be revoked given Kushner's meetings with Russian officials \u2014 which Kushner conveniently left off his security clearance application forms.\n\nKushner's clearance was ultimately downgraded a year ago \u2014 after which Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, admitted that it had been a bad idea to give Kushner that high-level security clearance in the first place.\n\nDemocrats in Congress now plan to investigate how Kushner obtained his top-secret clearance. After winning the House majority in the 2018 midterms, Democrats have control over powerful House committees and their investigative arms.\n\nThe news about Kushner's clearance comes after Trump's former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen implicated Trump and two of his children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., in other crimes, which House Democrats are now probing.\n\nIt's a really, really bad week to be a Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

John Kirby, who said the betrayal of an American family \"took my breath away.\"\n\nKirby served for nearly 30 years in the U.S. Navy, going on to serve as a spokesperson for the State Department and as a Pentagon press secretary.\n\nIn Hanoi discussing his failed summit with the North Korean leader, Trump was asked about Otto Warmbier, the college student who was imprisoned and beaten leading to his eventual death.\n\n\"I really believe something very bad happened to him, and I don't think that the top leadership knew about it,\" Trump said, parroting North Korean propaganda. Trump said Kim \"felt very badly about it\", adding, \"he tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word.\"\n\nCNN anchor Jim Sciutto noted how Trump's compliment, which runs contrary to findings from U.S. intelligence services, echoed his previous instances of siding with autocrats like Russia's Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman. He then asked Adm. Kirby to react to Trump's chilling comment.\n\n\"It kind of took my breath away to listen to that,\" Kirby replied, \"I can't but imagine what it must have been like for Mr. Warmbier's parents and the family to hear him say that.\"\n\n\"It's inexplicable. I don't know why he would just take Kim Jong Un's word.\"\n\nKirby also pointed out that when Warmbier was the subject of a show trial by the North Korean regime that footage of the event was shown around the world.\n\n\"You've got to assume that Kim Jong Un knew what was going on, and they don't make many decisions in North Korea without Kim Jong Un's awareness and just tacit approval,\" Kirby added.\n\nTrump showed a \"strange credulity\" in propping up the dictator, Kirby said, concluding, \"it was a real low moment for the press conference today.\"\n\nTrump is a demagogue with a track record of admiration for the worst impulses of the world's most oppressive leaders. His comments about Warmbier's murder fall right in line with his bizarre world view and Kirby's condemnation encapsulated Trump's abnormal behavior within the presidency.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Many national emergency declarations have resulted in sanctions on countries that are committing mass atrocities against their people, or that have tried to threaten or attack the United States.\n\nHowever, Trump's emergency declaration is different: He's using it to ignore Congress' constitutionally granted power of the purse, and instead raid already-appropriated federal dollars to spend on what he wants \u2014 a racist border wall that will neither help Americans nor address any kind of real emergency.\n\nMcConnell was initially opposed to Trump's emergency declaration idea. However, McConnell caved and announced he was backing the emergency declaration, in an attempt to appease Trump while also keeping him from recklessly shutting down the government again.\n\nMcConnell even tried to raise money off the declaration \u2014 sending a fundraising email referencing his support for Trump's national emergency just one day after expressing doubt on its legality.\n\nMcConnell fundraising off national emergency: \"The President is keeping his promise and I\u2019m standing shoulder to shoulder with him to get the job done ...

    "text": "Before the vote, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) gave a powerful, heart-wrenching speech in support of gun safety and closing the 'Charleston loophole.'\n\nFor the second time this week, the House of Representatives overcame Republican opposition to pass gun safety legislation. After passing a bill mandating universal background checks for gun sales on Wednesday, the House voted 228-198 on Thursday to pass the Enhanced Background Checks Act, which would close the so-called \"Charleston loophole.\"\n\nThe loophole was named after the 2015 mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, which left nine people dead. The gunman had a criminal record which should have prevented him from purchasing the weapon \u2014 but he was able to so because his background check took longer than three days to complete.\n\nUnder current law, gun dealers can move ahead with a gun sale after three days even if the background check isn't complete. While most background checks for guns take less than three days, it can sometimes take longer. The bill passed by the House would expand the mandatory window for concluding background checks to 10 days.\n\nMoments before the vote, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) gave a deeply personal speech about the importance of this kind of gun safety legislation.\n\nDingell spoke about her childhood with a father who was mentally ill and owned a gun, and the terror it caused her family.\n\n\"I had to hide in that closet with my siblings wondering if we would live or die,\" she said. \"One night, I kept my father from killing my mother. He shouldn't have had a gun!\"\n\nShe said the additional time required by the legislation \"will help us stop more massacres, such as the one in Charleston. And it may prevent another child or family going through what I did as a child.\"\n\nDingell ended her speech asking her colleagues to reject a Republican amendment to weaken the bill, and urged the full House to vote for the legislation.\n\nThe bill passed largely along party lines, with 225 Democrats supporting it, joined by only three Republicans. The remaining 191 Republicans who voted opposed the bill.\n\nGun safety groups cheered the bill's passage.\n\nJohn Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, praised the bill as \"common-sense legislation\" which will \"keep thousands of guns away from people who shouldn't have them.\"\n\nThe bill is one way \"we can honor the victims and survivors of the Charleston church shooting with action,\" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, said in a statement. \"We know that the Charleston loophole is deadly.

    "text": "Trump insisted he could grow the economy more than Obama did. Nope.\n\nTrump campaigned on the promise of absurdly high economic growth, specifically that the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would reach 5 or 6 percent. Trump and Republicans also insisted that at the very least, they would beat President Obama's record with a 3 percent annual growth in GDP.\n\nBut for the second year in a row, annual GDP growth still hasn't reached 3 percent.\n\nOn Thursday, new economic data from the Commerce Department showed 2018 growth at a mere 2.9 percent, less than half of what Trump promised. The number is preliminary and could be revised, but economists told CNBC that if a revision happens, it would likely make the number even smaller.\n\nAnd moving forward, even slower growth is predicted. \"2018 will be the high-water mark for growth in the Trump administration,\" Mark Zandi, an economist with Moody's Analytics, told CNBC. He also predicted that the economy will shrink to a dismal 1.1 percent growth in 2020.\n\nThe GOP tax scam, signed into law in late 2017, was supposed to be \"rocket fuel\" for the economy. But while Wall Street banks and wealthy corporations celebrated the lavish tax giveaways they got from the GOP bill, families across the country were left out in the cold.\n\nWages for most Americans have either remained stagnant or barely increased. Meanwhile, Trump's trade wars are wreaking havoc on farmers and devastating the economies of entire states.\n\nThere is other alarming economic data showing how millions of families are continuing to struggle in the Trump era. Experts are especially alarmed that a record number of Americans are falling behind on their car payments, which is a major red flag for economic problems because most Americans prioritize car payments ahead of credit cards and even mortgages.\n\nAs the April 15 tax deadline approaches, many families are furious at either smaller-than-expected refunds or shockingly high tax bills. Companies like Amazon, GE, and Netflix made hundreds of millions in profits and will see multi-million dollar tax refunds. But millions of Americans are seeing once again that Trump's economy is tilted in favor of the rich and powerful, not middle-class families.\n\nTrump is a man obsessed with size. He melted down over the crowd size at his inauguration, which was paltry compared to Obama's. On the very afternoon of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, he callously bragged that he now had the tallest building in New York City. Once, he even patted himself on the back for having a \"very, very large brain.\"\n\nBut his boasts about size often fail to meet expectations. The lackluster economic growth is just another in a long line of disappointments brought to America by Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Trump administration's cozy relationship with the oil industry continues, and oil companies are getting safety exemptions left and right.\n\nTrump's Department of the Interior has been quietly handing out hundreds of waivers to offshore oil drillers, and its an environmental disaster waiting to happen.\n\nBack in 2010, America saw the largest ocean oil spill in history when the Deepwater Horizon, a rig owned by BP, had a blowout preventer failure. Essentially, a piece of equipment that was supposed to shut off a high-pressure flow of oil and gas didn't do so. It was a spill so bad that BP agreed to pay $4.5 billion in fines and plead guilty to 14 criminal charges.\n\nUnder Obama, the Department of the Interior created stronger rules for blowout preventers to try to prevent another Deepwater Horizon, which had resulted in 11 deaths and over 3 million barrels of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nUnder Trump, though, there seems to be no appetite for any sort of regulation, even one to stop large-scale ecological disasters. Instead, Interior has granted nearly 1700 exemptions to the Obama safety rules, and the bulk of those exemptions allow oil companies to ignore the stronger blowout preventer rules. Worse, the administration has the safety rules on the chopping block anyway, so soon companies won't even need the waivers.\n\nThis administration is entirely devoted to the kind of industry doublespeak spewed by Erik Milito, an American Petroleum Institute vice president:\n\nIt is important that it [the Obama-era rule] is revised based upon new insights and developments in the offshore exploration and development field to enhance the regulatory framework to ensure updated, modern, and safe technologies, best practices, and operations.\n\nAmazing how regulatory frameworks are only \"enhanced\" when they are dismantled.\n\nIt isn't as if the Deepwater Horizon spill occurred 75 years ago and the industry could easily point to massive advancements in oil containment and safety technology in the ensuing decades. The spill itself was less than a decade ago, and the Obama-era regulations were only in effect for about the last six months of the previous administration.\n\nPut another way, pretty much the very minute the regulations went into effect, the industry began complaining they were outdated. In the swampy Trump administration, they immediately found a willing audience for that argument.\n\nThese moves by the Department of Interior are entirely in keeping with the administration's other anti-science, anti-environment steps. Under Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has drastically decreased inspections of polluters and is using junk science to justify lowering emissions standards. And the administration's commitment to disbelieving climate change is legendary, going so far as to try to set up a climate change panel that has no climate change experts as members.\n\nThis administration is devoted to letting the oil industry call the shots, and the industry hates regulation. Because of that, it's only a matter of time before we see another Deepwater Horizon \u2014 or worse.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "More Republican lies about voter fraud were exposed, this time deep in the heart of Texas.\n\nOn Wednesday, a federal judge lambasted Republican officials in Texas for abusing their power to push a patently false narrative of widespread voter fraud across the state. The court went a step further, blocking state officials from removing anyone from the voter rolls without express permission from the court because of the reprehensible conduct of GOP officials.\n\nIn the four-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery called out the Republican officials for \"ham-handed and threatening correspondence\" questioning the citizenship of tens of thousands of people. The court found Texas officials abused the \"power of government to strike fear and anxiety and to intimidate the least powerful among us.\"\n\nThe lawsuit began after Texas Secretary of State David Whitley, appointed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, outrageously claimed that 95,000 people in Texas were registered to vote despite not being citizens, and that 58,000 of those Texans had fraudulently voted in at least one election. Ken Paxton, the state's Republican attorney general, even declared a \"VOTER FRAUD ALERT\" on Twitter. Abbott, well known for fear-mongering about supposed voter fraud, praised his appointee for \"uncovering and investigating this illegal vote registration.\"\n\nTrump, unsurprisingly, has been touting the supposed \"voter fraud\" and even further exaggerating the numbers.\n\nBut the court found that based on all available evidence, \"there is no widespread voter fraud\" happening in the state. The judge chastised Republican officials, reminding them that soon after officials released the list of names, \"the government had an 'oops' moment, realizing that 25,000 names should not have been included.\"\n\n\"It appears this is a solution looking for a problem,\" the ruling notes.\n\nRepublicans have a long history of pretending voter fraud is a widespread problem. State legislators often use the guise of made-up voter fraud claims to pass legislation aimed at voter suppression. Republican efforts normally target young people and people of color, setting up unfair and unconstitutional barriers preventing certain segments of the population from exercising the most fundamental right in a democracy: voting.\n\nIn North Carolina, one federal court found Republicans passed a law to \"target African Americans with almost surgical precision.\"\n\nWhile in-person voter fraud almost never happens, election fraud can and does. Just last week, an elections board in North Carolina unanimously voted to hold a new election in the 9th Congressional District, because the evidence that Republican Mark Harris' campaign illegally collected and even filled in ballots was so overwhelming that Harris could not be certified the winner.\n\nIn Texas, the federal court determined that the secretary of state \"created this mess\" and ordered the state to stop purging its voter rolls of Texans who are, in fact, citizens.\n\nThe judge concluded by quoting from Robert Fulghum's \"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten,\" essentially ordering Republican officials to \"always put things back where we found them and clean up our own messes.\"\n\nWhile the officials who \"created this mess\" will now have to clean it up, the court's finding is unlikely to stop Republicans from continuing to spread lies about the supposed \"voter fraud\" that simply does not exist while ignoring the very real example of Republican election fraud in North Carolina.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump tried to argue that Cohen 'said no collusion with the Russian hoax.' That's not what happened.\n\nThe last 24 hours have, gently speaking, not been good for Trump.\n\nFresh on the heels of his former right-hand man Michael Cohen giving Congress shocking details (and hard evidence) of Trump's many crimes, Trump gave an embarrassing press conference in Vietnam during which he was forced to admit defeat in his negotiations with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un over denuclearization.\n\nBut Trump can never really let himself admit defeat, no matter how obvious it is that he has failed. He always tries to find a way to spin it into a glorious victory.\n\nWhich is why, during the Thursday press conference in Hanoi, Trump shifted gears to absurdly claim that Cohen's damning testimony was actually good for him \u2014 and that it even exonerated Trump on the question of whether he colluded with Russia to interfere with the 2016 election.\n\nTrump told reporters that while Cohen \"lied a lot,\" he did have one truthful moment: \"He said no collusion with the Russian hoax. ... I was actually impressed that he didn\u2019t say, well I think there was collusion.\"\n\nThis moment, Trump said, meant that Cohen lied only \"about 95 percent instead of 100 percent\" of the time during his testimony before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nFirst of all, that's not what Cohen said about Trump and Russian collusion.\n\n\"Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia,\" Cohen said in his opening statement. \"I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions.\"\n\nSaying that he personally knows of no \"direct evidence\" isn't the same thing as saying there was \"no collusion with the Russian hoax.\"\n\nAnd after that line, Cohen went on to describe a moment he witnessed between Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., that made him suspect Trump was aware of the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nEven more to the point, the rest of Cohen's testimony \u2014 which Trump dismissed as \"lies\" with no evidence \u2014 was devastating for Trump.\n\nCohen gave Congress testimony, and documentation, about multiple potential felonies Trump committed \u2014 at least four, according to one Fox News legal analyst.\n\nCohen produced a check from Trump as evidence that Trump directed him to illegally pay off Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her affair with Trump before the 2016 election, documentation that Trump had lied about his wealth when applying for a loan, and more.\n\nAnd a few minutes of incisive questioning of Cohen from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) may have laid the groundwork for Congress to finally see what's in Trump's tax returns.\n\nTrump can try to spin victory from defeat all he wants, but he'll still have to contend with reality in the end.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Donald Trump went to Vietnam to try to strike a deal with Kim Jong Un over denuclearization. In the end, like so many Trump deals, he walked away with nothing.\n\nTrump, the self-styled \"master of the deal,\" had yet another negotiation go down in flames when his talks with North Korea's Kim Jong Un collapsed in the middle of their much-celebrated summit. Like many Trump deals, he walked away with nothing.\n\nOf course, Trump is trying to spin this as if he engaged in a time-honored negotiation tradition of knowing when to walk away but it's clear that, despite his weird and constant flattery of Kim, a murderous despot, he just couldn't get a deal done.\n\nTrump gave a press conference where he looked \"visibly deflated,\" spoke in a monotone, and repeatedly referred questions to his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. And it's no wonder because there was no way for him to brag about what happened.\n\nPerhaps once he is back stateside, he will have White House press secretary Sarah Sanders come back out and declare, as she did before the summit, that Trump was a diplomatic genius just for scheduling a meeting with Kim. Sanders had declared, before the summit, that Trump had already \"had a great success here in the fact that they were able to sit down at the table.\"\n\nKim had said he was \"prepared in principle to denuclearize\" and would sign an agreement to that effect. The problem is that agreeing in principle to do something isn't really a deal \u2014 it's just an agreement to think about something. Indeed, that's all that happened in the summit in June 2018, where the result was a \"vague communiqu\u00e9\" that promised nothing.\n\nSo, when it came time to strike an actual deal in Vietnam, things fell apart. Kim, unsurprisingly, only wanted to close one nuclear facility but wanted all economic sanctions lifted. Mercifully, Trump didn't agree to that.\n\nEven with the deal utterly obliterated, even though he had to leave Vietnam with his tail between his legs, Trump still managed to take time to yet again fawn over Kim and their relationship: \"There\u2019s a warmth that we have, and I hope that stays. I think it will. But we\u2019re positioned to do something very special.\"\n\nAt root, Trump is just bad at getting things done. He couldn't get health care done and he couldn't get his wall built, even when he had an all-Republican Congress at his disposal. There was no way he was going to out-maneuver Kim, no matter how many times he talked about their \"special bond.\"\n\nThe fact that this deal went sideways on the same day that Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, went to Congress and detailed Trump's crimes, probably hurt most of all. Things just aren't looking good for the master of the deal.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Richard Blumenthal, a man who served in the Marine Corps Reserves.\n\nTrump dodged the Vietnam War draft with a fake claim of bone spurs, telling longtime attorney and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen that there was never any surgery related to his claimed ailment. Cohen made these claims in his prepared remarks, released before his Wednesday testimony before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nTrump handled the accusations with his typical misdirection and lashing out, this time focusing his misguided rage at Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).\n\nIn an unhinged tweet, Trump spouted, \"I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud \u2014 he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!\"\n\nBut Trump's attempt at redirecting the conversation does not change the fact that he received five deferments to keep him from entering the draft, including one for a claim of bone spurs. But Cohen says Trump never provided any proof. During the 2016 campaign, \"Mr. Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft,\" Cohen says in his prepared remarks.\n\n\"Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment.\"\n\nBut Trump wasn't done. \"He finished the conversation with the following comment. 'You think I'm stupid, I wasn't going to Vietnam,'\" Cohen says.\n\nTrump has a long history of attacking veterans, including those who served in Vietnam. During the campaign, Trump disparaged Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who was captured and spent years being tortured in a Vietnamese prison. \"He's not a war hero. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured,\" Trump said in July 2015.\n\nMcCain passed away last year, but that has not stopped Trump from attacking veterans. With his attack on Blumenthal, Trump is referring to a decades-old issue for which Blumenthal has repeatedly apologized. When running for Senate in 2010, Blumenthal misstated his service during the Vietnam War, where he served stateside in the Marine Corps Reserve, but never went to Vietnam.\n\nTrump is finally in Vietnam, and is using his high-profile visit to mock a veteran. But Trump's angry tweets only remind everyone of his draft-dodging past and his lifetime of disrespecting those who served.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump Foundation.\n\nThe state attorney general's office alleges that Trump and his three children operated the foundation \"in persistent violation\" of federal and state laws, including calling the organization a charity while using it as a \u201cpersonal piggy bank\u201d to fund their own excessive spending habits.\n\nOne example of this alleged misuse of funds took place in 2014, when an oil painting of Trump was put up for auction during a charity event at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida.\n\n\"So Mr. Trump donates $10,000 to start the bidding, and then when the bidding goes on and no one else bids, they\u2019re stuck with the painting,\" Futerfas told Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Saliann Scarpulla as he argued for the case to be dismissed.\n\nWhen Trump's personal charitable foundation placed the bid, it was only meant to \"get the bidding started,\" Futerfas claimed.\n\nBut as it turned out, no one else wanted the painting, so the charity was on the hook for the $10,000 bid. And while Trump could have footed the bill himself at that point, he chose instead to bill his charitable foundation for the cost.\n\nThat's not the only time Trump has allegedly dipped into charitable funds for personal use.\n\nThe state's lawsuit says he also used money from his charity to pay off debts and legal settlements, decorate one of his golf clubs, and make donations to benefit his presidential campaign.\n\nNow, he's trying to get the case dismissed \u2014 but his defense might just be worse than the charges.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "'He is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat.'\n\nMichael Cohen delivered a stunning opening statement to the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, detailing the many crimes committed by Trump, as well as the crimes Cohen committed at Trump's direction.\n\nAnd he confirmed what has been widely suspected: that the \"Individual 1\" cited in various court filings in Cohen's case is, in fact, Donald Trump.\n\nHere are some key excerpts from Cohen's explosive testimony.\n\n'He is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat.'\n\nI am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump\u2019s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat.\n\nDonald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation \u2013 only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the \u201cgreatest infomercial in political history.\u201d\n\nTrump implicitly directed Cohen to lie to Congress\n\nTo be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it, too \u2013 because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress.\n\nTrump is 'Individual 1'\n\nAs many people that know me best would say, I am the person they would call at 3AM if they needed help. I proudly remember being the emergency contact for many of my children\u2019s friends when they were growing up because their parents knew that I would drop everything and care for them as if they were my own. Yet, last fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1. For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J. Trump.\n\nTrump knew in advance about the Wikileaks hack and email dump that damaged Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign\n\nA lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes. As I earlier stated, Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails. In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump\u2019s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u201cwouldn\u2019t that be great.\u201d\n\nTrump is even more shockingly racist in private than he is in public\n\nMr. Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries \u201cshitholes.\u201d In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a \u201cshithole.\u201d This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States. While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.\n\nTrump lied about his wealth\n\nIt was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.\n\nTrump conspired with Cohen to mislead American voters and break campaign law with the Stormy Daniels hush money payment\n\nMr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too \u2013 without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public. I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.\n\nTrump lied to dodge the Vietnam draft\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Trump said he did not consider Vietnam Veteran, and Prisoner of War, Senator John McCain to be \u201ca hero\u201d because he likes people who weren\u2019t captured. At the same time, Mr. Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment. \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid, I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.\u201d I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now.\n\nCohen believes it's likely Trump knew in advance about the Trump Tower meeting\n\nQuestions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions. Sometime in the summer of 2017, I read all over the media that there had been a meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016 involving Don Jr. and others from the campaign with Russians, including a representative of the Russian government, and an email setting up the meeting with the subject line, \u201cDirt on Hillary Clinton.\u201d Something clicked in my mind. I remember being in the room with Mr. Trump, probably in early June 2016, when something peculiar happened. Don Jr. came into the room and walked behind his father\u2019s desk \u2013 which in itself was unusual. People didn\u2019t just walk behind Mr. Trump\u2019s desk to talk to him. I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: \u201cThe meeting is all set.\u201d I remember Mr. Trump saying, \u201cOk good\u2026let me know.\u201d What struck me as I looked back and thought about that exchange between Don Jr. and his father was, first, that Mr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world. And also, that Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone \u2013 and certainly not without checking with his father. I also knew that nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge and approval. So, I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad\u2019s desk that day \u2014 and that Mr. Trump knew that was the meeting Don Jr. was talking about when he said, \u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026let me know.\u201d\n\nWatch Cohen's full opening statement at CSPAN.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Mark Meadows (R-NC) used a black woman as a human prop to deny Trump's racism during the Michael Cohen hearing on Wednesday.\n\nMeadows took exception to Cohen's accurate description of Trump as a racist and had Lynne Patton, a black woman who is an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), stand next to him.\n\n\"She says that as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there is no way that she would work for an individual who was racist,\" Meadows said, using the woman like one would a placard placed on an easel during a traditional Congressional hearing.\n\n\"Neither should I, as the son of a Holocaust survivor,\" Cohen replied, pointing out that her employment by Trump at his company or in his administration does nothing to defuse his racism.\n\nCohen later pointed out that there are \"zero\" black executives at the Trump Organization as evidence that Trump is bigoted towards black people.\n\nAs part of his defense, Meadows said he's talked to Trump \"over 300 times\" and \"I've not heard one time a racist comment out of his mouth in private.\"\n\nBut Trump has repeatedly made racist public statements in full view of members of Congress like Meadows and the entire world.\n\nHe called Nazis \"very fine people.\" He praised memorials to pro-slavery Confederates as \"beautiful.\" He said Mexicans were rapists. He called for a Muslim ban on travel to the United States. He was the leading proponent of the racist birther conspiracy theory against President Barack Obama. He called for the execution of the Central Park Five after they were exonerated. He attacked black NFL players for opposing police brutality.\n\nIn the presidency, Trump referred to countries with nonwhite leaders as \"shithole\" countries.\n\nTrump even recognized the widespread black distrust of him because of his racism and reportedly offered to bribe rapper 50 Cent to be his friend.\n\nTrump is a racist, the public record shows it and Cohen's testimony is validated by the public record. If Meadows doesn't want to see it, that's because he is refusing to face reality.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Tuesday morning, another domino fell when Thom Tillis (R-NC) said he'd vote in favor of the resolution as well.\n\nFour unnamed Republican senators at the Pence luncheon said there are as many as ten GOP senators who would support a resolution disapproving the national emergency. Given that the Democrats only need four Republican defectors to pass the measure, it's no wonder that Pence is tasked with trying to keep the GOP in line.\n\nAt lunch, Pence vainly tried to explain how Trump's emergency declaration is different from President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which Republicans hated partly because they claimed it was an overreach of executive power.\n\nOne anonymous senator described Pence's argument as, \"We've got a crisis, that means the president can do this.\" He didn't consider that a very good argument.\n\nRand Paul argued with Pence that if the GOP backs the national emergency, they're ceding the high ground on the issue.\n\nWhile Paul is wrong that the GOP has ever held the high ground on this issue, his underlying sentiment is correct: The GOP will lose all ability to pretend they are the party of the rule of law if they back a president who has overridden the wishes of both the House and Senate.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Pence was sent to the Senate do Trump's dirty work for him, and it isn't the first time Pence got beaten up by members of his own party when he did so.\n\nDuring Trump's government shutdown, Pence trekked to a Senate luncheon to beg the GOP to stay unified in allowing Trump to continue his pointless, drawn-out closure of the government. The senators told Pence they didn't want a shutdown, however, and that it was a bad idea in the first place.\n\nIn the instance of the national emergency, it isn't likely that there are enough GOP defectors to create a veto-proof majority. That would take 20 Republicans crossing the aisle. But that's a bit beside the point.\n\nTrump is having an increasingly hard time forcing the GOP to agree with his pointless, heartless, and expensive moves at our southern border, and there doesn't appear to be anything Mike Pence can do about it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Democratic majority is exposing Trump lawlessness that Republicans refused to investigate for two years.\n\nElections have consequences.\n\nHouse Democrats on Wednesday held their first real hearing on Trump's alleged criminal activity leading up to, during and after the 2016 presidential elections \u2014 finally conducting the kind of oversight that Republicans refused to do for the first two years of Trump's stint in the White House.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Reform put Trump's longtime lawyer and self-described \"fixer\" on the witness stand to answer questions on the crimes he either helped carry out on Trump's request or the alleged crimes he witnessed while working for Trump for a decade.\n\nAnd the revelations were even more explosive than we could have imagined.\n\nThe biggest bombshell was Cohen's divulgence that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating Trump for unspecified crimes.\n\nCohen said those prosecutors \u2014 who work in the prestigious Southern District of New York (SDNY) \u2014 asked him not to discuss the investigation.\n\nBut the revelation that the SDNY is investigating Trump is a clear sign that Trump's legal exposure goes far beyond special counsel Robert Mueller's high-stakes probe into the Trump campaign's possible conspiracy with Russia during the 2016 campaign. And that's very, very bad news for Trump.\n\nBut that wasn't the only eye-popping revelation Cohen made during his more than 5-hours-long testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nCohen testified under oath that Trump knew about WikiLeaks' impending release of hacked emails that could damage Hillary Clinton's campaign \u2014 a revelation that shows Trump is unethical at best and criminal at worst for not reporting this the hack to authorities.\n\nCohen also laid out the illegal payment scheme to suppress porn actress Stormy Daniels' affair allegations against Trump \u2014 saying Trump knew about the payments all along and lied about his role in the payment scheme, as did Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.\n\nHe went on to say that negotiations for a Trump Tower project in Moscow took place during the 2016 election, and that Trump lied about the negotiations on the campaign trail.\n\nAnd Cohen revealed that Trump engaged in financial crimes, devaluing his assets in order to cheat on his tax bill and illegally using funds from his so-called charitable foundation to buy an expensive portrait of himself \u2014 something only a cheap egomaniac would do.\n\nCohen backed up his allegations with documents, providing checks and other documents as evidence.\n\nThis was key because Republicans on the committee were solely there to shield Trump from scrutiny \u2014 calling into question Cohen's credibility in an effort to try and sow doubt about Cohen's explosive revelations.\n\nHowever, their behavior was both desperate and in many cases embarrassing, as GOP lawmakers on the committee tried and failed to shut the hearing down before ultimately bumbling through lines of questioning that often went nowhere.\n\nUltimately, the hearing showed that Republicans' newfound House minority status will no longer allow them to run defense for Trump or shield him from scrutiny for his crimes and corrupt administration.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), for example, helped lay out the case for Congress to subpoena Trump's tax returns, pointing to Cohen's accusation that Trump inflated his net worth and value of his assets, including Trump golf properties across the country.\n\nLooking at Trump's tax returns could allow Congress to determine whether Trump was falsifying the value of his golf properties on his taxes.\n\nThe powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee has a wealth of corruption allegations against Trump and his business empire that it can investigate now that Democrats control it.\n\nSimilarly, there are a number of other committees that Democrats now control in the majority, where they can launch more probes. That includes the House Intelligence Committee, currently working on investigating Trump's Russia ties; the House Judiciary Committee, which can look into possible missteps by the Department of Justice; and a host of other committees focused on the environment, the financial services sector, and more.\n\nRepublicans blocked this type of oversight for the first two years of Trump's presidency.\n\nBut as they learned on Wednesday, the days of being able to shield their leader are now over.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) expertly laid out the reasons why Congress needs to see them.\n\nIn Wednesday's House Oversight Committee hearing with Trump former attorney Michael Cohen, Ocasio-Cortez laid out how Trump may have \"improperly devalued his assets to avoid paying taxes.\"\n\nHere's how the scheme worked.\n\nTrump claimed in financial disclosure forms that one of his properties in Florida, the Trump National Golf Club, was worth more than $50 million. But he reported to local tax authorities that the course was worth no more than $5 million.\n\nOcasio-Cortez asked Cohen if this was accurate.\n\nIn seeming agreement, Cohen said, \"It's identical to what he did at Trump National Golf Club at Briarcliff Manor.\"\n\nAfter going through other instances of \"dubious tax schemes\" Trump participated in, Ocasio-Cortez asked Cohen if he had knowledge of those. Cohen said he did not, but that Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg would know.\n\nThen Ocasio-Cortez went for the big game.\n\n\"Would it help for the committee to obtain federal and state tax returns from the president and his company\" to address the numerous issues, she asked Cohen?\n\n\"I believe so,\" Cohen answered.\n\nCongress has the authority to request the tax returns of any individual in the country. It simply requires a letter to the Treasury from Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nTrump himself repeatedly promised to release his tax returns during his campaign for the White House. But as usual, Trump was just lying.\n\nBut now that Democrats are in charge of the House, Trump may not have a choice. He may be forced to own up to his tax schemes \u2014 and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez laid out the roadmap for how Congress can expose them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The last time the House voted on a gun safety bill was for the 1994 assault weapons ban.\n\nThe bill will require a background check for all purchases of firearms \u2014 an idea that Americans overwhelmingly support. One 2018 poll shows 97 percent of the public supports the idea of universal background checks \u2014 including 97 percent of gun owners, 97 percent of Republicans, and 99 percent of Democrats.\n\nUnder current law, background checks are only required if a gun is purchased from a licensed gun dealer. The legislation is necessary to close loopholes for online purchases and at gun shows.\n\n\"It's a real moment for the nation,\" Rep. Lucy McBath (D-GA) said before the vote. \"We're at a critical mass now where families are just saying they\u2019ve had enough.\"\n\nTragically, McBath speaks from experience. She lost her son, Jordan Davis, to gun violence six years ago. She became an advocate for gun safety, which eventually led her to run for Congress and oust an NRA-backed Republican incumbent.\n\nEven after horrific massacres in Newtown, Charleston, Las Vegas, and Parkland, as well as more than 1,900 mass shootings in the last six years, Republicans steadfastly refused to even hold hearings on the issue of gun violence.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, voters across the country ousted NRA-backed Republicans from office and replaced them with Democrats who vowed to pass bills to help stem the epidemic of gun deaths.\n\nThe new Democratic majority is keeping that promise by passing this universal background check bill.\n\n\"This life-saving and bipartisan legislation passed because the determined leaders in the House listened to local organizers from Oklahoma to Colorado to Virginia who finally proved to lawmakers that voters care about gun safety,\" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, said in statement shortly after the bill passed.\n\nWhile the new Democratic majority is determined to fight for the safety of all communities, Trump has threatened to veto the bill if it makes it to his desk \u2014 showing once again that he would rather cower before the NRA than listen to the will of Americans.\n\nDemocrats overwhelming voted in line with the will of the majority of Americans. But 188 Republicans turned their backs on making America a little bit safer.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Matt Gaetz (R-FL), one of Trump's top congressional defenders, is under investigation by the Florida Bar Association for threatening Michael Cohen before his testimony on Wednesday.\n\nChuck Hughes, the bar's counsel, confirmed to the Daily Beast that an investigation is underway based on complaints submitted by the public. Gaetz is licensed as a lawyer in Florida, where he represents the 1st Congressional District.\n\nThe site notes that the bar's grievance committee must now determine whether Gaetz violated their organization's ethical guidelines. If they determine that a violation has occurred, Gaetz would be given 15 days to respond and the bar's attorneys would investigate. The entire process could lead to sanctions from the state supreme court.\n\n\"Hey @MichaelCohen212 \u2013 Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot\u2026\" Gaetz tweeted ahead of Cohen's testimony before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nLegal analysts pointed out that the thuggish missive could be in violation of 18 U.S. Code 1512, relating to \"tampering with a witness, victim or an informant.\"\n\nGaetz was immediately and widely condemned for his menacing tweet. Cohen had already rescheduled his testimony, citing his concern about threats to his and his family's safety after Trump used his Twitter feed to intimidate his former lawyer and personal fixer.\n\nGaetz ultimately deleted his tweet and apologized after Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned him for it.\n\n\"It was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did. I\u2019m deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I\u2019m sorry,\" Gaetz wrote.\n\nDespite his rhetoric, Gaetz was present in the hearing room for Cohen's testimony even though he is not a member of the Oversight Committee.\n\nGaetz is one of Trump's most frequent and vocal defenders in Congress. His decision to threaten Cohen was an extension of Trump's ongoing crusade to attack the former member of his inner circle.\n\nThe episode again illustrates that Republicans in Congress consider themselves members of Trump's defense team, trying to shut down investigations into his alleged crimes, rather than upholding their constitutional duty to the rule of law.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And since Cohen was Trump's lawyer, Cohen was often the one on the front lines making the threats of legal action.\n\nFor example, in 2015, when the Daily Beast reported that Trumps ex-wife Ivana Trump said she felt violated by Trump during sex, Cohen went on a long-winded rant against a reporter on the story, threatening him with ruining his life.\n\n\"I will make sure that you and I meet one day while we're in the courthouse.

Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), who wanted to know the last time Cohen spoke to Trump or anyone else \"acting on [Trump's] behalf.\"\n\nCohen replied that he last spoke to Trump about two months after Cohen's personal residence and office were raided by federal agents.\n\nKrishnamoorthi then asked what Cohen spoke about with Trump during that conversation, which was when Cohen dropped the bombshell.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this topic is actually something that's being investigated right now by the Southern District of New York, and I've been asked by them not to discuss and not to talk about these issues,\" Cohen said.\n\nWhen pressed further about whether Cohen knows of any illegal behavior by Trump that hadn't been discussed publicly yet, Cohen again declined to comment, citing an ongoing federal investigation.\n\n\"Again, those are part of the investigation that\u2019s currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York,\" Cohen said.\n\nLater in the hearing, Cohen gave more detail into the SDNY investigation, saying that Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., is under investigation for the same hush money payments Cohen pleaded guilty to.\n\nCohen's revelation that Trump is under investigation by the SDNY is huge.\n\nIt suggests that Trump's legal liability doesn't just lie with the outcome of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, but also with the SDNY \u2014 arguably the most respected and prestigious federal court district in the country.\n\nAnd the fact that Cohen revealed this is likely another reason Republicans were so terrified of having Cohen testify in the first place.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The indictment \u2014 related to activities during the 2016 general election and 2018 primary \u2014 includes three counts of felonious obstruction of justice, two counts of conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice, and two counts of possession of absentee ballot. Some of Dowless' colleagues face charges of obstruction of justice and possession of an absentee ballot.\n\nDowless was hired by Harris in the 2018 campaign for the 9th Congressional District, even after being warned by his own son that Dowless was a shady character. Dowless hired others to collect absentee ballots, and in some cases fill in the ballots for Harris. Both activities are illegal in North Carolina.\n\nAfter his campaign engaged in alleged election fraud, Harris received roughly 900 more votes than his Democratic opponent.\n\nThe North Carolina Board of Elections unanimously decided last week that it could not certify Harris as the legitimate winner, and called for a new election to take place. It will be the first congressional election do-over in more than 40 years.\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence that a Republican candidate financed an election fraud scheme to steal a House seat, GOP leaders have made the ludicrous claim that Democrats were somehow responsible for the fraud. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, issued a vague statement attacking Democrats for Harris' alleged election fraud.\n\nIn an even more ridiculous moment, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor to cast aspersions at Democrats for scandal. McConnell tried to conflate voter fraud, an extremely uncommon crime when voters themselves engage in criminal activity, with election fraud, whereby voters are the ones who are harmed.\n\nIn North Carolina, it was election fraud, financed by the Republican nominee Harris and carried out by the now-indicted Dowless.\n\nDowless was released on $30,000 bond, and will soon face justice for for his alleged crimes.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "'He is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat.'\n\nMichael Cohen delivered a stunning opening statement to the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, detailing the many crimes committed by Trump, as well as the crimes Cohen committed at Trump's direction.\n\nAnd he confirmed what has been widely suspected: that the \"Individual 1\" cited in various court filings in Cohen's case is, in fact, Donald Trump.\n\nHere are some key excerpts from Cohen's explosive testimony.\n\n'He is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat.'\n\nI am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump\u2019s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat.\n\nDonald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation \u2013 only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the \u201cgreatest infomercial in political history.\u201d\n\nTrump implicitly directed Cohen to lie to Congress\n\nTo be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it, too \u2013 because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress.\n\nTrump is 'Individual 1'\n\nAs many people that know me best would say, I am the person they would call at 3AM if they needed help. I proudly remember being the emergency contact for many of my children\u2019s friends when they were growing up because their parents knew that I would drop everything and care for them as if they were my own. Yet, last fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1. For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J. Trump.\n\nTrump knew in advance about the Wikileaks hack and email dump that damaged Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign\n\nA lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes. As I earlier stated, Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails. In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump\u2019s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u201cwouldn\u2019t that be great.\u201d\n\nTrump is even more shockingly racist in private than he is in public\n\nMr. Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries \u201cshitholes.\u201d In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a \u201cshithole.\u201d This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States. While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.\n\nTrump lied about his wealth\n\nIt was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.\n\nTrump conspired with Cohen to mislead American voters and break campaign law with the Stormy Daniels hush money payment\n\nMr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too \u2013 without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public. I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.\n\nTrump lied to dodge the Vietnam draft\n\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Trump said he did not consider Vietnam Veteran, and Prisoner of War, Senator John McCain to be \u201ca hero\u201d because he likes people who weren\u2019t captured. At the same time, Mr. Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment. \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid, I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.\u201d I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now.\n\nCohen believes it's likely Trump knew in advance about the Trump Tower meeting\n\nQuestions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions. Sometime in the summer of 2017, I read all over the media that there had been a meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016 involving Don Jr. and others from the campaign with Russians, including a representative of the Russian government, and an email setting up the meeting with the subject line, \u201cDirt on Hillary Clinton.\u201d Something clicked in my mind. I remember being in the room with Mr. Trump, probably in early June 2016, when something peculiar happened. Don Jr. came into the room and walked behind his father\u2019s desk \u2013 which in itself was unusual. People didn\u2019t just walk behind Mr. Trump\u2019s desk to talk to him. I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: \u201cThe meeting is all set.\u201d I remember Mr. Trump saying, \u201cOk good\u2026let me know.\u201d What struck me as I looked back and thought about that exchange between Don Jr. and his father was, first, that Mr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world. And also, that Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone \u2013 and certainly not without checking with his father. I also knew that nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge and approval. So, I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad\u2019s desk that day \u2014 and that Mr. Trump knew that was the meeting Don Jr. was talking about when he said, \u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026let me know.\u201d\n\nWatch Cohen's full opening statement at CSPAN.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Turns out that Trump talked a lot more about his Trump Tower Moscow deal than he has ever let on.\n\nLate Thursday night, BuzzFeed dropped a bombshell: Trump instructed his former longtime lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations.\n\nLast month, Lanny Davis, the ultimate unreliable narrator and Cohen's lawyer, had said that Trump knew ahead of time Cohen was going to give false testimony to Congress about the planned Trump Tower Moscow and that Trump didn't stop him.\n\nBut this is quite a few steps beyond that.\n\nCohen is going to prison because he lied to both the Senate and the House about this deal. Special counsel Robert Mueller specifically pointed out that Cohen lied about negotiations for the Moscow deal ending in January 2016 to try to minimize links between the project and Individual 1, aka Trump.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed, two federal law enforcement officials have confirmed that Cohen told Mueller that Trump \"personally instructed him to lie\" about the Moscow project and to say that the negotiations ended much earlier than they did. Apparently, the Special Counsel's office already knew all this, but Cohen confirmed it during one of his interviews with the office.\n\nThe Trump Tower Moscow story has had a ton of twists and turns. During the campaign, Trump said he had no dealings with Russia, a stance he was still yelling about on Twitter in early 2017. Then we heard Cohen's lie about negotiations ending in early 2016. And then we learned the negotiations maybe stretched into November 2016.\n\nAt this point, who knows how late they really went? When you have a campaign team that had over 100 contacts with the Russians, it must be tough to keep track.\n\nTrump can't wriggle out of this by saying he directed Cohen briefly and then Cohen handled everything else. According to BuzzFeed, Trump had at least 10 face-to-face meetings with Cohen about the deal during the campaign.\n\nThere's more. Cohen has also provided the Mueller's team with information about conversations about the project with Ivanka and Don Jr., saying that he gave Trump's offspring \"very detailed updates.\" Don Jr., of course, told the Senate back in 2017 that he barely knew about a plan to build a Trump Tower Moscow.\n\nHaving this story emerge Thursday goes a long way toward explaining Rudy Giuliani's deeply weird interview with Chris Cuomo Wednesday night, in which he revealed that yes, other people in the campaign colluded with Russia, but not Trump \u2014 as if that was some sort of defense.\n\nThere's no question that, as former Watergate prosecutor Jill Wine-Banks said on MSNBC, \"This is obstruction and collusion.\" With this new revelation naming Trump and two of his children, Trump has to be getting scared.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And, you know, I think comments like that show a lack of understanding of the impact of the Fed on the economy, and appropriate policy goals,\" she added.\n\nYellen was even more biting in her critique about trade in particular.\n\nTrump often whines about the trade deficit between the United States and other countries, which is the difference between the amount of goods the U.S. exports to a country and the amount the U.S. imports from that country.\n\nBut obsessing over that number is not smart, according to Yellen. \"I think almost any economist would tell you that there's no real meaning to bilateral trade deficits, and it's not an appropriate objective of policy,\" she said.\n\nStill, Trump has made discussion of trade deficits central to his escalating trade wars with China, Mexico, and other countries around the globe. His policies are costing farmers billions of dollars, and even one Republican governor says Trump's uneducated views on trade have \"devastated\" her state.\n\nOne analysis shows that if Trump follows through on all his threats related to tariffs and trade wars, his policies could cost the American economy more than 2 million jobs.\n\nYellen's wisdom comes from a long career of dealing with economic issues. She was the first woman to ever chair the Federal Reserve, which she did to close out her 17-year career at the institution. Trump did not re-appoint her for a second term, and she is now the president-elect of the American Economic Association.\n\nBut Yellen's critiques were not limited to Trump's policies; she also hammered the Republican tax scam as unnecessary, saying, \"we also had a huge fiscal stimulus that came at a time when the economy was arguably operating near full employment. Really didn't need that stimulus.\"\n\nThe GOP tax scam, which passed Congress without a single vote from Democrats, was a massive handout to Wall Street banks and massive corporations. The unneeded scam helped add almost $2 trillion to the national deficit, while families are seeing lower refunds or even unexpectedly finding out they owe Uncle Sam hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\nTrump's ignorance about the economy is causing real harm to American families across the country.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Never happens, they said! Well, that fraud just didn't happen if modest efforts to ensure that voters are who they say they are and are voting in the proper place were really some sinister right-wing plot to prevent people from voting.\"\n\nFirst, one thing very clear: What happened in North Carolina's 9th District wasn't voter fraud.\n\nVoter fraud is when someone who is ineligible to vote casts a ballot in an election or tries to impersonate someone else in order to cast a ballot.\n\nInstead, what happened was election fraud, in which an operative hired by Republican Mark Harris' campaign illegally harvested absentee ballots from eligible voters and illegally filled them out.\n\nA voter ID law, which requires voters to present their IDs in order to cast ballots in person, would not have impacted this instance of fraud whatsoever. That is, unless McConnell is against absentee ballots.\n\nBut an incredulous McConnell went on with his phony argument about voter fraud.\n\n\"So now you might expect, now that an incident of very real voter fraud has become national news and the Republican candidate seems \u2014 seems \u2014 to have benefitted, these long-standing Democratic talking points have been really quiet,\" McConnell said, appearing to even cast doubt on the massive election fraud carried out by a candidate from his own party.\n\nAgain, it wasn't voter fraud that occurred. And it's Republicans who should be forced to answer why they were all deafeningly silent about this case of election fraud until the GOP candidate was forced to call for a new election instead of perjuring himself on the witness stand during a hearing on the illegal scheme.\n\nSome Republicans have commented on the election fraud. But like McConnell, it's to make bad faith arguments blaming it on Democrats.\n\nOf course, both sides are not to blame here.\n\nRepublicans did wrong in North Carolina, and in order to skirt responsibility they're seeking to shift responsibility on Democrats, who were the innocent victims of GOP's attempt to steal an election.\n\nBut there's a way to punish Republicans for this: The North Carolina State Board of Elections called for a new election in the tainted 9th District race.\n\nVoters will get the chance to tell the GOP what they think about their blatant election stealing attempt.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

They haven't done so.\n\nNot only has the administration continued to drag its feet on reuniting families and assessing the whereabouts of abducted children \u2014 it's also still separating children from their families despite promises to stop and despite an order from a judge.\n\nThe plight of these detained children is a \"national emergency,\" said Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings.\n\n\"When our own government rips vulnerable children, toddlers, and even infants from the arms of their mothers and fathers with no plan to reunite them, that is government-sponsored child abuse,\" Cummings said. \"It is our job to step in and protect those children. Further delay is not an option.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the top-ranking Republican on the committee, complained that Democrats were rushing \u2014 even though the administration has already had 7 months to hand over the information requested.\n\nJordan, who has been embroiled in an abuse scandal of his own, and other congressional Republicans have set themselves up as Trump's defenders, rather than looking out for the interests of families and the United States.\n\nOfficials like Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen have been Trump's foot soldiers in implementing the abhorrent policy that created the crisis. Previous presidents did not prosecute all border crossers, which triggers child separation, but Trump chose to break with tradition and do so.\n\nSoon he had a national and international crisis on his hands, as the world raged against the administration for abusing and traumatizing small children by caging them and taking their parents away from them.\n\nEven as Trump stonewalls Congress and tries to distance himself from the mess he made, he is allowing the crisis to continue to this day.\n\nBut now that the House is no longer controlled by Trump's Republican co-conspirators, Democrats are using the power given to them by voters to try to uncover the truth and reunite families.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The resolution passed by a vote of 245-182, with every single no vote coming from Republicans.\n\nEven as many Republicans sided with Trump, a bipartisan majority in the House \u2014 13 Republicans voted with the Democratic majority \u2014 still delivered Trump \"an embarrassing rebuke,\" notes Politico.\n\nThe resolution was necessary because of Trump's reckless power grab after Democrats refused to allocate $5.7 billion to build a border wall Trump promised Mexico would pay for. After signing a funding bill without his requested funds, a petulant Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border.\n\nDozens of national security experts pointed out Trump's blatant lies, saying there is no national security crisis at the border. Even former Republican members of Congress pleaded with current Republican members to side with the Democrats, arguing that Trump was trampling all over the separation of powers laid forth in the Constitution.\n\nWith this vote, Congress is doing nothing more than reaffirming and upholding the Constitution, which gives Congress \u2014 not the president \u2014 the duty to allocate funding priorities.\n\nBut 182 Republicans opted to disregard their oath to uphold the Constitution, choosing party over country. Republican opposition is the height of hypocrisy, as even Republicans themselves admit.\n\n\"I'll be real honest, if Obama had done this Republicans would be going nuts,\" Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID) said. \"That's just the reality,\" he added.\n\nThe resolution now moves on to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must schedule a vote in the coming weeks, putting all senators on the record as to where they stand. The White House is already seeing several Republican senators defect, causing Trump to freak out. In a desperate move, Trump tweeted out a demand that Republicans show their loyalty to him no matter what, even if it means breaking their oath to protect and defend the Constitution.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we will learn who is loyal to the Constitution, and who chooses to swear fealty to Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Mark Meadows (R-NC) also furiously denounced the hearing in a Tuesday op-ed in USA Today.\n\n\"Giving Cohen a congressional platform is a disservice to the public, an affront to our democratic values and flat-out offensive to anyone who seeks the truth,\" they wrote.\n\nJordan and Meadows disingenuously claimed that the hearing is only taking place because \"many Democrats care about one thing and one thing only: impeaching President Trump.\"\n\nThe two men \u2014 who had no problems when a Republican-led Congress repeatedly wasted resources on fruitless investigations of President Barack Obama's administration \u2014 added, \"The Oversight Committee shouldn\u2019t feed Cohen\u2019s insatiable desire for celebrity while playing patsy for political aims of the far left.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee officially released a video accusing Cohen of \"lying about President Trump in an effort to save face,\" and telling him to \"have fun in prison.\"\n\nHowever, the RNC video failed to mention that Cohen \u2014 who used to serve as the RNC's deputy finance chair \u2014 also repeatedly lied for Trump in the many years he worked for him. And the RNC didn't seem to mind that the current leader of the GOP had for years employed a known liar as one of his right-hand men.\n\nRepublican Party chairwoman Ronna McDaniel complained that the hearing is a \"last ditch effort to save face & cast blame on everyone but himself [Cohen] for his crimes,\" and lamented that it is \"sad Democrats are wasting time with this liar in an effort to distract from the historic progress @realDonaldTrump is making overseas.\"\n\nIt is unclear if McDaniel is referring to Trump's \"historic\" willingness to suck up to strongmen Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, or his \"historic\" eagerness to alienate key allies like Canada and Germany.\n\nRepublicans are clearly very upset that Cohen is going to speak in public about the corruption he was a part of as a top figure within Trump's inner circle.\n\nBut instead of being angry with Trump for engaging in such practices, or their party for continuing to support him, prominent Republicans are lashing out at the Democratically-controlled House for showing the American people who their president really is.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Turns out he's polluting the swamp instead.\n\nTrump's EPA has drastically reduced the number of enforcement actions against those who break environmental regulations, a move that is leading to \"public health hazards,\" according to a new report sent to Congress on Tuesday from an environmental group.\n\nThat's possibly because Trump's EPA barely even tried to find the polluters in the first place.\n\nAccording to the study, the EPA completed 10,612 inspections on whether entities were complying with environmental regulations \u2014 \"less than 60 percent of the annual average since 2001,\" according to the study.\n\nBut that's not even the worst statistic from the report, written by the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonpartisan environmental watchdog.\n\nThe EPA opened just 129 criminal cases, which happens when the EPA believes a polluter's violations were intentional. That's more than were opened in 2017, Trump's first full year in office, \"but only about a third of the levels reported between 2008 and 2013,\" according to the study.\n\nEven more, according to the study, the EPA \"recovered $69.5 million in total civil penalties in fiscal 2018, the lowest in both actual and inflation-adjusted dollars since at least 1994.\"\n\nThe EPA's lack of enforcement against polluters is just the latest affront to the climate and science from the Trump administration.\n\nSince taking office, Trump's EPA suppressed a study that found there were hazardous levels of toxic chemicals in U.S. drinking water.\n\nThe EPA also wrote a memo to employees instructing them to sow doubt about climate change, giving them eight approved talking points.\n\nAnd the EPA used a debunked study to justify a repeal of emissions standards for a certain type of diesel-fueled truck.\n\nUltimately, more than 1,500 employees left the EPA in the first 18 months of Trump's presidency, many citing Trump's anti-science agenda.\n\nAnd speaking of the Trump administration's anti-science agenda, news broke just last week that Trump is planning to put together a panel to attack climate science, which will be headed by a guy who compared climate scientists to Nazis and ISIS.\n\nThis all comes as scientists warn the effects of climate change could have dire impacts on people's health and the global economy.\n\nDemocrats are working to try and come up with solutions to stop the negative impacts of climate change and make the planet a sustainable place to live.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, are doing everything they can to vilify Democrats' efforts to stop climate change \u2014 ensuring that future generations may pay for their reckless inaction.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Well, times change as it moves forward.\" pic.twitter.com/JSEOaqY6ci \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 26, 2019\n\nThe response was a dishonest two-step that also revealed the political calculations Trump and the GOP engaged in to try to sell Americans a bill of goods.\n\nTo justify Republicans failing to act on Trump's fake \"emergency\" when they had the chance, McCarthy falsely suggested that crime and other problems at the border have gotten so much worse in just the last few months that it had reached a breaking point.\n\nThat's simply not true \u2014 and, as reporters pointed out when Trump tried to make similar arguments, data from Trump's own government proves it.\n\nCustoms and Border Patrol data shows that 2,572 fewer people were apprehended at the border in January than in December, and 1,684 fewer in December than in November. That's the exact time period during which McCarthy claims the so-called emergency was getting worse.\n\nMcCarthy's other claims, which he seems to have cribbed from Trump's talking points, are also completely unsubstantiated.\n\nGovernment officials have not been able to verify Trump's claims of increased human trafficking along the border, and experts say his lurid tales of bound-up women forced across the border sounds like something from a movie, not real life.\n\nTrump and McCarthy have also both insisted that a wall will stem the tide of drugs going across the border. But in its report recommending strategies to reduce illicit drug use, the White House National Drug Control Strategy never even mentions erecting a border wall as a possible solution.\n\nIt's obvious that when McCarthy was second in command to then-Speaker Paul Ryan and working in concert with Trump, Republicans never truly thought the border was an \"emergency.\" If they did, they would have simply appropriated the money Trump wanted.\n\nUnlike McCarthy and his leadership team, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has stood on principle to say there's no good reason to fund Trump's wall, and that Trump is abusing his power by declaring a phony emergency to get what he wants.\n\nThat's why Trump is in the middle of a multi-week meltdown \u2014 and McCarthy is howling right along with him.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The House will vote on widely popular universal background checks this week, but Trump has already threatened to veto it.\n\nThe House of Representatives is poised to pass a bill that would implement universal background checks, an idea supported by 97 percent of the general public. On Monday night, the Trump White House threatened to veto the bill if it makes it to his desk.\n\nThe bill represents a commitment by House Democrats to take the issue of gun safety seriously. While NRA-backed Republicans spent years offering nothing but empty \"thoughts and prayers\" as an epidemic of gun violence and mass shootings ripped communities apart, the new Democratic majority is putting forward real legislation to deal with the problem.\n\nFor the first time in almost a decade, the House held a hearing about the issue of gun violence and gun safety. And despite overwhelming Republican opposition, Democrats passed the universal background check bill out of committee, setting up a vote by the full House on it.\n\nThe bill would require universal background checks on all gun purchases, helping to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of criminals and those who may seek to do harm to others.\n\nBefore the committee hearing about the bill, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) celebrated the bill as a \"most elementary proposal, to deny firearms to anyone who cannot pass a universal criminal and mental background check.\"\n\nA 2018 poll showed overwhelming support for the idea of universal background checks. A stunning 97 percent of Americans support universal background check legislation, including 97 percent of Republicans, 98 percent of independents, and 99 percent of Democrats. Even 97 percent of gun owners support the idea. The poll was taken before Democrats were in control of the House, and did not ask about this specific legislation, but rather the concept of background checks.\n\nIn the aftermath of the gun-fueled massacre of students and adults at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida, Trump came out in support of universal background check legislation. Six days after the shooting, Trump said, \"Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!\"\n\nLess than a month later, Trump made another promise, saying, \"Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House.\"\n\nBut when such legislation finally began moving through Congress, Trump immediately went back on his word. Instead of standing up for the safety of Americans, Trump aligned with the NRA in opposition to extraordinarily popular commonsense gun-safety legislation.\n\nThe bill is expected to pass the House, but Republicans in the Senate are already threatening to block it. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham already ruled out taking up the bill in his committee, even if it passes out of the House. \"We're kind of going our own way,\" Graham told Politico, saying he wants to hold hearings on \"red flag\" legislation.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies are so beholden to the gun lobby that they oppose legislation with near-universal support from Americans.\n\nWhen the next mass shooting happens, Republicans are sure to offer their thoughts and prayers for the victims' families. But those thoughts and prayers come with a catch: Opposition to any legislation that could prevent the next mass shooting, and the one after that, and the one after that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

It's only slightly longer than Cole's statement complaining about not having enough time to read the resolution.\n\nThe resolution is necessary because Trump declared a fake national emergency at the southern border as an excuse to swipe taxpayer money to build a wall he repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for. Trump spent months throwing tantrums and demanding Congress fork over $5.7 billion to pay for the wall.\n\nWhen Congress refused, a humiliated Trump decided to make up an emergency at the border and steal the money from other programs, maybe including school construction funds meant for children of military members.\n\nIn response, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) drafted the one-page resolution, using the authority the National Emergencies Act gives Congress to terminate any declaration by a president.\n\nA group of almost 60 former national security officials says there is no national emergency at the border. Almost two dozen former Republican members of Congress sent a letter to current Republican members, pleading with them to support the Democratic resolution.\n\nBut Cole insists he just can't find the time to read those 54 words.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Ben Sasse (R-NE) and authorized by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the vote to consider the so-called \"Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act\" failed to meet the 60-vote threshold needed to proceed, instead receiving 53 votes in favor and 44 opposed.\n\nThe bill, which Republicans have previously tried to pass in a cynical move to restrict abortion access, would have exposed doctors to criminal charges even if they are exercising their best medical judgment and working in the best interests of their patients.\n\nIt was a show vote, and the latest in a series of stunts from Republicans to put women at risk in an attempt to boost the party's failing legislative agenda.\n\nTrump has attached himself to the issue, radically mischaracterizing Democrats who opposed the bill as supporting the \"killing of newborn infant children\" \u2014 echoing the extremist rhetoric of terrorists who have murdered doctors in the past.\n\nThe bill was opposed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women\u2019s Association, and the American Public Health Association, who called it \"a dangerous government intrusion into private health-care decisions.\"\n\n\"This legislation is based on lies and a misinformation campaign, aimed at shaming women and criminalizing doctors for a practice that doesn\u2019t exist in medicine or reality,\" said Planned Parenthood Federation of America president Leana Wen in a statement.\n\nThe bill promotes an ugly right-wing myth that demonizes doctors by falsely claiming that infants are routinely \"born alive\" and then murdered after botched abortions. It threatens doctors with up to five years in jail if they fail to take such a theoretical infant to a hospital \u2014 even if it is not viable and has no chance of surviving.\n\nThe bill would require doctors to face unclear and uncertain regulations about what should be done in the midst of a medical procedure, and could force them to act against their best medical judgment. It could also force women in heartbreaking situations, such as those who need an abortion very late in pregnancy due to a deadly fetal anomaly, to endure even more trauma for no reason.\n\nIn his floor speech pushing for a vote on the bill, McConnell lied and said it was \"a straightforward piece of legislation to protect newborn babies,\" using a well-worn conservative talking point to cover for an attack on women's reproductive rights.\n\nBut Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) rebuffed McConnell's falsehoods on the floor of the Senate by pointing out that the bill was \"clearly anti-doctor, anti-woman and anti-family.\"\n\n\"If you're a medical provider, this bill would supersede your years of medical training and your oath to deliver the best possible medical treatment to your patients,\" Murray said. \"It would apply a one-size-fits-all set of requirements that do not reflect the reality that every pregnancy is different. And it would subject you to criminal penalties if you choose to let medical standards, not politics, drive the care you offer your patient.\"\n\nMurray also noted the bill's harmful impacts on women, who Republicans falsely claimed the bill would help.\n\n\"If you are a woman, this bill would mean if you are one of a very, very few women who needed an abortion late in pregnancy, you could be legally required to accept inappropriate, medically unnecessary care. Care that may directly conflict with your wishes at a deeply personal, often incredibly painful moment in your life,\" she explained.\n\nRepublicans were thwarted in their latest attempt to restrict women's rights and send doctors to jail for doing their jobs. But they are certain to try similar attacks in the future as they desperately try to hold on to their political power.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Even in the face of clear evidence of election fraud in North Carolina, Republicans have been mostly silent. Except, that is, when they can try to use the misdeeds of their candidate, Mark Harris, to somehow blame Democrats.\n\nYou'd think that when there was finally an instance of large-scale election fraud, Republicans would be the first to react. They've been banging the drum on this issue forever, most recently with Trump's laughably ineffective \u2014 and dearly departed \u2014 voter suppression commission.\n\nBut when faced with the Mark Harris race in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District, where clear evidence of widespread alteration of votes exists, likely at the level that changed the outcome of an election, the GOP has been largely silent.\n\nSure, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), issued a vaguely worded semi-condemnation that sought to, of course, attack Democrats instead.\n\nVoter fraud is never acceptable and neither is ballot harvesting. We call on Democrats to join Republicans in rejecting the practice of ballot harvesting in every congressional district in the country. States that do not have laws against ballot harvesting are more susceptible to voter fraud and as Washington Democrats have said, \u2018No American should have to wonder whether the vote they cast is counted and counted fairly.'\n\nEmmer's statement is about tapping into conservatives' unhappiness over the absolute decimation of the California GOP in the 2018 midterms. California allows for what conservatives derisively term \"ballot harvesting.\" It sounds nefarious, but all it means is that if you are voting by mail in that state, you can designate whomever you'd like to drop your ballot off. The California law contains a number of regulations and penalties should people try to engage in a large-scale, cash-driven fraud scheme like McCrae Dowless did for Harris in North Carolina.\n\nTrump had a typically incoherent answer when he was asked about the issue last week, largely dodging the issue to complain about \"what's happened in California with the votes,\" and to vaguely cite \"a case where they found a million fraudulent votes.\" But as to North Carolina, he demanded he see a \"final report\" before passing judgment, even though the final report, such as it is, already exists: There's going to be a new election. Trump's real goal, of course, is to muddy the waters and to use North Carolina's clear-cut election fraud to somehow insist that any election where he didn't like the outcome is stolen.\n\nThough the GOP seem to be putting forward a brave and belligerent face for the public eye, behind the scenes, it sounds like things may not be going so great for Harris. The right-leaning Washington Times is reporting that, as Harris reaches out to state and local Republicans, he's getting a \"clear message\" that he should definitely not be running again.\n\nThe GOP is right about one thing: Harris really shouldn't be running. Given the clear evidence Harris ignored the warnings about Dowless and chose to work with a convicted felon to alter the course of an election, it seems unfair to reward Harris with another bite at the apple.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump wants a climate change panel that can do its work in secret and be stuffed full of anti-science zealots.\n\nLast week, there were reports that William Happer, a senior director in Trump's National Security Council, was putting together a panel that would attack research on whether climate change was a security threat. Like many things with this administration, the idea has already gotten much worse than when it was first proposed.\n\nInitially, it appeared that Trump would, by executive order, create a Presidential Committee on Climate Security. Such a group would have been an official independent federal advisory committee.\n\nHowever, those committees have specific rules they must follow thanks to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. They have to meet in public, they are subject to FOIA, and, perhaps most relevant here, they have to maintain a membership that is balanced \"in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee.\" In other words, a climate change advisory committee would have to contain not merely people like Happer, a crackpot who thinks climate scientists are like Nazis, but also experts who believe in climate change.\n\nRather than follow those sorts of pesky rules, the new plan is to create an ad hoc working group that wouldn't be subject to disclosure rules and doesn't have to be fair or balanced. There's no reason the group couldn't just be stacked with fossil fuel industry insiders, climate denialists, or federal scientists who have no background in climate science.\n\nThis all stems from the fact that Trump is still unhappy that his administration issued the National Climate Assessment late last year, which it was required by law to do. It was a comprehensive 1600-page report detailing, with scientific certainty, both how devastating climate change has already been and how much worse it will get.\n\nBut Trump refused to accept the findings of the report.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" he said when the report was released.\n\nSince he doesn't believe in climate change, Trump and others in his administration think of a report confirming climate change as a political product of Obama-era scientists. He's ignoring the fact that much of the report was written and reviewed during this current administration. He's also ignoring the fact that climate change science is settled science.\n\nRetired Rear Adm. David Titley, who used to be the Navy's oceanographer, calls Trump's goal of a faux-neutral body that will attack climate science a \"truly bad idea that just refuses to die.\"\n\nHe's not wrong.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Forget the Constitution. Trump wants Senate Republicans to show fealty to him.\n\nAs several GOP senators abandon him, Trump took to Twitter on Monday morning in a humiliating effort to convince Senate Republicans to support his fake national emergency declaration.\n\nOn Friday, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) announced she would support a Democratic-led effort to rebuke Trump's latest effort to pretend the rules don't apply to him. \"I want to make sure that the resolution of disapproval is exactly what I think it is, because if it is as I understand it to be, I will likely be supporting the resolution to disapprove of the action,\" Murkowski told the AP.\n\nShe joins Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Marco Rubio (R-FL), who have expressed a desire to reign in Trump's unconstitutional power grab.\n\nSensing vulnerability, Trump made a desperate plea.\n\n\"I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,\" Trump said. \"Without strong Borders, we don't have a Country \u2014 and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don't fall into the Democrats 'trap' of Open Borders and Crime!\"\n\nThe lie-riddled pleas come as there is mounting pressure on Republicans to overturn the national emergency declaration. Public polling shows Americans are overwhelming opposed to both a wall along the border and Trump's fake national emergency declaration.\n\nTrump's efforts \"will undermine U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,\" a group of 58 former security officials, including high-ranking officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations, recently wrote. Further, a group of almost two dozen former Republican members of Congress sent an open letter to current GOP lawmakers pleading with them to support the resolution to revoke the national emergency.\n\nTrump only declared a national emergency \u2014 to steal funding meant for other priorities \u2014 after Congress repeatedly, and pointedly, rejected his funding request for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House will vote on a measure to overturn Trump's fake national emergency. The measure is expected to pass, at which point the Senate will be forced to hold a vote on it.\n\nIn addition to those mentioned above, several other Republicans expressed concerns about Trump's power grab. The AP noted there are at least 11 Republican senators to keep an eye on in the coming weeks, more than enough to create a majority in the Senate rejecting Trump's declaration.\n\nTrump is desperate to keep his caucus in line so he won't face an embarrassing rebuke from Congress.\n\nIn the end, Republicans in the Senate will have a very simple choice: Succumb to Trump's intimidation tactics, or hold true to their oath to uphold the Constitution.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Instead of preparing for his meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Trump spent Monday morning rage-tweeting about asinine topics.\n\nTrump spent his Monday morning firing off inane tweets, because it's not like he has anything better to do, such as prepare for an important meeting with one of the world's most dangerous and reclusive dictators.\n\nIn fact, Trump rattled off six tweets before 8 a.m., on everything from Spike Lee's Academy Awards acceptance speech, to a lie about former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nThis came ahead of Trump's noon departure from the White House en route to Vietnam, where he'll hold a summit to try to convince Kim to denuclearize.\n\nThe first tweet came at 6:32 a.m., about Trump's fake \"emergency\" he declared at the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 which House Democrats will try to repeal this week.\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump tweeted about Lee's acceptance speech, in which Lee urged the country to \"mobilize\" ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\"Let's all be on the right side of history,\" Lee said Sunday night when accepting the Oscar for best adapted screenplay. \"Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let's do the right thing! You know I had to get that in there.\u201d\n\nTrump ludicrously claimed Lee's acceptance speech was a \"racist\" attack against him.\n\n\"Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nWe're not sure what's \"racist\" about Lee's tame speech. Talk about a complex ...\n\nAnd the tweets didn't stop there.\n\nTrump went on to urge OPEC to lower oil prices and tout his breakfast meeting with Republican governors before his trip to Vietnam to meet with Kim, who he insisted will make a \"wise decision\" to denuclearize after meeting with Trump.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nTrump then had to fire back at Reid, who told CNN that he wishes former President George W. Bush \u2014 whom Reid loudly criticized during the Bush presidency \u2014 were president over Trump \"every day.\"\n\nThat obviously hurt Trump's feelings, because he went on to tweet a lie about Reid after the interview was published.\n\n\"Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career,\" Trump tweeted. \"He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!\"\n\nOf course, Reid \u2014 who is currently battling pancreatic cancer \u2014 didn't get \"thrown out.\" He retired rather than run for re-election in 2016.\n\nLastly, Trump tweeted what seemed to be a warning to Senate Republicans, who will be forced to vote on whether to revoke Trump's emergency declaration \u2014 which Trump announced because he was mad Congress didn't give him the funding for his stupid wall.\n\n\"I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,\" Trump tweeted. \"Without strong Borders, we don't have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don't fall into the Democrats 'trap' of Open Borders and Crime!\"\n\nTrump's aides, who already fear Trump is going to do something stupid in the meeting, must be even more worried now that it's clear Trump is spending his time doing anything but prep for the North Korea summit.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a Fox News host on Sunday said the freshman Democrat's plan to pay her congressional staff a living wage was \"socialism and communism on display.\"\n\nThe comment came from \"Fox & Friends\" co-host Pete Hegseth, who was commenting on Ocasio-Cortez's plan to implement a starting wage of at least $52,000 in her office.\n\nOf course, every member of Congress gets a budget, called a Members\u2019 Representational Allowance (MRA), and can choose to allocate that budget as they see fit, including hiring up to 18 permanent employees. There's a maximum salary that staffers cannot earn more than, currently $168,411 annually in the House.\n\nHowever, the median salary for staffers on Capitol Hill is as low as $35,000 a year, the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call reported \u2014 a number that makes living in and around the expensive Washington, D.C., area a challenge.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has simply decided that she will start her staffers at a living wage of $52,000, and adjust how she uses the rest of her budget to adhere to the spending limit.\n\nNever one to shy away from responding to her critics, Ocasio-Cortez pointed to Hegseth's comment as yet another sign that Republicans will go to ridiculous lengths to vilify socialism.\n\n\"The GOP is so disconnected from the basic idea that people should be paid enough to live that Fox actually thinks me paying a living wage in my office is 'communism,'\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Monday morning. \"So the next time GOP screams 'socialist,' know that\u2019s their go-to attack for any common-sense, humane policy.\n\nThis is not the first time Republicans have tried and failed to go after Ocasio-Cortez, making themselves look ridiculous in the process.\n\nDuring the 2018 midterm campaign, Republicans tried to vilify Ocasio-Cortez for growing up in a \u2014 gasp \u2014 house with four walls in Westchester, New York, which they somehow claimed was hypocritical given that she advocated for social programs. Ocasio-Cortez swatted that attack down fast.\n\nRepublicans also circulated a video of Ocasio-Cortez dancing on a rooftop while she was a college student at Boston University \u2014 seemingly an attempt to embarrass her. What a nightmare, witnessing a college student being a college student! The attack ultimately backfired.\n\nIs seems Republicans are determined never to learn that their over-the-top attacks against Ocasio-Cortez are only fueling her rise.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The 11-page letter also asserts \"there is no factual basis\" for Trump to declare an emergency and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe bipartisan letter was signed by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, as well as other officials from both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nThe letter will be entered into the Congressional record and is intended to help provide evidence for the multiple lawsuits seeking to overturn the declaration, according to the Post.\n\nOn the same day, Politico obtained a letter from more than 20 former Republican members of Congress warning their GOP colleagues to \"resist efforts to surrender\" to Trump on the issue of a national emergency. \"Our oath is to put the country and its Constitution above everything, including party politics or loyalty to a president,\" the letter reminded Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nBoth letters were released a day before the House votes on a resolution to block Trump's fake emergency.\n\nIn an attempt to circumvent the will of Congress \u2014 and possibly the Constitution \u2014 Trump declared a national emergency so he could build a wall along the southern border after Congress repeatedly rejected his funding requests.\n\nTrump went to extreme lengths to try to bully, badger, and beg Congress to allocate $5.7 billion for a border wall.

Gabby Giffords \u2014 who resigned from Congress after she was shot in the head \u2014 with the headline 'Target Practice.'\n\nDangerous, disturbing, and despicable.\n\nThat's the only way to describe an article in the NRA's monthly magazine for March, which features an image of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Rep. Gabby Giffords \u2014 the Arizona Democrat who was shot in the head in 2011 \u2014 with a headline reading \"Target Practice.\"\n\nFred Guttenberg, the father of a teenager slain in a mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, nearly a year ago, tweeted that the NRA's article amounts to an \"incitement of violence.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said the NRA should \"face legal consequences\" for the article, which he also said was a \"call for violence.\"\n\nLeave it to Republicans, however, to come to the NRA's defense no matter what.\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), replied to Swalwell's tweet asking if he was \"deliberately lying\" or if he simply didn't read the article.\n\n\"The article is about legislation targeting gun owners, not the N.R.A. targeting Democrats,\" Crenshaw tweeted. \"If your goal is to ensure that \u2018outrage culture\u2019 is alive and well, continuing to divide us, congrats.\"\n\nOf course, the content of the article \u2014 written by the NRA's executive director, Chris Cox, about a bill Democrats plan to bring to a vote this week on expanding background checks for gun purchases \u2014 wasn't the issue.\n\nIt was the fact that the article was accompanied by a picture of Democratic lawmakers \u2014 including one who had already survived a bullet to her head \u2014 with the words \"target practice\" over it.\n\nThat sends a clear, violent message at a dangerous time. Just last week, a white supremacist terrorist was arrested for plotting to kill a list of Trump's political opponents, including Pelosi.\n\nTrump's friend and former adviser Roger Stone was also admonished by a federal judge last week for posting an Instagram photo featuring the judge's face with a crosshair over it, who pointed out that the violent imagery and implied threat was unmistakable.\n\nThe actual bill the NRA was complaining about in the article will mandate all gun buyers obtain a federal background check, even on private sales. The vast majority of Americans \u2014 at least 90 percent \u2014 consistently say they support these kinds of universal background checks.\n\nThe bill makes good on Democrats' promise to take action on the scourge of gun violence and mass shootings that have plagued the country for years \u2014 a position that's gained wide public support since the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, a little more than a year ago.\n\nBut the NRA, and the Republican Party, are so committed to extremism on guns that they don't care about what most Americans want \u2014 or about keeping American lawmakers safe from violence.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump has a long history of sexual assault and is an admitted sexual predator.\n\nJohnson told the Washington Post that Trump leaned in and tried to kiss her on the lips outside a campaign rally in August 2016. She turned her head and was given an unwanted kiss on the side of her mouth.\n\nTrump's actions were \"super-creepy and inappropriate,\" she said.\n\n\"I immediately felt violated because I wasn\u2019t expecting it or wanting it. I can still see his lips coming straight for my face,\" Johnson added.\n\nOn the day it happened, Johnson told her boyfriend, mother, and stepfather what had occurred and they confirmed her account with the Washington Post. The paper also confirmed that Johnson sent text messages to an attorney two months after the incident discussing the possibility of legal action.\n\nJohnson is suing Trump for damages stemming from emotional pain and suffering. Her lawsuit also says that the Trump campaign discriminated against Johnson, who is black, by paying her less than her white counterparts who were similarly employed. Trump has a long history of personal racism, which has manifested itself in a series of racist comments and policies within the presidency.\n\nJohnson told the paper she started considering coming forward after the October 2016 release of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording, in which Trump infamously bragged about grabbing women \"by the pussy\" and getting away with it.\n\n\"You know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful \u2014 I just start kissing them,\" Trump said. \"It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab \u2019em by the pussy. You can do anything.\"\n\nThat, according to the suit, is exactly what Trump did to Johnson: grabbing her and kissing her without waiting for her consent.\n\n\"You want to move on with your life,\" Johnson said. \"I don\u2019t sleep. I wake up at 4 in the morning looking at the news. I feel guilty. The only thing I did was show up for work one day,\" she said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders denied the allegation, calling it \"absurd on its face.\" However, Sanders has a long and sordid history of lying about multiple issues in defense of Trump. And given Trump's own admission of assaulting women, one more accusation against him is not necessarily absurd at all.\n\nTrump has been credibly accused by multiple women of sexual assault and inappropriate sexual contact. He has made sexual comments about underage girls, and been accused of groping women. He has also defended other powerful men with patterns of sexual abuse, including Bill O'Reilly and Roger Ailes.\n\nWhile all of the facts are not yet know, it would be hard for Trump\u2019s defenders to claim he would never do such a thing \u2014 to Johnson or anyone else \u2014 when he has already admitted he has.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans prioritized rich banks over working families when they wrote the GOP tax scam.\n\nColorado resident Isadora Bielsky was recently brought to tears when she learned that, rather than getting a refund, she owed $8,000 in taxes this year, thanks to the GOP tax scam.\n\nBut while Republicans punish folks like Bielsky, federal data shows U.S. banks ended 2018 with $28.8 billion in extra profit because of the same Republican tax bill.\n\nBanks saw their profits soar by more than $70 billion over 2017 levels, but the $28.8 billion was solely because of goodies and kickbacks Republicans inserted into the tax bill, which passed Congress in late 2017 without a single vote from a Democrat.\n\nWhile Republicans lavished breaks on wealthy corporations, many families are now learning that the GOP left them out in the cold.\n\n\"I don't know who it's helping, but it's not helping the middle class,\" a single mother told one Massachusetts television station. She had just learned that she would be getting a significantly lower tax refund this year than she expected.\n\nBut the tax law is greatly benefiting certain segments of America: banks and wealthy corporations. Amazon made $11.2 billion profit, but rather than pay any taxes, they filed for a $129 million refund. Other corporations like Goodyear, Netflix, and U.S. Steel each made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits, and each is seeking a tax refund.\n\nWhen they set to work revising the tax code, Republicans did all they could to favor the wealthy and powerful. Trump and his congressional allies slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, and kept plenty of loopholes to further reduce corporate tax burdens. But for families, Republicans made sure 80 percent of the benefits from their plan eventually flow to the richest one percent of families.\n\nThe issue for working families is exacerbated because of new tax withholding rules in the GOP tax scam. When Republicans bragged about bigger paychecks last year \u2014 even highlighting a woman who would only take home an additional $1.50 per week \u2014 they failed to mention that the new withholding rules would impact tax refunds this April.\n\nEven for taxpayers like Bielsky who tried to do everything right, the GOP tax scam managed to pack a financial wallop. Bielsky has a Ph.D. in neuroscience, and her husband is a doctor.

    "text": "Republicans in North Carolina tried to steal an election through massive election fraud, and Trump's response was a conspiracy theory-laden rant full of lies.\n\nAsked to respond to the devastating GOP election fraud in North Carolina, Trump launched into a litany of bogus stories, none of which have any evidence to back up Trump's outlandish claims.\n\nHe accused California and Texas of voter fraud. He said one million fraudulent votes had recently been discovered, though he didn't say where, and there are certainly no reports anywhere in the news of such a thing.\n\nHe complained about the vote recount in last year's Florida elections. And, after more than a minute of angry ranting, he insisted that he wanted to see a \"final report\" on North Carolina \u2014 despite the unanimous vote by the North Carolina election board calling for the first congressional election do-over in 44 years due to the overwhelming evidence of election fraud.\n\n\"I condemn any election fraud,\" Trump said, starting his answer on solid ground. But then things went off the rails.\n\nWhen I look at what's happened in California, with the votes, when I look at what happened \u2014 as you know, there was just a case where they found a million fraudulent votes, when I look at what's happened in Texas \u2014 excuse me, excuse me \u2014 when I look at what's happened in Texas, when I look at that catastrophe that took place in Florida, where the Republican candidates kept getting less and less and less and less, and fortunately Rick Scott and Ron ended up winning their election, but it was disgraceful what happened there. So I look at a lot of different places all over the country. I condemn any voter fraud of any kind, whether it's Democrat or Republican. But when you look at some of the things that happened in California, in particular, when you look at what's happened in Texas, where some of those votes that they recently found were not exactly properly done \u2014 I condemn all of it. And that includes North Carolina, if anything, you know \u2014 I guess they're going to be doing a final report, but I'd like to see the final report. But any form of election fraud, I condemn.\n\nOn the subject of North Carolina, the original question, evidence of election fraud is so damning that even the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, admitted a new election was necessary.\n\nAfter the board made its ruling, North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin issued a statement saying, \"This saga could only have ended in a new election, and we look forward to repairing the harm dealt by Republicans and giving the people of the Ninth district the representative they deserve.\"\n\nAs for the other states Trump weighed in on, there is a thin veneer of reality surrounding a litany of unhinged conspiracy theories. For example, an election did, in fact, happen in California in November 2018. But there is no evidence of voter fraud or election fraud whatsoever.\n\nThere is ample evidence, however, that Republican candidates up and down the ballot suffered devastating losses. Democrats won all statewide offices, super-majorities in both state chambers of the legislature, and ousted seven Republicans from the House of Representatives.\n\nTrump may want to lie to himself to sooth his bruised ego after such an undeniable rejection of him and his policies, but his baseless accusations about fraud don't match what really happened.\n\nThe same is true for Florida. Trump was not the only Republican outraged at the idea that every voter had the right to have their ballot counted. After all the ballots were counted, Republicans narrowly won the races for senator and governor, but Trump's allegations of fraud are completely baseless.\n\nIn Texas, state officials made headlines by making wild accusations of possible widespread voter registration fraud. But days after the alarming allegations, officials were already walking back their claims, admitting they exaggerated the extent of their claims. The state is now facing multiple lawsuits.\n\nTrump frequently tells tall tales of supposed \"voter fraud\" to try to explain Republican losses. But when it comes to a very real case of a Republican campaign committing fraud to steal a congressional seat, Trump shrugs it off, claims he needs further evidence before rushing to judgment, and resorts to outrageous lies about fraud that doesn't exist.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The crisis sits in the Oval Office. It is high time for Congress to deal with that crisis.\"\n\nTrump routinely disrespects our military by using service members and their families as political props for his own ends. This has included needlessly sending thousands of troops to the southern border, where many had nothing to do but shovel horse manure and were forced to spend the holiday season away from their families.\n\nTo distract from public opposition to his wall fiasco, Trump is once again demanding absurd, unnecessary sacrifices from our men and women in uniform and their families \u2014 and likely violating the Constitution to do it.\n\nAnd veterans are refusing to stay silent while Trump inflicts more wounds on our warriors and our democracy.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Kristi Noem.\n\nTrump's reckless, unnecessary trade war continues to wreak economic havoc nationwide \u2014 and even some red state governors have had enough.\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, said that Trump's trade policies have been ruinous to her state's economy.\n\n\"South Dakota has been devastated by the trade wars that are going on,\" Noem told Politico. Agriculture is \"by far\" the largest industry in the state, she noted.\n\nTrump's trade war with China and Mexico has resulted in those countries levying retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like soybeans and wheat, which has been especially hard on farmers.\n\nIn an economy that centers around agriculture, Noem said, what's bad for farmers is also bad for \"every main street business, everybody that has another entity out there that relies on a successful ag industry.\"\n\nShe added that Trump's policies are \"driving a lot of family businesses out of business.\"\n\nSouth Dakota isn't the only place where farmers are feeling the pain of Trump's extended trade war. According to the Wall Street Journal, farmers in the Midwest are filing for bankruptcy at record rates.\n\nAnd agriculture is not the only industry suffering from Trump's poor choices. One analysis shows the United States could lose up to 2.2 million jobs over the next few years if Trump continues with his reckless policies and threats on trade.\n\nThe same analysis showed the trade war will cost the average family almost $2,400 per year, as a wide variety of everyday items become more expensive.\n\nUnfortunately, the White House's response is not reassuring.\n\n\"There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have sales in China that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with China,\" Kevin Hassett, who chairs Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN in January.\n\nWhile she is unhappy at the moment about what Trump is doing to South Dakota, Noem hasn't always been so critical of him. In fact, she was one of Trump's most loyal enablers before she became governor. She spent the previous two years as a member of the House of Representatives, where she backed the Trump agenda more than 92 percent of the time.\n\nEven as she complained about the suffering Trump has visited on her state, Noem could not stop herself from sticking up for Trump. She said that she thinks the United States has been treated unfairly in international trade, and that \"they [the White House] recognize that and want to have better trade agreements.\"\n\nYet in the end, farmers, businesses, and families are the ones being treated unfairly thanks to what Noem helped Trump sow.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Maybe that's why he is so mad that two openly LGBTQ politicians were named to leadership roles in the legislature \u2014 likely the event that triggered his Twitter poll.\n\nWhen called out on his behavior, Beaty defended himself by citing Trump.\n\n\"I pretty much only do what President Donald Trump does relative to his social media postings,\" Beaty said. \"If it is good enough for our president, whom I support 100 percent, then it is good enough for me as well.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has been incredibly hostile to LGBTQ Americans, and Trump's hateful Twitter habits have emboldened bigots of all kinds.\n\nSometimes that bigotry turns violent. The number of hate groups is now at a record high in the Trump era, and right-wing violence is on the rise.\n\nBeaty is mostly a garden-variety Trump-worshipping \"Proud Deplorable\" who just happens to hold a minor elected office. He attacks other politicians by calling them things like \"wimp\" and \"snowflake,\" and goes after people like David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland school shootings. Beaty describes this behavior as part of his own \"brand.\"\n\nBut Beaty also isn't just your average right-wing blowhard. He served 14 months in federal prison for threatening to kill then-President George H.W. Bush and then-Sen. Ted Kennedy back in 1991.\n\nMany local politicians have either called for Beaty to step down, demanded he apologize, or apologized themselves for his behavior. The chair of the Barnstable County Board of Regional Commissioners, Ronald Bergstrom, posted a note on the official county website apologizing for Beaty's comments and saying his views don't represent the views of the county. Even Republican members of the Massachusetts legislature called for him to step down.\n\nRather than address the issue or apologize, however, Beaty decided to whine on Twitter about how his First Amendment rights are under attack and call liberal Democrats \"pinheads.\"\n\nIn doing so, he shows he doesn't understand the First Amendment. He's not being silenced by the government; he\u2019s just finding out that there may be consequences for what he says. And as far as the pinheads comment \u2014 well, that\u2019s just Trump-esque.\n\nHowever, protestations about the First Amendment aside, he did memory hole the offending tweet.

Turns out nobody actually wanted that.\n\nBack in 2017, it looked like Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. had hit upon yet another way to exploit their name and their father's office: building budget hotels in red states that backed Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nHowever, it doesn't look like that plan is going to work out for them \u2014 perhaps because no one is all that enthusiastic about the prospect of more Trump hotels.\n\nThings looked rosy for the Trump sons in 2017 when they hatched a plan to open a chain of hotels called \"American IDEA.\" There was a splashy launch that had what the New York Times called \"a patriotic flair,\" and the name was designed to evoke Trump's \"America First\" campaign slogan. There was also going to be a chain called \"Scion.\"\n\nBoth those chains, at least at this point, are no more. Eric and Donald Jr. have indefinitely suspended plans for the chains.\n\nThey're trying to spin this as somehow the fault of Democrats, with Eric Trump issuing a statement grousing about how \"everything will be used against us, whether by the fake news or by Democrats who are only interested in presidential harassment and wasting everyone\u2019s time, barraging us with nonsense letters.\u201d\n\nWith typical Trumpian overblown rhetoric, he went on to say it was fine if the Trumps had to slow down their growth for a bit, because they \"already have the greatest properties in the world.\"\n\nIf they really were the greatest properties, perhaps there wouldn't be such widespread opposition to anything associated with Trump. Proposed hotels in red-state cities like Dallas and St. Louis met with local opposition, not sabotage from Democrats.\n\nAdditionally, the Trump name isn't nearly as desirable as his sons might wish it to be. In both New York and Toronto, it was so bad for business that the Trump name actually got removed from hotels there.\n\nThat pales in comparison to what happened with Trump's hotel in Panama, though. Owners of hotel rooms in the Trump Panama Hotel called the situation a \"financial bloodbath\" because no one wants to go to Trump hotels.\n\nDemocrats and the media aren't the ones who turned the Trump name toxic; the Trumps did that all by themselves. But the brothers are right about one thing: They're not going to be able to escape scrutiny now that the Democrats hold the House.

The charges are being designed so they would not overlap with the federal charges and convictions already hanging over Manafort.\n\nBecause they are state and not federal charges, Trump's pardon powers would be useless. And if Manafort were convicted of those crimes, Bloomberg notes he would \"face confinement in notoriously tough prisons.\"\n\nAs Trump's campaign chairman, Manafort shepherded Trump through earning the Republican nomination and rolling out his general election campaign at the GOP's 2016 convention.\n\nIn August 2018, Manafort was convicted on eight felony counts \u2014 five counts of tax fraud, one count of failing to file a foreign bank account report, and two counts of bank fraud \u2014 that stemmed from work he did on behalf of several pro-Russian strongmen, with a heavy focus on Ukrainian politics.\n\nManafort later pleaded guilty to two other felonies, conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice, in a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign's involvement with related Russian operatives.\n\nBut the plea deal was revoked, and even more charges were filed, because Mueller's team discovered Manafort had lied to federal officials.\n\nThere are also indications that after his conviction and subsequent guilty pleas, Manafort was feeding information back to Trump. During this time period Trump baselessly claimed to have inside information on the investigation, and wildly alleged that investigators were treating people \"horribly and viciously.\"\n\nEven before the convictions, Trump had been making noise about pardoning Manafort. He has characterized his friend's prosecution as part of a \"witch hunt\" and wrote, \"I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family.\"\n\nA Trump pardon would have been an escape hatch for Manafort to pull himself out of the complicated knot he has tied himself up in thanks to his criminal behavior.\n\nBut the district attorney of New York County has thrown a wrench in that plan \u2014 and now even if Manafort's man in the White House intervenes on his behalf, the consummate Trump insider will continue to be in very big legal trouble.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Once engaged, Trump bumbled around in full view of the entire world, saluting North Korea's abusive military, glad-handing with Kim, and ignoring human rights abuses.\n\nTrump went on to abandon joint military exercises with America's close ally, South Korea, a concession to the North, while receiving nothing in exchange. Trump then proclaimed that North Korea had denuclearized, while in fact they continue to pursue nuclear weapons and the technology to use those weapons against other nations \u2014 including America.\n\nCongress recently called out Trump for his diplomatic misfires and his insistence on keeping his dealings with the regime a secret, without allowing America's elected leaders to engage in oversight of his actions as the Constitution empowers them to do.\n\nTrump has failed America on North Korea and has set himself up to fail yet again, endangering the world. With that backdrop, the White House wants Trump to get credit for international diplomacy.\n\nBecause he had a meeting.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Bob Kraft gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nBob Kraft, a longtime Trump friend who donated $1 million to his inaugural committee, has been charged with soliciting prostitution.\n\nKraft is the multimillionaire owner of the New England Patriots, and was one of at least 25 people who were charged on Friday as part of a months-long human trafficking investigation. Kraft has been charged with two counts of solicitation and was a patron of the Orchids of Asia Day Spa.\n\nPolice say the spa played a role in human trafficking that spanned from China to Florida. According to officers, the women involved in the human trafficking ring were given no days off and averaged about 1,500 men per year. Their hygiene was described as \"minimal.\"\n\nPolice say there is video evidence documenting Kraft's alleged criminal acts. His spokesperson denied the allegations.\n\nTrump has often cited the prevention of human trafficking as one of the reasons his racist border wall should be built \u2014 but experts believe it will do little to stop such criminal acts, and say Trump doesn't understand the realities of human trafficking.\n\nKraft has been a friend of Trump's for an extremely long time.\n\nAfter Trump won the election, Kraft donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee. When many athletes were boycotting Trump's White House over his racism, Kraft and the Patriots visited him after their 2017 Super Bowl win.\n\n\"Bob has been my friend for a long time,\" Trump said at the ceremony.\n\nKraft returned the favor, calling Trump a \"very good friend\" and \"somebody whose mental toughness and strength I greatly admire.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly praised Kraft on his Twitter feed, dating all the way back to 2012.\n\n\"Never bet against Bob Kraft, Bill Belichick or Tom Brady!\" Trump wrote. He described Kraft as \"my friend,\" and in January congratulated Kraft and the Patriots for qualifying for the Super Bowl.\n\nTrump can attribute some of his political successes to his friendship with Kraft.\n\nOn the eve of the 2016 presidential primary in Massachusetts, Kraft released a statement praising Trump. He said he was \"a very close friend of mine for over two decades,\" and that the two men \"have had a lot of fun together socially\" and have worked together on \"a number of philanthropic events.\"\n\nThe Boston Globe noted that Trump \"has been a frequent guest\" of Kraft's at the Patriots' stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, \"with photos showing him on the field, in the owner\u2019s box, and in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter the boost from Kraft, Trump went on to win the Massachusetts primary with 49.3 percent of the vote.\n\nKraft isn't the only friend of Trump's to face charges related to prostitution. Trump was also longtime friends with Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 who, despite allegedly trafficking and raping hundreds of underage girls, managed to spend just 13 months in jail on prostitution charges thanks to a sweetheart deal from Alex Acosta, who now serves as Trump's Secretary of Labor.\n\nAnd Kraft now joins a long roster of other prominent figures connected to Trump \u2014 including Trump himself \u2014 who have been involved in serious allegations of lawbreaking.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The move would leave many low-income patients with nowhere else to go for affordable birth control and sexual health screenings.\n\nThe Trump administration is one step closer to achieving its long-sought goal of gutting Planned Parenthood's federal funding, which would needlessly hamper access to quality medical care for millions of women and men.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services on Friday announced a radical policy change that could strip funds and block more than 4 million patients from receiving care \u2014 including 1.6 million who go to Planned Parenthood health centers \u2014 in order to send that money to faith-based health care organizations that are anti-abortion.\n\nHHS made the rule change without studying the rule's full impact. House and Senate Democrats strongly objected to HHS's rushed process \u2014 but their request for caution and measured analysis fell on deaf ears.\n\nThe rule changes Title X, the only federal program dedicated to making sure low-income Americans can get affordable family planning services, by blocking its funding from going to health care providers that either perform abortions or give their patients referrals to get abortions elsewhere.\n\nIt's effectively a gag rule that prevents doctors from offering their patients all of the medical advice they have to give \u2014 and seeks to hamper women from receiving the abortions they are legally allowed to obtain.\n\nTitle X funds already can't be used for abortion; they cover other family planning services like contraception and sexual health screenings. Planned Parenthood serves 41 percent of the 4 million people who rely on Title X for this reproductive health care, most of whom are people of color under 30.\n\nAnd because Planned Parenthood serves a lot more patients and offers more services than many other Title X providers, kicking the organization out of Title X would leave many low-income patients with nowhere else to go.\n\nDr. Leana Wen, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the gag rule \"unconscionable and unethical.\"\n\n\"Patients expect their doctors to speak honestly with them, to answer their questions, to help them in their time of need,\" Wen said in a statement. \"Imagine if the Trump administration prevented doctors from talking to our patients with diabetes about insulin. It would never happen. Reproductive health care should be no different. Reproductive health care is health care and health care is a basic human right.\"\n\nIlyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, similarly bashed the Trump administration's dangerous new rule.\n\n\"Trump\u2019s gag rule creates a country where a culture of forced silence dominates over women\u2019s health, barring them from accessing the essential care they deserve; a country where women can\u2019t continue to visit their trusted providers for healthcare; a country where doctors will be forced to hide information from patients,\" Hogue said in a statement.\n\nThe new rule is almost certain to be challenged in the courts.\n\nHowever, a similar change to Title X during former President Ronald Reagan's administration was upheld by the Supreme Court. The only reason the changes weren't implemented was because former President Bill Clinton's administration scrapped the rule after its implementation was repeatedly delayed.\n\nTrump's relentless quest to deny women their basic rights to health care and bodily autonomy continues on.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta violated the law to help a serial child predator \u2014 but his job with Trump is perfectly safe for now.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal judge ruled that Trump's secretary of labor, Alex Acosta, violated the law when he facilitated a lenient plea deal for a serial child sexual predator. But as of now, Trump isn't planning to fire Acosta. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump is \"looking into\" the matter and that is \"not aware of any changes\" in Trump's confidence in Acosta.\n\nThe ruling stems from a 2007 plea deal that Acosta, then a U.S. attorney, struck with Jeffrey Epstein, a Florida billionaire accused of molesting \u2014 and in at least one case, raping \u2014 more than 80 young women and underage girls. The case received renewed attention after a blockbuster investigation by the Miami Herald late last year uncovered the extent to which Acosta bent over backward to go easy on a child molester.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal Acosta negotiated, Epstein served only 13 months in county jail on two reduced charges of soliciting prostitution.\n\nNow, as head of the Labor Department, Acosta is in charge of U.S. policy regarding sex trafficking.\n\nDistrict Judge Kenneth A. Marra ruled Acosta violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, a law giving victims the right to know about significant events in their cases. While Acosta and his team spent hours and hours working on the plea deal with Epstein, he kept Epstein's victims in the dark. According to the judge, Acosta and his fellow prosecutors tried \"to conceal the existence\" of the plea deal \"and mislead the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.\"\n\nWhile the case and allegations are horrific, Trump has long known Epstein and had nothing but wonderful things to say about him in the past.\n\nIn 2002, Trump called Epstein \"terrific guy,\" and \"a lot of fun to be with.\"\n\n\"It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side,\" Trump added.\n\nTrump's refusal to fire Acosta for being lenient on a child rapist fits a disturbing pattern regarding Trump's view of women survivors of sexual abuse. Trump enthusiastically embraced Roy Moore in a 2017 Senate race, even after Moore was credibly accused of being a child predator. The following year, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, and defended him after credible allegations surfaced that he once attempted to rape someone at a high school party.\n\nThen again, Trump himself bragged about being a serial sexual predator, laughing about \"grabbing women by the pussy\" and getting away with it.\n\nAfter the Miami Herald investigation, more than a dozen lawmakers sent a letter to the Department of Justice demanding an investigation into the plea deal. Earlier this month, the department opened an investigation, but it will be limited in scope and led by the Office of Professional Responsibility. The Washington Post notes that the investigation may drag on so long that Alex Acosta may not be in government service by the time it concludes.\n\nBut given Trump's reluctance to stand up for the victims of sexual exploitation, it looks like Acosta could stay in place for quite some time.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Maryland's Republican governor says the Republican National Committee is shielding Trump from primary challengers.\n\nMaryland's Republican Gov. Larry Hogan is furious with his own party, which he says has taken an \"unprecedented\" and \"undemocratic\" step to block Trump from facing primary challengers in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it, and I\u2019ve been involved in the Republican Party for most of my life. It\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d Hogan told Politico's Alex Isenstadt in an article published Thursday afternoon. \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s not the way we should be going about our politics.\u201d\n\nHogan may also have a personal stake here, since he's mulling whether to challenge Trump in a 2020 primary. But it's true that the RNC has already pledged to give Trump its \"undivided support\" in 2020, unanimously passing a resolution on the matter at the RNC's winter meeting in January.\n\nSome Republicans are even considering plans to cancel primary contests in their states to protect Trump.\n\n\"It's very undemocratic,\" Hogan said. \"And the question is, what are they afraid of? Because on the one hand you look at polls, 70 percent of Republicans support the president in a primary. Why are they so concerned? Why the puffing out the chest?\"\n\nIt's a good question.\n\nWhat are Republicans so afraid of?\n\nMaybe it's that they know their policy proposals \u2014 like slashing taxes for the richest and screwing the working class by taking away their health care \u2014 aren't popular, and believe that Trump's cult of personality is their only saving grace in 2020.\n\nBut that seems short-sighted, given that Trump's base is shrinking. His base is roughly 35 to 40 percent of the electorate, according to FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver \u2014 not nearly enough to win him a nationwide election.\n\nYet Republicans capitulate to that base, fearful that Trump's wrath could turn members of their already shrinking party against them.\n\nIt's a catch-22 that no one should envy. But that's what the GOP got themselves into when they hitched their wagon to the Trump Train.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump loves to make up ridiculous stories about fake voter fraud \u2014 but he has nothing to say about a real case of massive election fraud carried out by Republicans in North Carolina.\n\nDespite what Trump says, millions undocumented immigrants did not vote in the 2016 presidential election. Nor did \"missing or forged\" ballots mysteriously appear to hurt Republicans in Florida's 2018 Senate race. And there was definitely nobody who voted once in 2018, then put on a disguise in order to vote again.\n\nBut there was a case of rampant election fraud in 2018 \u2014 and it was carried out by Republicans in North Carolina's 9th District congressional race. It was so bad that the state's board of elections declined to certify the results and called for an entirely new election \u2014 the first time that's happened in 44 years.\n\nAnd even though Trump loves talking about fake stories of non-existent voter fraud, he's been deafeningly silent about the one real case of election fraud uncovered in decades. He hasn't issued a single comment about it.\n\nSo why isn't Trump talking about such a prominent real, not made-up, case of election fraud?\n\nIt's likely because North Carolina's fraud doesn't fit neatly into his attempt to fear-monger and appeal to the GOP base's racist underbelly by making up phony stories about undocumented immigrants and people of color trying to steal elections from Republicans.\n\nLet's take a look at the facts of the North Carolina case:\n\nRepublican Mark Harris personally sought out the services of known fraudster and convicted felon McCrae Dowless, who ran an illegal absentee ballot campaign in which he harvested mail-in ballots and even filled in ballots for people \u2014 both of which are illegal.\n\nHarris' own son, a lawyer, warned him about hiring Dowless, whom he believed was running an illegal ballot operation. Yet Harris ignored the warnings and hired him anyway.\n\nAt a hearing before the North Carolina State Board of Elections on Thursday, under questioning from a lawyer hired by the Democratic candidate in the race, Harris ended up calling for a new election rather than face difficult questions about what he knew about Dowless' operation and when he knew it. Harris claimed that an illness had left him with memory loss, but that the hearing until that point had convinced him a new election was needed to ensure the public trust in the outcome.\n\nLet's make something perfectly clear, though.\n\nThe case in North Carolina is not \"voter fraud.\" Voters did nothing wrong here. They were the ones exploited by the GOP-led effort to harvest ballots.\n\nInstead, this is election fraud, in which someone tied to Harris' campaign defrauded voters to try to steal an election.\n\nBut that narrative does nothing to help Trump's quest to build support for draconian voter ID laws that disenfranchise voters who don't support Republican candidates.\n\nAnd so Trump has done everything he can to avoid drawing attention to this case. Instead, he's tweeting about Jussie Smollett, pretending that his wall is already being built, and trying to claim he's been exonerated in the Russia investigation when he most certainly has not.\n\nIt's as cynical as it gets.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The lie is the latest humiliation for Trump, who has been repeatedly denied the ability to waste billions in tax dollars on the racist vanity project.\n\nTrump posted video of the fence repair with the caption, \"We have just built this powerful Wall in New Mexico. Completed on January 30, 2019 \u2013 47 days ahead of schedule! Many miles more now under construction!\"\n\nIn a subsequent, lying, all-caps tweet he added, \"THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW!\"\n\nThe video is footage of a repair procedure from Sept. 18, 2018.

That's a fact that continues to frustrate him and a prime example of his political impotence.\n\nHis attempt to get American taxpayers to pony up billions for the wall, after he promised for years that Mexico would \"pay for it,\" led to him shutting down the government.\n\nAmericans revolted at the unnecessary event and the hardship it created for thousands of federal workers.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi forced Trump to reopen the government and he eventually had to sign legislation that funded the government and avoided a shutdown without wasting money on the wall.\n\nTrump has now been reduced to declaring a phony \"national emergency\" to waste existing government funds on the wall, a tactic that prompted immediate legal challenges from multiple states.\n\nBased on tweets like the fraudulent one touting wall construction and signs at his unhinged rallies that now proclaim \"finish the wall,\" the Trump tactic now appears to be a concerted attempt to claim the wall is in progress.\n\nLike nearly everything else Trump has said and done, it is a lie.\n\nThere's no wall being built, no wall to be finished, and no wall \"under construction.\"\n\nThe only \"wall\" being built is the wall of lies and deception surrounding Trump's presidency.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

A new class action arbitration claim could make all of those go away.\n\nA former Trump campaign staffer is trying to void the nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements she was required to sign to work on the campaign, which would allow her to speak out about what happened during that time.\n\nBut she's not just seeking to void her own agreements. Instead, she's filed a class action arbitration claim to get them tossed for everyone else who worked on the campaign, too.\n\nJessica Denson worked for the Trump campaign beginning in August 2016. To be allowed to work on the campaign, she had to sign both a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) and a nondisparagement agreement. NDAs prevent you from disclosing any confidential information you learn while working for a company or person. A nondisparagement agreement prevents you from saying anything bad about that company or person. Trump demanded his campaign workers sign both.\n\nDenson has been trying to void her NDA for quite some time because that's the only way she can move forward with a lawsuit against the campaign for what she alleges was verbal and sexual harassment by a supervisor. Those claims need to be pursued in court \u2014 but by trying to do so, Denson triggered the remedy in the NDA, which was to have the Trump campaign take her to arbitration and win a nearly $50,000 judgment against her for bringing the lawsuit.\n\nNow, she's hit upon a clever way to draw attention to her ongoing problem while also undermining all the NDAs and nondisparagement agreements campaign workers were asked to sign. If Denson had continued to fight about this via arbitration, those proceedings would be secret, because individual arbitration claims are confidential. But class action arbitration claims are public.\n\nDenson says the NDA she was required to sign was much too broad, and that appears to be the case even for an NDA issued by a private corporation. Basically, it bars her from making legal claims of any sort.\n\nBut there was an additional wrinkle once Trump became president. Trump is now part of the government, and any attempts he makes to enforce an NDA can be said to be an action by a government actor. Government actors generally can't prevent people from speaking out, particularly on matters of public concern.\n\nIt's no secret Trump is a big fan of NDAs. Two adult film actresses \u2014 Stormy Daniels and Jessica Drake \u2014 were bound by nondisclosure agreements barring them from talking about their affairs with Trump. Trump has also made noise about enforcing NDAs against not one, but two, former White House advisers who have written tell-all books about him: Cliff Sims and Omarosa Manigault Newman.\n\nIt appears that Trump just took the NDAs he used as a private businessman and tried to graft them onto government employment. It's pretty clear that those can't be valid, because you can't bar federal employees from speaking out about non-classified material after their federal employment has ended.\n\nSo, it's likely the NDAs that White House staffers and others have had to sign are invalid.\n\nAnd just think of all the things we could learn if Denson can get all the other campaign staff NDAs voided as well.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Thanks to Trump, $500 million meant for school construction projects is at risk.\n\nOn Wednesday, reports indicate that more than $500 million meant for much-needed school construction are in jeopardy because it could be taken to build Trump's racist border wall.\n\nMilitary families in Kentucky were looking forward to turning former Fort Campbell High School into a new middle school. The $62 million project aimed to have the refurbished school ready in time for the 2020-2021 school year, while the children of military personnel currently sit crammed into an older school in need of repair.\n\nBut, according to an analysis from the House Appropriations Committee, Trump could put that money toward building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as part of the $3.6 billion Trump said he would take from military construction for his wall construction.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) apparently has no problem depriving military kids of much-needed schools. \"It would be better for middle school kids in Kentucky to have a secure border,\" Graham said on ABC's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. Graham, whose home state of South Carolina is ranked 42 in the nation in education, added, \"We'll get them the school they need\" without providing any evidence or details.\n\n\"Politicians' statements that these military dependents will eventually get the new school they desperately need ring hollow,\" Gary Hritz, spokesman for the Federal Education Association, told Ed Week. \"These students and their families sacrifice enough. They should not be asked to sacrifice their learning environment any longer.\"\n\nAnd it is not just military families in the United States who could suffer. Ed Week reports that U.S. military bases in Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom could face cuts to their school construction budget so Trump can build a wall.\n\nThe idea does not sit well with veterans, either.\n\n\"The number of projects for military families that could potentially be cut is horrifying, but what's even more horrifying is that this is clearly an unconstitutional power grab by Donald Trump,\" Will Fischer, an Iraq War veteran and the director of government relations for VoteVets, told Shareblue Media.\n\n\"Maybe the president and his enablers figure that the fewer schools there are, the fewer kids will be able to learn that,\" Fischer added.\n\nOver the years, Trump seems to have no problem forcing members of the military to endure more sacrifices than necessary. In the run-up to the 2018 midterm election, Trump hyped a made-up crisis at the southern border and ordered thousands of troops there. Trump kept them there through the holidays, away from their families, even though there was so little to do that some were reduced to shoveling horse manure.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for the border wall. Instead, Trump may end up forcing the children of those serving our country to pay the price.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But now these states are crying foul at Trump's latest attempt to circumvent the will of Congress.\n\nTrump shut down the government for 35 days demanding Congress pay a $5.7 billion ransom to build wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats scoffed at the idea, forcing Trump to repeatedly cave on his demands.\n\nAfter Trump signed a long-term government funding bill, he declared a national emergency along the border, promising to steal money from military projects to build a wall.\n\nHis actions are nothing more than a tantrum, according to North Carolina's WRAL.\n\nA common theme through these and other editorials in red states is Trump's massive and unconstitutional power grab. Whether lambasted as \"executive overreach\" or \"an end-run around the Constitution,\" red-state editors called out Trump's fake national emergency as an attempt to undermine the very fabric of America's democracy.\n\n\"American presidents have repeatedly called national emergencies to protect democracy,\" writes the Houston Chronicle. \"Donald Trump may become the first to do it to undermine democracy \u2014 on our very own soil.\"\n\nEven the conservative Wall Street Journal criticized Trump's decision, calling it a \"misuse of the emergency power delegated by Congress, which is meant for genuine security crises, not to fulfill a campaign promise.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is already planning on using her levers of power to stop Trump. But will Republicans put the good of the country ahead of Trump's lust for power?\n\n\"If not them, who?\" asks the Salt Lake City Tribune. \"If not now, when?\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And because Trump has decided to bypass the traditional ethical guidelines followed by past presidents, some portion of that money will find its way into his personal accounts.\n\nGreat America Committee, which is led by Pence, spent $36,256.40 at the hotel between December 2018 and January 2019.\n\nThe payoff is a classic example of \"how to curry favor with your boss,\" noted Dave Levinthal of the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nOverall the Pence PAC has spent at least $160,605.60 at the hotel, which has become a central hub for funneling money to Trump.\n\nBecause Trump has neither sold his interests in the Trump Organization nor set up a blind trust, money spent at the hotel finds its way back into his personal accounts.\n\nThe money from Pence's PAC will travel the same corrupt pipeline as similar spending from the Republican National Committee, other Republican campaigns, foreign governments, and private businesses.\n\nThe relationship between Trump and Pence has often seemed dicey, and Pence's decision to set up a separate \"leadership PAC\" distinct from the Trump reelection campaign was unusual.\n\nPence has been assembling what appeared to be a shadow campaign for the presidency that could swoop in if Trump was unable to finish his term. Pence has also repeatedly tried to distance himself from the many scandals in the Trump administration, though evidence shows him playing a central role in the rampant corruption.\n\nBut while Pence's PAC was spending all that money at the D.C. hotel, Trump began telling his closest advisors that he wants Pence on the ticket with him after all.\n\nWith Trump there is rarely any certainty or consistency \u2014 but Pence's continued contributions to Trump's personal bottom line certainly don't hurt his chances to stay on the ticket.\n\nThis kind of quid-pro-quo wouldn't even be the most blatantly corrupt element of Trump's presidency, in which rules, laws, and ethical traditions have often been disregarded.\n\nThe Pence PAC has emerged as yet another way of improperly adding to Trump's wealth, corrupting the institution of the vice presidency alongside the presidency.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Christopher Paul Hasson.\n\nHasson is accused of plotting to carry out a mass terror attack, targeting \"a list of prominent Democratic congressional leaders, activists, political organizations, and MSNBC and CNN media personalities\u201d that Trump has publicly feuded with, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nThe news of Hasson's arrest broke Wednesday afternoon \u2014 but there was still nary a peep from Trump about it by noon on Thursday.\n\nTrump has, however, tweeted about the arrest of actor Jussie Smollett, who is accused of staging a hate crime in which he claimed Trump supporters attacked him and hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him.\n\n\".@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?\" Trump tweeted Thursday morning, soon after news of Smollett's arrest for filing a false police report about the attack broke.\n\nTrump also made the time to tweet about other things, such as the need for the U.S. to invest in 5G and 6G technology, as well as an absurd all-caps claim that \"THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW!\"\n\nHe also tweeted on Wednesday about Hoda Muthana, an Alabama woman who joined ISIS but has since renounced her support for the group and wants to return to the U.S.\n\n\"I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nYet on Hasson's arrest, silence.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has disgracefully failed to acknowledge white supremacist terrorism.\n\nHe called neo-Nazis \"very fine people\" after one of them murdered anti-racist activist Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year. He insulted the victims of the anti-Semitic massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue by saying they should have had armed security guards at their worship service. And his administration shut down the nation's only program dedicated to countering violent right-wing extremism.\n\nIt seems Trump doesn't like to draw attention to white terrorists who are very real, but who don't fit into his racist narratives about who's really a threat to America.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "One child newly ripped away from her mother was an eight-month-old infant.\n\nAfter the Trump administration earned worldwide condemnation for ripping children away from their families in an effort to deter both legal and illegal immigration, Trump signed an executive order that he claimed would halt the abhorrent practice.\n\nThat was in June. But in the eight months since then, a new report finds that 272 adults have been separated from their children just at one Texas courthouse.\n\nThe youngest child separated in these new cases was an eight-month old infant taken away from her mother.\n\n\"The American people need to know that babies are still being ripped from their mothers' arms by President Trump's family separation policy,\" Laura Pe\u00f1a, a Texas Civil Rights Project (TCRP) attorney, said after the organization released the report.\n\nThis is the case even though a federal judge ordered the administration to reunite families that had already been separated.\n\nThe TCRP report is based on screening and/or interviewing more than 10,000 immigrants being prosecuted for illegal entry in or near McAllen, Texas from June 2018 through December 2018. The organization says this is the first non-governmental data on new family separations since Trump's June 2018 executive order.\n\nThe limited scope of the interviews leads the organization to believe these 272 adults aren't the only ones being separated from their children. \"If this is happening in McAllen, it is happening in 18 district courts across the southwest border,\" the report read.\n\nThe Trump administration made national and international headlines in the summer of 2018 for aggressively prosecuting every single misdemeanor border-crossing violation, as well as some legal asylum-seekers. This resulted in children being separated from their parents or adult guardians who were awaiting trial.\n\nThe United States government, at the direction of Trump, essentially kidnapped thousands of children in such a reckless manner that they did not even keep track of where the children's parents were taken.\n\nAfter massive protests and outrage, the Trump administration claimed it would stop the program. But the TCRP report shows this isn't true.\n\n\"These ongoing separations are despicable,\" said Sandra Cordero, director of Families Belong Together, blasting the Trump administration's \"deliberate campaign to inflict trauma on children by forcibly tearing them from their parents.\"\n\nWhile 38 of the cases involved taking a child away from their parent or legal guardian, the majority involve separating children from other relatives, including aunts, uncles, siblings, and grandparents.\n\nIn one case, an 11-year-old boy was taken away from an uncle who had been caring for him since the child's mother died of cancer.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, the Trump administration defended this practice because the Homeland Security Act \"does not make concessions for anyone other than a parent or legal guardian.\"\n\nBut the Trump administration position did not sit well with lawyers from the ACLU, who point out that it's not right to separate children from family members just because they aren't their parents.\n\n\"What's happening is the government is doing separations unilaterally without any process to contest the separations and without a child welfare expert overseeing the separations,\" Lee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer, told the AP.\n\nTrump's hostility toward immigrants has been well-documented throughout his campaign and time in the White House.\n\nAnd his cruelty has inflicted incalculable harm upon thousands of innocent children.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Even though 97 percent of the public wants stronger background checks, many Republicans are still standing in the way.\n\nA group of former top military advisers is pressuring Republicans to support a commonsense background checks bill making its way through Congress.\n\nThe gun safety legislation, known as H.R. 8 or the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, is part of the commitment of the new Democratic majority's agenda to reject the influence of the NRA-backed gun lobby and pass commonsense gun safety legislation that is popular with voters \u2014 of both political parties.\n\n\"After a year of horrific mass shootings \u2014 Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Parkland, Thousand Oaks \u2014 and daily gun violence spreading across our country, when it comes to making Americans safer, it is clear we have no time to waste,\" the Feb. 20 letter reads.\n\nThe letter is signed by 13 former military advisers who served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, including former NSA and CIA Director Michael Hayden, retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, and former Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen. The letter was organized by Giffords, a gun safety advocacy organization created by former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head in 2011 during a public meeting with constituents.\n\n\"A prohibited person with dangerous intent can easily buy a gun over the internet or in a parking lot with no questions asked,\" the letter continues. \"For those of us with extensive firearms training, who have seen the damage inflicted by a powerful weapon in the wrong hands, this is simply unfathomable.\"\n\nThe letter \u2014 addressed to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2014 urges Congress to swiftly pass the bill into law.\n\nThe bill passed out of the House Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote, meaning all Republicans on the committee voted against it. While a handful of Republicans not on the committee back the bill, the overwhelming support comes from the new Democratic majority in the House. In fact, the bill would be the first significant piece of gun safety legislation to pass the House in more than a decade.\n\nAccording to Roll Call, the main purpose of the letter by military leaders is to convince Republicans, especially in the Senate, that universal background checks are necessary to ensure that the wrong people don't acquire guns.\n\nThe letter references a poll showing a stunning 97 percent of Americans support universal background checks legislation. The same poll shows background checks have the support of 97 percent of Republicans, 98 percent of independents, and 99 percent of Democrats. Even 97 percent of gun owners support the idea.\n\n\"The data supports the legislation,\" former Army Capt. Terron Sims II, one of the letter's signatories, told Roll Call. \"It's just a matter of getting those moderate Republicans to go with the will of their constituents.\"\n\nFor years, Republicans resisted the will of the American people and sided with the NRA. But the 2018 midterm election showed Americans across the country reject the pro-death agenda of the gun lobby and vote for a Congress willing to take steps to reduce gun violence.\n\n\"Now it is time for the leaders of our nation to step up,\" the military leaders tell Congress.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Harris \"won\" the election by roughly 900 votes, but serious inconsistencies were soon discovered. In the course of an investigation, it came to light that the Harris campaign sought out and hired a known election fraudster to run a crooked \"absentee ballot project.\"\n\nThe shocking evidence of Harris' involvement in the scheme came from the Republican's own son, who testified Wednesday that he had warned his father about consultant McCrae Dowless' long history of election fraud.\n\nThe call for a new election is a stark flip-flop for Harris, who in December demanded to be seated in the House of Representatives despite the allegations of election fraud surrounding his campaign.\n\nIn calling for a new election, the Times note Harris is effectively admitting that his \"win\" is tainted by the evidence that his campaign tried to steal the election. According to previous testimony, Harris financed a scheme to collect absentee ballots, and in some cases fill in the ballots for Harris. Both collecting the ballots, and filling them in, are illegal.\n\nAfter the elections board members made their decision, North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin issued a statement saying, \"This saga could only have ended in a new election, and we look forward to repairing the harm dealt by Republicans and giving the people of the Ninth district the representative they deserve.\"\n\nAt this point, it is unclear if Harris will seek to be the Republican nominee again. As reporter Ally Mutnick notes, this will be first \"redo congressional election\" in more than 40 years.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The North Korean government has threatened the use of those weapons against South Korea, a key American ally, as well as Japan and other countries. North Korea has even made bellicose threats about American soil in Hawaii and on the west coast.\n\nAnd while all this was happening, Trump has falsely claimed that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat, and has continued to attack intelligence agencies who have revealed how ineffective his diplomacy is by contradicting them and publicly fuming at their assessments.\n\nIn reality, his cringe-inducing attempts at diplomacy have only helped legitimize Kim's government while weakening the U.S.-South Korea alliance.\n\nThe joint letter also called out Trump for not coming clean about the details of his meetings with North Korea.\n\n\"Our ability to conduct oversight of U.S. policy toward North Korea on behalf of the American people has been inappropriately curtailed by your administration\u2019s unwillingness to share information with Congress,\" the letter states.\n\nTrump reportedly plans to have more secret, unaccountable, interactions with Kim Jong Un at the upcoming summit in Vietnam.\n\nThae Yong Ho, former North Korean ambassador to the United Kingdom and now a defector, recently held a press conference to warn that Trump fell into a \"trap\" set by Kim. Trump is ill-equipped to personally counter the North Koreans and risks setting up America and its allies for massive future failures.\n\nTrump similarly had a private one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin, which has given Russia the ability to lead the United States around by the nose. Because the meeting was private, Putin has been able to claim Trump made statements and commitments he cannot deny.\n\nAll three members of Congress have already made multiple information requests relating to intelligence in North Korea that went unanswered when Republicans controlled the House and Trump's fellow Republicans refused to conduct even basic oversight of his administration.\n\nBut Trump won't have a shield anymore with Democrats in charge, and they've only just begun to call him out.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Rob Pittenger, whom Harris defeated in the 2018 primary in order to move on to the general election, was interviewed by a local television outlet about using Dowless' services.\n\nPittenger told the television station that Dowless approached him during the 2018 election, but that Pittenger refused his services because he felt Dowless was a \"very unsavory character\" and that \"what he proposed was something that I did not want to do.\"\n\n\"Everything that I heard in the five minutes that I spent with him was enough to say, 'No thank you,'\" Pittenger said.\n\nFlashback: This is how former Rep.

Sulzberger said Trump's \"enemy of the people\" rhetoric \u2014 a phrase Trump used once again Wednesday morning in an angry tweet storm directed at the New York Times \u2014 is \"dangerous\" and \"has an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants who sought to control public information.\"\n\nIndeed, dictators like Josef Stalin and Mao Zedong were infamous for labeling their political opponents \"enemies of the people\" in order to justify jailing or murdering them.\n\nIn an audio recording of one of the face-to-face confrontations Sulzberger mentioned, Trump seemed surprised when Sulzberger informed him that murders of journalists are on the increase worldwide.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Trump from continuing to attack the press, including the New York Times specifically.\n\nTrump deployed his latest \"enemy of the people\" attack after the Times published a bombshell report on Tuesday suggesting that Trump asked now-former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to obstruct justice by reinstating an ally to oversee the Michael Cohen investigation led by federal prosecutors in New York.\n\nBut Trump has consistently used the \"enemy of the people\" line whenever news stories are published that expose his corrupt or legally dubious behavior.\n\nAnd it's already led to violence against reporters \u2014 including at a campaign rally Trump held in El Paso, Texas, last week, when a Trump supporter physically attacked reporters stationed in the press pen.\n\nBefore the attack, Trump had been riling up the crowd against the media. And Trump never condemned the violent act after it was committed.\n\nUltimately, Sulzberger said Trump's rhetoric won't deter the New York Times from conducting dogged and accurate reporting on Trump and his administration.\n\n\"Through 33 presidential administrations, across 167 years, the New York Times has worked to serve the public by fulfilling the fundamental role of the free press. To help people, regardless of their backgrounds or politics, understand their country and the world. To report independently, fairly and accurately. To ask hard questions. To pursue the truth wherever it leads,\" Sulzberger wrote. \"That will not change.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Mark Harris' son just threw him under the bus.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Mark Harris \u2014 who is under investigation for election fraud during his 2018 congressional campaign \u2014 was personally warned that a consultant he was thinking of hiring had a history of carrying out massive election fraud. Harris went ahead and hired him anyway.\n\nThat revelation came Wednesday during what's now been a 3-day hearing by the North Carolina State Board of Elections, which is probing the alleged fraud and whether it warrants a do-over election in North Carolina's competitive 9th District.\n\nAnd the revelation came, of all places, from Harris' own son \u2014 who took the witness stand in the hearing on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHarris' son John testified before the NCSBOE, that he told his dad and his dad's campaign consultant Andy Yates that he warned his dad about hiring McCrae Dowless, who appeared to be part of another election fraud scandal in 2016.\n\nYet Harris went ahead and hired Dowless \u2014 who is now accused of illegally harvesting absentee ballots for Harris' 2018 bid.\n\nJohn Harris testified that he thought Dowless \"might be kind of a shady character\u201d who was part of a separate election fraud scandal in 2016, in which Dowless was \"illegally collecting ballots.\" And John Harris said he raised these concerns with both to his father and Yates.\n\nThe testimony came after Yates took the stand over the course of two days \u2014 and repeatedly denied knowing that Dowless had a history of election fraud.\n\n\"I don't know that anybody on the campaign should have known,\" Yates said during the hearing before the NCSBOE, according to local news station WRAL. \"This is definitely asking me to speculate. There may have been people in Bladen County that should have known.\"\n\nThe outcome of the NCSBOE's hearing could ultimately determine whether a new election will be held in North Carolina's 9th District. As it stands, Harris currently leads his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, by 905 votes.\n\nHarris' son's testimony could be key to that determination, given that we now know that Harris was warned about Dowless' past behavior yet went ahead and used his absentee ballot services anyway.\n\nThanksgiving dinner at the Harris household might be very, very awkward this year.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center paints a disturbing picture of the spread of hate in Trump's America.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) reports a 30 percent increase in the number of hate groups in the last four years, coinciding with Trump's candidacy and presidency.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the new SPLC report shows 2018 saw a record number of hate groups \u2014 1,020 in all \u2014 operating in the United States, which is the most since the organization began tracking this issue in 1999.\n\n\"Rather than trying to tamp down hate, as presidents of both parties have done, President Trump elevates it \u2014 with both his rhetoric and his policies,\" Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project, said. \"In doing so, he's given people across America the go-ahead to act on their worst instincts.\"\n\nFrom 2011 through 2014, the number of hate groups declined by about 25 percent, down to 784. The uptick in 2015 coincided with Trump's campaign launch.\n\nAnti-immigrant and racist rhetoric has been a staple of both Trump's campaign and his time in the White House. While running for president, he attacked Mexicans as \"rapists,\" called for a ban on Muslims, and promised Mexico would pay for a wall along the southern border.\n\nOnce in office, Trump continued to promote white nationalists, especially he called them \"very fine people\" following a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that led to the murder of one protestor.\n\n\"Trump has given voice to the rage and paranoia of white supremacists,\" Beirich says. While SPLC notes there has been growth in other types of hate groups, far-right hate groups have proven to be the most violent.\n\nA separate report from the Anti-Defamation Leagues' Center on Extremism showed that every extremist murder in the U.S. in 2018 was linked to right-wing extremism. The 50 murders committed by extremists was an increase of 35 percent over 2017.\n\nThe FBI has seen a steady increase in the number of hate crimes over the same period of time SPLC saw a rise in hate groups. Between 2016 and 2017 alone, hate crimes spiked 17 percent.\n\n\"The numbers tell a striking story \u2014 that this president is not simply a polarizing figure but a radicalizing one,\" Beirich says.\n\nSPLC President Richard Cohen says hate has frayed our society, but we can all work to knit it back together. \"Most of all, it will take leadership \u2014 political leadership \u2014 that inspires our country to live up to its highest values,\" he says.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Christopher Paul Hasson, a self-proclaimed white nationalist, was arrested and accused of plotting a domestic terror attack to kill a bevy of Democratic officials and media figures whom Trump has publicly sparred with.\n\nAgents found a large arsenal of weapons at Hasson's residence, including 15 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.\n\nIn a court filing seeking to detain Hasson until trial, the Department of Justice says Hasson \"compiled a list of prominent Democratic congressional leaders, activists, political organizations, and MSNBC and CNN media personalities\" that he sought to kill.\n\nThe list includes, according to the court filing:\n\n\u201cJOEY\u201d (who most likely is Joe Scarborough of MSNBC, based on the searches described above); \u201cChris hayes\u201d (who presumably is Chris Hayes from MSNBC); \u201cSen blumen jew\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)); \u201cpelosi\u201d (who presumably is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)); \u201csen kaine\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA)); \u201cari melber\u201d (who presumably is Ari Melber from MSNBC); \u201cshumer\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY)); \u201cdon lemon\u201d (who presumably is Don Lemon from CNN); \u201cgillibran\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)); \u201cpoca warren\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)); \u201ccortez\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY)); \u201cbooker\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ)); \u201charris\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA)); \u201cbeto orourke\u201d (who presumably is former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX)); \u201cmaxine waters\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA); \u201csheila jackson\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson (D-TX)); \u201ciihanomar\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN)); \u201cchris cuomo\u201d (who presumably is Chris Cuomo from CNN); \u201cDSA\u201d (which presumably is the political organization Democratic Socialists of America); \u201cvan jones\u201d (who presumably is Van Jones from CNN); and \u201cpodesta\u201d (who presumably is former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta).\n\nMost, if not all, of these targets have been favorite punching bags of Trump's, whom Trump has chosen to insult or smear while onstage at his rallies or on Twitter.\n\nThe \"poca warren\" mention, for instance, is hard to read as anything but a reference to Trump's favorite mocking nickname for Elizabeth Warren, \"Pocahontas.\"\n\nThe court filing also says that Hasson searched online for topics that right-wing media has spread fear about, including the searches, \"what if Trump illegally impeached\" and \"civil war if Trump impeached.\"\n\nThis is not the first time a domestic terrorist has created a target list of Trump's enemies.\n\nRight before the midterm elections last fall, a laundry list of Trump's enemies were the target of mail bombs sent by a Trump superfan.\n\nThe suspect, Cesar Sayoc, drove a van emblazoned with Trump photos and quotes, and attended Trump rallies.\n\nTrump has repeatedly been warned that his rhetoric is inspiring violent acts against public officials and the media \u2014 yet he has not stopped his attacks.\n\nAnd it doesn't seem likely this arrest will change much.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump says he has no idea what's going on.\n\nThe Trump administration has a major international initiative being promoted by one of the most high-profile foreign policy officials of the United States \u2014 and Trump knows nothing about it.\n\nRichard Grenell, the infamously incompetent U.S. ambassador to Germany, recently announced a campaign to purportedly push to end laws that criminalize homosexuality in foreign countries.\n\nAsked whether some of the notoriously anti-gay members of the administration, including Trump and Mike Pence, are on board with the new policy, Grenell gave the impression that he had support from Trump and the rest of his administration.\n\n\"Decriminalizing homosexuality is something that people absolutely agree is a policy that we have to move forward on,\" he told NBC News.\n\nBut Trump appears to have no idea what Grenell is talking about.\n\nAt an appearance alongside the Australian chancellor on Wednesday, Trump was asked by a reporter to comment on the \"push to decriminalize homosexuality.\"\n\n\"Say it?\" Trump asked, looking completely confused.\n\n\"Your push to decriminalize homosexuality across the world,\" the reporter reiterated.\n\n\"I don't know which report you're talking about. We have many reports,\" Trump replied. He then asked, \"Anybody else?\" to move on to the next question.\n\nIt is understandable why Trump would be surprised by the question since his administration is openly hostile to LGBTQ rights and equality.\n\nHis administration has been contemplating enshrining restrictive definitions of gender in the law, which would allow widespread discrimination against transgender people.\n\nIn October \u2014 during LGBTQ History Month \u2014 Trump's State Department reversed a 2009 rule for employees of U.S.-based international organizations implemented under President Barack Obama that granted spousal visas to same-sex couples who are domestic partners. Marriage isn't an option for many of these people since they work in countries that do not allow same-sex marriage.\n\nTrump's Department of Agriculture recently pressured 4H to rescind guidance that would have been more welcoming of LGBTQ children.\n\nTrump's vice president has been a longtime leader in the movement to deny equal rights to LGBTQ Americans. His appeal to social conservatives who share those extreme beliefs was part of a calculated strategy to shore up Republican support for Trump during the 2016 campaign.\n\nOrganizations fighting for equality were openly skeptical of Grenell's claims.\n\n\"Donald Trump and Mike Pence have turned a blind eye to a campaign of violence and murder targeting LGBTQ people in Chechnya that has stretched on for two years. They have turned away LGBTQ people fleeing violence and persecution and sent them back to countries that criminalize them and have consistently worked to undermine the fundamental equality of LGBTQ people and our families here at home from day one,\" said Jeremy Kadden, senior international policy advocate for the Human Rights Campaign, in a statement to Shareblue Media.\n\n\"If this commitment is real, we have a lot of questions about their intentions and commitments and are eager to see what proof and action will follow.\"\n\nTrump is no ally to LGBTQ people, either in the United States or globally. He is not only disinterested in their human rights, but is openly hostile to them. That's why the administration's new policy has raised so many questions.\n\nBut Trump's confusion seems to confirm that the ambassador does not have the full support of the administration in his own pursuit for gay rights abroad. Whether Trump will actually support it, once someone explains it to him, is anyone's guess.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "For years, for-profit schools have preyed upon veterans, and Betsy DeVos wants to make it even easier for them to do so.\n\nSince taking office, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has shown a complete devotion to deregulation at the expense of vulnerable students. Now, veterans' groups are calling her out on a particularly egregious offense: She's allowing the for-profit schools she loves so much to fund themselves with G.I. Bill money, while they do next to nothing \u2014or worse \u2014 for vets.\n\nVeterans are uniquely sought after by for-profit schools when they are bringing G.I. Bill money. Schools have to follow what is called the 90/10 rule: 90 percent of their funding can be taxpayer dollars (like federal student aid), but the remaining 10 percent has to be private money. Thanks to a loophole in how the federal government views funding, G.I. Bill funds are currently viewed as private money, even though they are clearly taxpayer funds as well.\n\nThanks to the loophole, these for-profit schools can fund themselves almost entirely with G.I. Bill funds, and they're caught time and time again screwing over vets. Eight of the ten schools that receive the most G.I. Bill money are for-profit colleges, and six of those have defrauded students.\n\nA recent New York Times op-ed notes, \"Despite robust objections from roughly three dozen national veterans and military service organizations, Secretary DeVos elected to eviscerate student protections and quality controls for colleges.\"\n\nThis reality \u2014 veterans being fleeced by for-profit colleges \u2014 stands in stark contrast to the administration's supposed commitment to veterans. But DeVos has been cozying up to the for-profit college industry for the entire time she's been Secretary of Education. She came into office with holdings in companies that harass student loan borrowers, and she had investments at firms that own for-profit colleges.\n\nWithin just a few months of becoming secretary, she named Julian Schmoke to lead the fraud enforcement unit. Schmoke came from DeVry University, a sketchy for-profit school that, just before Trump took office, paid a $100 million settlement with the FTC because they misled students with false claims of high employment rates.\n\nAfter that, Devos went on to kill investigations into for-profit schools. Just last month, she floated a plan to massively roll back oversight of higher education to the point where accredited schools could farm instruction out to non-accredited providers, and students wouldn't even be informed they were getting instruction from the non-accredited partner. Another proposed change would lead to students learning on their own via self-help videos rather than having a teacher.\n\nDeVos has enjoyed two years of being free of scrutiny while she makes her moves to sell education to the highest bidders. That all ended when the Democrats took the House in the midterms. Among other things, the House Education Committee is planning to look into DeVos' recent replacement of the Department of Education's acting inspector general. That person was replaced while they were looking into DeVos' reinstatement of an accreditor of for-profit colleges.\n\nVeterans \u2014 and all students \u2014 deserve better than a Department of Education that exists to line the pockets of for-profit colleges with taxpayer dollars while providing a subpar education and no job prospects.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Go get them Nick. Fake News!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nSandmann, who was thrust into the national spotlight when a video of him in a Trump hat staring down a Native American protester on the National Mall went viral, is suing the Washington Post for a cool $250 million.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that amount is what Jeff Bezos paid for the newspaper, and will \"teach the Post a lesson it will never forget.\" That comes after the lawsuit claims that Sandmann did not \"bring this lawsuit to use the judicial system to further a political agenda.\"\n\nExcept that's exactly what this lawsuit seeks to do.\n\nIt reads like a piece of GOP propaganda against the media, a message Trump has pushed to try and absolve himself of responsibility in a litany of legal and ethical scandals that ensnare his presidency.\n\nThe lawsuit claims with no proof that the Washington Post only wrote the story about Sandmann because it \"wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nApparently Sandmann and his legal team believe factual reporting on the unethical behavior and legal problems surrounding Trump constitutes \"bias.\"\n\nIt goes on to claim the Washington Post \"target[ed] Nicholas in furtherance of its political agenda,\" and \"wanted to lead the charge against this child because he was a pawn in its political war against its political adversary \u2014 a war so disconnected and beyond the comprehension of Nicholas that it might as well have been science fiction.\"\n\n\"'The Washington Post ignored basic journalistic standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump,\u201d Trump tweeted, quoting from the farcical lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit, which doesn't appear to be on sound legal footing in the first place, then begins to fall apart when it admits that the Washington Post wasn't even the first outlet to report on the standoff between Sandmann and the Native American protester.\n\n\"The Post was the one of the first, if not the first, mainstream media outlet to expand coverage of the January 18 incident from social media to mainstream media,\" the lawsuit states \u2014 a pretty weak excuse of an argument to justify $250 million worth of damages solely from the Washington Post.\n\nIt's no wonder Trump cheered this lawsuit on, however.\n\nTrump spent his Wednesday morning tweeting attacks against the media, saying that, \"The Press has never been more dishonest than it is today,\" and calling the New York Times the \"true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!\"\n\nIt's the kind of attack he regularly makes against the free press: on Twitter, at his rallies, in interviews.\n\nIn other words, it's a day that ends in \"y.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Justice Clarence Thomas has suggested rolling back a major Supreme Court case that protects newspapers from harassing lawsuits from politicians. That would make Donald Trump very happy.\n\nIn his continuing quest to take American law backward to a time when the powerful gleefully held sway over everyone else, Justice Clarence Thomas has now called for the Supreme Court to revisit a landmark libel decision.\n\nAnd it just happens that if this decision were reversed, it would be much easier for people like Donald Trump to silence critics by filing lawsuits.\n\nBack in 1964, a unanimous Supreme Court held that public figures had a higher bar to clear if they wanted to win a libel suit. The case, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, originated during the Civil Rights movement and involved an advertisement published in the Times decrying police actions against civil rights demonstrators in Montgomery. The ad contained some errors and exaggerations.\n\nAlthough Sullivan wasn't named in the advertisement, he was partly in charge of the police in Montgomery. So he sued, alleging that the Times had libeled him \u2014 published something they knew was false \u2014 by running the ad.\n\nDuring the civil rights movement, Southern politicians routinely sued newspapers, hoping that they could blunt the coverage of the movement. Sullivan's lawsuit wasn't born out of some noble impulse or from being wronged. It was a tactical move to ensure civil rights leaders didn't get widespread exposure.\n\nThe Times argued that if they were required to rigorously examine every possible claim made by someone else about a public official, which Sullivan was, discourse about government officials could be shut down altogether. Rich and powerful people could latch on to a minor error in a story and use that to functionally hound a newspaper out of business.\n\nIn ruling for the Times, the Court created a new standard for libel of public figures. It said that someone who is a public official had to show that the publisher acted with \"actual malice\": publishing something either with clear knowledge it was false, or with \"reckless disregard\" for the truth.\n\nThis standard protects newspapers and allows public discourse, particularly about politicians, to thrive.\n\nThis has been a relatively uncontroversial view for decades. Even Justice Neil Gorsuch, an ultra-conservative Trump appointee, said at his confirmation hearing that it was settled law.\n\nBut Clarence Thomas wants to drag us back to a time when it was easy to sue people and libel was actually a crime.\n\nWhy? Because that's how things were in the late 1700s.\n\nThomas' view, were it to prevail, would make Donald Trump's dreams come true. Trump declared on the campaign trail in 2016 that if he were elected, he would \"open up\" libel laws so it would be easier for him to \"sue them and win lots of money.\" Trump specifically named the New York Times and the Washington Post as newspapers he would go after.\n\nTrump has often smeared both of those papers since becoming president. He's bizarrely tried to demand that the Washington Post register as a lobbyist, and has threatened to sic the IRS on the Post when it published something he didn't like. Trump goes after the Times on Twitter routinely, calling it \"failing and corrupt\" and calling one of their reporters a \"Crooked H flunkie.\"\n\nTrump's hostility to the media is unique in its vitriol, even compared to Nixon. Given a chance, there's every reason to believe Trump would fully embrace tyranny and shut down media outlets that he didn't like.\n\nApparently, Clarence Thomas would like to help him do just that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump prioritized whining about the New York Times over responding to serious national security threats.\n\nDuring his state of the nation address on Wednesday, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin threatened to aim new missiles at the United States \u2014 but Trump was too busy whining about the New York Times to bother responding to the threat.\n\nPutin said that Moscow will target the United States with new hypersonic missiles if Trump chooses to deploy new intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe, which wouldn't be prohibited now that Trump has scrapped a Reagan-era nuclear arms treaty.\n\nIn early February, the Trump administration announced the United States would withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. National security experts denounced the move as dangerous and warned that it could lead to a new nuclear arms race.\n\nPutin used his national address to threaten exactly what experts predicted. In addition to threatening America's European allies, Putin bragged about the new weapons which could directly target the U.S. He described missiles that could travel at eight times the speed of sound, had a range of more than 600 miles, and could be deployed on ships and submarines.\n\nThe New York Times described Putin's words as \"some of his most explicit threats ever.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Trump blasted what he called the \"true enemy of the people\" on Twitter.\n\nBut Trump wasn't talking about a hostile country threatening to aim missiles at America's cities and towns. He was talking about the New York Times.\n\n\"The New York Times reporting is false. They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!\" Trump raged. It was his third tweet of the morning attacking America's free press \u2014 yet he couldn't muster the time or energy to push back against Putin.\n\nTrump was likely irked by a recent Times investigation describing his efforts over the past two years to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation. The investigation includes some previously unreported episodes about Trump using a wide array of tactics to undermine any attempt to look into his entanglements with Russia.\n\nNew York Times Publisher A.G. Sulzberger called Trump's attacks not just false, but dangerous. Describing the press as the \"enemy of the people\" has \"an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants who sought to control public information,\" he said, and Trump's reckless attacks may be \"encouraging threats and violence against journalists\" both in the United States and around the globe.\n\nTrump has always been more interested in attacking America's free press than criticizing Putin. His subservient attitude toward Putin is so worrying that former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe thought it was possible Trump was working for Russia.\n\nAnd even when Russia threatens to aim missiles at American cities, Trump can't be bothered to stand up for the country he's supposed to be leading.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Then he doubled down on his comparison.\n\n\"The comment I made was that the demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world and so were the Jews,\" he explained.\n\nHapper is a professor emeritus at Princeton and in 2015 was caught agreeing to write a briefing paper financed by the fossil fuel industry to hype the \"benefits of fossil fuels to developing economies.\"\n\nThe panel he is working on for Trump is described in an internal discussion paper as a committee \"to advise the President on scientific understanding of today's climate, how the climate might change in the future under natural and human influences, and how a changing climate could affect the security of the United States.\"\n\nThe crackpot beliefs and rhetoric espoused by Happer fit right into Trump's approach to the environment and science. Trump has said that climate change is a \"hoax\" that was invented by the Chinese government. On several occasions, Trump has stupidly pointed to extreme cold weather as evidence that climate change does not exist.\n\nRepublicans overall have embraced wholesale denialism of the global climate change problem, preferring to mock serious solutions to the problem while catastrophes across the world increase thanks to higher temperatures.\n\nPutting Happer in such an important position of influence with science he has actively worked to undermine is a perfect distillation of the Republican approach.\n\nClimate change is real, it is happening, scientists know it, people are dying, and Trump and the Republicans do not care.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans are not backing off their quest to kick needy Americans off the food stamps they need to feed their families.\n\nRepublicans may have failed to kick needy Americans off food stamps during Trump's first two years in office \u2014 but that doesn't mean they're giving up.\n\nSixty-five Republican members of Congress wrote a letter to Trump Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue on Tuesday supporting Perdue's plan to create work requirements for people to receive food stamps.\n\nIn the letter, Republicans peddled insulting, inaccurate myths about food stamp recipients, such as claiming they're lazy and choose not to work because food stamps have become their \"way of life\" rather than a short-term fix when they're in a financial bind.\n\nThis simply isn't true. More than half of beneficiaries are children who can\u2019t work in order to feed themselves, and the average length of participation in the program is seven to nine months.\n\nThe GOP lawmakers argued that food stamps have \"disincentivized self-sufficiency,\" which they claim is a \"significant problem\" that can only be solved with onerous work requirements. They say their plan to institute work requirements would save $15 billion over 10 years, or $1.5 billion annually.\n\nTo put that yearly amount into perspective, the tax scam Republicans passed adds at least $1.3 trillion to the deficit over the course of 10 years. Cutting food stamps to poor Americans would be a minuscule fraction of the cost the GOP incurred to give tax breaks to the richest in the U.S.\n\nWork requirements are also a pernicious way to \"save\" money, since all they do is deny people the benefits they need without actually encouraging more people to work.\n\nThe \"problem\" Republicans lay out in their letter isn't really a problem. Rather, it's a long-stated goal of Republicans like now-former Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump \u2014 who has been demanding work requirements since he took office.\n\nRepublicans, however, failed to get their precious work requirements into the farm bill that passed Congress in 2018. That's why they are now resorting to changing the rules via regulations \u2014 a tactic that Trump and the GOP relentlessly attacked former President Barack Obama for using.\n\nThe ultimate irony here is that Trump's own supporters may be hurt most by any food stamp work requirement changes.\n\nA report from May found that food stamp work requirements \u201cwould disproportionately affect low-income residents in states that supported Donald Trump for president.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for those folks, you get what you vote for.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The GOP tax scam is doing what Republicans intended: helping rich corporations while hurting American families.\n\nAmazon will pay no taxes this year, but Andy Kraft and Amy Elias of Portland, Oregon, just found out they owe more than $10,000.\n\nWelcome to the first tax season under the new GOP tax scam, a time when wealthy corporations pay little or no taxes but families across the country see their refunds shrinking or tax bills skyrocketing.\n\nKraft told the AP that his \"jaw hit the floor\" after he entered his information into TurboTax. The amount he and Elias owed was so staggering that he called an accountant to double-check the numbers. But there was no mistake. Thanks to the GOP tax scam, the couple owes more than they did last year.\n\nWhile families feeling the full negative impact of the 2017 tax scam, Fortune 500 companies are reaping a windfall.\n\nNot only will Amazon pay no taxes on their $11.2 billion profit, but they filed for a $129 million refund, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP). ITEP noted Amazon is able to do this because \"the Trump administration and its congressional allies included lavish new giveaways\" for corporations in the GOP tax scam.\n\nAccording to Axios, Amazon isn't the only wealthy corporation pulling in multibillion dollar profits and filing for refunds. GM made a healthy $11.8 billion profit, and yet still filed for a $104 million refund. Companies like Goodyear, Netflix, and U.S. Steel each made more than $690 million in profit, and each are claiming refunds this year.\n\n\"We've known all along that the Republican tax plan was a corporate giveaway paid for by working families, and large corporations paying little to nothing in taxes is just another example of it,\" Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) told Shareblue Media.\n\nRepublicans made sure the tax code would favor the wealthy and leave middle-class families out in the cold. Without a single vote from Democrats, Trump and his Republican allies slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, and Axios noted that corporations still have plenty of loopholes to use.\n\nBut for personal income, more than 80 percent of the benefits of the tax scam will eventually flow to the richest 1 percent of families. And middle-class families will feel the burned.\n\n\"For generations, Republicans have rewritten the rules of the economy to benefit the largest corporations and the wealthiest individuals at the expense of everyone else \u2014 and the GOP's tax law only made it worse,\" Ryan Thomas, spokesperson for Tax March, said in a statement to Shareblue Media. \"The fact that multi-billion dollar corporations with massive profits are paying no federal income taxes while working Americans owe higher tax bills shows just how rigged the tax code is.\n\nAshley Alt of Illinois told the New York Times she was expecting a smaller refund or maybe owe a little this year. Then she found out she would owe $4,800. \"I did not expect to owe two months of take-home pay,\" she said.\n\nAccording to early IRS data, about 16 percent fewer people are receiving refunds this year compared to last year. And if people are getting a refund, it is eight percent lower, on average, than last year.\n\nThe issue is exacerbated because of new withholding rules in the GOP tax scam. Republicans bragged about bigger paychecks last year, even highlighting a woman who would only take home an additional $1.50 per week. But many taxpayers did not realize that minuscule increases throughout the year would impact their tax refund this April.\n\nAccording to one government report, roughly 30 million Americans had too little withheld from their regular paychecks last year. This made their take-home paycheck larger, but increased their tax liability, according to the AP.\n\nAll in all, Republicans wrote a tax bill to lavish giveaways to Wall Street billionaires, not caring what happened to working-class families. And as Americans are finding out, it is working exactly as they wanted it to.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans didn't bother to show up at a hearing featuring Stacey Abrams on voter suppression efforts.\n\nRepublicans skipped a special congressional hearing on efforts to suppress the votes of racial minorities, in the latest sign of the party's ongoing hostility to voting rights.\n\nNot a single Republican on the House Administration Committee attended the hearing on Tuesday, which took place at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia. The session was entitled, \"Field Hearing on Voting Rights and Election Administration in Georgia.\"\n\nRep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH) described the event as \"a hearing on how we enfranchise all voters in the United States.\"\n\nGeorgia was ground zero for Republican voter suppression efforts in the 2018 midterms. Brian Kemp, who continued overseeing Georgia elections as secretary of state even while he ran against Democrat Stacey Abrams for governor, held up the registrations of over 53,000 mostly black voters \u2014 just one of the many voter suppression tactics Kemp has engaged in over the years. Kemp narrowly won the governors race.\n\nAt the hearing, Abrams explained how Republican leaders in her state operated their campaign.\n\n\"Incompetence and malfeasance operates in tandem, and the sheer complexity of the state\u2019s voting apparatus smooths voter suppression into a nearly seamless system that targets voter registration, ballot access, and ballot counting,\" Abrams testified.\n\nAbrams said the hurdles erected by the GOP to depress turnout among minority voters \u2014 who heavily favor Democrats \u2014 had its \"desired effect.\"\n\nSean J. Young, the legal director for ACLU of Georgia, also testified at the hearing and discussed the difficulty of filing local legal challenges to voter suppression.\n\n\"Playing whack-a-mole is not a sustainable strategy to fight against voting discrimination,\" he explained.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have proposed a series of electoral reforms as part of HR 1, a House bill that would increase voter participation and protect the sanctity of the vote against foreign and domestic threats.\n\nInstead of joining in and supporting the right to vote, however, Republicans have attacked the bill. Led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the party has lashed out at the idea of protecting voting rights in such an egregious manner that McConnell's hometown newspaper, the Lexington Herald-Leader, blasted his efforts as \"segregationist.\"\n\nAt the same time as the hearing took place in Georgia, North Carolina elections officials heard testimony from an investigation exposing how a Republican campaign operative worked to steal a House seat in the 9th Congressional District.\n\nRepublicans have been systematically attacking voting rights across the country. These attacks come almost exclusively from Republicans, because they tend to lose when more people \u2014 especially more people of color, poor people, students, and others hurt by voter suppression tactics \u2014 are able to cast a ballot.\n\nAfter years of inaction at best and active sabotage at worst under Republican leadership, the problem is finally being addressed.\n\nBut Republicans simply chose not to show up and face the consequences of their actions.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Even after she lied for the Trump administration and bashed the media, CNN decided to put GOP operative Sarah Isgur in charge of its 2020 election coverage.\n\nCNN has hired a former Trump administration official and longtime Republican operative to coordinate its coverage of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSarah Isgur has no experience in journalism, and most recently served as the spokesperson for the racist and incompetent Jeff Sessions, Trump's former Attorney General. Yet Isgur has nonetheless been granted what Politico described as a \"senior role\" as political editor for the cable news network.\n\n\"Isgur has no experience in news but a long history as a political operative, most recently with the Trump administration and the Fiorina campaign,\" Politico noted.\n\nCNN's new hire also has a history of attacking the press with phony allegations of liberal bias \u2014 including CNN, which she blasted in 2013 for accurately describing hosts at the conservative \"Values Voters Summit\" as \"anti-gay\" and \"anti-abortion.\" In 2015, Isgur also accused the media of acting as \"lapdogs\" for Hillary Clinton.\n\nIsgur is just one of many shills for Trump who have been hired by CNN over the last few years. But unlike those other shills, who have joined CNN as commentators and analysts, Isgur will be in a position to make major editorial decisions about the network's campaign coverage \u2014 even though Trump is already running for reelection in the 2020 campaign that Isgur will oversee coverage of.\n\nShe has been given this position at one of the most-watched and influential news outlets in the country, even though she has repeatedly lied to the news media on behalf of Sessions and the Trump administration.\n\nIsgur's then-boss Sessions lied to Congress during his 2017 confirmation hearings by saying he had not personally had any contact with Russian operatives when he was part of Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nBut he had. And even when it came out that Sessions had met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Isgur lied on Sessions' behalf by insisting that \"there was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer\" to Congress.\n\nIn one appearance on CNN last year, Isgur used her position as the public face of Sessions' office to promote a conspiracy theory, frequently pushed by Trump and other Republicans, that a joking text between two FBI agents was evidence of an anti-Trump \"secret society\" on special counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating Russian election interference.\n\nIsgur wanted the inspector general, who conducts oversight of federal agencies, to issue a report on the text messages despite no evidence that they were more than a joke.\n\nBefore becoming Sessions' spokesperson, Isgur worked for Carly Fiorina's failed presidential primary campaign, the Republican National Committee, and Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. She also worked on Ted Cruz's campaign for Texas attorney general and told the Harvard Crimson her political views were similar to his.\n\nIsgur played a key role in promoting a blatant falsehood from the Fiorina campaign that Hillary Clinton supported abortion \"up until the moment of birth.\" Isgur cropped a quote from Clinton and presented it as evidence of the wild claim, which got four Pinocchios from the Washington Post fact checker.\n\nIsgur further smeared Clinton by claiming Clinton had received \"foreign donations\" (a lie that can be traced back to Trump campaign boss Steve Bannon) and even accused her of stealing lines and ideas from Fiorina.\n\nIsgur also promoted a series of hoax videos smearing Planned Parenthood, absurdly claiming that the organization \"and its media allies don't want you to believe\" the content of the thoroughly debunked and doctored videos.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential race, CNN will be covering a wide and diverse field of Democrats seeking the party's nomination. The eventual nominee will take on Trump in the general election.\n\nShaping that coverage, from inside CNN, will be Sarah Isgur \u2014 an openly conservative Republican operative with a proven track record of lying about Democrats, lying for the Trump administration, and attacking the media.\n\nThis is CNN.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He hasn't tweeted about it since August of 2018, when he wrote, \"Space Force all the way!\"\n\nThe Pentagon was always skeptical of the idea. While Trump was pushing \"Space Force\" to wild applause from his most diehard supporters, Defense Department officials were effectively ignoring him. They have sought to coordinate military activities in space under a U.S. Space Command, but that's nothing like the separate \"Space Force\" branch of the military Trump envisioned.\n\nCongress, even when it was under Republican control, also did not make the Space Force a priority, and openly expressed skepticism about the idea.\n\nTrump would need the approval of Congress to create a new branch of the military. Now that Democrats are in control of the House, Trump cannot even get money for his precious border wall idea, let alone an entire Space Force.\n\nJust like the wall, \"Space Force\" was always a ridiculous applause line that was never going to become reality.

Since meeting with Trump, the regime has continued to pursue its weapons program, despite Trump's insistence that thanks to his efforts, North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat.\n\nThae believes Kim made noise about attacking South Korea and other U.S. allies in the hopes that he could pressure America into a peace agreement and see sanctions eased.\n\nTrump has helped him along that path by meeting him as equals when previous administrations have treated the North Korean government like the international pariah that it is.\n\nTrump is slated to meet again with Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\nAt their last meeting, Trump repeatedly bumbled through the event, showed deference to the thuggish North Korean military, then later proclaimed he had succeeded at denuclearizing the country.\n\nHe even gave in to a major demand from the North Koreans and cancelled planned joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States.\n\nSoon after, U.S. intelligence agencies and other outside groups determined that North Korea has continued to build and test weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThus far, North Korea has successfully played Trump for a fool, getting him to repeatedly praise the nation's dictator and declare some sort of success while North Korea continues to pursue its nuclear ambitions.\n\nIt seems likely that that Trump is headed for yet another failure while North Korea continues to play him like a fiddle at next week's summit.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "His failure was even worse than we thought.\n\nTrump admitted defeat Friday when he signed a bill to fund the government that didn't include the money he wanted for his border wall.\n\nBut Vice News reported Tuesday that Trump's defeat was even more complete and humiliating than many realized: The bill he signed essentially designated \"no-wall zones,\" specific areas on the southern border where he is forbidden from using any of the funds Congress gave him to build a wall.\n\nThe legislation Trump signed includes just $1.37 billion for pedestrian fencing, not $5.7 billion to build a big wall like Trump wanted.\n\nBut the bill Trump signed specifically prohibits the government from using even those funds to build fencing in designated sections of Texas: the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge, the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park, the La Lomita Historical Park, the National Butterfly Center, and in specific regions of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThis is a big setback for Trump, who has been insisting since the early days of his presidential campaign that a wall has to span the entire southern border in order to be effective.\n\n\"I will build the best wall, the biggest, the strongest, not penetrable, they won\u2019t be crawling over it, like giving it a little jump and they\u2019re over the wall,\" Trump told supporters in April 2015.\n\nIn March of 2016, Trump said \"a thousand miles\" of wall would need to be built to do the job right. And in January of this year, he insisted that \"between checkpoints,\" where no walls are built, is where \"tremendous problems\" can occur.\n\n\"We got five protections that were so important,\" Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) said in describing the steps he took to make sure the legislation defended the land.\n\nIn some cases, action had been taken to begin construction in the five areas now protected by the spending bill. In 2017, the National Butterfly Center posted video of the first phase of wall construction, highlighting survey stakes and workers with chainsaws near the property.\n\nTrump was forced to sign the legislation after losing badly in his political confrontation with Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, over shutting down the government. Millions of Americans suffered thanks to his obstinance as federal workers went unpaid.\n\nTo avoid another public black eye for his already unpopular administration, Trump signed the bill and accepted provisions that handcuff him.\n\nAs a last resort, Trump is now trying to invoke a \"national emergency,\" so he can steal money from projects like building military homes to build his wall. There too he is facing massive opposition \u2014 and multiple lawsuits, one from at least 16 states and others from advocacy groups, with potentially more on the way.\n\nTrump isn't getting his wall. His shutdown to get the wall didn't work. And now he has been forced to sign legislation specifically designating no-wall zones.\n\nThe only avenue he might have left is his dubious \"emergency\" declaration, which is also facing massive legal challenges on multiple fronts.\n\nTrump just keeps on losing.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Again.\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics (OGE) refused to certify Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' financial disclosure form \u2014 because Ross lied about owning certain stocks.\n\nThe move comes after the OGE warned Ross in the summer of 2018 about the consequences of his repeated problems with inaccurate disclosures.\n\nIn a letter dated Feb. 15, 2019, OGE Director Emory A. Rounds declared that the office would not certify Ross' disclosure because the \"report was not accurate and he was not in compliance with his ethics agreement at the time of the report.\"\n\nRoss lied about owning BankUnited stock, the Center for Public Integrity reported in December 2018. According to the ethics agreement Ross signed in early 2017, Ross was supposed to divest this stock no later than the end of May 2017.\n\nBut he didn't. In fact, he continued to own some stock in the company all the way until the end of October 2018, despite signing several financial disclosure forms saying he sold them all in the intervening months.\n\n\"Wilbur Ross clearly is not taking his ethics obligations seriously,\" Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, told the Center for Public Integrity in December. \"He's been warned and at this point he needs a full audit by OGE and probably Congress to make sure he's not operating with blatant conflict of interest.\"\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill took notice as well. In December, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) told the Center for Public Integrity that this \"administration's contempt for the most basic checks on corruption is bottomless.\"\n\nLying on an ethics form isn't the only way Ross makes headlines. During the Trump shutdown, Ross was baffled that some federal workers were struggling after not being paid for 35 days. When a reporter asked Ross about federal workers who were visiting homeless shelters to get food, Ross replied that he knew about it, but, he said, \"I don't really quite understand why.\"\n\nLike many in Trump's Cabinet, Ross may see himself as above the rule of law. Unfortunately, his attitude, according to Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, \"shows a lack of reverence towards the ethics program and a disregard for the rules.\"\n\nIn Trump's Cabinet, the culture of corruption is just par for the course.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe said GOP leaders in Congress didn't object when the FBI opened an investigation into Trump because he might be 'a threat' to national security.\n\nOn the \"Today\" show Tuesday, former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe revealed that congressional leaders \u2014 including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 did not object to the FBI opening a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was a threat to national security.\n\n\"No one objected,\" McCabe said, when asked whether he had discussed the investigation with the \"Gang of Eight\" congressional leaders who get briefed on classified intelligence. \"Not on legal grounds, not on constitutional grounds, and not based on the facts.\"\n\nThe FBI opened its investigation into a sitting president, McCabe said, because \"we had information that led us to believe that there might be a threat to national security \u2014 in this case that the president himself might, in fact, be a threat to the United States' national security.\"\n\nSpecifically, McCabe added, the FBI thought it \"possible\" that Trump might be working for Russia.\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising news that GOP lawmakers didn't object to the FBI investigating such serious concerns.\n\nBut unfortunately, it is surprising news. That's because time and again, Republicans in Congress have bent over backwards to defend Trump's relationship with Russia, and have treated U.S. law enforcement like the enemy for investigating that relationship.\n\nThe FBI opened its counterintelligence investigation in May 2017, after Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey in an attempt to thwart the agency's investigation into the Trump campaign's possible criminal collusion with Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nThe counterintelligence investigation was a separate probe from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference, but both looked into Trump's possible motivations for firing Comey.\n\nWhen the existence of the counterintelligence probe was first reported by the New York Times in January, Trump pitched a fit, and many Republicans defended him.\n\nYet according to McCabe, Republican leaders in Congress have long been aware of the FBI's investigation.\n\nRather than put the security of the country first, Republicans have consistently rallied behind Trump and remained silent about the potential danger he poses \u2014 even when they should know better.\n\nFor instance, McConnell adamantly refuses to allow a vote on legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation in to Trump's ties to Russia. For years, Trump has railed against any investigation into his ties to Russia as a \"witch hunt,\" yet McConnell \u2014 even knowing what he knows of the FBI investigation \u2014 still refuses to lift a finger to reign in Trump's rhetoric or action.\n\nMany other leading Republicans in Congress have gone out of their way to cover for Trump and support his attacks against the Department of Justice. Former Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) went so far as to say Trump \"has the right\" to threaten people at the Justice Department, siding with Trump over U.S. law enforcement agencies.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, was also present when McCabe told Congress about the counterintelligence investigation. Like McConnell, Nunes spent years trying to cover up Trump's potential crimes. Nunes even thwarted his own committee's Russia investigation \u2014 so badly that Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) immediately reopened it when he took over as chair of the Intelligence Committee.\n\nFor McConnell, the borderline-treasonous silence is part of a pattern of putting political ambitions ahead of the good of the country. Before the 2016 election, McConnell helped cover up information showing Russia was interfering in an effort to elect Trump.\n\nWhen then-CIA director John Brennan informed congressional leaders, including McConnell, of Russian interference, McConnell did all he could to ensure the public never knew about it. With a raised voice, he threatened Brennan: \"If you try to come forward with this, I'm not going to sign on to any public statement that would condemn Russian interference. But I will condemn you and the Obama administration for trying to mess up this election.\"\n\nDay by day, we are learning even more about Trump's dangerous behavior \u2014 and of Republicans' willingness to endanger national security in order to stand by Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But they chose to proceed.\n\nThe plan was to build nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia, but the technology could possibly be used to manufacture nuclear weapons. If that is the case, such a sale would require approval from Congress, according to the Atomic Energy Act. The whistleblowers warned of \"potential procedural and legal violations\" with the plan hatched in the early days of the Trump administration.\n\nThe effort was spearheaded by former Trump campaign surrogate and disgraced former national security advisor Michael Flynn, who was pushing a deal which could have brought a financial windfall to one of his former clients.\n\nOnce ethics officials became aware of the potential deal, National Security Council (NSC) officials warned it was a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\"One senior political official stated that the proposal was 'not a business plan,' but rather 'a scheme for these generals to make some money,'\" according to the report.\n\nFlynn \u2014 who has since pled guilty to lying to the FBI and is a cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigations \u2014 was not the only person to potentially benefit.\n\nOne of the companies that could have built the power plants is connected to Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. The manufacturer is a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management, the company that bailed out Kushner when one of Kushner's real estate deals was in dire financial straights.\n\nThe shocking revelations brought about a swift response from members of Congress.\n\n\"What is driving this policy of subservience of American national security interests to the interests of Saudi Arabia?\" asked Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chair of the House Intelligence Committee in a statement. Schiff promised to work with Cummings to look into these matters.\n\nA new member of the Oversight Committee, Rep. Harley Rouda (D-CA), stressed that the report \"reveals that White House advisors including Michael Flynn & Jared Kushner were & possibly still are working to rush highly sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, and some stood to personally make money off new power plants.\" He added that the committee will continue to investigate the issue.\n\nDespite warnings from the NSC and ethics lawyers, the report notes that the White House is continuing to meet and discuss the possibility of selling nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia as recently as this month.\n\nIt seems the Trump White House won't let legal or ethical issues get in the way of ill-gotten profit.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

What he forgot to mention is that his team asked Japan to nominate Trump.\n\nSad!\n\nJapanese Media reported on Sunday that the Nobel Prize nomination Trump received happened because the U.S. government asked Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to nominate him.\n\nTrump had let slip during his bizarre \"national emergency\" declaration on Friday that it was Abe who nominated him for the prestigious award that Trump ultimately didn't receive.\n\n\"Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize,\" Trump said in his rambling address at the White House.\n\n\"He said 'I have nominated you, respectfully, on behalf of Japan. I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Trump continued. \"You know why? Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan. They feel safe. I did that.\"\n\nBut Trump left out the part where Abe wrote the nomination because he was asked to, not because of some pressing urge to give Trump an accolade for outstanding work.\n\nAbe on Monday refused to deny that he nominated Trump, or that he was asked to write the nomination.\n\n\"I'm not saying that it is not the fact,\" Abe said, according to CNN.\n\n\"I'll continue to [offer] my utmost cooperation to President Trump to solve the North Korean nuclear and missile issues and the abduction issue, which is the most important ... for Japan,\" Abe added.\n\nTrump has clearly felt slighted that he didn't win the Nobel Prize Abe reportedly nominated him for. And he's suggested it's because he's jealous that President Barack Obama received the award when he served as president.\n\n\"They gave it to Obama, he didn't even know what he got it for,\" Trump said on Friday, after announcing that Abe had nominated him for the prize. \"He was there for about 15 seconds and got the Nobel Prize. He said, 'Oh, what did I get it for?'\"\n\nTrump has been obsessed with Obama's successes, and has worked hard to try to undermine Obama's policies and fruitlessly prove that Obama wasn't a better president.\n\nDuring tours of the Oval Office, for example, Trump likes to point out that he uses the space more than Obama did \u2014 as if that means anything at all.\n\nNo matter where Obama works, he likely did far more than Trump, who spends most of his days in unspecified \"executive time\" and live-tweeting Fox News.\n\nIn 2018, CBS News reported that Trump's Interior Department wanted to change hunting rules that Obama had instituted that protected brown bears and their cubs from inhumane hunting practices. Even hunters backed the Obama-era changes, but that didn't stop the Trump administration from trying to nix them.\n\n\"Under the proposed changes, hunters would also be allowed to hunt black bears with dogs, kill wolves and pups in their dens, and use motorboats to shoot swimming caribou,\" CBS News reported.\n\nThere truly are no limits to Trump's jealousy over Obama's success.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

NPR noted, \"For Harris to have ended up with that 61 percent, he would have had to win every single Republican and unaffiliated voter and some registered Democrats as well.\"\n\nStrach said that the evidence \u2014 which includes testimony to investigators from 140 voters and 30 witnesses \u2014 shows Dowless paid people to pick up ballots, and took other actions designed to \"obstruct the investigation and testimony provided at this hearing.\"\n\nOne woman who testified in the hearing, Lisa Britt, signed her name as a witness to many of the ballots illegally turned in by Dowless. She said the Republican operative paid her between $150 and $175 for every 50 absentee ballot request forms she picked up, and said Dowless instructed her to fill in blanks for races on the ballots she took in.\n\nAfter the election, Dowless reportedly told his hires not to admit to the illegal ballot collection. A typed-out form, which Britt said Dowless gave her, instructed ballot collectors to refuse to testify to investigators and to plead the Fifth if necessary.\n\nThe national Republican Party, led by Trump, has often baselessly accused Democrats of stealing elections. But the North Carolina case shows Republicans doing just that \u2014 at the same time as the national party pushes for laws to restrict voting to help them win elections.\n\nHarris is also a Republican very much in the bigoted mold of Trump. Harris has said Muslims worship \"the anti-Christ,\" argued Jews and Muslims should convert to Christianity, and once delivered a sexist sermon that said women should be subservient.\n\nDemocrats in the House leadership have said they would refuse to seat Harris until the election dispute is resolved.\n\nAs Republicans desperately tried to keep control of Congress in the 2018 midterms, they lied and pushed absurd fantasies about Democrats stealing elections.\n\nWhen the dust settled, they still lost \u2014 and the only race actually stolen was a scheme put together by Republican operatives.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Angela Paxton, a Republican who just happens to be the wife of the sitting state Attorney General Ken Paxton, has introduced a bill to increase the power of her husband's office in a way that uniquely benefits her husband.\n\nBack in July 2015, while he was already the sitting attorney general of Texas, Paxton was indicted on three separate securities fraud felonies. One of those was a charge for acting as an investment adviser when he wasn't registered. Paxton was soliciting clients and taking a commission for those clients, but he had never registered to do so with the state securities board.\n\nPaxton has already faced civil consequences, having been disciplined by the Texas State Securities Board. He's still awaiting his criminal trial, but has managed to get the trial pushed back several times. The last trial date was for December 2017, but that date came and went \u2014 and Paxton made it through the 2018 election while still under indictment.\n\nPaxton's wife is now a sitting state senator, having just gotten elected in 2018. And one of her very first efforts upon taking office was to introduce a bill that expands the power of the attorney general to allow people to work as investment advisers without having to register with the state securities board.\n\nIn other words, Angela Paxton wants to give her husband the power to exempt people from having to follow the rule that led to his existing criminal charges.\n\nThe ostensible idea behind the bill is that it helps the financial tech sector by letting entrepreneurs apply to the attorney general's office for an exemption to push their products rather than having to go through the existing securities registration process.\n\nAngela Paxton also comically declared that her bill would strengthen consumer protection. It is unclear how a measure that would exempt advisers from basic regulations would somehow protect the customers of those advisers.\n\nIndeed, Angela Paxton engaged in some very impressive doublespeak to justify that view:\n\nThe state agencies that have regulatory oversight of financial institutions and consumer protection laws will provide appropriate regulatory support within the sandbox to ensure that consumers are protected.\n\nActual securities experts disagree with her, noting this is a \"fairly aggressive\" exception that gives an \"uncomfortable level\" of discretion to the attorney general.\n\nIt also removes the approval process from the state securities specialists \u2014 the people who are experts in approving such things \u2014 and gives it to Ken Paxton, who is not at all an expert.\n\nEven if this were an incredibly innovative and necessary move, you'd think that both of the Paxtons would stay far away from it, given how unsavory it all seems.\n\nBut you'd be wrong.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump repeatedly lied about the affair and the payoffs.\n\n\"It now appears that President Trump\u2019s other attorneys \u2014 at the White House and in private practice \u2014 may have provided false information about these payments to federal officials,\" Cummings wrote.\n\nCohen has already been sentenced to three years in prison for these actions. Cummings noted that Cohen admitted in his guilty plea that he was directed by Trump to make the payments to influence the outcome of the election.\n\nTrump's other lawyers may have done the same, Cummings noted. \"This raises significant questions about why some of the President\u2019s closest advisers made these false claims and the extent to which they too were acting at the direction of, or in coordination with, the President,\" he wrote.\n\nCummings is demanding that the Trump administration provide documents related to the hush money payouts. So far, they have not released the information despite the criminal and ethical implications.\n\nTrump has already been implicated in violating federal campaign finance law, and the subsequent cover-up of that violation \u2014 including lying to federal officials \u2014 has already led to convictions and guilty pleas of members of Trump's inner circle.\n\nThe new information further implicates Trump as being at the center of a network of criminality that has cast a growing shadow over his unpopular presidency.\n\nUnder Republicans, these violations of the public trust and American law were given a complete pass. Under Cummings' leadership, the truth is coming to light.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The very day Trump declared his unnecessary national emergency, two public interest groups filed lawsuits. More are on the way.\n\nTrump is already facing at least two lawsuits over his unnecessary wall, and there are more on the way.\n\nEven before he officially declared a national emergency in an unhinged rant, it was clear that there were going to be lawsuits. Yes, plural.\n\nAnd it isn't like he didn't know he'd get sued. He said so Friday, when he announced the emergency. He also said that he \"didn't need to do this,\" a statement that somewhat undercut his assertion there was an emergency.\n\nNow, there are two lawsuits and the promise of at least one more, and that doesn't include the fact that the House Judiciary Committee has already said they are going to investigate as well.\n\nThe first two lawsuits came from public interest groups. On Friday \u2014 the same day the \"emergency\" was announced \u2014 Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) sued the Department of Justice (DOJ). Their lawsuit alleges that the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) didn't provide any documents that explain the legal authority Trump has to make the national emergency declaration.\n\nCREW had requested those documents from DOJ back in early January and also requested an expedited review given that everyone has a significant interest in knowing, sooner rather than later, the underlying legal basis for Trump declaring a national emergency. The OLC denied expedited review and told CREW that they wouldn't even make the normal deadline of 20 working days. So, CREW sued to get those documents.\n\nThe American people shouldn't be in the dark about a matter as important as this. CREW's lawsuit seeks to shed some light by asking the court to order the DOJ to provide those documents, including legal opinions, immediately.\n\nFriday's other lawsuit was filed by Public Citizen on behalf of Texas landowners and an environmental group. The landowners are people who have been informed that the wall will be built on their property.\n\nTaking their property to build the wall is theoretically permissible under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which allows the government to exercise eminent domain and take private property for public use. However, conservatives are generally virulently opposed to such a thing.\n\nTrump likes the idea just fine though.\n\nPublic Citizen's lawsuit isn't just about the taking of land. It also challenges the idea that there is a national emergency at all. Migration at the southern border is not an unforeseen emergency, for example. And most important of all: \"[A] disagreement between the President and Congress about how to spend money does not constitute an emergency authorizing unilateral executive action.\"\n\nAnd there's another lawsuit getting teed up. California announced on Friday that they're planning on suing. It looks like at least four other states \u2014 Hawaii, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Oregon \u2014 will join the suit.\n\nTrump may be confident that he'll find a sympathetic ear at the Supreme Court that he's already stacked with two extremely conservative judges, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. With Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, along with Chief Justice John Roberts, there are, regrettably, five votes to back Trump's most absurd and vicious impulses. That's exactly what they did in the travel ban case.\n\nHere's hoping that Chief Justice John Roberts' desire to maintain the independence of the judicial branch comes through and Trump eventually gets told he can't use a national emergency to get his pointless wall.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump spent Monday morning watching 'Fox & Friends' and angrily tweeting insane things.\n\nForgive us if you've heard this one before, but Trump spent his Monday morning angrily tweeting the dumb things he watched right-wing guests spew on \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nThe rage tweets began before 7 a.m., when Trump tweeted a comment from reporter Ken Dilanian \u2014 who works for NBC News, an outlet Trump has repeatedly called \"fake news.\" Dilanian said the Senate Intelligence Committee has not found any \"direct\" evidence of collusion from their two-year investigation. (Democrats widely reject this characterization of the investigation, and say there is plenty of evidence to suggest collusion.)\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump went on to baselessly accuse two men he appointed, and who Senate Republicans confirmed to key administration roles, of engaging in treason.\n\n\"Wow, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe,\" Trump tweeted. \"He was fired for lying, and now his story gets even more deranged. He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by Jeff Sessions (another beauty), look like they were planning a very illegal act, and got caught.\"\n\nTrump continued, \"There is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the Military, Vets, Economy and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous 'insurance policy' in full action!\"\n\nLet's break these two insane tweets down.\n\nFirst, Trump is clearly upset by the \"60 Minutes\" interview with McCabe that aired Sunday night, in which McCabe said that Trump believed Russian President Vladimir Putin over the American intelligence community \u2014 which can be argued is a treasonous act in and of itself.\n\nAnd far be it for us to defend Sessions, but Trump trying to distance himself from one of his top campaign surrogates is really rich.\n\nAnd Trump is delusional if he thinks Americans \"elected a president who they really like\" when Trump won. Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million votes, and public polls show that his approval rating has hovered in the high 30 percent to low 40 percent rage \u2014 dismal for a president halfway through his first term.\n\nThe tweet storm didn't end there. Trump sent off two more tweets.\n\nThe first praised \"Fox & Friends\" for its analysis \u2014 suggesting the president who claimed he doesn't have time to watch TV was plopped in front of the tube.\n\nAnd the last was a botched quote from Fox News regular Dan Bongino \u2014 who has run three failed bids for office and now peddles fake conspiracy theories on television.\n\n\"'This was an illegal coup attempt on the President of the United States.' Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends True!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nAfter his crazy tweet spree, Trump hopped in a car and headed to his West Palm Beach golf club.\n\nAll in all, a very productive morning for a president dealing with a \"national emergency.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Even Trump's most obedient lackeys are saying a national emergency declaration to build a wall is going too far.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-ME) will gleefully vote to put a belligerent alleged attempted rapist on the Supreme Court, but even she can't stomach the idea of Trump declaring a national emergency to build a border wall.\n\nCollins said it would be a mistake to declare a national emergency in this case, would undermine the role of Congress, and would be \"of dubious constitutionality.\"\n\nThe statement came just before Trump's Friday morning declaration of a national emergency as a way to pilfer billions of dollars to build a wall. Trump made the announcement after signing a funding bill that contained far less money than he demanded.\n\nBut before Trump officially declared a national emergency, criticism for the plan came from all corners of Congress.\n\nIn a surprise to few, Democrats lambasted the plan as \"crazy,\" \"ridiculous,\" and \"a gross abuse of the power.\" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said of Trump \"being a failed politician who can't persuade Congress or the public or Mexico to pay for your racist wall may be a blow to your ego, but it's most certainly not a national emergency.\"\n\nBut Trump also received an unusually high level of criticism from members of his own party. Rep. Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (R-WA) said Trump was \"circumventing Congress and Article I of the Constitution,\" and setting a dangerous precedent.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) also has concerns about Trump's authority to make such a declaration, saying, \"no crisis justifies violating the Constitution.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) echoed this criticism, noting, \"The Constitution's pretty clear: spending originates and is directed by Congress, so I'm not really for\" Trump's emergency declaration.\n\nEven Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), a member of the GOP's Senate leadership, criticized the move as \"a dangerous step.\"\n\nWhile many Republicans focused on the danger or lack of authority Trump has to do what he wants to do, others were more blunt. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) said, \"I never thought that was a good idea. I still don't.\"\n\nRep. Tom Reed (R-NY) called the plan an inappropriate way to bypass Congress.\n\nRep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) called the decision both a mistake and a dangerous precedent.\n\nWhile it is easy to send out a press release attacking an unconstitutional power grab by Trump, the real test for Republicans will come when Congress takes action.\n\nCongress has the authority to terminate a presidential emergency declaration. And several members of Congress have indicated they will seek to use that authority. If the Democratic-controlled House passes a such a resolution, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must hold a vote on it within a few weeks.\n\nIn the past, Republicans have preened in front of the camera with concerns about Trump only to back down when it came time to take action. In a joint statement, Pelosi and Schumer called on Republican colleagues to join Democrats to defend the Constitution against Trump's \"unlawful declaration.\"\n\nBut if past actions are any indicator, it is unlikely Republicans in Congress will do a thing.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Lindsey Graham is pushing a false conspiracy theory to try to protect Trump.\n\nLindsey Graham is back at it again, using his position as chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee to try and run defense for his BFF, Trump.\n\nOne day after a judge ruled that former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort violated his plea agreement when he lied to federal agents, Graham announced he's going to conduct an investigation into a conspiracy theory surrounding former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\n\nTrump and his defenders on Fox News have tried to claim that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant used to wiretap Page \u2014 who has documented Russian ties and has given bizarre interviews on cable news \u2014 is evidence of some kind of bias against the Trump campaign by the FBI.\n\nAnd now Graham is reopening that ridiculous conspiracy in yet another attempt to get the attention off of Trump.\n\nGraham is hinging the investigation on an interview former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe gave to CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" in which McCabe revealed that he was concerned Trump or other officials in Trump's orbit would try to shut down the Russia investigation to cover up their efforts to collude with Russia during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"After Mr. McCabe's '60 Minutes' interview, it is imperative that he, and others, come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to fully explain how and why a FISA warrant was issued against Carter Page and answer questions about what appears to be, now more than ever, bias against President Trump,\" Graham said in the statement.\n\nA year ago, the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 then run by Republicans \u2014 issued a bizarre report about the Page surveillance, claiming it was based on information from the infamous Steele dossier and thus was somehow improper and proof that the FBI was out to get Trump from the start.\n\nHowever Democrats have said the Page FISA warrant was also based on other things \u2014 including that the Russian intelligence operatives had tried to recruit Page in 2013, long before he was hired by the Trump campaign.\n\nBut all of this brouhaha aside, the Page FISA warrant is merely a smokescreen for Republicans seeking to muddy the waters and protect Trump, as Page was not the reason the Russia investigation was launched in the first place. Trump can thank his former aide George Papadopoulos for that.\n\nAnd no matter how much Graham or other Republicans try and run interference for Trump, polls show the public continues to trust that Mueller's team will come out with the truth.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Rather than answer the question, Trump lashed out at Acosta's employer, CNN.\n\n\"You're CNN, you\u2019re fake news,\" Trump said. \"You have an agenda. The numbers that you gave are wrong.\"\n\nBut while Trump later claimed that he gets his statistics from the Department of Homeland Security, Acosta was correct about what DHS numbers say about border crossings \u2014 which means Trump was smearing his own administration's crime statistics as \"fake news.\"\n\nBrian Karem, White House correspondent for Playboy, followed up by asking Trump to \"clarify where you get your numbers\" on this subject.\n\n\"Most of the DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] crime reporting statistics we see show that drugs are coming across at the points of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down,\" Karem pointed out. \"So what do you base your facts on?\u201d\n\nAfter a tense back-and-forth in which Trump yelled at Karem to \"sit down,\" he finally replied, \"I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily.\"\n\n\"So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying?\" Karem asked.\n\n\"I use many stats,\" Trump repeated vaguely, \"but I also use Homeland Security.\"\n\nSince Trump claims to use Homeland Security information, here is what U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, which is part of DHS, said in December 2017: \"In FY17, CBP recorded the lowest level of illegal cross-border migration on record, as measured by apprehensions along the border and inadmissible encounters at U.S. ports of entry.\"\n\nForbes noted that Trump officials often cherry-pick data from 2017 and 2018 to claim that illegal border crossings are skyrocketing, but that this just doesn't represent reality.\n\nThis trend of decreasing border crossings also tracks with broader immigration patterns since 1980, Forbes points out: \"Border Patrol apprehensions along the Southwest border plummeted by approximately 80%, from a high of over 1.6 million in FY 2000, to around 300,000 in FY 2017. (Apprehensions are considered a proxy for illegal entry, so the fewer apprehensions, the less illegal entry.)\"\n\nAs for Trump's desire to link all immigrants to an increase of criminal activity, Acosta was correct: Immigrants \u2014 whether documented or undocumented \u2014 commit crimes at a lower rate than those born in the United States.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal puts an even finer point on it: While the number of undocumented immigrants tripled between 1990 and 2013, violent crimes in the U.S. declined by 48 percent in the same period.\n\nAs for drugs coming into the country, CPB also does, in fact say most drugs are smuggled through points of entry \u2014 something a wall would do nothing to stop.\n\nTrump is so desperate to build a wall that he even refuses to accept official data from his own government.\n\nAnd when informed reporters call him out for his willful ignorance, Trump just can't handle it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump heaped praise on right-wing propagandists after a reporter asked him whether they influenced his decision to declare a bogus 'national emergency.'\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s rambling, incoherent Rose Garden diatribe on Friday to promote his bogus \u201cnational emergency\u201d declaration, a reporter asked him whether right-wing pundits had influenced his decision to declare an emergency in order to get around Congress and build a border wall.\n\n\"Could you tell us to what degree some of the outside conservative voices helped to shape your views on this national emergency?\" asked NBC's Kelly O'Donnell.\n\nTrump immediately responded by showering praise on Fox News host Sean Hannity \u2014 a serial liar who has been repeatedly caught pushing bigoted stories and smears \u2014 for leading the way on the right-wing agenda Trump pursues.\n\n\"Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do,\" Trump gushed.\n\n\"Not of me,\" he added quickly. \"If I changed my views he wouldn't be with me.\"\n\nTrump then went on to describe the consistently racist Rush Limbaugh, who once called a 13-year-old Chelsea Clinton \"the White House dog,\" as \"a great guy,\" and marveled at his ability to \"speak for three hours without a phone call\" in front of \"one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world.\"\n\nAfter Trump continued to swoon over Limbaugh's broadcasting skills, O'Donnell interrupted him to ask if figures like Hannity or Limbaugh are deciding policy.\n\n\"They don't decide policy,\" Trump insisted, adding that if he \"went opposite\" from the ideas they support, they would not go along with him.\n\nWhile Trump said that they don't \"decide\" policy, his effusive praise for Hannity and Limbaugh when asked about their influence on his policy painted a much different picture.\n\nAnd by insisting that these pundits would stop supporting him if he made decisions they didn't like, Trump accidentally confessed the truth: that he knows the right-wing figures he so admires might abandon him if he doesn't do what they want.\n\nIn reality, though, it takes a lot for these pundits to abandon Trump. And the influence clearly goes both ways.\n\nContrary to what Trump said, Hannity quickly changed his tune and supported Trump's decision to sign a bill funding the government after fuming about it at first. The New York Times reported that the Trump White House reached out to Hannity and Fox Business host Lou Dobbs to get them on board with the funding deal.\n\nAt the same time, Hannity and other right-wing media hotheads saw Trump dance to their tune as he invoked the \"national emergency\" declaration that they have been insisting on for months.\n\nAfter celebrating Hannity and Limbaugh, Trump also praised columnist Ann Coulter because \"she said 'Donald Trump'\" when she was asked who would win the 2016 election. He also said Laura Ingraham, one of his most loyal attack dogs, is \"great,\" and that Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a favorite of white supremacists, \"has been great.\"\n\nTrump has long relied on right-wing media to do much of his thinking for him, enlisting Hannity in particular as an informal presidential adviser with frequent telephone calls.\n\nTrump's decisions to engage in destructive behavior, like shutting down the government or declaring a national emergency, have largely been based on the ranting he watches on Fox during his so-called \u201cexecutive time.\u201d\n\nIn exchange, right-wing media outlets have become Trump\u2019s reliable propagandists, attacking his political enemies and legitimate reporters while unquestioningly promoting his administration\u2019s destructive policies and rhetoric.\n\nTrump owes his political career in large part to the right-wing press, since he used his frequent appearances on Fox News to promote his racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory against President Barack Obama.\n\nTrump has now used the presidency to completely enshrine the most extreme right-wing voices that are the most detached from reality as the senior shapers of American policy. Their fingerprints are all over ideas of Trump's that have disrupted the lives of millions of people.\n\nIn many instances, thanks to Trump, these absurd figures have far more influence than government agencies and departments staffed with high-level experts.\n\nThanks to Trump, people like Hannity and Limbaugh are now running the country.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Mark Pocan (D-WI) pointed out, was \"likely at the EXACT same time 800,000 federal employees were without pay.\"\n\nPocan is referring to the 35-day Trump shutdown, during which Trump repeatedly refused to sign legislation to reopen the government and pay workers unless Democrats paid a $5.7 billion ransom for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe Post noted that Trump complained to friends about not being able to play golf in Florida during the government shutdown.\n\nBut while Trump was buying himself a fancy new toy to pass the time, 1 in 4 federal workers were forced to visit a food pantry just to be able to feed themselves and their families.\n\nAccording to the Post, Trump paid for the new toy himself. The $50,000 price tag is more than 80 percent of what a median American household earns in an entire year.\n\nA recent survey showed that nearly half of federal workers fell behind on paying their bills during the shutdown \u2014 all thanks to Trump's refusal to abandon his obsession with a border wall.\n\nTrump has already built a reputation as one of the laziest presidents in American history. A recent release of Trump's private schedules shows he spent 60 percent of the working day in \"executive time,\" a euphemism created by the White House to describe the time Trump wastes watching television and playing on Twitter.\n\nAnd Trump was already abandoning work nearly every weekend to spend time playing golf at Trump-branded properties in Florida or New Jersey. Despite attacking President Obama for playing the occasional round of golf, Trump plays more than twice as many rounds as Obama, according to a Washington Post analysis.\n\nNow Trump can spend even more time playing golf instead of working, in the comfort of his taxpayer-subsidized home \u2014 and hide his laziness from Americans by doing it during his \"executive time\" routine.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Not because it was a campaign promise ... [but] because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country,\" Trump said in a rambling speech at the White House, one day after Congress rebuked him by appropriating just $1.375 billion for \"pedestrian fencing\" on a small area of the border \u2014 not a wall, and far less than the unrestricted $5 billion Trump had been demanding.\n\nTrump's speech was a mess, as he rambled on about drugs and unsubstantiated stories of women being duct taped at the border, interspersed with incoherent asides.\n\n\"I'm going to be signing a national emergency,\" Trump finally managed to get out, going on to defend his action as something previous presidents have done.\n\nBut previous presidents have declared national emergencies for real emergencies like natural disasters \u2014 not to unilaterally reappropriate funds for a useless, years-long construction project that Congress rejected.\n\nIn a call with reporters before the speech, a senior administration official tried to claim that this emergency declaration wasn't really an attempt to circumvent Congress.\n\n\"it's not as if he didn't just get what he wanted so he's waving a magic wand and getting money,\" the senior administration official said on the call.\n\nBut when pressed on how that could be the case, the official had no good response \u2014 because, of course, this is exactly what Trump is trying to do.

The House will almost certainly vote to block Trump's order, and there's a good chance the Senate will, too \u2014 handing Trump yet another loss.\n\nTrump, though, is likely to veto that decision, which will spur legal challenges that experts say the White House is destined to lose.\n\n\"They will win,\" lawyer George Conway, the outspoken Trump critic and husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, tweeted on Thursday \u2014 referring to the groups that will sue Trump over the emergency declaration.\n\nTrump's schedule shows that after announcing the national emergency, he will have some down time before jetting down to his Mar-a-Lago resort with first lady Melania Trump.\n\nAh yes, a national emergency indeed.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump has yet to master the art of dealing with Democrats in power.\n\nWhen Trump signed a funding bill on Friday afternoon, it was the third time in less than a month that he backed down and caved to the demands of congressional Democrats.\n\nTrump's surrender on the funding bill capped an eight-week saga of political battles against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. From the outset, he stumbled and was outmaneuvered by Democrats at every single turn.\n\nIn mid-December, Trump threw his first of many tantrums demanding Congress hand over $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats, fresh off a resounding victory in the November midterm election, balked at the idea, telling him in no uncertain terms that he would not get the money.\n\nIn a televised White House meeting, he was easily goaded by Schumer into accepting responsibility for a government shutdown if Democrats refused to pay the $5.7 billion ransom. Trump went so far as to brag that he would be \"proud\" to own a shutdown.\n\nTrue to their word, Democrats did not support $5.7 billion for a border wall. And Trump initiated what would become the longest shutdown in government history, lasting 35 days.\n\nWhen Pelosi took over as speaker of the House in January, one of her first orders of business was to pass a bill to reopen the government. But Trump, enabled by Republican accomplices in the Senate, rebuffed numerous attempts to end the shutdown.\n\nKnowing Trump's love of being on television, Pelosi sent a letter to the White House suggesting that, because of the shutdown, the State of the Union should be postponed until he reopened the government. She offered to work with him on an alternative date, and off-handedly mentioned that Trump could just give his speech from the Oval Office.\n\nIn childlike fashion, Trump fumed and forced Pelosi and other members of Congress to cancel a planned trip to Afghanistan by refusing them use of military planes. But Pelosi stood strong and formally rescinded Trump's invitation to give the State of the Union in the House chamber. Trump caved, giving in to Pelosi's demand.\n\nTwo days after his first surrender, Trump suffered a humiliating defeat as he was forced to sign a bill reopening the government without a single penny for the border wall he is so obsessed with. But the funding was temporary, giving Congress three weeks to work together on a long-term funding bill. If there was no agreement, then the government would shut down at midnight on Friday, Feb. 15.\n\nTrump did everything he could to threaten, beg, and plead with Congress to get $5.7 billion for a wall. Instead, the bill Trump signed Friday afternoon, in his third surrender to Democratic demands, contains less than $1.4 billion for not a wall, but some fencing in limited areas along the Texas border. In fact, it is less funding than Democrats were willing to agree to before the shutdown.\n\nIn a transparent attempt to distract from his string of failures, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border. The White House argues that with this declaration, Trump can pilfer money from the military to build his wall, without the approval of Congress.\n\nThe declaration was met with widespread criticism, even from some of Trump's staunchest Republican allies, before Trump even announced it.\n\nDemocrats have been in charge of one half of one branch of government for a month and a half. And in that time, they have already forced Trump to give in to their demands on three major issues.\n\nDespite Trump's boasts of being the world's greatest dealmaker, he has yet to master the art of dealing with Democrats in power.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "What did we just watch?\n\nIf you could decipher even half of what Trump said in his national emergency declaration speech Friday morning, well, congrats!\n\nTrump's national emergency declaration was a roughly 25-minute-long unhinged rant, in which he interspersed dark and often false stories about crime at the border with braggadocios chatter about how the economy, stock market and relationships with other nations are doing so well under his watch.\n\nWithin his chaotic \"remarks,\" Trump attempted to talk about how the wall will pay for itself, but he never actually explained how the wall will pay for itself \u2014because he totally veered off course into defending Customs officers.\n\n\"We would be able to make up the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people, we wouldn't need all of this incredible talent some of whom are sitting in the first row,\" Trump said. \"We would get thousands of law enforcement people including border patrol you put them in different areas doing different things.\"\n\n\"So, that's the story,\" Trump says at the end of that particular jag, never actually laying out how that pays for the wall.\n\nTrump also went on an extended riff about how Chinese President Xi Jinping uses the death penalty to help combat a drug crisis, lamenting the fact that he doesn't have that tool at his disposal \u2014 despite having signed a criminal justice reform bill last year that lessened penalties for drug crimes.\n\n\"They're criminal list a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our criminal list a drug dealer gets a thing called how about a fine?\" Trump said, referring to China's efforts to combat drugs.\n\nBut the best of the bizarre moments may have come when Trump explained how the federal court system works, and how a likely lawsuit against his emergency declaration would play out.\n\nIn a sing-song voice, Trump said:\n\nWe will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the 9th Circuit, even though it shouldn't be there, and we will possibly get a bad ruling. and then we'll get another bad ruling. And then we'll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we'll get a fair shake, and we'll win in the Supreme Court, just like the [travel] ban, they sued us in the 9th Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won, and it was very interesting.\"\n\nTrump later took questions after his emergency declaration speech, which were even more insane than the rambling speech he gave.\n\nAside from yelling at the press, he claimed that he didn't know racist right-wing pundit Ann Counter \u2014 one of his earliest and most fervent supporters.\n\n\"They have somebody, Ann Coulter. I don't know her,\" Trump said. \"I hardly know her. I haven't spoken to her in way over a year.\"\n\nHe also helped opponents of the national emergency declaration build their case against him in the courts, saying the quiet part out loud: that the only reason he signed the declaration was because Congress didn't give him what he wanted in terms of border wall funding.\n\n\"I went through Congress and made a deal ... but I'm not happy with it,\" Trump said.\n\nLater, Trump added that he \"didn't need to do this,\" referencing the emergency declaration, but that he \"just want to get it done faster, that's all.\"\n\nYou could almost hear the lawyers at the Department of Justice who will be forced to defend his emergency declaration screaming for it to end.\n\nSo, what did we learn from all of this?\n\nIt appears the biggest national emergency this country faces is having an unhinged Trump in the White House. SOS.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump has no idea what human trafficking actually looks like \u2014 but he's happy to make up stories about it to push for his wall.\n\nFear-mongering has always been Trump's go-to strategy for drumming up support for his racist border wall. He constantly lies about immigrants bringing drugs, disease, and terrorism into the country \u2014 but his new favorite boogeyman is human trafficking.\n\nTrump has started telling frightening tales about women being kidnapped and brought over the border and arguing that a border wall would somehow solve this problem. In just the past two weeks, Trump has told repeated stories about women being \"thrown into vehicles\" with \"tape over their mouths\" and transported through illegal entry ports.\n\n\"They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs,\" Trump said in a speech Monday. \"They put them in the back seat of cars and vans, and they go \u2014 they don\u2019t come in through your port of entry, because you\u2019d see them. You couldn\u2019t do that.\"\n\nBut according to trafficking experts, Trump's tales are so misleading that they more closely resemble depictions from \"action films\" than anything seen in real life.\n\nThe Toronto Star spoke with six trafficking experts from around the country, all of whom said they had met \"no trafficking victims who had suffered anything like the experience Trump described.\"\n\n\"Either he\u2019s watching action films or he\u2019s watching some other type of movie that involves handcuffs and tape over people\u2019s mouths,\" Lori Cohen, director of an anti-trafficking organization, told the Star. \"But in neither case is it based in any reality of what individuals helping trafficking victims see.\"\n\nMartina Vandenberg, president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center, told the Star that Trump's depiction of the problem \"is practically unrecognizable to those of us who have spent decades in the trenches combating these abuses.\"\n\nOther experts provided similar accounts.\n\n\"I have never had a case where someone\u2019s mouth was taped up and they were brought across the border in the way the president described,\" said Bridgette Carr, director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School.\n\nAs for Trump's claim that a border wall could \"eliminate\" human trafficking from Mexico, experts said this isn't even close to accurate.\n\nMost trafficking victims fall prey to verbal coercion in which traffickers promise them a better life in the U.S. Then, after arriving in the country and realizing that the jobs they were promised don't exist, victims are kept against their will through threats, violence, or a combination of both.\n\nMany victims \"arrive on visas fraudulently obtained by traffickers. Others are exploited by traffickers after they independently arrive in the U.S. on visas,\" the Star reported. \"None of these people would be helped by a wall.\"\n\nNot only would Trump's border fail to address the problem of human trafficking, but his policies are actually making life harder for the victims he claims to care about.\n\nFor example, as the Star noted, the Trump's administration has slashed the number of visas available to protect trafficking victims from deportation if they cooperate with law enforcement.\n\nAs one expert told the publication, if Trump cares about solving the problem of human trafficking, he should stop implementing policies that \"play into the hands of the pimps.\"\n\nBut Trump doesn't care about addressing the problem \u2014 he cares about his border wall, and he's willing to lie, fear-monger, and exploit victims to get it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Unlike Trump, the White House National Drug Control Strategy doesn't say that a border wall will help tackle issues like the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe Trump administration released its first official drug control strategy Thursday \u2014 and not once does it suggest that building a border wall might help curb drug addiction or the opioid crisis, undermining one of Trump's key arguments in favor of a wall.\n\nThe report, the National Drug Control Strategy, lays out an array of policies to reduce \"illicit drug use through education and evidence-based prevention programs.\" But not one of those policies includes building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe report does mention drugs coming into the country in ways a wall would not prevent, such as through the mail. But Newsweek points out that the words \"wall\" and \"barrier\" are never mentioned in the same context that Trump uses them.\n\nThe report's silence on a border wall speaks volumes about Trump's repeated, absurd claims that such a wall is needed to stop illegal drugs from flowing into the country from Mexico.\n\nTrump shut down the federal government for 35 days demanding Congress pay a $5.7 billion ransom to build Trump's wall. During the shutdown, Trump repeatedly invoked illegal drugs as a scare tactic to try to convince Americans to support the wall.\n\nIn his first prime-time Oval Office address to the nation, Trump claimed a wall was needed to prevent drugs like heroin from entering the country. At the time, fact-checkers pointed out that most drugs coming across the border actually travel through ports of entry, hidden among legal goods \u2014 so a wall wouldn't stop them.\n\nThe issue came up again earlier this week when a record amount of fentanyl was seized at the U.S.-Mexico border. Even though the 254 pounds of drugs were found in a tractor-trailer stopped for inspection at a legal border crossing, Republicans and White House officials bizarrely claimed the drug bust was evidence that a border wall is needed.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's national security team testified before Congress on Tuesday about top national security threats facing the country. As the Washington Post pointed out, not a single official said there was a crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIt's not surprising that the shutdown ended with Trump getting no money for his wall. It's an obviously unnecessary waste of money, and a racist symbol to boot.\n\nBut Trump still isn't willing to face reality. He desperately wants to build a border wall \u2014 but his excuses for building one make so little sense that even his own administration can't defend them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Beto O'Rourke (D-TX), who also held a rally protesting Trump's racist border wall and his policy of stealing migrant children from their families.\n\n\"A young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first name, he is, he has challenged us.

He didn't have to lie about how many people came to his rally, or to O'Rourke's event. But Trump regularly exaggerates his crowd sizes, and he did so again Monday night.\n\nThis time, the lie was quickly debunked by a local fire department.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Mike Rogers (R-MI) said on CNN Friday morning.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell got played in the government funding deal that passed Congress Thursday night.\n\nAt least, that's what a former Republican member of Congress said Friday morning on CNN \u2014 though in much more graphic terms.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re watching Mitch McConnell eat a manure sandwich in this whole process,\u201d former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) said \u2014 referring to the fact that McConnell meekly raised the white flag and capitulated to Trump's demand to declare an unnecessary national emergency to obtain wall funds Congress denied him in the deal.\n\nMcConnell initially opposed a national emergency declaration, knowing that Congress would likely overturn the declaration via a resolution \u2014 which would be yet another embarrassing loss for Trump and his administration.\n\nIf Congress doesn't overturn it, the courts might. Critics say Trump's move is a potentially unconstitutional power grab because he is trying to make government spending decisions that the legislative branch didn't agree to.\n\nOn Thursday, however, McConnell totally caved to Trump, saying that he now supports letting Trump use the extreme maneuver in order to build the wall. It was likely McConnell's only option to prevent Trump from recklessly tanking the funding deal and launching yet another devastating shutdown.\n\nTrump is set to announce the use of a national emergency to get his precious wall funding on Friday morning at the White House, before he jets off to his gaudy Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, for a weekend of golf.\n\nYou know \u2014 exactly what a president usually does in a national emergency situation.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump, Pence, and GOP senators used to be very concerned that executive actions about immigration were unconstitutional. But suddenly they're not bothered at all.\n\nEveryone is awaiting Trump's declaration of a national emergency so he can build the wall no one wants.\n\nThe move is a shocking overreach of executive power. It will certainly face massive litigation.\n\nIt's also a move that, not too long ago, both Trump and Mike Pence opposed vehemently.\n\nBack when Barack Obama was president, Trump declared that if Obama took any executive action to stop the deportation of DREAMers, it was not only \"unconstitutional\" but could lead to impeachment. He told \"Fox and Friends\" in November 2014 that using executive action was a \"very, very dangerous thing\" and would be \"overwritten easily by the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\"Fox and Friends\" also fed Trump a softball question about whether Obama had done anything impeachable, opening the door for Trump to say that, yes, \"certainly he could be impeached.\"\n\nAt that same time in 2014, then-governor Mike Pence was also very, very concerned about executive overreach. When speaking to the Republican Governors Association shortly after Obama announced his executive action on immigration, Pence declared that Obama should cooperate with the Senate instead.\n\nBack then, Pence said that issues like immigration needed to be addressed by Congress, rather than the executive branch, because they should \"always be resolved with the consent of the governed.\" Pence went on to say that \"signing an executive order, giving a speech, barnstorming around the country defending that executive order is not leadership.\"\n\nThis consternation over executive action back in 2014 wasn't limited to Trump and Pence. Then-Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, warned that \"the country's going to go nuts, because they're going to see it as a move outside the authority of the president, and it's going to be a very serious situation.\"\n\nNot content with that, Coburn went on to say that you could see instances of anarchy and violence stemming from Obama's efforts to stop the deportation of children.\n\nAnd then there's Mitch McConnell. McConnell has already said that he supports Trump declaring a national emergency to build his wall, which means he approves of Trump going around McConnell's own legislative body.\n\nBut back when Obama wanted to use executive powers to address immigration issues, McConnell piously declared that \"changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes, one by one.\"\n\nMcConnell also said that if Obama issued an executive order, he'd be issuing \"a rebuke to his own stated view of democracy\" and would be rejecting the will of the voters.\n\nIt looks like Trump, Pence, and McConnell have worked through all their reservations, just in time to support Trump's wall.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But the Washington Post reported last month that the Trump administration was looking at raiding $13.9 billion allocated to the Army Corps of Engineers for natural disaster relief. Those funds were intended for rebuilding efforts in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico and Florida, flood management programs in Texas, and wildfire management in California.\n\nOther funds could Department of Defense construction projects, including homes for military families.\n\nNow, Trump wants to use that money for a wall no one wants and that experts say won't have any impact on making the U.S. safer.\n\nCongress does have the authority to override Trump's national emergency declaration. But given that McConnell said he backs Trump's move, it's possible that any efforts by House Democrats to block Trump's efforts could die in the Senate.\n\nOf course, in order to back Trump's emergency declaration, Republicans would be going against the wishes of the vast majority of the public \u2014 as two-thirds of Americans oppose such a move, according to a CBS News poll from early February.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats are already considering their options to fight the emergency declaration, which includes the possibility of filing a legal challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an emergency what\u2019s happening at the border,\" Pelosi said.\n\nEither way, Trump and the GOP got rolled on this border wall funding fight. And now they are reverting to an unpopular emergency declaration that the public doesn't want, and that has the horrible optics of stealing money intended for disaster relief efforts.\n\nSo much winning.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Trump administration's approach to immigrant children is 'characterized by cruelty,' Rep. Judy Chu said.\n\nThe Trump administration is looking to build a new baby jail for immigrant children on top of a toxic waste landfill, according to a new report from environmental organization Earthjustice released on Monday. The new facility, designed to detain 7,500 unaccompanied minors, would be built at Goodfellow Air Force Base (GAFB) in Texas.\n\nThe area planned for the proposed detention center \"is contaminated with lead, arsenic, benzene, PFAS, and other chemicals associated with increased risk of cancer and neurodevelopmental damage,\" Earthjustice wrote. Additional chemicals at the site emit vapors which can cause \"nausea, headaches, and damage to the nervous system, kidneys, and liver.\"\n\nRep. Judy Chu (D-CA), head of the Congressional Asian and Pacific America Caucus and an outspoken critic of Trump's treatment of immigrant children, slammed the administration for their reckless plan.\n\n\"From loopholes that allow them to hire staff without even a background check to this new proposal to build a camp on a toxic dump, the entire approach of this administration towards immigrant children has been characterized by cruelty,\" Chu said in a statement to Shareblue Media.\n\nThe scheme to jail minors on military bases resulted from a June 2018 executive order signed by Trump. The order required the Secretary of Defense \u2014 James Mattis at the time \u2014 to either use existing facilities or construct a new facility if necessary. At the time, the Daily Beast reported GAFB was among the military facilities under consideration.\n\nBut the desire to jail children in such a dangerous environment is not the only example of Trump's inhumane attitude toward immigrants.\n\nTrump's rampant xenophobia hit a peak in the summer of 2018, when his \"zero tolerance\" policy toward immigrants crossing the southern border led to his administration taking thousands of children away from their parents.\n\nIn one of the darkest moments in modern American history, the Trump administration built baby jails to detain infants and toddlers, some of whom were literally ripped from their mothers' arms. Investigations found hundreds of kids held in \"unregulated child prisons,\" according to Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR).\n\nShowing a callous disregard for the children's well-being, the Trump administration didn't bother to track many of the families, resulting in lengthy delays when the administration was forced to reunite them.\n\nRather than seek a more compassionate immigration policy, Trump is doubling down on cruelty. If the administration follows through on their plans to build a detention center atop a toxic waste dump, it will be \"another cruel, misguided, and intentional action that will compound the irreparable damage to the physical and mental well-being of thousands of migrant children being separated from their parents at the border,\" Laura M. Esquivel, director of National Advocacy for Hispanic Federation, told the Daily Beast.\n\nAs members of Congress, Chu and Merkley are not content to merely lambast the administration, they are also determined to hold them accountable. The pair introduced legislation \"to end the detention of immigrant children and stop dangerous facilities from existing at all,\" Chu told Shareblue Media.\n\nThe bill, the Shut Down Child Prison Camps Act, is straightforward: It would shut down unregulated child prison camps for children.\n\nIn a Feb. 7 press statement about the bill, Chu said she was horrified by what she saw when she visited a child prison camp in Tornillo. \"I will never forget the lines of children being forced by guards to march in a single-file line just to go to the bathroom because they were not allowed to go anywhere on their own,\" she said.\n\n\"Our taxpayer dollars are being used to traumatize children by keeping them in child prison camps instead of in homes and communities,\" Merkley said in a press release about the bill. \"This is evil.\"\n\nPerhaps even more evil is building these child prison camps at toxic waste landfills.\n\n\"Migrant children fleeing desperate conditions do not belong in cages,\" writes Earthjustice, \"let alone chemically polluted cages.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos went to Stoneman Douglas High for a photo op, but then refused to speak with concerned students.\n\n\"You came to our school just for publicity and avoided our questions,\" wrote student Aly Sheehy, criticizing DeVos.\n\nThese slights were among the reasons some of the students cited for why they would not attend a White House photo op that had been mounted in response to the tragedy.\n\nTrump is the NRA's lackey. The extremist gun organization spent $35 million in 2016 to elect Trump, and he and Mike Pence have vowed to be the organization's allies \u2014 even though the NRA is losing money and becoming politically toxic thanks to the Parkland teens' activism.\n\nThe NRA owns Trump \u2014 and he acts like it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

It didn't go very well for Whitaker.\n\nThere was the part where Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) asked him about Trump's family separation policy, and he tried to deny it even existed, relenting only after she read him a memo about that policy.\n\nAnd there was also the part where he tried to evade answering a question from the chair of the committee, Rep.

Lucy McBath (D-GA) said, remembering the child she lost to gun violence.\n\nDemocrats passed key gun safety bills out of the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday night \u2014 but only after overcoming 11 hours of delays and obstruction from Republicans.\n\nIf either bill is passed by the full House, it would be the first significant gun safety legislation passed by either chamber of Congress in more than a decade.\n\nYet the GOP tried to stop this progress \u2014 even on the eve of the first anniversary of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida. On that tragic day, 17 students and teachers lost their lives in a matter of minutes.\n\nOne of the bills would require universal background checks on all gun sales \u2014 a move Americans overwhelmingly support because background checks help keep guns out of the hands of criminals and others who should not have them. The other bill would close a loophole in background checks that allowed white supremacist Dylann Roof to get the gun he used to murder nine people at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nRep. Ted Deutch (D-FL), who represents Parkland in Congress, said that if the legislation can prevent one person from harming others with a gun, then \"it will be something we can be proud of.\"\n\n\"A day before the one-year mark of the Parkland shooting, the House is honoring all victims and survivors of gun violence with action,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement.\n\nAs Deutch and Democrats were trying to make the country safer for children, however, Republicans kicked off the Parkland anniversary trying to obstruct those efforts.\n\nThroughout the day on Wednesday, Republicans tried over and over to water down the universal background check bill with an unending stream of amendments. Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-PA) expressed frustration that instead of working with Democrats, \"Republicans are adding more loopholes, which is shameful.\"\n\nRep. Lucy McBath (D-GA), who lost her son Jordan Davis to gun violence more than six years ago, refused to back down in the face of Republican opposition. \"As a survivor of gun violence myself, I refuse to let my colleagues stand here and devalue the importance that this bill has,\" she said.\n\nBut after about 10 hours of this obstruction, the committee finally had the chance to move the first bill forward, and advanced the second one shortly after that.\n\n\"For my son Jordan Davis, I vote aye,\" McBath said in registering her vote \u2014 a powerful moment given that McBath had worked tirelessly as an advocate for gun safety after her son's death, and then ousted an NRA-backed Republican to claim her seat in Congress.\n\nRep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) noted that advocates with Moms Demand Action, a gun safety group, spent all day watching the committee work, and then erupted in applause and tears when the bills were approved by the committee.\n\n\"House leaders are following through on their promise to act to end our nation's gun violence crisis,\" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, said in a statement following the vote. \"Requiring background checks on all gun sales is the first step towards creating a safer future for our children.\"\n\nUniversal background check legislation is just one way Democrats will advance the gun safety agenda. Some members have also introduced legislation to make high-capacity magazines illegal.\n\nThe November 2018 power shift which put Democrats in charge of the House of Representatives is already dramatically changing how Congress handles gun legislation.\n\n\"Despite Republican attempts to put up roadblock after roadblock to derail yesterday's vote on universal background checks, House Democrats made it clear that they have the courage to do what's right to make our communities safer from gun violence by passing H.R. 8 out of the House Judiciary Committee,\" Robin Lloyd, managing director of the gun safety advocacy group Giffords, told Shareblue Media.\n\n\"No longer will we have to rely on the thoughts and prayers of politicians when it comes to addressing gun violence, and we're grateful to the House Democrats for prioritizing this critical public safety issue.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Chuck Grassley (R-IA) asked the Almighty to intervene and prevent Trump from embarking on another disastrous government shutdown.\n\n\"Let's all pray that the president will have wisdom to sign the bill so the government doesn't shut down,\" Grassley pleaded from the Senate floor.\n\nSen. @ChuckGrassley: \"Let's all pray that the president will have wisdom to sign the bill so government doesn't shut down.\" pic.twitter.com/phUQOfdYC7 \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) February 14, 2019\n\nGrassley isn't the only Republican senator leaning upon a higher power to intervene. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters, \"I pray\" Trump signs the bill.\n\nRepublicans stood by Trump during the 35-day shutdown that started in late December 2018, which Trump instigated when he threw a tantrum demanding $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nWhen Democrats refused his demand, Trump pouted, shut down the government, and worked with Republicans to thwart all efforts by Democrats to reopen it. Those five weeks wreaked havoc upon the country.\n\nAround 800,000 federal workers, plus hundreds of thousands of government contractors, went more than a month without receiving a paycheck.\n\nDuring that time, 1 in 4 federal workers impacted by the shutdown were forced to visit a food pantry in order to feed themselves and their families. Many fell behind on their bills, even after digging into their savings and retirement accounts.\n\nAirline workers warned of catastrophic risks to air travel, and air travel was even temporarily halted near the end of the shutdown.\n\nAs the Trump-induced crisis lingered, former Homeland Security secretaries warned that Trump was putting the country's national security at risk.\n\nTrump and his out-of-touch administration did not seem to understand the pain and suffering they were causing. Millionaire Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was baffled that people were struggling after being denied two consecutive paychecks. One Trump advisor said workers might be better off without paychecks. And during all this, Trump spent $50,000 installing a room-sized golf simulator in the residence of the White House.\n\nIn the end, the Trump shutdown cost the U.S. economy $11 billion. Some federal workers are still waiting to receive their back pay, and Trump has still not committed to signing a funding bill this week. If Trump refuses, the government would shut down starting Saturday, Feb. 16.\n\nAfter enabling the recent Trump shutdown, Republicans are backing down, caving to Democratic demands, and begging heavenly forces to prevent Trump from inflicting more pain upon the country.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Brock Long, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, resigned after facing a string of scandals during his brief tenure.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Brock Long announced his resignation as director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. Like so many Trump officials, Long faced a series of scandals during his tenure, primarily focused on his repeated misuse of government resources related to traveling.\n\nRather than use his own car for his personal trips home, Long would often leave Washington on Thursdays \"in a caravan of government-owned vehicles with federal employees,\" to travel 400 miles to his home in North Carolina, according to the Wall Street Journal. His misdeeds cost taxpayers more than $150,000 in staff salary, travel expenses, and vehicle maintenance.\n\nAfter an internal investigation, Long was forced to repay the government for his unethical behavior.\n\nLong was FEMA director during the Trump administration's lackluster response to Hurricane Maria, which ravaged Puerto Rico. After reports came out showing thousands of people died in the aftermath, Trump simply refused to believe the data. Long also refused to accept the findings, claiming \"the numbers are all over the place.\"\n\nIn FEMA's announcement of the resignation, the agency announced that Long's deputy, Peter Gaynor, will become acting director for FEMA. Gaynor becomes yet one more Trump administration official to lead an agency in the \"acting\" capacity rather than through Senate confirmation.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump had seven top roles in his administration filled by acting heads, including acting chief of staff, an acting attorney general, an acting secretary of defense, an acting secretary of the Interior, an acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, and an acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Even Republican members of Congress are concerned about Trump's habit of bypassing the Senate's constitutional role in confirming administration officials.\n\nOne of the reasons Trump must rely on acting heads of agencies is because no one wants to work for him. After chief of staff John Kelly quit, Trump struggled to find a replacement for what was once one of the most sought-after positions in Washington. Trump begged the press to stop saying no one wanted to work for him after several high-profile people publicly stated they did not want to work for him.\n\nMany other top positions remain unfilled. The United States currently has no secretary of defense, for example. The Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency also have \"acting\" leaders in place. FEMA, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, now will be led by someone in an \"acting\" role as well.\n\nIn one of the most chaotic and unstable administrations in modern history, Trump has trouble keeping staff in place. In his first year in office, turnover among top staff was higher than in the past 100 years.\n\nBrock Long joins a long list of Trump administration officials leaving after facing sandal.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "But he's still trying to find someone else to blame for it.\n\nThe GOP suffered a resounding defeat in the 2018 midterm elections, thanks in large part to Democrats' willingness to run hard on health care and shame Republicans for trying to take people's health care away.\n\nNow, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) is finally acknowledging that health care is why his party lost. But he's still not taking responsibility for the failure, trying instead to shift all that blame to the right wing of his caucus and ignoring the truth about just how hard establishment Republicans pushed to kick people off their health insurance.\n\nIn a leaked call to GOP donors obtained by the Washington Post, McCarthy admitted that his party's push to get rid of Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions is what cost Republicans the election.\n\nBut he immediately shifted to saying that the problem wasn't with the GOP as a whole, but rather the Freedom Caucus, the ultra-conservative branch of the House GOP. And he seemed to suggest that repealing Obamacare might have actually worked if not for the Freedom Caucus' meddling.\n\n\"When we couldn\u2019t pass the repeal of Obamacare the first way through, an amendment came because the Freedom Caucus wouldn\u2019t vote for\" the original repeal bill, McCarthy said. \"That amendment put [the] preexisting condition campaign against us, and so even people who are running for the very first time got attacked on that. And that was the defining issue and the most important issue in the race.\"\n\nBoth bills McCarthy referred to, however, would have kicked about 23 million people off their health insurance.\n\nAnd McCarthy is trying hard to bury his own role in the process. For example, during the May 2017 vote to repeal Obamacare, McCarthy read inspirational quotes from General George S. Patton while projecting a picture of him onto a screen in the room, all to get GOP representatives hyped up enough to vote to repeal.\n\nMcCarthy's view on all this is deeply confusing. He blames the entire House loss on health care only, arguing that Republicans really won on the economy, immigration, and social issues.\n\nThere's no real evidence that is the case, and McCarthy's attempt to explain it was laughable:\n\nBut there was one issue we lost overwhelmingly \u2014 it was health care by 66 points. Had we lost health care just by 34 points, we\u2019d still be in the majority. We\u2019d have those other 80,000 votes that we needed.\n\nMcCarthy is missing quite a few zeroes with that number. Democrats won the popular vote by well over 8 million votes and picked up 40 House seats. The 2018 midterms weren't exactly a close race by any metric.\n\nKeep in mind that McCarthy was so unwilling to admit that his party lost the House that he reportedly wished to be called \"Republican leader\" instead of the traditional \"minority leader.\" So it isn't really surprising he'd go looking for someone or something else to pin that loss on.\n\nBlame-shifting and denials aside, it's still amazing to see McCarthy admit that one of the cornerstones of his party's very existence \u2014 the repeal of Obamacare \u2014 turned out to be a complete loser.\n\nOn the call with donors, McCarthy also tried to set himself apart from the losers in the Freedom Caucus and said he'd recruit candidates who will \"find a solution.\" And he made sure to tell the donors he was reaching out to doctors, Navy SEALS, and a former CIA agent to run in 2020.\n\nToo bad for him that none of those people will make the GOP's view on healthcare any less unworkable and morally bankrupt.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's shutdown stunt deprived people of paychecks for 5 weeks, and the effects were devastating.\n\nThe 35-day Trump shutdown caused enormous hardship for federal workers across the country, and a new survey shows just how difficult it was for many people to cope.\n\nNearly half of federal workers who were affected by the shutdown fell behind on one or more of their bills, and a majority were forced to spend all or most of their emergency savings, according to a survey by Prudential.\n\nMore than 1 in 4 surveyed missed a mortgage or rent payment, and 42 percent took on new debt to help make it through the 5-week shutdown.\n\nAnd a quarter of federal workers surveyed said they visited a food bank in order to feed themselves and their families.\n\nThe survey of 350 federal workers impacted by the shutdown, first reported on Tuesday by USA Today, lays bare the hardship Trump forced hundreds of thousands of people to endure for the sake of his obsession with a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nDuring the shutdown, federal workers were denied two paychecks because Trump refused to reopen the government unless he received $5.7 billion for a border wall. The Democratic-led House repeatedly passed legislation to fund the government, and thereby pay federal workers \u2014 only to be rebuffed by Trump and his Republican accomplices in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, Trump's advisers and allies made painfully out of touch remarks that showed just how little they understood or cared about the pain they caused.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a multi-millionaire, said he simply could not understand why people would need to go to food pantries after going more than a month without being paid. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, called the devastating lack of paychecks a mere \"glitch.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy defended Trump's decision to hurt federal workers as \"reasonable.\"\n\nWhile Republicans were holding paychecks hostage, almost a quarter of federal workers were forced to cut back on health and medical expenses for themselves or their families. Even after Trump caved and reopened the government \u2014 with no funding for the border wall \u2014 thousands of federal workers still did not receive their back pay on time.\n\nAnd about a million people who work as federal contractors, like the janitors and cafeteria workers who work in federal buildings, may never get paid at all for the 5 weeks they weren't allowed to do their jobs.\n\nDespite all the pain and hardship he caused, Trump is still contemplating shutting down the government again, as the temporary funding he agreed to expires on Feb. 15. Congressional negotiators have agreed on a funding package, and GOP leaders are desperately begging Trump to accept it and give up on his demand for wall funding.\n\nIf Trump opts to throw another tantrum instead, it will throw federal workers' lives into even more chaos.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "After losing control of the House, the GOP is returning to its playbook of racism and sexism to try to win it back.\n\nRepublicans, seeking something \u2014 anything \u2014 that will give them a way to regain their lost majority in Congress, are once again turning to racism and misogyny.\n\nPolitico reports that the party's official campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), is sending \"thousands of emails\" that smear three freshmen Democrats in the House \"as their new targets.\"\n\nThose targets \u2014 Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 all happen to be women of color. Tlaib and Omar are both Muslim.\n\n\"It speaks to a fear-based strategy that they utilize in order to kind of create political support, instead of actually painting a positive vision,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\n\"I think they just don\u2019t know what to do with powerful women of color,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), the first Indian-American woman to serve in the House of Representatives. \"I\u2019ve felt that before ... in this chamber and I think it\u2019s a new level because there\u2019s so many more of us now.\"\n\nThe NRCC's website \"makes it appear as if these backbench members are running the House,\" Politico notes. \"GOP lawmakers and aides privately acknowledge that the freshman trio are their main focus now.\"\n\n\"The fact that somebody like myself, who\u2019s a woman of color, is now an equal to many of them \u2014 people are very fearful of that,\" Tlaib told the outlet.\n\nThe targeting of women of color is a continuation of the GOP's strategy that failed spectacularly in 2018, allowing Democrats to pick up 40 seats in the House. Republicans abandoned earlier plans to pitch their failed tax scam to voters in the midterms, pivoting instead to racist ads and rhetoric to try to motivate their base.\n\nInstead, voters rejected the the GOP's embrace of bigotry, delivering the House to Democrats with a more diverse caucus than ever before.\n\nTargeting Tlaib, Omar, and Ocasio-Cortez is also evidence that the GOP's tried-and-true strategy of demonizing Speaker Nancy Pelosi has hit a road block.\n\nAttacks on Democratic candidates who backed Pelosi for speaker, while highlighting those who opposed her speakership, failed. Pelosi easily won the speakership, for the second time, in January.\n\nSo now the GOP is targeting other women, attempting to portray them as radical and out of step with voters, despite the popularity of the positions they hold.\n\nIt's a tactic that hasn't worked for the GOP in the past, but, as Politico notes, \"It\u2019s a move born, in part, out of desperation\" because now that they're in the minority, Republicans \"badly need something else to rally around.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Thanks to his ceaseless lies, Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort just had his plea deal voided by the court.\n\nPaul Manafort's plea deal is gone for good, thanks to a finding from Judge Amy Berman Jackson that Manafort lied to the special counsel.\n\nWith his sentencing date of March 13 coming up quickly, and the possibility of a shorter sentence because of his plea deal out the window, Trump's former campaign chairman is looking at the very real chance he might spend the rest of his life in jail.\n\nManafort took a plea deal back in September 2018. In that plea deal, he agreed to cooperate with the office of special counsel Robert Mueller. Except he didn't. A mere two months later, Manafort was back in court, with Mueller's team alleging he had lied to them and may have even been funneling information about the investigation directly to Trump.\n\nAnd then Manafort was slapped with even more charges just last week, this time related to his work in Ukraine that he somehow managed to carry out while in jail.\n\nWednesday's order from Jackson still contains significant factual gaps. The hearing that led up to this order was a closed hearing, and the filings have been heavily redacted. But it's still possible to see the rough contours of what Manafort lied about.\n\nFirst, there's the tantalizing mention of \"Firm A,\" an entity that made a payment to a law firm, and about which Manafort lied. The order notes that the payment is a matter material to the special counsel's investigation.\n\nNext, the court found that the special counsel proved that Manafort intentionally lied to the FBI, the office of the special counsel, and the grand jury about his contact with shady Russian billionaire Konstantin Kilimnik, who appears to be tied to Russian intelligence.\n\nFinally, the judge held that back in October 2018, Manafort intentionally lied about something material to a different Justice Department investigation.\n\nThings may not remain a total mystery much longer. The judge's order gives the parties exactly one day to tell the court of any redactions to the sealed hearing transcript. That transcript will then be released to the public no later than the morning of Feb. 15.\n\nAt root, the key takeaway here is that Manafort's lies were substantial and in some way go to the heart of both the Mueller investigation and another investigation. They weren't small lies or Manafort getting tripped up in his recollections. They were part of a sustained pattern of deception that went on for several months. And, come Friday, we might find out why Manafort was willing to throw away a plea deal over Firm A, Konstantin Kilimnik, and that unnamed DOJ investigation.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Both of them ostensibly represent students training for technical careers.\n\nThe idea behind the council is laudable, but its actual membership \u2014 mostly wealthy CEOs, with little representation from those who understand the needs of working people \u2014 is further proof this White House simply doesn't understand or care about American workers.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

It's quite an achievement for Trump, who cared deeply about the size of that debt when Obama was president \u2014 but now can't be bothered to address it at all.\n\nBefore running for office, Trump repeatedly went after President Obama for the size of the national debt. Back in September 2012, when the national debt stood at $16 trillion, he complained that Obama had \"amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents.\" A few months later, when the debt stood at $17 trillion, Trump called it \"a national security risk of the highest order\" and also claimed that concerns over the debt were stopping businesses from hiring or expanding.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump also bragged that he is \"the king of debt\" and that \"nobody knows debt better than me.\"\n\nWhen he first took office, Trump was at least pretending to be a budget hawk, bragging that he'd decreased the debt in his first month in office and whining that \"the media\" hadn't reported on it.\n\nBut once Trump got his tax cuts for the rich, he apparently stopped caring about the national debt. Trump has piled over $1 trillion onto the debt since taking office, and his tax cuts are projected to add another $1.5 trillion over the next ten years.\n\nThat debt is the sum of our annual budget deficits. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the budget deficit for 2019 will be $897 billion, a whopping 15 percent increase over 2018.\n\nTrump, who constantly brags that he is bringing jobs back to America and takes personal credit for the unemployment rate, no longer seems to see the national debt as something that deters corporations from hiring or harms the economy. That's likely because he believes that his tax cuts are going to spur such wild economic growth that it will erase all that debt from his giveaway to the rich.\n\nEconomists don't believe that, however, and are instead worried that his tax cuts may lead to a recession by 2020.\n\nAt least Trump finally can point to something where he has bested Obama: He really is the king of debt.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is putting his party on the record: They're not interested in saving the planet.\n\nScientists are sounding increasingly dire warnings that climate change will drown coastal cities and threaten human civilization if we don't act fast \u2014 but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would rather waste time with symbolic votes than take any action to save the planet.\n\nEarlier this week, McConnell gleefully announced the Senate will hold a vote on the Green New Deal, a package of economic and environmental justice proposals spearheaded by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA).\n\n\"I've noted with interest the Green New Deal,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"We're going to be voting on that in the Senate; it will give everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal.\"\n\nMcConnell's goal is not to pass the bill, NPR notes, but rather to use it as a political weapon to force Democrats to cast a vote on the ambitious plan.\n\nHowever, it will also put Republican senators on record as opposing any attempts to address the very serious and growing threat of climate change and save the planet for future generations before it's too late. A recent report from the United Nations warned that we have only 12 years to act on global warming to prevent major global catastrophes.\n\nThat's in addition to other warnings that glaciers in Antarctica could soon collapse and cause sea levels to rise by two feet. That's enough to \"inundate coastal cities across the globe,\" reports NBC News.\n\n\"Globally, as many as 650 million people live on land that will be submerged or exposed to chronic flooding\" in the next 80 years if nothing changes, Michael Mann, director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center, told NBC News in May 2018. And nothing is exactly what McConnell intends to do.\n\nPlaying political games on such an important issue did not sit well with Markey, who lambasted Republicans for their stance.\n\n\"They have offered no plan to address this economic and national security threat and want to sabotage any effort that makes Big Oil and corporate polluters pay,\" Markey told NPR. McConnell's lack of seriousness is evident in the fact that there will be no committee hearings, expert testimony, or any sort of debate on the merits of the issue, Markey added.\n\nThe Green New Deal is a 10-year plan to put the United Staes on the path to eliminate carbon emissions, move to using 100 percent renewable energy, upgrade buildings to make them more energy efficient, and invest in high-speed rail to eliminate the need for air travel.\n\nRather than engage on the real issues, Republicans are lying about what is contained in the framework, accusing Democrats of ridiculous ideas like banning hamburgers.\n\nContrary to McConnell's mocking tone, recent polls show quite a bit of support for the Green New Deal, especially among younger voters and millennials.\n\nIn pushing for a symbolic vote, McConnell is once again flip-flopping on his stance against such votes. During the 35-day Trump shutdown, McConnell refused for weeks to allow a vote to reopen the government. He said holding votes on bills Trump had threatened to veto was \"absolutely pointless,\" ignoring the fact that Congress could of course override a veto.\n\nWhile McConnell held the paychecks of federal workers hostage, he was willing to force a symbolic anti-abortion vote on a bill that had no chance of passing. Now it seems he is willing to play games with the environment instead of working to find solutions.\n\n\"The only policy that unites Republicans is opposing Democrats, which is to say they functionally lack a policy platform,\" Josh Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, said in response to McConnell's decision to hold a vote on the Green New Deal.\n\nIf McConnell has his way, and nothing is done to address climate change, a child born today will see cities in America and across the globe drown during their lifetime. But rather than work to stop that from happening, McConnell is choosing a path of political polarization and gamesmanship.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republican Kevin McCarthy is offering an unconvincing defense of his own anti-Semitism.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is trying to defend a tweet he wrote during last year's midterms, which was widely condemned for perpetuating an anti-Semitic stereotype.\n\nMcCarthy's tweet accused George Soros, Michael Bloomberg, and Tom Steyer of trying to \"BUY this election!\" Soros and Bloomberg are both Jewish. (Steyer, whose father was Jewish, is often misidentified in the media as Jewish.)\n\nMcCarthy's defense comes as he has been leading a campaign against Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) for comments she made about the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobbying group, which some have criticized as also anti-Semitic.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Wednesday, McCarthy insisted that his tweet of Oct. 24, 2018, which he subsequently deleted amid massive outrage, \"had nothing to do about faith.\"\n\n\"That was about Republicans versus Democrats,\" McCarthy said. \"Michael Bloomberg put in $54 million dollars into the campaign just in the last couple weeks in 24 districts. All I was pointing out was, money that Republicans and Democrats were spending to defeat one another.\"\n\nMcCarthy then offered a bizarre non sequitur to defend himself, saying that \"one of the greatest joys\" of his job is leading a trip to Israel.\n\n\"This had nothing to do about faith,\" he concluded. \"This had to do about party and a campaign.\"\n\nMcCarthy never explained \u2014 nor was he asked by Fox host Harris Faulkner \u2014 why he deleted his October tweet after it was so widely criticized for being anti-Semitic.\n\nOmar, unlike McCarthy, apologized for her tweets, but Republicans \u2014 including Mike Pence and Trump \u2014 are trying to gain a political advantage from the incident.\n\nThe double standard Republicans are trying to apply to Omar is reminding the country that Republicans were happy to campaign on anti-Semitism.\n\nMcCarthy's October tweet came at the same time that National Republican Congressional Committee, the party's campaign arm, released an ad targeting Soros, referencing well-worn anti-Jewish tropes, showing Soros sitting behind piles of money.\n\nEven after a mass shooter, who believed similar conspiracy theories about Soros, attacked and killed innocent people worshipping in a Pittsburgh synagogue, the NRCC defended the ad as \"factual.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump's campaign repeatedly associated itself with anti-Semitism. Trump tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton with piles of money and a Jewish star, attacking her as \"corrupt.\"\n\nAn ad from his campaign showed images of Soros alongside other prominent Jews as the voiceover from Trump warned about \"global special interests.\"\n\nHis campaign even had its surrogates appear on a radio show with a neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier.\n\nMcCarthy, who was House majority leader at the time, never condemned or spoke out against Trump's incidents of anti-Semitism.\n\nNow he's attacking Omar and demanding serious consequences for her tweets, while ignoring the anti-Semitism in his own party and offering incredible rationalizations for his own flirtation with anti-Semitism.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

It\u2019s called Presidential Harassment!\" Trump tweeted on Dec. 6.\n\nTrump slammed the House probes again during his State of the Union address last week, falsely claiming that \"partisan investigations\" are the only thing that could stop economic growth.\n\n\"If there is going to be peace in legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,\" Trump said in the speech. \"It just does not work that way.\u201d\n\nOf course, Trump's complaints haven't deterred Democrats from conducting legitimate inquiries into his conduct and his administration's activities \u2014 inquiries that the GOP blocked for the first two years of Trump's presidency.\n\nSince Democrats took the House majority in January, the House Intelligence Committee has reopened its Russia investigation because Republicans botched it so badly when they were in charge. Democrats have also launched their effort to finally obtain Trump's tax returns.\n\nAnd no matter how much Trump stomps his feet and pouts, public opinion is squarely on Democrats' side when it comes to holding Trump accountable for his potential crimes and corruption.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Jews, of course, don't believe in Jesus. And the sect of Christianity that the \"rabbi\" follows has the goal of converting Jews to Christianity.\n\nUntil Pence decides he wants to call out \"both sides\" for anti-Semitic comments, he should refrain from the sanctimony.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "High-capacity magazines make mass shootings much more deadly \u2014 but Republicans still want to keep them legal.\n\nDemocrats are ready to use their new majority in the House of Representatives to take action on gun safety legislation in order to make schools, theaters, halls of worship, and everywhere else a little bit safer.\n\nBut not a single Republican is willing to support legislation banning high-capacity magazines like those used in the deadly 2017 Las Vegas massacre that killed 58 people and injured hundreds.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) reintroduced the Keep Americans Safe Act, which would ban any magazine with more than 10 bullets. Access to these magazines makes shooters \"dramatically more dangerous,\" Deutch told CNN in a recent interview, because they can fire more shots without pausing to reload.\n\nThere are no Republican cosponsors of the measure.\n\nThat was also the case last year, when similar bills were introduced in both the House and the Senate. On the House side, 109 members cosponsored the bill, but not a single Republican. On the Senate side, there were 29 cosponsors, and again, not a single Republican.\n\nOne cosponsor, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), described high-capacity magazines as \"force multipliers for evil\" at a Tuesday press conference announcing the reintroduction of the bills. He noted that over the years, children have escaped school shooters when the shooter needed to pause and reload their guns.\n\nThe more bullets a magazine can hold, the more deadly a mass shooter can be. But Republicans in Congress aren't interested in taking even this small step to save lives.\n\nHalf of all mass shooters in the country have a high-capacity magazine, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), another cosponsor of the bill, noted at the press conference.\n\nIn a statement announcing her support of the legislation, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) said that high-capacity magazines have no other purpose but to \"wreak havoc\" \u2014 and that they \"make it nearly impossible for law enforcement to respond to active shooters.\"\n\nAt the press conference, Deutch thanked all the young people who are taking action on the issue of gun safety because they are \"tired of seeing their friends die around them.\" Deutch's district is home to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, where a horrific mass shooting almost one year ago drove surviving students to organize the March for Our Lives, one of the largest gun safety rallies in the country's history, and spark a nationwide movement for gun safety.\n\nGun safety organizations praised Democrats in Congress for reintroducing the legislation.\n\n\"We're thrilled that leaders in the 116th Congress are standing up for the safety of their constituents by introducing gun safety legislation,\" Stacey Radnor, public affairs director for Everytown for Gun Safety, told Shareblue Media. Radnor praised Deutch, Menendez, and others for \"taking a stand and working to tackle our nation's gun violence crisis by supporting legislation that will help save lives.\"\n\n\"If our country is serious about addressing our devastating gun violence crisis, we must start by having a serious conversation about the type of weapons we're making available on our streets,\" David Chipman, senior policy advisor at Gifford, a gun safety advocacy organization, said in a statement.\n\nThe new Democratic majority is proving that it's ready to take gun safety issues seriously. Earlier this month, House members held a hearing on gun safety for the first time in almost a decade. That hearing was focused on universal background checks, another top priority of advocates to ensure guns don't fall into the hands of criminals.\n\nThe bills show the \"unprecedented momentum\" toward ending the epidemic of gun violence in America, Charlie Mirsky, political director for March for Our Lives, said at the press conference.\n\nGun safety became a major, nationwide campaign issue in 2018 after several high-profile mass shootings, including the ones in Parkland and Las Vegas.\n\nThe hard work of gun safety advocates paid off, as NRA-backed candidates across the country lost \u2014 and Congress is now moving forward on an issue so important to so many families.\n\nIf only Republicans would bother to lift a finger and help.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans only seem to care about anti-Semitism if they can use it to attack Democrats.\n\nRepublican lawmakers are attacking Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota over comments she made on Twitter Sunday night about the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobbying group. They say that by critiquing the GOP's relationship with AIPAC as being \"all about the Benjamins,\" Omar perpetuated anti-Semitic tropes and must be condemned by all.\n\nHowever, the same Republicans who are eager to rebuke Omar seem to have forgotten their own use of anti-Semitic dog whistles during the 2018 midterm elections \u2014 not to mention their failure to stand up to Nazis and white supremacists in their own party.\n\n\"Anti-Semitic tropes have no place in the halls of Congress,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote in a holier-than-thou Twitter thread Sunday night. \"It is dangerous for Democrat leadership to stay silent on this reckless language.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats did in fact call Omar's remarks \"deeply offensive\" on Monday and called on her to apologize.\n\nA short while later, Omar did just that in a statement. \"Anti-Semitism is real and I am thankful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,\" she wrote. \"This is why I unequivocally apologize.\" She added that she still intends to address \"the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry.\"\n\nBut Republicans like McCarthy have no room to talk when it comes to perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes.\n\nAhead of the midterms in October 2018, McCarthy tweeted: \"We cannot allow Soros, Steyer and Bloomberg to BUY the election! Get out and vote Republican Nov 6th! #MAGA.\"\n\nIt was bad enough for McCarthy to accuse three men who are Jewish or have Jewish heritage of trying to \"buy\" the election. But Holocaust survivor and philanthropist George Soros has also been the subject of deeply anti-Semitic right-wing conspiracy theories about being a \"globalist\" who is trying to control the world economy.\n\nMcCarthy ended up deleting that tweet after Soros was the target of a mail bomb from a pro-Trump domestic terrorist.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, who is Jewish, also called Omar's choice of words \"deeply hurtful and offensive\" and said she \"appears to traffic in old anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money.\"\n\nBut Nadler was also quick to point out the hypocrisy of GOP lawmakers, too many of whom have trafficked in either hateful anti-Semitic conspiracy theories or equally hateful Islamophobia, and warned Americans not to be fooled by bad-faith arguments.\n\n\"Even as this is the case, one must also note and be concerned about the concerted Right-wing tactics aimed at advancing their agenda by distracting and dividing those committed to equality and social justice,\" Nadler wrote. \"These tactics have painted some unfairly and we must guard against this as well, because to unfairly accuse someone of a particular hatred undermines the legitimacy of the condemnations when they are truly warranted.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that Omar's original comment was a response to what she apparently saw as an unfair attack from McCarthy, who threatened to take unspecified \"action\" against both Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), both Muslim women, for unspecified remarks about Israel that McCarthy said were offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, top Republicans, McCarthy included, have been shamefully slow to condemn outright white supremacy and Nazi sympathizing in their own party, particularly from Rep. Steve King of Iowa.\n\nRepublicans also ran into trouble during the midterms when a shocking number of open white supremacists, and even literal Nazis, kept winning Republican primaries and becoming the official GOP nominee.\n\nIn addition to McCarthy, the entire GOP establishment used Soros extensively in their midterm messaging \u2014 painting him as a shadowy, nefarious figure funding radical policies.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee even refused to take down its anti-Soros ad in the wake of the anti-Semitic mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue \u2014 even when it emerged that the alleged shooter believed Soros was funding the migrant caravan that the GOP and Trump tried unsuccessfully to use as a scare tactic to rally their base voters.\n\n\u201cThat ad is factual,\u201d then NRCC Chair Steve Stivers told NBC's Chuck Todd. \u201cAnd it also has nothing to do with calling for violence. That ad is a factual ad.\u201d\n\nLet's also not forget Trump, who claimed there were good people on \"both sides\" of the Charlottesville protest, equating anti-racism counter-protesters with neo-Nazis chanting \"Jews will not replace us.\"\n\nOmar's comments have sparked intense debate about U.S. policy on Israel, AIPAC's lobbying efforts, Palestinian human rights, and how to talk about those things without using bigoted tropes.\n\nBut the GOP's outrage over Omar is hypocritical at best and phony at worst, given how consistently the party has trafficked in anti-Semitism for political gain.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) called on Trump \"to stop the encouraging of violence at these rallies\" \u2014 and demanded that Trump do so publicly, on TV and not just on Twitter.\n\nBrown made the comments at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor the morning after the El Paso rally. A reporter next to the cameraman said the crowd had been \"whipped up into a frenzy against the media\" by Trump and others at the rally.\n\n\"[Trump] should call off his supporters who are doing those kind of things,\" Brown said. \"Call them out and ask them to stop. We all are concerned there will be something worse happening at some time in the future.\"\n\nTrump's rallies throughout the 2016 campaign were marred by violence, often at the explicit encouragement by Trump. Once, Trump even offered to pay the legal bills for those who assaulted others.\n\n\"If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell ... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise,\" Trump said at a February 2016 rally in Iowa.\n\nIn the intervening years, Trump has moved on from encouraging violence against protesters to encouraging violence against the media.\n\nIn despotic fashion, Trump regularly attacks the free press as the \"enemy of the people\" and encourages hateful jeers towards members of the press who are covering his rallies.\n\nEven after a gunman killed five people working for a newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, Trump refused to stop using this dangerous rhetoric.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2018 midterms, Trump even went so far as to praise a member of Congress who assaulted a journalist.\n\nIn 2018, the entire U.S. Senate condemned attacks against the press as \"an attack on the democratic institutions of the United States.\" Yet Trump barges ahead with his attacks, recklessly endangering the safety of journalists across the country.\n\nWhile Trump tries to incite violence, Brown \u2014 who is married to a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist \u2014 takes a different approach to journalists who cover him in his home state of Ohio: He thanks them.\n\nAt the event on Tuesday, Brown recalled telling a crowd that \"journalists play an important role and are not enemies of the people. And the group as a whole, these people at a Democratic rally, turned around and gave a standing ovation to the journalists.\"\n\nBrown added that such support for a free press is not something you would ever see at a Trump rally.\n\nIn a healthy democracy, elected leaders do not incite violence against a free press \u2014 yet Trump repeatedly uses his hate-filled campaign rallies to do just that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The cost to operate the plant is about the same as the amount it makes from selling power wholesale. With that, it would seem that it just makes economic sense for TVA to shut it down.\n\nBut the power plant also buys much of its coal from a company owned by a major Trump donor. That might be why Trump waded into the discussion Monday afternoon, tweeting that coal is \"an important part of our electricity generation mix\" and calling on TVA to give serious consideration to \"all factors\" before it votes to close \"viable power plants.\"\n\nThe only viable power plant Trump identified in the tweet just happened to be Paradise #3 \u2014 a power plant that is, in reality, not viable at all.\n\nParadise #3 gets most of its coal from a subsidiary of the Murray Energy company, owned by Robert Murray. Murray also just happens to be a huge Trump supporter.\n\nIn the 2016 election cycle, Murray Energy somehow came up with $100,000 to donate to the Trump Victory Fund, even though it was in such dire straits it needed to issue layoff notices to 4,400 workers the very next day.\n\nAfter Trump won, Murray also donated $300,000 to Trump's beleaguered inauguration committee. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as Murray and Murray Energy also gave a million dollars to America First Action, a Trump-backing super PAC.\n\nMurray appears to have gotten quite the deal for that money.\n\nAfter the election, Murray drafted a \"wish list\" of pro-coal actions he hoped the Trump administration would take. Chief among those was withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords, which Trump did in June 2017.\n\nIn December 2017, Trump began considering how to roll back rules that protected coal miners from black lung disease, another wish of Murray's.\n\nMurray also asked Trump to get rid of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which Trump formally moved to do in April 2018.\n\nNow, it looks like Murray needs one of his big customers to stay open, regardless of whether the TVA buying coal from Murray makes fiscal sense for the TVA or the people of Kentucky that TVA serves.\n\nAnd Trump appears happy, yet again, to do Murray's bidding.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Skeans said the man almost knocked him and his camera over two times before being wrestled away by another man on the scene.\n\nSurveying the scene from the stage, Trump asked if everyone was OK, gave a thumbs up to Skeans, and continued giving his speech. He did not bother to remark on, much less condemn, the attack itself.\n\nAttacking the press has been Trump's stock in trade for years. He routinely describes reporters who cover him as the \"enemy of the people.\"\n\nIn October 2018, a would-be serial bomber was arrested after mailing explosive devices around the country to figures like President Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and philanthropist George Soros.\n\nThe man also sent a device to CNN's headquarters.\n\nWhen captured, the man was discovered to be an ardent Trump supporter who had even been photographed at a Trump rally wearing one of the ubiquitous red MAGA caps.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign Trump repeatedly encouraged and incited violence against protesters. \"Knock the crap out of them,\" he told supporters at one point \u2014 even promising to pay any resulting legal fees.\n\nTrump is a demagogue who incites violence and harm against those who tell the truth about him.\n\nAnd some of his followers are willing to assault innocent people based on the lies Trump tells them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Martha McSally in Arizona in 2020.\n\nArizona voters will have another chance to reject Martha McSally in 2020, when the unelected Republican is up for re-election in the late John McCain's Senate seat that she was appointed to fill.\n\nAnd now voters know definitively who one of their options at the ballot box will be, after Democrat Mark Kelly announced his candidacy in a moving four-and-a-half-minute-long video posted to his Twitter account Tuesday morning.\n\nIn his announcement, Kelly plays up his military service and time as an astronaut \u2014 but explains that his role caring for his wife, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, after she was shot in the head in a failed assassination attempt, is what spurred him to run for Senate.\n\n\"I learned a lot from being an astronaut. I learned a lot from being a pilot in the Navy. I learned a lot about solving problems from being an engineer,\" Kelly says in his announcement video, seated next to his wife. \"But what I learned from my wife is how you use policy to improve people's lives.\"\n\nKelly's positive video makes no mention of McSally or Trump. It focuses on issues he wants to tackle, such as health care, stagnant wages, jobs and the economy, and climate change.\n\nBut McSally and her far-right views will obviously be a major issue in this race.\n\nWhile McSally is up for re-election in 2020, she never actually won her Senate seat.\n\nVoters rejected her candidacy in 2018, when she lost the open-seat Senate race to replace now-retired Sen. Jeff Flake to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. And she only ascended to the Senate because GOP Gov. Doug Ducey ignored the will of Arizona voters and appointed McSally to serve in the Senate until a special election could be held to replace McCain.\n\nGiven that Kelly talks about health care as a major topic he wants to tackle as a Senator, McSally will again have to face her vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a GOP alternative that would have stripped health care from more than 20 million Americans.\n\nOther Democrats may well run for this seat as well, including Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who told Politico in December that he is leaning toward running.\n\nBut election analysts at the non-partisan political handicapping outlet Inside Elections already rate McSally's re-election a toss-up contest. And that rating may shift toward Democrats as voters remember why they rebuffed McSally's first attempt at the Senate.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

However, in an effort to turn public opinion against the ambitious piece of legislation a pair of Democrats introduced last week to try and combat climate change, Republicans have been spewing ridiculous lies about what the deal would do.\n\nOn Monday night at a campaign rally in El Paso, Texas, Trump falsely claimed the deal would \"shut down a little thing called air travel.\"\n\n\"How do you take a train to Europe?\" Trump said, mocking the deal.\n\nThe deal, to any normal human being who has read it, does not ban air travel. It simply would make other forms of public transportation faster and more readily available, thus making air travel less necessary within the U.S.\n\nCongressional Republicans have also gotten in on the foolishness surrounding the deal.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) \u2014 a member of House Republican leadership \u2014 falsely said the deal would \"outlaw cars.\"\n\nSen. John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday that the deal would ban ice cream.\n\n\"There's another victim of the Green New Deal, it's ice cream,\" Barrasso said, without any sarcasm. \"Livestock will be banned. Say goodbye to dairy, to beef, to family farms, to ranches. American favorites like cheeseburgers and milkshake will become a thing of the past.\"\n\nWhere do we even begin with this whopper, no pun intended. Barrasso is apparently referring to the plan's net-zero emissions goal, which he'd like us to believe is a threat to cows.\n\nDon't worry, you'll still be able to get your Ben & Jerry's and In-N-Out if the Green New Deal passes. The Washington Post reports, \"Nothing in the resolution eliminates 'all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military,' as Trump tweeted.\"\n\nBut don't expect it to pass.\n\nEven though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he'll put the bill to a vote, he's only doing it in an effort to put vulnerable Democratic senators in a bind \u2014 without proposing any climate change legislation of his own.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, are annoyed at the GOP misinformation, but unswayed by the smear campaign.\n\n\"Republicans don't want to debate climate change, they only want to deny it,\" Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and co-sponsor of the deal, said in a statement.\n\n\"The Green New Deal resolution has struck a powerful chord in the country,\" Markey continued, \"and Republicans, climate deniers and the fossil fuel industry are going to end up on the wrong side of history.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The congressional funding compromise hammered out by Congress rejects Trump's demand for $5.7 billion for a wall.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are ready to cave on their demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the southern border, and are desperate to convince Trump to join them.\n\nGOP leaders \"mounted a quick campaign\" to convince Trump that the funding deal hammered out by a bipartisan congressional group should be viewed as a win, according to Politico.\n\n\"I'm inclined to be for something that gets us out of the current logjam we are in,\" Senate Majority Whip John Thune told Politico, grateful for any funding Democrats allowed for wall funding, even if it is far less than Thune and Republicans fought for.\n\nThe deal Republicans agreed to is nothing less than total capitulation to the demands Democrats have been making for months. Instead of the $5.7 billion Trump demanded for wall funding, the compromise offers $1.375 billion for fencing, including 55 miles of new bollard fencing. The new agreement is less than what Democrats offered in the summer of 2018, when the funding was $1.6 billion for 65 miles of new fencing.\n\nDespite a significant loss on a key issue, Republicans are desperate to spin the agreement as a win in hopes Trump will not shut down the government again.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even praised the compromise as a \"good deal\" and hopes the Senate will act on it soon.\n\nBut Politico reports Republicans are worried Trump will ignore their pleas and listen to far-right Fox News personalities like Sean Hannity, who called the deal a \"garbage compromise.\"\n\nRepublicans might be right to worry. When asked about the deal at a Tuesday photo-op for a Cabinet meeting, Trump said, \"Am I happy? The answer is no, I'm not. I'm not happy.\"\n\nThe last time Trump was not happy about a funding deal, he threw a tantrum and shut down the government for 35 days. During that time, 800,000 federal workers were not paid, national parks were destroyed, air travel was less safe, America's national security was put at risk, and the economy lost $11 billion.\n\nAll the while, the American public placed the blame squarely on Trump and congressional Republicans, who together refused to reopen the government without the $5.7 billion for a wall.\n\nThe standoff ended when Trump caved and agreed to reopen the government without wall funding. And it seems that Republicans are caving yet again to Democratic demands.\n\nIt only remains to be seen if GOP leaders can talk Trump into relenting yet again, or if Trump decides he wants to hold workers and the country hostage another time.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Richard Burr (R-NC) told CBS News in an interview last week.\n\nBut a Democratic aide close to the investigation told Shareblue that Burr's assessment is wrong, and pointed to numerous pieces of evidence the Senate Intelligence Committee now has that suggest collusion.\n\nThat evidence includes:\n\nThe Trump Tower meeting, in which top Trump campaign officials, along with Trump's son and son-in-law, met with Russians \"for the express purpose of obtaining 'dirt' on Hillary Clinton,\" the Democratic aide said.\n\nThe 100+ contacts that members of the Trump campaign and transition team had with Russia-linked officials.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos' meeting with a professor in London in which he drunkenly said he knew that Russians had a trove of emails relating to Clinton that had yet to be released. Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about this meeting, and served jail time for his crime of lying to federal agents.\n\nThe fact that indicted Trump confidant Roger Stone was in regular contact with WikiLeaks at the same time that he was communicating with Trump campaign staff.\n\nAnd Trump's lies about his attempts to forge a deal for a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign, a campaign that Russia interfered with to boost Trump's chances of being elected.\n\n\"Looking at this pattern of contacts and lies, there clearly is plenty of circumstantial evidence that would suggest collusion,\" the aide told Shareblue.\n\nOf course, despite this pile of potentially damning evidence, Trump is latching onto Burr's comments and claiming they somehow exonerate him in the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump has tweeted a handful of times praising Burr's comments. And he also touted them at his lie-filled rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night.\n\n\"Sen. Richard Burr from the great state of North Carolina, he's chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and they've been investigating this Russia hoax for two years, they've interviewed over 200 people, they've studied hundreds of thousands of documents and pages, and Richard just announced that they found no collusion between Donald Trump and Russia,\" Trump said as his supporters cheered.\n\nWhile Burr suggested the Senate's investigation is winding down, Trump shouldn't be celebrating yet.\n\nFirst off, Burr never said that the Senate report would fully exonerate Trump on the collusion front.\n\nAnd even if the Senate report from the GOP-led committee does give Trump a pass, the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 now led by Democrats \u2014 announced last week that it is reopening its Russia investigation, and is looking into a number of areas including collusion and whether anyone in Trump's orbit attempted to obstruct any investigations.\n\nWhat's more, special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is still ongoing and has continued to hand down indictments, including Stone's in January. And there are signs that Mueller is still probing aspects of the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia that pose a serious threat to Trump.\n\nTrump may be clinging to Burr's irresponsible comments for now \u2014 but he's not off the hook yet.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "In a rant detached from reality, Trump tried to say 'rust' explains why no one likes his racist wall idea.\n\nIn one of his signature bizarre, rambling rants, Trump today blamed \"unattractive\" and \"ugly\" walls that have \"rust\" for the unpopularity of his plan to construct a racist border wall.\n\nWith his Cabinet and top advisers in attendance, Trump was asked by members of the media to discuss ongoing negotiations about his border wall demands in Congress. Trump then launched into an unhinged monologue.\n\n\"We're getting a beautiful looking structure that's also less expensive to build, and works much better,\" he began. \"It was crazy what they were putting up \u2014 in fact, I happen to think that the walls that they were building were so unattractive and so ugly that walls got bad names.\"\n\nHe didn't stop there: \"They were so ugly, with rusted steel and big ugly plates on top that were all tin-canned... It's called tin-canned where they're wavy... because the heat makes 'em \u2014 expand and contract, and they tin-can.\"\n\nTrump then leaned on a favorite device \u2014 holding a conversation between himself and an unknown third party, typically invoking a person he has clearly made up to make himself look smart.\n\n\"I say, 'Why didn't you paint the steel?' 'Well sir, we save money by not painting it.' I said 'Yeah, but it's going to rust.'\"\n\nHe concluded the troubling display by blaming the past tyranny of unpainted walls on past presidents.\n\n\"I've never seen \u2014 I've ordered a lot of steel \u2014 I've never seen in m whole life steel come to me that was unpainted. This could only happen at the border. It wasn't me. It was our past geniuses.\"\n\nTrump's wall is unpopular. Most Americans do not believe that a wall targeted at screening out Latino migrants is the way to deal with immigration.\n\nContrary to Trump's strange show, it is not the aesthetics of a wall that make it unpopular, but the idea in the first place. People understand that a wall can be subverted, climbed or tunneled under, for one thing. It isn't a serious deterrent or a solution to a major problem.\n\nIn reality, it's something Trump's inner circle came up with as a rhetorical trick to get him to talk about immigration. But it has now become an absurd obsession that has overtaken Trump, leading him to shut down the government and hurt the lives of millions.\n\nThat's why \u2014 in addition to his own natural detachment from reality \u2014 Trump broke down and blathered about painting walls, rust, and other disturbingly unserious detail. Meanwhile, this man is in charge of America's nuclear arsenal.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

That's not a \u2014 not even a wall, a barrier? I'm going to tell this tonight we will get back into this tomorrow. Any Republican that supports this garbage compromise, you will have to explain,\" Hannity thundered.\n\nFellow Fox News host Laura Ingraham also slammed the reported deal as \"pathetic,\" adding, \"the word 'principle' shouldn\u2019t be used to describe this deal.\"\n\n\"Radical Dimms refuse to protect America, their 'Deal' is an insult to @POTUS and the American people,\" said conspiracy theorist and Fox Business host Lou Dobbs.\n\nIn a normal presidency, the anger of a few television talking heads would not be particularly notable, but Trump dances to the tune of Fox News and the rest of the right-wing media. He sets the direction of American policies based on how they play out on television, without concern for real-world consequences.\n\nTrump reportedly has regular conversations with Hannity, who steers and directs the policy of the United States from his Fox News studio.\n\nTrump's \"executive time\" is hours and hours of him sitting in front of television, absorbing what is being said about him and the rest of the world, then responding through Twitter tirades, or in presidential decisions.\n\nSo opposition to the deal from the Fox News chorus could easily lead to Trump's opposition and yet another government shutdown.\n\nThat's what happened in December of 2018. Despite Republicans controlling the House, Senate, and presidency, Trump appeased his television bosses by pushing the government into a shutdown.\n\nIt was a disaster that uprooted the lives of millions of Americans. It endangered food and travel safety. It sent military families to food banks. It made businesses lose billions of dollars and led to piles of excrement and litter at America's national parks.\n\nSimply because Trump is at the mercy of millionaires with TV shows.\n\nAmerica was rescued from the last shutdown because Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others stood up to him and arranged for the government to reopen.\n\nBut because Sean Hannity, calling Trump from his sprawling mansion, might be opposed to the new agreement, the country could suffer all over again.\n\nPresident Hannity has made his demands and his humble servant, Trump, is on track to once again do as he was told.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Donald Trump held a 'Finish the Wall' rally in El Paso, but he couldn't be bothered to actually acknowledge negotiations about how to build the wall in the first place.\n\nThe first Trump rally of 2019 is in the history books. It was predictably vicious and incoherent, including the now-routine exaggerations about crowd size that are a Trump hallmark and demands to lock Hillary Clinton up.\n\nBut this rally had a new twist: Trump announced he was ignoring updates on talks to avert another government shutdown \u2014 so that he could instead come out and bask in the MAGA love.\n\nIt wasn't just that he was passively ignoring the discussions or was unaware of where things were at. He knew that a deal was possible, and he said so himself:\n\nThey say that progress is being made. Just so you know. Just now just now. I said wait a minute, I gotta take care of my people from Texas, I got to go, I don\u2019t even want to hear about it, I don\u2019t want to hear about it.\n\nIt was a shockingly unpresidential move even for someone as unpresidential as Trump.\n\nA bipartisan group of legislators is doing their best to avert yet another pointlessly expensive government shutdown, but Trump can't be bothered even to pay attention, much less participate.\n\nPerhaps he's trying to ignore the deal because it is nothing remotely like the kind of deal Trump thinks he'd get, being such a master negotiator. While Trump was pumping himself up for El Paso, Senate and House negotiators agreed to a deal that provides $1.375 billion for fencing and other barriers, including 55 miles of new bollard fencing.\n\nThis isn't just a deal that offers much less than Trump's demand for $5.7 billion for his wall. It's a deal that is even worse than the original deal Democrats agreed to back in summer of 2018. Back then, before Trump's temper tantrum, the Democrats had agreed to spend $1.6 billion for 65 miles of fencing.\n\nAt the El Paso rally, Trump even slipped up and explained that he was the one responsible for the longest shutdown in government history, saying \"If we didn't do that shutdown, we wouldn't have been able to show this country, these politicians, the world, what the hell is happening with the border.\"\n\nEven if the Democrats and the Republicans manage to avoid another shutdown, even if they get Trump to sign the bill capping wall funding at $1.375 billion, it might not matter.\n\nTrump says he's building the wall anyway, and told the El Paso crowd that they should chant \"Finish the Wall\" because he's already built a lot of it. In fact, he's gotten started building about 14 new feet of wall (out of a 2000-mile border).\n\nIt seems Trump understands the truth about as poorly as he understands that Congress controls the purse strings.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Debbie Lesko (R-AZ), making the common NRA argument against gun laws. For its $3,000 investment in her, the NRA got Lesko to sound just like former NRA chairman Wayne LaPierre, who claimed \"criminals won't participate\" if gun laws are passed.\n\nAfter taking $5,893 from the NRA, Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) was all too happy to urge his fellow lawmakers \"to focus on enforcing the laws we already have on the books\" on guns.\n\nThis talking point has been invoked again and again by the NRA, and NRA spokesperson and serial liar Dana Loesch has said the same thing almost verbatim.\n\n\"You have to enforce the laws that we have,\" Loesch says in a clip featured in the Guns Down America video.\n\nPeople like Loesch and Reschenthaler say this even though the public has repeatedly called for new gun legislation after mass shootings, and even though U.S. states with stricter gun laws also tend to have fewer gun deaths.\n\nRep. Tom McClintock (R-CA), one of the few California Republicans left in Congress, has taken in a massive amount of money from the NRA: $54,842.\n\nAt the hearing, he whined: \"Whenever anyone suggests armed guards to protect our children at our schools, it's met with hoots of derision.\"\n\nThe foolish idea that putting more guns around children will help stop school shootings has been a favorite of the NRA's. And it was one of the ideas Trump touted most often after the massacre at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida.\n\nLike McClintock, Trump was the beneficiary of tainted NRA money, receiving $35 million in support from them in 2016.\n\nCongress ignored the gun issue while it was under GOP control, even as American citizens were repeatedly gunned down at school, in church, and at concerts. Then the NRA lost big with its bet on Republicans in 2018.\n\nDespite that rebuke from voters, the video shows that even in the minority, Republicans are still marching in lockstep with the NRA and its tainted money. They will continue to offer the same dishonest talking points even if it means more Americans of all ages could be murdered.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Some $40 million of that was set aside for Let Girls Learn, the initiative launched by Michelle Obama to help girls in the developing world get a quality education.\n\nA year later, the Trump administration ended the program.\n\nJust last year, philanthropist Melinda Gates announced a $170 million plan to increase the economic power of women around the world. That's more than three times as much as the commitment from the entire U.S. government.\n\nYet, despite the comparatively paltry sum of his offering, Trump clearly wanted praise for the program.\n\nDuring his State of the Union address, Trump congratulated himself for launching \"the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.\"\n\n\"Trump is committed to women's economic empowerment,\" claimed a White House press release. The document said the $1 per woman effort would advance \"women's full and free participation in the global economy.\"\n\nAs Trump signed a memorandum establishing the initiative, Ivanka wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed that laughably claimed the fund would help \"boost global economic output by an additional $12 trillion by 2025.\"\n\nThe public relations maneuver is right in line with an administration that has attacked women around the world at every turn.\n\nHe reinstated the anti-choice global gag rule, then later expanded it \u2014 banning the United States from funding certain reproductive health initiatives around the world.\n\nOpposition to abortion also led Trump to cut funding for the United Nations Population Fund, which is responsible for family planning, including ending deaths from childbirth, across 150 countries.\n\nTrump hurt women and families when he ended the Syrian refugee program and imposed a ban on Muslim travel to the U.S. Additionally, he put in place policies at the U.S.-Mexico border that separated children from their families.\n\nTrump is reviled by women, and this initiative is part of a gambit to improve his standing with them before the election. But even then, with his daughter leading the charge, Trump hobbled the program and made it into an obvious joke.\n\nThere is no real commitment here, just smoke and mirrors for another con in progress.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump spent his weekend going after Democratic candidates on Twitter.\n\nTrump had a very productive weekend \u2014 but only if tweeting attacks on his rivals and praise of Kim Jong Un constitutes productivity.\n\nThis weekend saw Trump for the first time going after Democratic candidates entering the presidential race. He attacked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in his usual fashion, by calling her \"Pocahontas,\" but then he took it one step further, asking if she would run as \"our first Native American presidential candidate\" and then declared he'd see her \"on the campaign TRAIL.\"\n\nPeople rightly interpreted this as a reference to the Trail of Tears, where the United States drove Native Americans from their homes and onto reservations, killing thousands of people in the process. Fox News' Brit Hume was forced to come to Trump's defense by suggesting that Trump wasn't smart enough to know about the Trail of Tears.\n\nTrump is going after Warren because she's a force to be reckoned with \u2014 and she has no problem going after him. During a recent visit to Iowa, she said, \"By the time we get to 2020, Donald Trump may not even be president. In fact, he may not even be a free person.\" Good point.\n\nOn Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) officially announced her bid for president. She made her announcement outside during a relatively mild snowstorm. But because Trump willfully misunderstands the difference between weather and climate, he tweeted that he found her call to fight global warming problematic because she was \"standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice, and freezing temperatures\" and that \"by the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman).\"\n\nKlobuchar likely terrifies Trump as well, given how competently and calmly she handled Brett Kavanaugh's belligerent behavior during his confirmation hearing. Of course, she also won re-election in the 2018 midterms by 24 percentage points.\n\nTrump also touched on some old Twitter favorites this weekend, including NO COLLUSION and insisting he is very popular. He also used his Twitter feed to praise a favorite strongman of his, declaring that Kim Jong Un will make North Korea an economic powerhouse and praised how capable he is. It's an odd appreciation for a leader who starves his people and has personally ordered the execution of hundreds.\n\nTrump also Twitter-fixated on the fact that Sen. Richard Burr's (R-NC) comically limited investigation supposedly cleared him, which is no surprise, given that the House of Representatives has just said they're starting the Russia investigation all over again, not to mention all the other investigations they're undertaking.\n\nSo, Trump faces increased investigations and increased political competition. That doesn't bode well for a man who spends his weekends melting down any time the slightest thing doesn't go his way.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Thanks to Republican accounting trickery, millions of Americans are losing out on refunds or getting stuck with tax bills they didn't expect.\n\nAs Tax Day approaches, millions of Americans are expected to see smaller tax refunds this year \u2014 and many will owe taxes they didn't expect to owe \u2014 thanks to changes in the tax code Republicans rammed through Congress in late 2017.\n\n\"It totally feels like a scam,\" John Prugh, a manager at a New Jersey bookstore, told the Washington Post. Prugh just found out his refund was $3,000 less than he anticipated, even though he and his wife have had the same jobs for years.\n\n\"I did still get a small refund, but compared to what I was expecting from previous years, it was shock,\" he added.\n\nPrugh is not alone, the Post notes. According to an IRS estimate from last summer, the GOP tax scam means 4.6 million fewer families will receive a refund this year \u2014 and an additional 4.6 million filers will owe money to the IRS who haven't in previous years.\n\n\"As Tax Day approaches and people start filing their returns, it should come as no surprise that the GOP's tax scam isn't delivering on Republicans' promises,\" Ryan Thomas, spokesperson for Tax March, told Shareblue Media. \"The American people are now seeing firsthand that this tax law was written by and for the wealthiest, not for working and middle-class families.\"\n\nJason Marques, a postal worker and pizza delivery driver in Massachusetts, told NBC News that he was expecting a refund of about $6,000, the same amount he got last year. But this year, he found out he would receive less than $500 total.\n\n\"My jaw hit the floor,\" Marques said. He had planned on paying off credit card debt, and possibly student loans, with the refund. Now he can't do any of that.\n\n\"It looks like it was a bunch of gimmicking,\" Marques said of the changes to the tax code. \"I didn't know how badly it was actually going to hurt.\"\n\nThere's a reason that the smaller refunds are coming as such a nasty shock to so many Americans. The GOP tax scam Trump signed into law in December 2017 changed withholding levels to make it seem like many people were getting bigger tax cuts than they really were.\n\nNow, the bill is coming due \u2014 and most Americans had no way of knowing the price they were paying.\n\nSome workers may have seen a change in their take-home pay, but NBC reports the amount could have been so small that people didn't even notice. For example, former Speaker Paul Ryan embarrassed himself when he bragged about a woman who received an additional $1.50 per week in her paycheck.\n\nWhile Republicans told middle-class workers to be grateful for six quarters, their tax scam lavished billions of dollars upon Wall Street billionaires. More than 80 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 percent, while corporate banks raked in record-breaking profits.\n\nAccording to IRS data, tax refunds average about 8.4 percent less this year compared to last year. One accountant in New York City told NBC News that she anticipates about two-thirds of her clients will pay more in taxes than they thought they would.\n\nFrom coast to coast, the tax scam is hitting families hard.\n\n\"The Republican tax bill handcuffed Orange County families with higher taxes to give a handout to special interests \u2014 we should be returning money to working families' pockets, not giving tax breaks to the wealthiest corporations in America,\" Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) said in a statement to Shareblue Media.\n\nPorter, one of many freshman Democrats in the House, ousted a Republican incumbent who enthusiastically supported the tax scam.\n\n\"It was a scam then, it's a scam now,\" Rep. Primila Jayapal (D-WA), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, recently said of the GOP tax bill.\n\nThe GOP tax scam was already unpopular when it passed Congress without a single Democratic vote. If Americans were skeptical then before seeing the harmful effects firsthand, they are likely to be furious now.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

After caving to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump agreed to reopen the government for three weeks (with no funding for a wall) so Congress could discuss longer-term border security funding.\n\nThat funding runs out on Friday, however. That's why Nelson says a new shutdown would turn Saturday into day 36 of the Trump shutdown.\n\nDuring the recent shutdown, flights were brought to a halt at several major airports. A group of airline unions said air travel was so dangerous that they \"cannot even calculate the level of risk\" to passengers, pilots, and airline workers.\n\nThe shutdown was wildly unpopular with the general public, who largely laid the blame on Trump and Republicans in Congress. Yet the White House refuses to rule out the possibility of shutting down the government again.\n\n\"We have a duty to protect ourselves and the American people from the danger,\" Nelson wrote. Even if Trump and Republicans in Congress refuse to look out for the safety and security of the public, the flight attendants' union will do so.\n\n\"Working people have power when we come together,\" she wrote. \"If Congress chooses the chaos of a continued lockout, we will use that power.\"\n\nHopefully, Trump and Republicans will learn from last time, and abandon any attempts to hold workers \u2014 and our collective safety \u2014 hostage once again.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Gavin Newsom, who will pull hundreds of National Guard troops away from the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nNewsom is the second governor in a week to rebuke Trump and refuse to allow National Guard troops to be used as political props.\n\nNewsom plans to pull an estimated 360 troops from the border in order to focus on issues important to the state. Around 110 troops will be sent to support the state's wildfire fighting agency, Cal Fire, and another 100 will help with intelligence operations related to international drug gangs.\n\nThe announcement will come a day before Newsom delivers his State of the State address. In prepared remarks released to the media, Newsom will use the address to slam Trump for his divisive language around immigrants. \"This is our answer to the White House: No more division, xenophobia or nativism,\" Newsom will say.\n\nTrump's border \"crisis\" nonsense began as a political stunt in the months leading up to the 2018 election. As the Republican economic message fell flat with voters, Trump sought to use anti-immigrant racist rhetoric to drive Republican voters to the polls. As part of this effort, Trump started talking about a \"crisis\" at the border, where he sent thousands of military troops.\n\nHowever, since there was no crisis, the troops spent their time shoveling horse manure and performing other menial tasks. Trump refuses to abandon his political games, and a recent analysis showed a continued troop presence at the southern border will cost $1 billion this year.\n\nNewsom joins New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who last week said she was pulling National Guard troops from the border. She lambasted the White House over the \"charade of border fear-mongering.\" In a statement, Lujan Grisham wholeheartedly rejected the assertion by Trump that there is any kind of crisis at the border. Rather than assist Trump's misguided efforts, Lujan Grisham will use her state's resources to deal with humanitarian issues and focus on asylum seekers coming in to the state.\n\n\"California will not be part of this political theater,\" Newsom will say Tuesday night.

After three months of schedules were leaked, Trump launched a hunt for the White House staffer who confirmed Trump's deep and abiding laziness to the public.\n\nBut despite that hunt, even more daily schedules have leaked. And they show the same thing: vast swaths of \"executive time\" \u2014 the code phrase everyone has settled on to describe the many, many hours Trump spends not doing the work of being president.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump went on Twitter to claim that when his schedule says it is executive time, \"I am generally working, not relaxing.\" He also insisted that the media getting his work schedule was actually \"something very easy to do.\" Finally, he deployed his characteristic nonsense bombast and declared, \"In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President.\"\n\nHe repeated the absurd claim about his work ethic on Monday morning: \"No president ever worked harder than me (cleaning up the mess I inherited)!\"\n\nLiterally none of that is true.\n\nHis full schedules aren't easy to get, for one thing, which is precisely why they only appear when some White House staffer leaks them to the media. The publicly available \"official\" schedules typically show huge gaps of time unaccounted for.\n\nCompare that to President Obama, whose schedules routinely showed 10-plus-hour public-facing days \u2014 and that doesn't include the fact that he was notorious for working late into the night by himself. Every daily schedule of both President Obama and Vice-President Biden was also publicly available and remains archived for all to see.\n\nBut you also don't need to see Trump's private schedule to know that Trump spends his morning executive time quite obviously watching Fox and Friends and tweeting about it, rather than working.\n\nOther people in Trump's orbit also tweeted absurd claims about how Trump is the hardest-working man in politics.\n\nMadeleine Westerhout, the Director of Oval Office operations, first declared that leaking Trump's ostensibly easy-to-get schedule was a \"disgraceful breach of trust.\" She went on to hilariously claim that Trump takes \"hundreds of calls and meetings\" every day.\n\nSetting aside the fact that it is not possible to have hundreds of calls and meetings in a day, it seems like this entire mystery could be put to bed if Trump would just provide a schedule that detailed what he actually did all day.\n\nInstead, the entire country has to coddle a president who behaves like a toddler, reassuring him that yes, he is achieving big things while he sits around watching television.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Collins said she thought Kavanaugh would respect Supreme Court precedent on abortion \u2014 but he just refused to enforce a decision the court made only two years ago.\n\nSupporters of reproductive freedom breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday when the Supreme Court blocked a restrictive anti-abortion law in Louisiana from going into effect, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the court's liberal justices in the narrow 5-4 ruling that prevents the law from being enforced.\n\nOnly one justice wrote a dissenting opinion: Brett Kavanaugh, whom opponents long warned would vote to limit or even end abortion rights in the U.S.\n\nIt's already shocking that four justices would dissent in this case, since the Louisiana law was almost identical to another law the court found unconstitutional just two years ago. It suggests that all of the court's conservative justices, except for Roberts, won't even bother to enforce the Supreme Court's own decisions when it comes to abortion rights.\n\nBut Kavanaugh's dissent in particular flies in the face of the promise Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) made when she announced her key swing-vote decision to support Kavanaugh's nomination: that Kavanaugh would uphold Supreme Court precedent and not chip away at abortion rights under Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"As Judge Kavanaugh asserted to me, a long-established precedent is not something to be trimmed, narrowed, discarded, or overlooked,\" Collins said in her long-winded speech from the Senate floor in October. \"Its roots in the Constitution give the concept of stare decisis greater weight such that precedent can\u2019t be trimmed or narrowed simply because a judge might want to on a whim.\"\n\nSo much for that.\n\nIt took just four months on the bench for Kavanaugh to chip away at established Supreme Court precedent from the 2016 Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt decision, making Collins' deluded speech look even more delusional now.\n\nIn his dissent, Kavanaugh argued that the Louisiana law \u2014 which requires abortion providers to have surgical admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their abortion clinic \u2014 is not unduly burdensome because those providers can simply obtain those admitting privileges.\n\nThat goes against the court's ruling in Whole Woman's Health, which held that a similar law in Texas created an undue burden for women who want an abortion, thus violating the Constitution.\n\nAdmitting privileges laws like those in Louisiana and Texas were indeed very burdensome for women seeking an abortion. They made abortion providers jump through absurd, medically unnecessary hoops that often resulted in clinics being forced to close, which resulted in many women being forced to wait longer and travel longer distances to get the procedure.\n\n\"No one should mistake Kavanaugh\u2019s dissent as a genuine compromise,\" Mark Joseph Stern, a legal correspondent at Slate, wrote in a piece panning Kavanaugh's dissent. \"There will always be a way to uphold an abortion law while insisting that somehow, someday, women might still find a legal way to terminate their pregnancies.\"\n\nIf Kavanaugh isn't willing to respect basic Supreme Court precedent on the Louisiana abortion case, there's no reason to think he'll respect it on Roe v. Wade or abortion rights more broadly \u2014 and the supposedly pro-choice Collins will be to blame.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was able to expose Trump's remarkably brazen corruption, pointing out that members of Congress are \"being held to a higher ethical standard\" than Trump and that current law allows him \"to be a pretty bad guy.\"\n\nThe quick lesson came during a House Oversight Committee hearing, where experts on government ethics were testifying on H.R. 1, the legislation offered by Democrats to address concerns about voting access and election integrity.\n\nOcasio-Cortez delivered what she described as a \"lightning round\" of questions with the witnesses, posing as \"the bad guy\" attempting to get away with unethical conduct.\n\nHer questions revealed, among other things, that it is currently possible for an official to run a campaign with money exclusively from corporate interests, and write or influence legislation directly affecting those interests, even if the elected official held a financial stake in the related industries.\n\nTrump has broken with presidential tradition practiced over decades by both parties by refusing to divest from his personal business or put it into a blind trust.\n\nThis has made it possible for Trump to profit from the presidency through his decisions made in the Oval Office, where it is now unclear if he is working in the interest of the country or of himself.\n\nAt the same time, outside interests \u2014 including foreign concerns \u2014 have patronized Trump's private businesses even while they are seeking sign-off from the government Trump heads. It looks a lot like bribery.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said there are strict ethics rules and regulations that a member of Congress like herself have to follow, Ocasio-Cortez, asking witness Walter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics, \"Compared to the Executive branch, and compared to say the President of the United States, would you say that Congress has the same sort of standard of accountability? Is there more teeth in that regulation in Congress on the president or would you say it's about even or more so on the federal?\"\n\n\"In terms of laws that apply to the president? There's almost no laws at all that apply to the president,\" Shaub said.\n\n\"So I'm being held \u2014 and every person in this body is being held \u2014 to a higher ethical standard than the president of the United States,\" Ocasio-Cortez replied.\n\nIt's already super legal, as we've seen, for me to be a pretty bad guy. So it's even easier for the President of the United States to be one, I would assume.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Shaub replied.\n\nTrump's corruption is all-encompassing. He has mingled his private family interests so thoroughly with the business of the federal government and turned his office into a cash cow for himself.\n\nWhile other presidents have been led by a moral compass and a sense of shame, Trump has no such limitations. It is open season, and the current Congress knows it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Jared Kushner is worth millions, but small donors are paying for his lawyers.\n\nTrump's re-election campaign has used thousands of dollars from donors to pay legal fees for Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is a multi-millionaire.\n\nABC News reports that nearly $100,000 donated to the campaign has gone to pay off Kushner's liabilities. Two payments were made to the firm Winston & Strawn LLP for a total of $97,904. Kushner's lawyer Abe Lowell has been part of the firm since May 2018.\n\nKushner's net worth has been reported to be anywhere from just north of $320 million to as much as $800 million, and his combined net worth with his wife Ivanka Trump could be over $1 billion. A 2016 report from Forbes estimated that the Kushner family, headed by Jared's father Charles Kushner, had a $1.8 billion dollar fortune.\n\nBut the money for his legal defense is being financed largely through small-dollar contributors to the Trump campaign, who donated 98.5 percent of the money to the enterprise. Most of those donations have been for $200 or less.\n\nKushner has been squarely in the crosshairs of the ongoing investigations surrounding Trump at the highest levels. The FBI has reportedly been probing Kushner and his business concerns as part of the ongoing Robert Mueller investigation.\n\nAt the same time, Kushner has been evasive on his official disclosure forms about his Russian contacts, and he was unable to be directly given a security clearance for access to top secret information.\n\nThe campaign has spent massive amounts of money on legal fees for the scandal-plagued individuals involved at the highest levels of Trump's inner circle. Over $6.7 million has been spent so far.\n\nThat includes $514,000 to help Donald Trump Jr., $590,000 for former White House communications director Hope Hicks, $276,000 for former Trump fixer and personal lawyer Michael Cohen, and $173,000 for former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, according to the ABC News report.\n\nMany of the people involved are extremely wealthy, with millions of dollars in the bank and the ability to cover these legal expenses out of their own pockets.\n\nBut they are instead following the model set by Trump himself, who marketed himself as a billionaire while he personally profited from his own presidential campaign. He has continued the practice with the power of the presidency behind him.\n\nTrump's inner circle has had to deal with the legal fallout of their involvement with a presidential campaign that made multiple contacts with Russian operatives. Those contacts triggered the ongoing special counsel investigation of Trump and his team, and have racked up serious convictions and indictments by Robert Mueller.\n\nDonors to Trump's presidential campaign in all likelihood believe their donations are going toward traditional expenditures \u2014 campaign ads, political hires, organizing \u2014 but millions of dollars they've given are financing the legal lifestyles of the extremely rich.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump hired scores of undocumented workers at his New Jersey golf club, and profited by paying them far less than their work was worth.\n\nTrump has built his brand on vilifying undocumented immigrants, appealing to the GOP base's bigotry to build support for his anti-immigrant, nationalistic policies.\n\nYet despite railing against undocumented immigrants and calling for an unnecessary border wall to keep them out, Trump himself has profited off undocumented labor at his ritzy golf clubs across the country.\n\nAnd according to a report published Friday by the Washington Post, Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey employed so many undocumented workers that \"Trump money\" helped residents of one entire town in Costa Rica buy houses and support their families.\n\n\u201cMy whole town practically lived there,\" said one former Bedminster maintenance worker from the town of Santa Teresa de Cajon, which over the years has supplied Trump's New Jersey club with dozens of undocumented workers, former employees told the Post.\n\nThe hiring of undocumented labor at the Bedminster golf club was \"systematic\" and an \"open secret,\" according to the Washington Post's report, which was based on interviews with more than a dozen people from Latin America who worked at the club.\n\nNews of undocumented labor at the Bedminster club first broke in December, when two undocumented housekeepers who had worked there told their story to the New York Times.\n\nBut the Post's new report reveals the shocking scope of the matter. Trump essentially had a pipeline of undocumented workers from Costa Rica who helped build and later maintain the club in New Jersey \u2014 as the Trump Organization demanded more and more cheap labor, and as more and more workers shared news of the opportunity with their friends and family back home.\n\n\u201cMany of us helped him get what he has today,\u201d one undocumented worker living in Costa Rica told the Washington Post. \u201cThis golf course was built by illegals.\u201d\n\nTrump also benefited from drastically underpaying the workers for what their labor was actually worth.\n\nThe work performed ranged from groundskeeping to operating heavy machinery such as bulldozers and excavators. The Trump Organization only paid the undocumented workers $10 or less per hour for the heavy machinery work \u2014 far less than the $51 to $55 dollar per hour salaries that workers who were licensed to operate heavy machinery would have made, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThat means Trump was arguably taking away jobs from the blue collar workers he claims to support, and profiting off of the undocumented workers he has attacked.\n\nYou don't have to go far back to find Trump comments that lay out how hypocritical his practice of profiting off undocumented labor is.\n\nIn fact, just go back to his racist State of the Union address from Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cTolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is actually very cruel,\" Trump said in the speech, in which he lied about the supposed ill effects illegal immigration has on jobs and society.\n\nEric Trump, who now \"leads\" the Trump Organization, and the White House both declined to comment to the Washington Post on Trump's practice of hiring undocumented workers at Trump's Bedminster club.\n\nFor a group of people who normally lie with ease, even the Trump family can't seem to lie its way out of this hypocritical mess.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Mitch McConnell is terrified of voters.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is freaking out over an effort by Democrats to make elections more fair, and his hometown newspaper noticed. In a scathing editorial, the Lexington Herald-Leader lambasted McConnell for making excuses for voter suppression that sound downright \"segregationist.\"\n\n\"Flushed out by Democrats who newly control the House, McConnell increasingly sounds like one of those segregationist lions of yore who roamed the Senate, cloaking their political self-interest in pious bluster about states\u2019 rights and an oppressive federal government,\" the Herald-Leader editorial board wrote.\n\nMcConnell is vehemently opposed to any congressional action which would curb Republican voter suppression efforts. In doing so, the Herald-Leader argued, McConnell \"has all but declared that he's against removing barriers to voting and making elections cleaner and more fair because he thinks it would help Democrats win.\"\n\nThe target of McConnell's fear and ire is H.R. 1, the House Democrats' bill to advance national automatic voter registration, safeguard election infrastructure against foreign attackers, and end partisan gerrymandering.\n\nThe bill would restore aspects of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which was gutted in a 2013 Supreme Court ruling, in order to protect the right of every citizen to make their voice heard. This is especially important for people of color who have been discriminated against at the ballot box both in the past by Jim Crow laws, and in the present with other voter suppression measures like voter ID laws.\n\nMcConnell \"spurns the role of Congress\" to protect the rights of black Americans and other minorities to vote without fear, the Herald-Leader said, when he smears the idea of restoring voting rights as a \"power grab\" by Democrats in Congress.\n\nMcConnell's \"most repugnant\" stance, the Herald-Leader argued, is his opposition to any and all efforts to restore voting rights to felons who have served their sentence.\n\nThe paper notes that a quarter of Kentucky's black population is permanently barred from voting, and that 312,000 Kentuckians cannot vote because they have previously been convicted of felonies.\n\nWhile McConnell gives lip service to the idea that states should decide who should be allowed to vote, a poll shows more than 3 in 5 Kentuckians support giving voting rights to formerly incarcerated people.\n\nMcConnell is not alone in defending voter suppression efforts; in fact, it's essentially the GOP party line these days.\n\nRepublicans, from Trump all the way down to state lawmakers, consistently stoke panic about nonexistent \"voter fraud\" in order to pass discriminatory measures like voter ID laws, improperly purge voter rolls, and cut back on early voting.\n\nIn the 2018 midterm election, Georgia voters faced barriers erected by then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who spent years purging mostly black residents from the voter rolls. Kemp narrowly defeated Stacey Abrams, who would have been the first black woman governor in the nation if she had won.\n\nIn 2013, North Carolina's Republican-led legislature tried to pass legislation specifically aimed at making it harder for black residents to vote. A federal court struck down the provision, saying the GOP lawmakers targeted black voters \"with almost surgical precision.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans got caught because they made the racism absurdly obvious, but other states have passed similar measures and gotten away with it.\n\nAll of this is why Democrats in Congress are pushing H.R. 1 and other measures to make voting more fair.\n\nBut McConnell has already promised to oppose the bill \"at every opportunity.\" He has the power to prevent any House-passed legislation from even coming up for a vote in the Senate, and vowed such a bill \"will not pass the U.S. Senate.\"\n\nThe question that Kentuckians \u2014 and Americans \u2014 should be asking is: Why is Mitch McConnell so afraid of making it easier for people to vote?\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "GOP Rep. Devin Nunes' attempt to cover for the Trump administration has been thwarted by House Democrats.\n\nElections have consequences.\n\nAfter winning back control of the House in a 2018 blue wave, Democrats announced on Wednesday that they are re-opening the House Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation \u2014 because former Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Republicans botched it so badly when they were in charge.\n\n\u201cDuring the prior Congress, the Committee began to pursue credible reports of money laundering and financial compromise related to the business interests of President Trump, his family, and his associates,\" current House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, these and numerous other avenues of inquiry were not completed during the last Congress,\" Schiff said.\n\nDemocrats on the committee plan to do a thorough probe of Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election, whether the Russian government coordinated its attacks with anyone in the Trump campaign, and whether Trump himself may have been compromised by a foreign power.\n\nWhen Nunes and Republicans were in charge, Intelligence Committee member Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said, they repeatedly undermined the investigation \u2014 and even hid evidence by blocking Democrats on the committee from pursuing leads on \"worrisome contacts between the Russians and candidate Trump, his family, his businesses, and his campaign.\"\n\nUltimately, Nunes and the GOP-led committee ended the investigation in early 2018. Democrats said the investigation was a sham from the very start because Republicans were trying to cover for Trump, as well as his family members and campaign staff.\n\nSchiff said the re-opened House probe will focus on five areas:\n\nThe \"scope and scale\" of Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nWhether there was any \"coordination between the Russian government, or related foreign actors, and individuals associated with Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, transition, administration, or business interests.\"\n\nWhether foreign actors have tried to use any kind of blackmail \u2014 financial or not \u2014 as leverage over Trump.\n\nWhether Trump or anyone in his orbit \u2014 both familial and campaign \u2014 \"have sought to influence U.S. government policy in service of foreign interests.\"\n\nWhether anyone has tried to \"impede, obstruct, and/or mislead authorized investigations into these matters, including those in the Congress.\"\n\nAlready, the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday voted to send transcripts of witness interviews the committee conducted over the past two years to special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nWhen reporters on Capitol Hill asked Nunes whether he voted to tun over the transcripts, Nunes declined to comment and instead gave a petty retort.\n\n\u201cYou guys are an embarrassment to yourselves,\u201d Nunes said, according to CNN's Manu Raju.\n\nThe news that the committee is re-opening the investigation comes a day after Trump called for an end to all investigations of his administration during his State of the Union address Tuesday night.\n\nWhen Trump's plea fell on deaf ears, he lashed out again on Wednesday.\n\n\"He\u2019s just a political hack who is trying to build a name for himself,\" Trump said of Schiff and the re-opened investigation.\n\nVice President Mike Pence defended Trump's startling remarks in a Wednesday interview on \"CBS This Morning\" by trying to dismiss investigations into Trump's potential crimes as \"partisan.\"\n\n\u201cCongressional oversight is a part of the checks and balances of our system, but what the president referred to last night was partisan investigations,\u201d Pence said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also called on Democrats to end their investigations into Trump and his administration.\n\n\u201cLook, we will never give up our oversight role, but this country is too great for a small vision of just investigations,\" McCarthy said at a press conference Wednesday morning.\n\nThis is the same McCarthy who admitted in 2015 that the GOP's years-long investigation into the 2012 embassy attack in Benghazi was a political attempt to discredit Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cEverybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee,\u201d McCarthy said on Fox News in 2015. \u201cWhat are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she\u2019s un-trustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought and made that happen.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who just won a major victory by forcing Trump to end his senseless government shutdown, does not appear moved by the GOP's pleas for investigative mercy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our congressional responsibility, and if we didn\u2019t do it, we would be delinquent in that,\u201d Pelosi said Wednesday, adding that Trump's call for the investigations to end was an \"all-out threat.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, it looks like House Democrats are just getting started with their investigative oversight.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Actions speak louder than words, and despite Trump's pledge, his administration's actions are not only falling short \u2014 they're moving in the wrong direction.\n\nTrump announced this week during his State of the Union address that he plans to launch an effort to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S. within the next decade.\n\n\"My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years,\" Trump declared. \"Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.\"\n\nHowever, actions speak louder than words, and despite Trump's pledge this week, his administration is not only falling short \u2014 it's moving in the wrong direction entirely.\n\nWhile many HIV/AIDS experts were excited when news of Trump's plan to increase funding for HIV/AIDS prevention was first reported, their excitement soon turned to skepticism when the plan was released.\n\n\"There were high expectations that the president would use this opportunity to announce something bold on HIV in the U.S.,\" said Jen Kates, vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nBut those expectations were not met, Kates said, noting that Trump's plan lacked the necessary details to even evaluate its potential impact.\n\n\"There was no detail on funding, for example, or the specific components of what might be done,\" she said. \"Without this detail, it is hard to say what this will mean for truly making a difference on HIV.\"\n\nWhat we can say, however, is that since taking office, Trump has undermined the fight against HIV/AIDS by letting partisan politics and ideology take precedence over science \u2014 and those actions have continued even as recently as this week.\n\nThe day after Trump delivered his State of the Union address, his own Department of Justice announced that it is suing a Philadelphia-based nonprofit to stop it from opening the nation's first safe injection site.\n\nSafe injection sites are facilities where intravenous drug users can get clean needles and inject drugs under medical supervision. These sites, which are based on the harm reduction approach to disease prevention and control, have been credited with containing the spread of infectious diseases like hepatitis and HIV, as well as reducing fatal drug overdoses.\n\nShutting down a site like this means that drug users will not have access to clean needles and will be more likely to reuse and share needles, putting them at increased risk for HIV.\n\nIn December 2018, the White House marked another setback in the fight against HIV/AIDS, when it shut down a critical line of HIV research because it involved the use of fetal tissue.\n\nReacting to the move, one government researcher warned, \"This effectively stops all of our research to discover a cure for HIV.\"\n\nAs the Daily Beast noted, the Trump administration also recently made changes to Medicare Part D that are \"almost zeroed in\" on restricting access to retroviral drugs for people living with HIV.\n\nBut Trump's history of undermining HIV prevention efforts goes back nearly to the beginning of his presidency.\n\nIn May 2017, the White House released a budget proposal that would have slashed over $1 billion in funding for international and domestic HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs including PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and the Ryan White Program.\n\nLast year, the administration started taking money from the Ryan White program to pay for the cost of reuniting immigrant families separated by the administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy.\n\nAlso included in the 2017 budget proposal were plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act and make devastating cuts to Medicaid. Given that an estimated 40 percent of Americans living with HIV rely on Medicaid for healthcare, those funding cuts would disproportionately harm people with HIV.\n\nWhile Trump and congressional Republicans haven't been successful in their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, they have waged all-out war on health care access, often targeting those at risk for HIV.\n\nFor example, the Trump administration has proposed a so-called \"religious freedom\" rule that would essentially allow providers to deny health care services to LGBTQ patients, and has also attempted to dismantle the ACA's non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ patients.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration and its GOP allies have repeatedly tried to strip funding from Planned Parenthood, which provides affordable HIV testing, as well sex education and critical community health services, including in areas disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS.\n\nAs a result of these moves, six members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS resigned in June 2017, saying Trump didn\u2019t care about fighting the disease. Just a few months later, Trump fired the remaining 16 members of the council with no explanation.\n\nThe tragic reality is that advancements in science have brought us closer than ever to being able to end the HIV epidemic, but the Trump administration is moving us backward \u2014 making his State of the Union pledge nothing more than an empty promise.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Where\u2019s the rest of my money?'\" she told the Washington Post.\n\nDennis-Bowyer is one of thousands of federal employees who experienced delays in receiving back pay for weeks after the shutdown ended.\n\nAnd the chaos is not limited to federal workers. Some contractors have not been paid for work done as far back as October 2018, and are waiting for agencies to process a backlog of invoices.\n\nSome payment delays, the Post reports, are caused because employees cannot log on to agency networks, since passwords expired over the course of the shutdown.\n\n\"People are fatigued by the shutdown,\" David Verardo, president of AFGE Local 3403, which represents employees at the National Science Foundation and other agencies, told the Post. \"They're demoralized to some extent,\" he added.\n\nThe shutdown began in late December, after a tantrum-throwing Trump demanded $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Over the next 35 days, federal employees did not receive a paycheck, which forced some to worry about homelessness or visit food pantries in order to provide for their families.\n\nIn the end, Trump caved to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's demands and reopened the government with no funding for a wall.\n\nHowever, the agreement only funded the government for three weeks. And on Friday morning, a White House spokesperson said, \"We're on the verge of a government shutdown again.\"\n\nWhile the White House went on to pre-emptively blame Democrats, a bipartisan group of members of Congress is currently working together to come up with a funding plan which includes adequate border security initiatives. Trump will have the opportunity to sign or veto whatever legislation Congress agrees to.\n\nIn the meantime, the back pay issues are already causing resentment and anxiety for federal workers who don't know how they would cope with another shutdown.\n\nTrump's initial shutdown caused pain and hardship for 800,000 federal employees, and even Republicans thought it was a stupid idea. Yet here we are with Trump threatening to go down that chaotic, harmful road yet again.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Instead of denouncing the transparent attempt to distract from the rampant corruption of the Trump-Pence administration, Pence doubled down on the whining.\n\nPence echoed Trump's unfounded complaints about investigations into his corrupt administration, describing such investigations as merely \"partisan.\"\n\n\"Congressional oversight is a part of the checks and balances of our system, but what the president referred to last night was partisan investigations,\" Pence said.\n\n\"We don't object to oversight \u2013 that's the proper role of committees in the Congress, but when it takes on a partisan tint, when it seems more intent on becoming a forum for invective against the president and against the administration, the American people expect better.\"\n\nPence's contention that oversight under the newly Democratic House has been tainted by partisanship is a lie.\n\nIn fact, this Congress has not even begun seriously investigating the Trump administration's abuses because it has been dealing with the fallout from his shutdown of the federal government.\n\nThere is a lot to investigate, and when Republicans held the House, they shirked their constitutional duties and ignored Trump corruption. Instead, Republicans worked as Trump's defenders, blocking attempts to figure out how he and his team have been wasting tax dollars and engaging in underhanded dealings.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama those same Republicans engaged in investigation after investigation. They used their congressional power to pursue issues, like Benghazi, in the vain hopes of uncovering scandals that could hurt Democrats. They came up empty.\n\nBut now Trump's corrupt fingerprints are all over a growing roster of issues: His campaign's involvement with Russian operatives meddling with the election. His use of government resources to go on luxury vacations. His personal profiteering from the presidency. His cavalier approach to disclosing national security secrets to compromised officials (with Pence's knowledge).\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nAlready much of Trump's corruption is under investigation from nonpartisan law enforcement.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is a Republican, heading up the investigation into the Russia issue. Federal prosecutors are investigating Trump's dirty \"charity\" and his inaugural committee.\n\nDespite the Trump-Pence protests there are a host of issues to be investigated by Congress. That is their job.\n\nThe results of the 2018 election were in large part because voters were tired of Trump's corruption being allowed to go unchecked.\n\nPence said, \"the American people expect better.\" He's right \u2014 that's why they voted for Democrats.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

His appeals were exhausted, but he had one last request: As a Muslim, he wanted an imam to be in the chamber with him when he was put to death.\n\nIn Alabama, prisoners can have a Christian chaplain with them in the chamber when they are executed. Ray's imam was available to join him in the death penalty chamber, but Alabama \u2014 and a majority of the United States Supreme Court \u2014 were so eager to put the man to death, and so eager to inflict one more casual cruelty, that they refused to stay the execution for a short time so that the imam could be present.\n\nThe Supreme Court announced its decision just after 9 p.m. on Thursday night. Ray was executed at 10:12 p.m., without his imam. All four liberal justices dissented from the refusal to stay the decision.\n\nThis is a Supreme Court that has touted its commitment to \"religious freedom,\" but it is really only freedom for conservative Christians.\n\nThe conservatives on the court ruled that merely signing a piece of paper to forego providing birth control to your employees was a substantial burden on religious freedom. And they held that making a cake for a gay couple was too terrible for a Christian baker to contemplate.\n\nBut when it came to a Muslim man asking for a small thing that affected no one but him, Alabama and the conservatives on the Supreme Court suddenly weren't so interested in accommodating someone's religious beliefs.\n\nAll four liberal justices would have granted the stay so that Ray could have his imam in the chamber with him. Justice Elena Kagan wrote an elegant, sparse dissent explaining why this decision was wrong. The Establishment Clause of the Constitution states that no religion can be officially preferred over another. It's a core principle of the founding of America.\n\nIn this instance, Kagan noted, the lower court \u2014 the Eleventh Circuit \u2014 issued a stay and wanted to hear the matter in full and then issue a decision. Justice Kagan explains why that is so wrong. \"Instead, this Court short-circuits that ordinary process\u2014and itself rejects the claim with little briefing and no argument\u2014just so the State can meet its preferred execution date.\"\n\nShe's right. There was no reason the execution of Ray had to happen on February 7. Since Ray's appeals on the execution itself had been exhausted, had he succeeded with this request, all it would have meant was that he could die with his spiritual advisor in the room, which is the very least Alabama could provide.\n\nInstead, Alabama fought it all the way to the Supreme Court, where it met with a conservative majority more than willing to treat Muslims with disrespect and disdain.\n\nThis case lays bare the fact that the conservatives on this court are only interested in religious liberty when it allows them to advance their conservative Christian beliefs. Each member of the conservative majority claims to be religious, but in the end, here they showed no mercy.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Yet they were able to influence government decisions that affected the lives of American veterans, and may have made unethical profits for themselves in the process.\n\nThe chair of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA), sent a letter to Robert Wilkie, the current Secretary for Veterans Affairs, informing him that the investigation of what Takano called the \"Mar-a-Lago Three\" is now underway.\n\nTakano noted that the Mar-a-Lago Three were \"not accountable to veterans and the American people\" when they \"ostensibly used their wealth and connections to President Trump and his family to make decisions for the Department.\"\n\nCiting public documents and related email traffic, Takano wrote that the department \"apparently treated these Mar-a-Lago members as having decision-making authority.\"\n\nThat allowed these inexperienced Trump cronies, who had no official role at the VA, to weigh in on official business like picking candidates to lead the department or organizing meetings between the VA and outside businesses.\n\nOf particular concern for Takano is that the three men have \"no experience delivering healthcare to veterans\" \u2014 but they still tried to influence government decisions on healthcare delivery, and rejected advice from experts at the department, in order to benefit themselves.\n\nTakano noted that the VA entered into an agreement with Apple that \"could personally enrich Dr. Moskowitz and his family,\" and that then-VA Secretary David Shulkin participated in a Veterans Day event at the New York Stock Exchange that promoted Marvel, Perlmutter's company.\n\nThe scandal is an example both of Trump's corruption \u2014 which the previous Republican-led Congress allowed to thrive unchecked \u2014 and his seemingly never-ending disdain for veterans and the military.\n\nVoters clearly got sick of this behavior from Trump and Republicans, which is one reason the House, and its substantial investigative power, is now in Democratic hands. And now Congress can finally do its job and start defending veterans against Trump's greed and disinterest.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's acting attorney general sure doesn't seem to want to tell Congress the whole truth.\n\nMembers of Congress weren't sure if they could trust Matthew Whitaker, Trump's acting attorney general, to answer all of their questions during his scheduled testimony before a House committee on Friday. So on Thursday, they authorized a subpoena just in case they needed it.\n\nAnd judging by Whitaker's petulant response \u2014 announcing that he'll refuse to testify as long as the subpoena threat remains \u2014 it looks like they were right to be worried.\n\nDemocrats on the committee want to talk to Whitaker because they're concerned about his hostility to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign's interactions with Russian operatives during the 2016 election.\n\nAfter weeks of avoiding the issue, Whitaker finally agreed to testify Friday before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nBut, as committee chair Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) explained in a statement, some in the Trump administration have reportedly been urging Whitaker to skip Friday's hearing. And if former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' testimony was any guide, there was a serious risk that Whitaker would simply avoid answering tough questions with bogus claims of \"executive privilege.\"\n\nThat's why the Judiciary Committee passed the resolution that authorizes them to subpoena Whitaker. They're not subpoenaing him yet, and say they won't if he cooperates \u2014 but they're giving themselves the option in case they need it.\n\n\"When we invite officials to testify before this Committee, they have to appear,\" Nadler wrote. \"When we ask them questions, they have to provide us with answers\u2014or provide us with a valid and clearly articulated reason to withhold certain information.\"\n\n\"Without the threat of a subpoena, I believe it may be difficult to hold Mr. Whitaker to this standard,\" Nadler added.\n\nWhitaker didn't take kindly to this. Shortly after the committee made the authorization on Thursday, Whitaker demanded the committee promise not to subpoena him on Thursday or Friday \u2014 or else he'll refuse to testify.\n\n\"Based upon today\u2019s action, it is apparent that the Committee\u2019s true intention is not to discuss the great work of the Department of Justice, but to create a public spectacle,\" Whitaker said in a disingenuous and evasive statement.\n\nWhitaker is a shady operator who was installed by Trump as acting attorney general after he fired Sessions. Despite Sessions' boosting of Trump and longtime credentials as a conservative hack, Trump wanted an attorney general who, unlike Sessions, might be willing to slow down the Mueller probe.\n\nWhitaker had previously committed to a January hearing in a phone call to Nadler and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chairman of the Oversight committee.\n\nBut since then, he has been a no-show.\n\nNadler said Whitaker and officials at the Department of Justice engaged in \"unacceptable\" delay tactics by trying to hold off Whitaker's testimony until a permanent attorney general was confirmed.\n\nThe chairman also took a hard line on the question of \"executive privilege,\" and reserved the right to subpoena Whitaker if he tries to pull the same stunt Sessions did in 2017.\n\nDuring that testimony, Sessions repeatedly avoided question on communications between Trump and the Department of Justice. He claimed Trump might theoretically want to invoke executive privilege over the content of those conversations, blocking them from congressional oversight.\n\n\"This excuse is, of course, ridiculous,\" Nadler explained, \"The President can choose to invoke executive privilege and instruct a government witness not to answer a specific question. The witness cannot speculate that the President might want to assert executive privilege and refuse to answer a question on that basis.\"\n\nHowever, Republicans allowed Sessions to get away with avoiding key questions \u2014 just as they've given Trump's corruption a free pass for two years in every other way.\n\nWhitaker is acting like he has something to hide from Congress about Trump's actions. Even if he does eventually appear, his track record indicates he'll do whatever he can to avoid key inquiries on Trump's attempts to obstruct justice.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Four Pinocchios is the worst ranking a statement can receive.\n\nJayapal then read from a leaked draft memo that laid out the very family separation policy Whitaker denied.\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2018, the Trump administration ripped thousands of children away from their families as immigrants crossed the border. Many families were legally seeking asylum, only to be separated by Trump administration officials.\n\nAfter news of the policy spread, including the revelation that Trump was building baby jails to incarcerate toddlers, national and international outrage exploded.\n\nBut significant damage had already been done, as the Trump administration lost track of hundreds of parents, effectively kidnapping children while being unable or unwilling to reunite them with their families.\n\nJayapal also forced Whitaker to admit the DOJ has no process in place to track separated families.\n\nAn impassioned Jayapal then demanded to know if Whitaker was aware of \"what kind of damage has been done to children and families across this country? Children who will never get to see their parents again? Do you understand the magnitude of that?\"\n\nIn previous congressional testimony, Health and Human Services (HHS) officials warned about potential health consequences resulting from the family separation policy.\n\n\"Separation of children from their parents entails significant risk of harm to children,\" Commander Jonathan D. White, an HHS official, told senators.\n\nIn merely five minutes, Rep.

    "text": "He's deploying even more troops to the border for a useless, expensive political ploy.\n\nBefore the midterm elections, Trump needlessly deployed thousands of U.S. troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to try to rally his racist base against immigrants. Even though the ploy didn't work, Trump still kept it up \u2014 and now, what started as a racist campaign stunt could end up costing taxpayers more than $1 billion, the Washington Post reports.\n\nThe nakedly partisan use of American troops, in addition to the staggering price tag, is enraging veterans and members of Congress.\n\n\"It is simply obscene that Trump is wasting the time, energy, and money that could be spent defending us against real threats, and force readiness to face unforeseen threats, for his racist stunts,\" Will Fischer, a veteran and director of government relations at the advocacy group VoteVets, told Shareblue Media.\n\n\"The reason that voters increasingly say they will not vote for him again is because of his absolute mismanagement \u2014 indeed, malmanagement \u2014 of our military,\" Fischer added.\n\n\"It is outrageous that President Trump is sending thousands of active-duty personnel back to the border to shovel manure, change tires and lay concertina wire,\" Rep. Anthony Brown (D-MD), vice-chair of the House Armed Services Committee and a 30-year combat veteran, said in a statement.\n\nTrump used racist rhetoric to falsely claim that immigrants are invading, and even \"infesting,\" the United States in order to justify sending roughly 8,000 troops to the southern border. It was a clear attempt to stir up anti-immigrant animosity among the Republican base and boost voter turnout in the midterms.\n\nWhile the number of troops has been reduced somewhat, it still remains unacceptably high. The $1 billion price tag, which the Post arrived at from data released by the Department of Defense and other analyses, assumes no major changes to the current level of 4,300 troops at the southern border.\n\nThe misuse of military resources and disrespect of our troops couldn't be more obvious. Some of those troops spent their Thanksgiving holiday away from their families in order to shovel horse manure and perform other menial tasks.\n\nOne Democratic governor of a border state recently said she has had enough of Trump's fake crisis.\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced earlier this week that she is removing most National Guard troops from the border, lambasting Trump's \"charade of border fear-mongering by misusing our diligent National Guard troops.\"\n\nTrump continues to pretend there is a crisis at the border as he begs Congress to spend $5.7 billion on a border wall. So far, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have unequivocally rejected Trump's demand.\n\nTrump hasn't been able to get money for the wall \u2014 but he has still managed to waste $1 billion on his fake border crisis by shamefully misusing the women and men of the U.S. military as political props.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Cory Gardner in 2020.\n\nDemocrats made sweeping gains across the country in the 2018 midterm elections, but the Senate remains in Republican hands \u2014 for now. And even though the 2020 election is more than 630 days away, several high-profile Coloradans are already jumping at the chance to flip one more Senate seat blue by ousting Republican Cory Gardner.\n\nFormer Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff announced on Thursday morning that he will join a growing field of Democrats looking to challenge Gardner \u2014 who is likely to be one of the most vulnerable Republican senators in 2020, and who has even GOP officials worried about his re-election chances.\n\nRomanoff spent eight years in the Colorado House, including four as speaker. In his announcement, he pledged to fight for progressive values on issues from the environment to health care to immigration.\n\n\"We've seen politicians do the bidding of billionaires, catering to their corporate benefactors while sticking the rest of us with the bill,\" Romanoff said. \"I'm running to change that.\"\n\nRomanoff's progressive platform is in line with the views of Colorado voters \u2014 who recently elected Democrats to every major statewide office, kept control of the state House, and flipped control of the state Senate from red to blue.\n\nGiven this political reality, Gardner probably did himself no favors when he recently flip-flopped on his opposition to Trump's fitness to be president.\n\nIn 2016, Gardner boldly declared that he could not and would not \"support someone who brags about degrading and assaulting women\" \u2014 referring to Trump, after the \"Access Hollywood\" video came out showing Trump gleefully bragging about being a sexual predator.\n\nYet less than three years later, Gardner has fully embraced Trump and endorsed his 2020 campaign.\n\nRomanoff is not alone in seeking to challenge Gardner.\n\nEarlier this week, former state Sen.

    "text": "Because they have no real legislative agenda, the House GOP is just going to try to put women at risk 'again and again and again,' as Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy put it.\n\nHouse Republicans are pushing a bill that would threaten doctors with criminal penalties if they don't provide medical care for babies who survive attempted abortions \u2014 a bill that is both unnecessary and dangerous.\n\nBut none of that is stopping the GOP, which is once again turning to fearmongering and lies about abortion to rile up the right-wing base because Republicans have no other real ideas for governing.\n\nThe idea that abortion providers routinely deliver live infants and then kill them is a completely bogus right-wing myth that has found its way into the halls of Congress. If such a thing ever did happen, it wouldn't be necessary to pass a new law about it because infanticide is already illegal.\n\nBut the GOP bill is not just useless \u2014 it's also dangerous, because its vague, broad language could interfere with doctors' normal medical practice.\n\nMinority Leader Kevin McCarthy, however, is determined to promote these harmful lies by demanding a voice vote on the resolution. He's perfectly aware the Democrats will object, so he says Republicans will just ask \"again, and again, and again\" until they get what they want.\n\nThat isn't legislating; it's theater. It's also the same disastrous impulse that led Republicans to vote, scores of times, to repeal Obamacare when they knew it would never make its way past Obama's desk \u2014 which ended up costing the GOP dearly in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nFor years, the GOP has flogged myths about what they call \"late-term abortions\" (which, because it's not even a real medical term, they inaccurately use to describe ending pretty much any pregnancy after the first trimester). But these myths have been given new life thanks to abortion rights legislation being passed in New York and proposed in Virginia.\n\nIn a comically overwrought portion of the State of the Union, Trump described the New York bill as \"legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments before birth.\" He went on to claim that the embattled governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, would \"execute a baby after birth.\"\n\nFirst of all, there's no such thing as an \"abortion\" moments before birth or in the ninth month of pregnancy. Abortions after 24 weeks are vanishingly rare and are only done in the case of fetal anomalies, and if a woman's health requires ending a pregnancy after 24 weeks, doctors just do a C-section or induce labor and care for the infant in the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\nSecond of all, the actual legislation Trump referred to is much less dramatic than he suggests. New York removed some barriers to later abortions so that women no longer had to travel out of state for abortions that occur later in pregnancy. The proposed legislation in Virginia would allow third-trimester abortions with a signature of only one doctor, rather than three \u2014 and that doctor would still have to say there were significant risks to the mother's mental or physical health.\n\nNone of these are even close to ripping babies from wombs or executing them after birth. That's because, simply put, healthy fetuses are not \"aborted\" at the nine-month mark in any state for any reason.\n\nMoreover, this approach isn't nearly the winning strategy the GOP thinks it is. A decisive majority of Americans \u2014 58 percent \u2014 think abortion should be legal in most or all cases. The types of abortions the right wants to scaremonger over are also quite rare: only 1.3 percent of abortions happen after the 21st week.\n\nIntroducing bills no one wants and that have no hope of passing shouldn't be a governing strategy \u2014 but with the House GOP, it's all they have.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Trump administration has once again put corporate profits ahead of the best interests of families.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration delivered a victory to predatory payday lenders, proposing a new rule that will help them exploit low-income families.\n\nIn a roundly criticized move, the new rule from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) would roll back Obama-era guidelines meant to rein in some of the most pernicious tactics used by payday lenders.\n\nThe Washington Post said the move is equivalent to \"boosting the fortunes of an industry accused of keeping low-income borrowers trapped in a cycle of debt.\"\n\nAccording to Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA), it's more proof the Trump administration is \"putting corporate profits ahead of protecting American families from abusive practices.\"\n\nThe rule issued under President Obama required payday lenders to ensure that people taking out loans have the ability to repay them. But CFPB under Trump wants to undo the rule and allow payday lenders to exploit low-income workers who are forced to rely on the predatory services.\n\nUnder the system Trump prefers, borrowers sometimes take months to repay high-interest loans meant to be repaid in weeks. Some families are then forced to take out additional loans \u2014 at 300 percent interest or more \u2014 to pay off old loans, leading to a cycle of debt, says Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), chair of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nWaters put out a statement condemning the proposed rule change, saying the move left her \"deeply troubled.\"\n\nFormer CFPB director Richard Cordray was also critical, issuing a statement saying the decision \"will hurt those who are being abused and mistreated by ruinous loans.\"\n\nThe rollback from CFPB is laced with controversy. The Washington Post reports that lobbyists for payday lenders held multiple events at Trump properties over the past several years. Since Trump financially benefits from these events, government watchdogs warn they could be \"legal bribery, a way to influence regulation and policy by giving money to the president.\"\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the first time the Trump administration prioritized corporate profits over the well-being of families. Trump supported and signed the GOP tax scam into law. That bill showered corporations with billions of dollars of tax cuts, while middle-class families were largely left out in the cold.\n\nA recent report showed big Wall Street banks raked in $21 billion from the tax scam, yet still cut thousands of jobs. While other corporations also received a windfall from Republicans, they did not choose to invest in hiring more workers or increasing wages. Instead, corporations lavished Wall Street investors with stock buybacks, doing next to nothing to help the average worker.\n\nThe desire to eliminate protections for the most vulnerable, for no reason other than corporate profits, fits into a disturbing Trump administration pattern.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Proponents of the provisions say the law is necessary for Congress to conduct proper oversight, as required by the constitution.\n\nThe leaders of the organization Americans for Tax Fairness argue that Trump's tax returns could show anything from Trump's using fraud to cheat on his taxes, to undue foreign influence from Russia.\n\nEven without passing H.R. 1, House Democrats can \u2014 and should \u2014 obtain Trump's tax returns. As CNN's John Berman explains, Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), chair of the Ways and Means Committee, can demand Trump's tax returns directly from the Treasury Department.\n\n\"I don't think there's ambiguity in the law there. Ways and Means can ask for an get the returns,\" Berman said.\n\nWhile the law is clear, the new Democratic majority is not rushing the process. \"The House is going to proceed with restraint, with regular order, and that's why hearings will take place,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), a member of the House leadership team, said. He added that Democrats will not overstep or over-politicize their constitutional duties.\n\nIn his conversation with CNN's Berman, investigative journalist David Cay Johnson praised Chairman Neal's methodical approach as \"very smart.\" Those comments are echoed by Ways and Means committee member Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ), who told Politico, \"The law is on our side. We need patience.\" Pascrell added that Neal is likely to request Trump's tax returns from Treasury sometime in the next three months.\n\nSome progressive members of Congress are encouraging Neal to act sooner rather than later, as Trump is expected to fight the effort in court. Trump's legal team is already gearing up to keep his taxes hidden from public view, which would likely lead to a Supreme Court showdown.\n\nTrump's fear was evident at Tuesday's State of the Union address, when he called for Congress to give up their investigations.\n\nBut Democrats have refused to back down. This hearing is the first step of shining a spotlight on years, possibly decades, of Trump's corruption.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Paul Manafort somehow managed to get himself in even more trouble with unnamed Ukrainians and a shady Russian.\n\nEven after pleading guilty to conspiring against the United States, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort just couldn't help himself. He had to get cash. He had to keep working. So he did, likely for the same type of people he\u2019s worked with before: dictators, pro-Russian Ukrainian strongmen, and shady Russian billionaires.\n\nSomehow Manafort managed to do work on behalf of Ukraine during 2018, a year in which he spent most of the time either on house arrest or in jail. It's fairly inventive, but it also landed him something he probably didn't expect: a brand new indictment from special counsel Robert Mueller's office.\n\nThe prosecutors said that the new charges, and Manafort's overall pattern of deception, goes \"very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating.\" Which could also spell trouble for Trump.\n\nIn laying out their case for the new charges, prosecutors told the judge what a spectacular amount of lying Manafort had done in the past:\n\nThe defendant coming into this had lied to the Department of Justice, had lied to banks, had lied to his own defense counsel, had violated court orders, had lied to his tax preparers, had lied to his bookkeepers. In other words, there were so many lies.\n\nAnd Manafort might have started lying, prosecutors said, because he was trying to increase his chance for a pardon. Trump has definitely dangled that possibility in front of Manafort in the past.\n\nThere's also a tantalizing reference in the hearing transcript, which lays out prosecutors' rationale for the additional charges, to a \"backdoor\" related to Ukraine. It appears that Manafort was working for a political client in Ukraine, as there are also references to polling.\n\nThis new indictment is in addition to Manafort's past convictions and his guilty plea.\n\nBack in August 2018, Manafort was convicted of eight counts of tax fraud and bank fraud, related to the millions of dollars he earned \u2014 and hid \u2014 doing lobbying work for the likes of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nThen shortly after he was convicted, Manafort pleaded guilty to an additional two felony counts and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel.\n\nExcept he didn't really cooperate. He lied to the special counsel and basically tanked his own cooperation agreement with the government.\n\nNow, he's gone even further and gotten himself indicted again.\n\nThese new charges are also related to Manafort's work in Ukraine. It isn't clear who the Ukrainian client was in this instance, but it is somehow all tangled up with Konstantin Kilimnik. Kilimnik is a longtime associate of Manafort who is also, according to the FBI, connected with Russian intelligence.\n\nBack in June 2018, Kilimnik and Manafort were both charged with obstructing justice, conspiracy to obstruct justice by using intimidation or force against a witness, and tampering with a witness, victim or informant.\n\nThis time around, the special counsel alleges Manafort lied to prosecutors about the scope of his discussions with Kilimnik. Manafort talked with Kilimnik August 2, 2016. That's when Manafort was still Trump's campaign chair. They continued to talk all the way through 2018.\n\nThe transcript doesn't explain how Manafort managed to do all this while behind bars or confined to house arrest.\n\nManafort is facing new charges just as Trump is facing more investigations in Congress \u2014 and the walls are closing in on both of them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Rather, most of the cash came from out-of-state supporters of Kavanaugh.\n\nAccording to the Huffington Post, only $19,000 of the nearly $900,000 Collins raked in from donors who gave over $200 came from people in Maine. In contrast, approximately $32,000 came from Kavanaugh advocates, many of whom signed public letters of support backing the accused sexual predator.\n\n\"For the most part, these people donated on the same day or after Collins' Oct. 5 announcement that she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, even though he faced sexual misconduct allegations,\" the Huffington Post reported.\n\nCollins' vote for Kavanaugh came after days of \"difficult\" deliberation, though she ultimately ended up selling out. And apparently, Kavanaugh's apologists decided to pay her back for the support.\n\n\"For all the talk about Collins's record-setting quarter, the reality is that she raised more money from Kavanaugh sympathizers than she did from the people she's supposed to be representing,\" said Amelia Penniman, a spokeswoman for American Bridge 21st Century, the group that discovered the influx of donations from Kavanaugh apologists.\n\n\"That fact speaks volumes and underscores exactly why her days in the Senate are numbered,\" Penniman added.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen.

    "text": "A Fox host casually suggested that Trump should engage in a shocking abuse of power if Congress keeps investigating him.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade encouraged Trump to open revenge investigations into two Democratic members of Congress.\n\nOn \"Fox & Friends,\" Kilmeade targeted Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chair of the Intelligence Committee, and Maxine Waters (D-CA), chair of the Finance Committee, as top targets on what sounds like a proposed enemies list for Trump. Kilmeade was upset at the two lawmakers for having the audacity to investigate Trump for a litany of potentially criminal actions.\n\n\"Why not investigate Adam Schiff? Why not investigate Maxine Waters?\" Kilmeade asked. \"How did they become rich?\"\n\nKilmeade asked these questions after a discussion of Trump's meltdown over House investigations, one of which is being led by Schiff. After being told that any investigation by Trump must go through the Department of Justice, and that there would need to be a legitimate reason for such an investigation, Kilmeade refused to give up on his vengeful idea.\n\n\"Does the president have an attorney? Why doesn't the president just run a private investigation [into] Adam Schiff?\" Kilmeade asked.\n\nSchiff announced earlier this week that the Intelligence Committee would look into allegations of money laundering and other financial crimes related to Trump, his family, and his associates. Several of Trump's closest and most trusted associates are currently under arrest, awaiting prison sentences, or already in prison for federal crimes.\n\nYet when presented with the idea of Congress properly investigating these serious allegations, Kilmeade apparently thought it sounded reasonable to suggest that Trump launch a rogue, personally financed investigation into the personal finances of members of Congress.\n\nFirst of all, neither Schiff nor Waters are particularly wealthy to begin with. According to Roll Call, Schiff ranks number 300 out of 431 members of the House in terms of personal wealth. Waters ranks number 361.\n\nAnd if Fox News wants to compile an \"enemies list\" of members of Congress investigating Trump, there would be a lot more than two names on it.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee, led by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), is looking into why Jared Kushner was able to get a top secret clearance from the White House even though he really shouldn't have. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), is investigating the interplay between Trump's business dealings and his foreign policy activities. The Ways and Means Committee, led by Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) will likely demand Trump's tax returns as part of ongoing investigations.\n\nTrump used his State of the Union address, which was supposed to be a call for unity, to effectively threaten Congress for investigating him.\n\nBut in November, voters rejected Trump's culture of corruption by putting House Democrats in charge of holding him accountable. By continuing and expanding their investigations into Trump, Democrats are showing that they won't be bullied by him \u2014 or by his friends at Fox.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

A new analysis prepared for Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, a pro-trade group, shows every single state losing thousands of jobs, with several losing more than 100,000 in the next few years.\n\nAs millions could find themselves unemployed, the cost to the average American family of four could be as much as $2,389 per year. \"The trade war is already creating enormous economic loss, and this report shows how much worse it could get,\" Dr. Charles Boustany, spokesperson for Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, said in a statement.\n\nAmericans across the country are suffering because of Trump's reckless trade wars. Farmers are losing billions in profits, GM has threatened 14,000 layoffs, and Ford could slash as many as 24,000 jobs.\n\nBut the situation could get significantly worse if Trump continues to down the same path. The new report looks at what may happen if Trump follows through on promised tariffs against certain goods from China beginning on March 1. The analysis lays out several scenarios, including those where China does not retaliate (which is unlikely) all the way through a total trade war.\n\nEven in the best-case scenario, the U.S. will lose 937,000 jobs. But if China retaliates, which it has always done, the job losses skyrocket to more than 2 million.\n\n\"It's time for the administration to take tariff increases off the table for good, end the threat of new tariffs and finally bring an end to the crippling tariffs we are facing right now,\" Boustany implores.\n\nIn 2018, Trump declared that trade wars are \"good and easy to win.\" His rhetoric once again fails to match the reality faced by farmers, auto workers, and thousands more across the country. Trump already hurt middle-class workers with a tax scam designed to give most of the benefits to Wall Street tycoons and the richest one percent of households.\n\nNow his trade war threatens to hurt hundreds of thousands, if not millions, more.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

On Feb. 6, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on preventing gun violence, the first hearing on this topic since 2011.\n\n\"No longer will Congress remain silent on this issue,\" Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, said about the hearing. Thompson noted that Republicans prevented hearings on the issue for years, but this is \"a new day\" and Democrats are determined to get results.\n\nPublic sentiment in favor of gun safety legislation has been growing for years, especially after a gunman murdered 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Since that tragedy, there have been 1,952 mass shooting events in the United States, according to Vox. Yet the GOP-controlled House of Representatives did not hold a single hearing on the issue of gun safety in all that time.\n\nMeanwhile, upwards of 90 percent of Americans support solutions like a background check before people are allowed to purchase a gun. While in power, Republicans refused to lift a finger to prevent mass shooting after mass shooting, despite more than 67,000 gun deaths since Newtown.\n\nBut that wait is now over.\n\n\"Finally, we have a Congress willing to prioritize gun violence prevention,\" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, said in a statement on the hearing.\n\nThe announcement of a hearing comes just a few weeks after Thompson and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation on gun safety and universal background checks. \"Finally, with our new majority that ran on helping to prevent gun violence, we will introduce a bipartisan, universal background checks bill,\" Thompson said at the time.\n\nGun violence prevention played a major role in the 2018 midterm election. After the February 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman High in Parkland, Florida, survivors of the Parkland tragedy organized the March for Our Lives, one of the largest gun safety rallies this country has ever seen. In the aftermath, NRA-backed candidates lost from coast to coast.\n\n\"Finally we are going to have hearings on the most elementary proposal, to deny firearms to anyone who cannot pass a universal criminal and mental background check,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), a member of the Judiciary Committee, told Shareblue Media. \"This is a great day for Congress and for the public safety agenda,\" he added.\n\nIn a statement noting how grateful he is for Congress holding this hearing, John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, reiterated a critical truth: \"background checks save lives.\"\n\nWhile Republicans gave their allegiance to lobbyists from the NRA, the new majority is working for the people. And this hearing is only the first of many steps to curtail the scourge of gun violence across the country.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), chair of the House Democrats, told the New York Times.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's words \"an all-out threat, and asserted to reporters that Trump \"should not bring threats to the floor of the House.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted, \"I can understand why the idea of meaningful oversight terrifies the President. Several of his close associates are going to jail, others await trial, and criminal investigations continue.\"\n\nSchiff confirmed that he and Democrats in Congress were \"going to do our job,\" despite Trump's behavior.\n\nTrump initiated a government shutdown in late December, demanding $5.6 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi refused to go along with it, and in mid-January she disinvited Trump from giving the State of the Union in the House chamber during a government shutdown. Trump backed down, and gave in to Pelosi's demand. A few weeks later, Trump caved to Pelosi yet again as he agreed to reopen the government without a single penny for a border wall.\n\nYet somehow Trump thought making calling for an end to investigations during a high-profile speech would be effective. It was not.\n\nPelosi explained to the Times that Congress has a constitutional duty to engage in oversight and investigations, and \"if we didn't do it, we would be delinquent.\"\n\nThe day after Trump made his threat, Schiff announced a sweeping revival of an investigation into Trump and Russia related to the 2016 campaign.\n\nLater this week, a House Ways and Means subcommittee will hold a hearing about obtaining Trump's tax returns.\n\nLater this month, Trump's longtime attorney and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, will testify in a closed-door hearing with the Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"The days of the House operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump administration are over,\" Jeffries told the Times. It's a new day in Congress, with serious investigations and real accountability.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Because it is the essence of our democracy.\"\n\nFor years Republicans have worked to manipulate voting laws and regulations to exclude voters, particularly in communities with a large amount Democratic-leaning voters. They have singled out areas with college-age voters, black voters and Latino voters, seeking to suppress turnout and empower Republican politicians.\n\nThose efforts have been assisted at the federal level by Republicans, who refused to reauthorize key provisions of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nTrump has nominated a judge who was a key architect of the election law the Supreme Court singled out for its blatant discrimination. Trump has also repeatedly pushed lies about undocumented immigrants to justify restrictive voter ID laws that hurt the minority vote.\n\nIf passed, H.R. 1 would circumvent many of these attempts by making the protection of voters part of federal law, while also helping states get eligible voters to the polls.\n\nFor that very reason, it has come under intense attack from Republican leadership like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has called protecting voter rights a \"power grab.\"\n\nCummings impassioned statement put the fight into clear context.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) chastised banks and other big corporations for this type of buyback in a New York Times op-ed published on Sunday.\n\n\"Far too many workers have watched corporate executives cash in on corporate stock buybacks while they get handed a pink slip,\" they wrote.\n\nAs for lending, Bloomberg reported that the major banks saw their total loans increase at a slower rate than they did in 2017. In 2018, the banks increased the total amount they lent by 2.3 percent, down from a 3.6 percent increase in 2017.\n\n\"At best, corporate tax cuts had a muted impact on lending, the banks' primary contribution to the economy,\" Bloomberg reported.\n\nEven banks that gave bonuses to some employees, such as Bank of America, ended up reducing the size of their workforces.\n\nRepublicans, led by Mitch McConnell and former Rep. Paul Ryan, promised this bill would be a boost to the economy and the middle class. Trump also said the bill would be \"rocket fuel\" for the economy.\n\nYet it turns out the tax scam did exactly what Democrats warned: Made the rich richer and left the middle class in the lurch.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Those migrants are not illegal, and instead have the right to have their asylum cases heard.\n\nUltimately, the only thing different about this SOTU compared to Trump's other speeches on the wall was the length.\n\nTrump's second SOTU clocked in at a whopping 82 minutes and 28 seconds, according to C-Span, longer than his 2018 SOTU, which nearly set a record for the longest SOTU in history.\n\nSo, given that 60 percent of Americans still oppose Trump's wall since he began making his case for the project, don't expect this tired speech to change minds.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump broke his promise to deal with the opioid epidemic. Now, the states that voted for him are dealing with the fallout.\n\nAs a candidate, Donald Trump promised to bring an end to the opioid epidemic that experts have described as the \"defining public health challenge of our time.\" With an estimated 150 Americans dying from drug overdoses every single day, the crisis is producing a death toll equal to September 11th every three weeks.\n\nYet since he took office, Trump has let the opioid epidemic sit on the back burner, even ignoring the urgent pleas from his own advisory committee.\n\nNow, the same areas hardest hit by the scourge of opioid addiction are facing an entirely new crisis: a brewing HIV epidemic.\n\nAccording to a new report, the next HIV epidemic to hit America is likely already underway in rural towns and counties across the country, most of which are still in the grips of the nationwide opioid crisis. But due to underfunding and limited HIV screening in many rural counties, health officials don't even know how the bad the problem is.\n\nThey point to Scott County, Indiana, which in 2015 suffered the worst HIV outbreak in state history \u2014 a wholly preventable disaster that was sparked by cuts to public health funding and an unwillingness to implement risk-reduction programs like needle exchanges. The funding cuts shuttered the county's only Planned Parenthood clinic, which had provided HIV testing and preventive care to the 28,000 residents in the county.\n\nThe result was unprecedented: 20 new cases of HIV were being diagnosed each week at the height of the epidemic. A study examining the outbreak, which happened under the leadership of then-Gov. Mike Pence, concluded that the crisis was preventable and warned that other U.S. communities were at risk for nearly identical outbreaks.\n\n\"The nightmare that wakes me up at 3 a.m. is a Scott County-level HIV outbreak happening here in Alaska,\" Jay Butler, director of the Division of Public Health in the state\u2019s health department, told Politico.\n\nLate last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified at least 220 counties at high risk of a spike in HIV infections related to intravenous drug use \u2014 and the vast majority are in red states that voted for Trump.\n\nAccording to several analyses, Trump\u2019s focus on the opioid epidemic helped boost him to victory in key states like Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Counties with the highest rates of opioid overdoses overwhelmingly voted for Trump, meaning that his base includes many of those who are most vulnerable to the coming HIV epidemic.\n\nMany of these areas also lack the public health infrastructure to deal with such a crisis, and despite warnings from the CDC, the Trump administration isn't doing anything to address that.\n\nIn early August, Trump pledged to declare the opioid epidemic a national emergency, which would open up new lines of funding and give states more flexibility to implement programs such as HIV screening initiatives and drug treatment programs.\n\nBut more than two months later, Trump still hasn't taken any of the necessary steps to make an official emergency declaration.\n\nOn top of that, the website for the Office of National AIDS Policy was shut down just days after Trump took office, and nine months later, he still hasn\u2019t appointed anyone to lead the office. As many HIV/AIDS activists have warned about for months, it appears that Trump doesn't even have an HIV/AIDS prevention strategy, not to mention the will to implement it.\n\n\"It pretty much says that\u2019s not something that is on their radar,\" said Lucy Bradley-Springer, an infectious disease expert and former member of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. She was among six experts who resigned from the panel this year in protest of Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nTrump often claims that he won the election by listening to the forgotten needs of voters in rural counties across America. Yet now, in their time of greatest need, Trump is nowhere to be seen."

In total, Republicans have tried and failed more than 70 times to repeal Obamacare.\n\nMonday's move comes as nervous Republican candidates try to change their public positions on the issue, fearing a voter backlash, since affordable health care remains popular with voters.\n\nTrump himself has been boldly lying about health care on the campaign trail, including a recent claim that \"all Republicans support people with preexisting conditions, and if they don't, they will after I speak to them.\"\n\nMonday's rule change could accelerate a divide in this country in terms of how states deal with health care. Thus far, blue states are being far more protective of consumers and offering consumers wider choices, while many red states have chosen to cut back and provide fewer options.\n\nMake no mistake, Republicans are unequivocally trying to chip away at health care, and they're perfectly fine with ditching protections for pre-existing conditions to get it done.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress, and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker,\" Clinton said in the speech.\n\nTrump, however, made absolutely no mention of Pelosi's comeback, starting his dark speech instead with a jab at the Democratic party, pejoratively calling it the \"Democrat Party.\"\n\nPelosi, for her part, has started off her second go-around as speaker strong.\n\nShe held Democrats together during Trump's reckless shutdown, and ensured that the government reopened and federal workers once again received their paychecks \u2014 without Trump getting a cent for his wall.\n\nIn fact, Pelosi may have helped end the shutdown by refusing to allow Trump to give his SOTU address if the government remained shut down. Trump was upset that he wouldn't get to grandstand in front of the cameras; it might have even pushed him to reopen the government.\n\nWith all of Pelosi's winning, Trump and his wounded ego just couldn't muster the decent thing to do: Congratulate Pelosi on her speakership win.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The poll shows that despite Trump's desperate tall tales about caravans hurtling to the border, taped-up women and prayer rugs, people are just not buying his snake oil.\n\nAt the same time, the poll shows that support for more immigration has significantly increased.\n\n\"Since Trump's election, the proportion of Americans wanting to increase immigration levels has grown -- from 21% in June 2016 to a record-high 30% now,\" Gallup notes.\n\nWhile Republicans have gone all-in for Trump's approach on racism, Americans have rejected their stance.\n\nShutting down the government was cruel to hundreds of thousands of families and businesses. It was also a political loser, forcing Trump to bend to the will of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats.\n\nThe people of the country still believe in the Statue of Liberty's exhortation to \"give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\" even as Trump and his underlings have assaulted the idea.\n\nBut it isn't working.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

With Democrats in the House, that has to change.\n\nTrump is sending several thousand more troops to the border for no real reason. Department of Defense (DOD) officials couldn't even be bothered to tell the House how many troops they would be sending.\n\nNow that the Democrats control the House, Trump and his DOD aren't going to be able to be as cavalier or close-mouthed as they were under the single-party Republican rule of the past two years.\n\nOf course, Trump announced this troop deployment via tweet, saying that the additional troops were necessary to stop the \"Invasion of Illegals, through large Caravans.\" In the same tweet, he inevitably lamented the lack of a wall, saying it would be easier and less expensive to build the wall.\n\nIt's beginning to look like Trump may just keep sending troops to the border for non-urgent and non-military tasks, only because he sees it as leverage to get his wall.\n\nThe additional 3,500 troops are being sent to the border to help string concertina wire. That's on top of the 2,300 troops that have been there since before the election. The request came from DHS and was made during the shutdown.\n\nBut the administration seems to have gotten a bit rusty about having to explain to Congress what it is going to do and why. On Tuesday, there was a House Armed Services Committee meeting. At that meeting, the Pentagon wouldn't tell the committee the size of the deployment. This was even though the committee asked them several times to explain what would happen next at the border.\n\nIn a letter to Patrick Shanahan, the acting secretary of defense, Armed Services Committee Chair Adam Smith noted that this omission was \"at best an error in judgment, and at worst flat-out dishonesty.\"\n\nAll along, Trump has treated troops with shocking disrespect. He took them away from their families at the holidays to perform the vital function of shoveling horse poop. Then their deployments were significantly extended. They were supposed to come home December 15, but now they're stuck at the border until September 30.\n\nNow he is moving thousands of troops around on a whim, and his defense officials don't feel obliged to answer questions about troop deployments \u2014 even when those questions come from the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nThis administration already appears to be chafing from the most minor of oversight actions. They're in for a long two years.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

A creature of television, both as a rabid viewer and performer, appearing before such a large global audience thrills him more than doing the real work of leading the nation.\n\nBut the guests who will be attending the event after being invited by congressional Democrats are set to ruin Trump's big night.\n\nReal people hurt by his administration's worst actions will stare him down in front of millions of viewers from around the world, and their collective attendance will only make his historically unpopular presidency seem even smaller in stature, humanity, and decency.\n\nCommunity organizer Ana Maria Archila, who memorably confronted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) on an elevator over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has been invited to the speech by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\n\"You're telling me that my assault doesn't matter, that what happened to me doesn't matter, and that you're going to let people who do these things into power,\" Archila said, demanding the Republican senator look her in the eye.\n\nDoing Trump's bidding, Flake voted for the nominee despite the credible allegations of sexual assault against him. Trump, who is a sexual predator, hailed the nomination and considers the installation of Kavanaugh onto the court as one his major achievements.\n\nSandra Diaz, an undocumented immigrant from Costa Rica who worked as a housekeeper at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, will be in attendance. Diaz was invited by Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA).\n\n\"She is living proof that President Trump couldn't be more wrong \u2014both morally and factually \u2014 when he demonizes those who come to America seeking a better life,\" said Gomez in a press release. Attacking immigrants has been one of the core elements of Trump's political identity for years. He has done so to pander to racists within the Republican Party's base of voters.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) has invited Regina Moller, who heads Noank Community Support Services, as his guest. Moller's organization has helped provide services for the children affected by Trump's racist immigration policies like child separation, and also gave support to families affected by the unnecessary government shutdown.\n\nCameron Kasky, one of the students who survived the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida, will attend the speech after being invited by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA).\n\nKasky is one of the co-founders of the gun violence prevention group Never Again MSD and helped to organize the massive March for Our Lives nationwide protest.\n\nTrump is a stooge of the gun extremists at the NRA who repeatedly attacked the Stoneman Douglas students for trying to protect their fellow Americans. Despite multiple mass shootings on his watch, including the tragically historic casualties in Las Vegas, Trump has remained steadfast in opposing gun legislation.\n\nNavy Lt. Cmdr. Blake Dremann is the first openly transgender servicemember to be promoted in the history of the U.S. military and will be the guest of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).\n\nService members like Dremann \"make our armed forces and our country stronger,\" Gillibrand said.\n\nTrump is trying to exclude people like Dremann from the military, ignoring the extraordinary sacrifice and commitment that transgender Americans have been willing to take to defend the country.\n\nTrisha Pesiri-Dybvik, an air traffic controller from California, lost her home in the wildfires there \u2014 and was also furloughed during the Trump shutdown. She will attend the speech with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).\n\n\"As my family and I have begun to rebuild after losing our home in the Thomas Fire, the hardship we faced during the government shutdown \u2014 and the looming uncertainty of another potential shutdown \u2014 have added a further layer of stress to our already challenging situation,\" Pesiri-Dybyik said in a release.\n\nTrump has pushed absurd conspiracy theories about the fire, blaming them on environmentalists, while his administration has refused to acknowledge the role climate change plays in causing the devastating disasters.\n\nTrump's hate and ignorance do not occur in a vacuum. Everything he does in the presidency reflects on his cynical outlook on the world and has a real human cost.\n\nOn his big night, during the big speech he's been waiting forever to give, Trump will be stared down by those he caused to suffering. The millions watching will see them and make the easy connection between his presidency and absolute failure.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republican senators are proposing another startling tax cut for the extremely wealthy.\n\nLast year, the Trump tax cuts upped the estate tax exemption to $11 million per individual or $22 million per couple, leaving just 5,000 super-rich people in the entire country whose inherited wealth would fall outside that amount.\n\nNow, the GOP wants to get rid of the estate tax entirely with another tax cut for the extremely wealthy. It's another way that the GOP is willing to wage a class war.\n\nSenators John Thune (R-SD) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) have teamed up to demand a complete elimination of the estate tax. Of the 5,000, only 1,700 people are expected to actually pay the tax each year.\n\nIt is an astonishingly tone-deaf maneuver, given the struggles of ordinary Americans, but well in keeping with the GOP's goals of making sure people like Trump's children benefit to the tune of billions and billions of dollars.\n\nIn his press release touting his proposal, Thune comically claimed that the brunt of the estate tax is borne by family-owned farms and ranches and that such a way of life is \"integral to so many South Dakota families.\" In reality, even before last year's tax giveaway, roughly only 20 residents of South Dakota were subject to the estate tax annually.\n\nThe recent GOP tax cut was always a giveaway to the very rich, and they've always been willing to hurt lower- and middle-income Americans to transfer even more money to the hyper-wealthy\n\nFirst, they passed a tax cut they knew would explode the deficit. And indeed, it exploded spectacularly. The Treasury just had to borrow $1 trillion for the second year running to finance the deficit. Then, they've used that ballooning deficit to justify deep cuts. Last year, the administration denied federal workers their 2.1 percent raise because Trump said there were \"serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare.\" The administration is also using the looming deficit to argue that they need to pass a tough budget with across-the-board spending cuts. Nor have lower- and middle-income people seen any more money in their paychecks. In fact, the Trump tax scam led to real wages falling and a drop in spending power.\n\nThis latest GOP proposal is yet another indication that the GOP has no interest in helping ordinary Americans.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump and his GOP promised their tax scam would help middle-class workers, but wages are actually down and the only ones benefitting are the ultra-rich.\n\nRepublicans sold their tax scam as a way to help the middle class, but seven months after Trump signed the bill into law, Americans have seen months of declining wages. In reality, the tax scam is a $2 trillion, deficit-financed boondoggle to benefit wealthy Wall Street corporations while workers languish.\n\nTrump vowed the tax scam would be \"rocket fuel\" for the economy. Congressional Republicans made over-the-top promises about higher wages and a booming economy.\n\nBut that hasn't happened. The tax scam has not led to higher wages. Instead, as finance expert Noah Smith explains in Bloomberg, \"Real average hourly compensation actually fell in the first quarter\" after the tax scam was passed.\n\nAnd the news for the second quarter is even worse. Real wages continue to go down.\n\n\"Year-over-year, rising prices have eaten up still-modest pay gains for many workers, with the result that real wages fell 1.4 percent from the prior year,\" reports CBS News.\n\nThe Washington Post explicitly calls out Trump for his lies on the subject, noting that American workers' spending power has dropped.\n\n\"That's not what Trump promised,\" the Post writes.\n\nWhile workers are worse off than they were a year ago, rich corporate executives are lavishing billions of dollars on wealthy Wall Street investors. Companies have spent a record-setting $700 million on stock buybacks in 2018, boosting the pay of senior executives at the expense of workers, according to CBS News.\n\nBloomberg's Smith sums up the tax scam succinctly.\n\n\"Huge, immediate gains for wealthy shareholders combined with tepid increases in business investment and decreases in real wages don't paint a flattering picture of the tax cut's impact so far,\" he writes.\n\nWith a failing economic policy, Republicans are increasingly running away from their support of the unpopular tax scam.\n\n\"The most vulnerable Republican incumbents in the tightest congressional races in the November elections are talking less and less about the tax cuts on Twitter and Facebook, on their campaign and congressional websites and in digital ads, the vital tools of a modern election campaign,\" Reuters reports.\n\nIn a special election in Ohio's 12 Congressional District, Republicans are abandoning campaigning on the tax scam. Instead of talking about the tax scam, a SuperPAC linked to Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) released a fear-mongering anti-immigrant ad that \"looks like it could have been inspired by the Nazi-linked white nationalists who marched with torches in Charlottesville,\" as Shareblue previously reported.\n\nAmericans are beginning to see that Republicans fleeced workers and showered wealthy Wall Street investors with billions in kickbacks.\n\n\"Of course, companies were expected to receive the bulk of the tax savings,\" wrote Bloomberg. \"That\u2019s how the plan was designed.\"\n\nAs workers see their real earnings decline, they should know: The tax scam is all going according to plan.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump instigated a government shutdown in late December \u2014 which he declared at the time he would be \"proud\" to own \u2014 because Congress refused to pay the $5.7 billion ransom he demanded for an unpopular wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump has proved to be an epic failure at making a deal, with repeated tantrums, hissy fits, and outbursts. His lone attempt at a sham \"compromise\" was full of anti-immigrant language and completely unacceptable to Democratic lawmakers.\n\nAmericans overwhelmingly support the way Pelosi is handling the shutdown and her attempts to get government running again. But those attempts have been stymied by a cowardly GOP-led Senate, led by craven Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Since the shutdown began, McConnell has not held a single vote to reopen the government.\n\nPelosi's unprecedented actions come during unprecedented times. As she pointed out in a previous letter asking Trump to consider a later date for the State of the Union, a State of the Union speech has never been given during a government shutdown. Pelosi did note that Trump was welcome to give the speech from the Oval Office if he wanted to, or even to make his statement in writing.\n\nPelosi's latest letter concluded: \"I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when [the] government has been opened.\"\n\nTrump decided to shut down the government, and now he is forced to live with the consequences. One of those consequences is being denied a public platform in the People's House.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

John Cornyn (R-TX) is already stockpiling money out of fear that he could lose his deep red seat to a Democratic challenger.\n\nPolitico reports that Cornyn has already harvested $5.8 million in donations for his campaign, more than any other senator up for re-election in 2020. Cornyn recently hired his campaign manager and secured an endorsement from fellow Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who did not endorse him the last time he ran.\n\nHe has no idea which Democrat will be running against him, but Cornyn admits that he is afraid of what might happen.\n\n\"The tectonic plates shifted in Texas in 2018,\" Cornyn told Politico, \"and I think everybody realized we need to do something different and to address those concerns or else we're in trouble.\"\n\nCornyn is referring to the close election in 2018 between Cruz and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, where Cruz won by only 2.6 points. in Cruz's first Senate election in 2012, he won by 14 points.\n\nO'Rourke proved that a Democrat can put up a serious challenge in Texas, especially in an election where voters are motivated to vote against the Republican agenda.\n\nSo while Cornyn easily won re-election in 2014 by by 27.2 points, and Texas has not had a Democratic senator since 1993, Cornyn is clearly worried that the tide is changing in Texas.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won Texas by 9 points, down from Mitt Romney's 16-point victory over President Barack Obama. With its 38 electoral votes, Texas is the biggest red state in America, without which the Republican Party would almost certainly would not be able to win presidential elections.\n\nAnd if Trump struggles in Texas, that could trickle down to Cornyn. Trump's approval is at 49 percent in Texas, and while that is higher than the national average, it's not saying much in a state that is supposed to be so reliably red.\n\nIn his interview with Politico, Cornyn took the time to point out areas in which he has mildly disagreed with Trump. But his voting record shows someone who has supported Trump 95.5 percent of the time over the last two years. That steadfast support might not sit well with Texas voters who are not enthusiastic about Trump.\n\n\"Cornyn has wrapped himself around Trump from the very beginning and he will be wrapped around Trump in the general election in 2020 by Democrats every single day,\" Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, told Politico.\n\nWith politics changing in Texas, and an unpopular president at the top of the ticket, Cornyn could be in trouble, and he knows it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Since some costs were classified, even that very high dollar amount is incomplete.\n\nGovernment aircrafts and boats accounted for $10.6 million, while the remaining $3 million was for the costs of transporting, lodging and feeding government personnel on the trip. The Department of Defense picked up the tab for $8.4 million, while Homeland Security spent over $5 million.\n\n$18,000 was spent to transport then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to the resort to meet with Trump. In total $29,000 was spent by the State and Justice Departments to transport Cabinet officials and staff to the resort as well.\n\nThe GAO report does not include expenses incurred by local law enforcement, which often has to dole out overtime pay for officers deployed to assist Trump.\n\nThe report also reveals that taxpayers spent $396,000 protecting Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. when they made three international trips in 2017.\n\nGiven that Trump has taken 19 trips to Mar-a-Lago during his presidency, that means he's spent at least $64.6 million in taxpayer cash on those vacations, according to the Washington Post.\n\nTrump has personally made money from these trips, since he owns Mar-a-Lago and has refused to put his holdings in a blind trust or sell them off. $60,000 of the expenses were paid out to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump recently whined that the presidency has limited his ability to make money. But in reality, he's been using his public office to line his own pockets ever since the beginning.\n\nThe properties and businesses Trump still owns \u2014 including resorts like Mar-a-Lago, but especially the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. \u2014 have become a magnet for grift. Anyone who wants a favor from the U.S. government knows they can basically bribe Trump by staying at his hotel or holding events there.\n\nAnd sometimes this grift comes at taxpayer expense. Previous reporting has also shown that the public paid $32,000 to protect Donald Jr. on a trip to India that brought in $15 million in sales for the Trump family.\n\nThe new GAO report shows yet another way that Trump has spent his time in office living high on the hog while making America foot the bill.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Multiple members of last year's Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles announced they would skip a White House visit.

Utah voters got fed up with this inaction and passed a ballot initiative expanding Medicaid in November \u2014 but now Republican lawmakers are trying to narrow the pool of residents who are eligible to be covered, leaving roughly 70,000 people out in the cold.\n\nMany Utahns are livid at Republican lawmakers for making \"backroom deals designed to overturn the clear will of the voters,\" Andrew Roberts, spokesman for Utah Decides, told the Salt Lake City Tribune. Proponents of the Medicaid expansion recently spent $100,000 on television ads to criticize lawmakers seeking to undo the measure.\n\n\"I think it's time that we do what the people asked us to do and not play games,\" said state Sen.

The bill now moves to the Utah House, where it is expected to pass.\n\nUtah Republicans aren't alone; GOP lawmakers in other states have also made shockingly anti-democratic moves recently to avoid implementing ideas that are popular with voters.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers called an emergency legislative session after the midterm elections to strip powers away from the incoming Democratic governor.\n\nRepublicans in Michigan also used a lame duck legislative session to shamelessly strip power from incoming Democratic officials. Local papers in the state criticized the naked power play.\n\nEver since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, Republicans across the country have done all they can to weaken it and reduce the number of people who can afford health insurance.\n\nThe GOP-led Congress tried to rip health care away from 23 million people and gut protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions. After that sabotage effort failed, Republicans slipped measures to weaken the health care law into their unpopular tax scam.\n\nEven in a traditionally Republican state like Utah, voters embraced the ACA's Medicaid expansion. But elected Republicans are so obsessed with their ideological agenda that they won't even listen to their own voters \u2014 and are still willing to do everything in their power to keep health care away from those who need it most.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "They're being sued for their transparently racist attempt to remove people from voter rolls.\n\nLate last month, Texas Secretary of State David Whitley made the outrageous claim that 95,000 people who were not citizens were registered to vote in the state, and 58,000 of those people had voted in at least one election.\n\nThe claim quickly fell apart, and Texas Secretary of State's office began to walk it back. However, the retraction and mea culpa were done much more quietly than the initial assertion. Now, the state faces three lawsuits over its transparently racist attempt to remove people from the voter rolls.\n\nThe trouble began with the way Whitley compiled his list of suspected vote fraudsters. All he did was match one list of people against another. First, he looked at who had applied to Texas' Department of Public Safety (DPS) for a license or ID card and, at the time of application, indicated they were not citizens. He then compared that to voter registration information. Anyone that was a match, Whitley put on his list of people suspected of voting illegally.\n\nIn putting together that list, Whitley failed to look into whether someone became a naturalized citizen after they'd applied for a license or ID card. He also failed to account for the fact that some of the name comparisons were a weak match \u2014 someone with the same last name, but a different middle initial, for example.\n\nOne of the lawsuits, brought by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), points out the majority of naturalized citizens in Texas, by far, are Latino. And by targeting naturalized citizens, Texas is directly attacking Latino voters.\n\nIn Texas, Latino voters broke overwhelmingly for Beto O'Rourke, with 64% of Latino people supporting him over Ted Cruz. It's not hard to see how removing newly naturalized Latino citizens from the voting rolls would benefit the Texas GOP.\n\nAnother lawsuit, this one initiated by the Texas and national branches of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), is a class action lawsuit. LULAC brought the lawsuit on behalf of newly naturalized citizens in Texas. People who are naturalized in Texas \u2014 roughly 50,000 people per year \u2014 don't have to go back to DPS and tell them they are now a citizen. In other words, many people on that list may now be citizens. But Whitley and Ken Paxton, Texas' attorney general, have threatened to prosecute people on the list and have told county election officials to give people only 30 days to prove their citizenship.\n\nThe ACLU of Texas also filed a lawsuit on behalf of a number of groups, including the League of Women Voters and the Texas Conference of the NAACP. That lawsuit alleges that Whitley and Texas' director of elections, Keith Ingram, knew their list of 95,000 potential illegal voters was a flawed list, one that contained naturalized citizens eligible to vote, but they sent it out anyway.\n\nSince the list was initially sent to counties back on January 25, thousands of people in several counties have been found to be eligible voters. At the same time, however, counties have already sent out material to others on those lists saying \"there is reason to believe you may not be a United States citizen\" and demanding a certified copy of citizenship papers within 30 days.\n\nOf course, people may miss this letter and be removed from the rolls, even if they have proper citizenship papers. In the anti-immigrant climate of fear Trump has fostered, it isn't farfetched to think that some people may be too intimidated to respond, even if they are citizens.\n\nWhitley put together a sloppy list that could easily have been double-checked before sending it out. Refusing to do so is either rank incompetence or deliberate targeting of immigrant voters. Either option is not defensible.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Trump administration is stacking the EPA's Science Advisory Board with anti-science conspiracy theorists and industry insiders.\n\nThe mission of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to protect human health and the environment by acting as a watchdog over industry and big business.\n\nUnder Trump's watch, however, the EPA has turned into a cesspool of industry insiders and lobbyists who have hijacked the agency by replacing science with politics and prioritizing corporate interests above all else.\n\nAnd now, things are getting even swampier at the EPA, thanks to new leadership.\n\nAndrew Wheeler, the former coal lobbyist who was appointed by Trump to be the agency's acting director, is in the process of picking new members for the EPA's Science Advisory Board, which is supposed to serve as a team of external experts to advise the agency on scientific matters like evidence-based policies and regulations.\n\nThus far, the new members include a political insider from a Koch-funded conservative think tank, several industry-funded researchers, and \u2014 most recently \u2014 an outspoken climate change denier who believes that burning fossil fuels is actually good for the earth.\n\nLast week, when his advisory position was announced, John Christy, told E&E News, which covers energy and the environment, that \"there's a benefit, not a cost, to producing energy from carbon.\"\n\nHe has previously expressed similar sentiments, saying, \"Carbon dioxide makes things grow. Plants love this stuff. It creates more food. There is absolutely no question that carbon energy provides ... longer and better lives.\"\n\nChristy, an atmospheric science professor at the University of Alabama in Hunstville, also thinks that regulations on greenhouse gases should be undone because he doesn't believe human activity is related to global warming \u2014 which he's not even entirely confident is real.\n\nWhen asked about the overwhelming scientific consensus that refutes his claims, Christy has attributed it in part to censorship, making the baseless assertion that scientists are too afraid to speak up and come forward with evidence contradicting mainstream climate science.\n\nAt one point in the past, Christy even put forth research asserting that the earth was actually cooling, not warming. Those findings were swiftly debunked, and Christy later admitted that his conclusions were erroneous.\n\nStill, he continues to argue that the earth isn't warming at the rate that scientific agencies say it is, and his research continues to be refuted by mainstream scientists. He counters the scientific consensus by saying that whatever happens to the environment is God's will.\n\nUpon being named to the advisory board, Christy told E&E news that he will use his position to \"question the results of climate models.\"\n\nAccording to Christy, he got his seat on the board after being asked to apply by EPA officials.\n\nHe will join other new members chosen by Wheeler, including Richard Williams, who has downplayed the link between formaldehyde exposure and cancer during his time as a member of the American Chemistry Council's formaldehyde panel, and Brant Ulsh, who has criticized how much effort is spent trying to minimize radiation exposure at nuclear power plants.\n\nBarbara Beck, another new pick for the board, once wrote that researchers should be more careful in making the determination that that low levels of lead exposure are harmful to children. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is \"no safe blood lead level in children.\"\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists slammed Wheeler's decision to pack the scientific advisory board with industry insiders and anti-science skeptics.\n\n\"Scientists on the SAB should be providing an independent check on the work of the EPA, not using their positions to push fringe scientific views or further a specific policy agenda at the agency,\" the organization declared in a statement Friday.\n\n\"It's a shame that the independence and quality of the SAB is being so badly decimated at a time when oversight at the EPA is sorely needed to ensure that science is being used to inform policies that should be protecting Americans and our environment,\" the group added, noting that this is \"part of a general trend of the Trump administration's relentless attacks on science and sidelining of science advice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as Wheeler was busy stacking the science advisory board with politically motivated insiders, he still found time last week to sign off on a plan that would allow toxic chemicals to go unregulated in our nation's drinking water supply.\n\nAmong the results of the administration's anti-science agenda is a mass exodus of scientists and researchers, with nearly 1,600 EPA employees leaving during the first 18 months of Trump\u2019s presidency. At the same time, fewer than 400 new employees were hired, and many of them were pro-industry political appointees, not scientists.\n\nIn the words of former surgeon general Richard Carmona, the Trump administration's war on science is as \"egregious as I've ever seen it, starting from the very top with the president just denying the existence of science, manipulating the system on behalf of special interests.\"\n\nAnd now, those special interests have their very own representatives to manipulate the system from the inside out.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Neomi Rao, Trump's nominee to take Brett Kavanaugh's old seat on the federal judiciary, has a history of making shockingly hateful remarks.\n\nIf you've said the best way to prevent date rape is for women to stay \"reasonably sober,\" it's pretty hard to argue that you don't blame the victims of date rape for the crimes committed against them.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that Neomi Rao, Trump's nominee to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, struggled mightily to defend that position \u2014 along with a slew of other shocking, bigoted remarks she's made in the past on issues like LGBTQ rights, AIDS, and race relations \u2014 during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.\n\nRao has come under fire recently for columns she wrote for the Yale Herald, including a 1994 piece arguing that \"a good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober.\"\n\nSen. Pat Leahy (D-VT) asked Rao if she still believes that \"if a woman consumes alcohol to the point where she can no longer consent, she's in part to blame if somebody rapes her?\"\n\n\"I was trying to make, and perhaps not in the most elegant way, the commonsense observation that that excessive drinking can lead to risky and dangerous behavior for both men and women,\" Rao replied \u2014 still not grasping that pushing this point of view is placing the onus on women to not be raped, rather than on men who do the raping.\n\nThe hearing didn't get any better from there.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) asked Rao about another article she wrote during her time at Yale, in which she said sexual and racial oppression are \"myths.\"\n\nDurbin asked what those \"myths\" were. Rao responded that she doesn't \"recall.\"\n\n\"I've always been someone who has taken problems of sexism and racism very seriously, and part of what I'm responding to there is a very narrow set of issues on the Yale campus and a specific type of activism and multiculturalism that existed at Yale at that time,\" Rao said. \"And I guess I always thought it would be best to have more tolerance and understanding rather than dividing people into groups.\"\n\nDurbin was perplexed by that response.\n\n\"Tolerance of sexual and racial oppression, is that what you're asking for?\" Durbin asked.\n\nTo which Rao replied, \"No, tolerance of racial differences, understanding between different racial and ethnic groups.\"\n\nDurbin still wouldn't let Rao's answer slide. And that's when Rao made her most ridiculous claim yet \u2014 that she was actually \"inspired by Martin Luther King's vision\" to take a colorblind view of diversity and race relations.\n\n\"I think I had a kind of idealism about racial relations,\" Rao said. \"I went to a school that was very diverse, I had friends from all different backgrounds. And as growing up as an ethnic minority I guess as it were, I was inspired by Martin Luther King's vision that we should be judged by the content of our character and not the color of our skin.\"\n\nKing's views on race were anything but colorblind, however \u2014 and it's hard to imagine King signing on to Rao's argument that much of racial discrimination is just a myth.\n\nEven Republicans on the Judiciary Committee were taken aback by Rao's writings from Yale.\n\n\"I had a chance to review a number of your writings while you were in college,\" said Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican up for re-election in 2020. \"They do give me pause. Not just from my own personal experiences but regarding messages we send young women everywhere.\"\n\nErnst went on to ask Rao why she wrote that it is \"a dangerous feminist idealism which teaches women that they are equal.\"\n\n\"Is that a dangerous feminist ideal, is that women are created equal?\" Ernst asked Rao.\n\nRao said she regrets that statement and is \"honestly not sure why I wrote that in college.\"\n\nStill, despite all of Rao's shortcomings, don't expect GOP senators to kill her nomination. Republicans have proven time and again that they're almost always willing to push Trump's picks through \u2014 no matter how disastrous the choice could be.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He's just upset that he didn't win the Senate, after spending a fortune, like he thought he would,\" Trump tweeted. \"Too bad we weren't given more credit for the Senate win by the media!\"\n\nHeadlines from Fox News, USA Today, TIME, CNBC, and a slew of other outlets have all declared that Trump will focus on the theme of \"unity\" when he addresses the nation on Tuesday night. \"We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future,\" Trump plans to say, according to an excerpt received by USA Today.\n\nBut if his Tuesday morning outburst is any indication, Trump is still committed to a pattern of crass partisanship and petty insults that have defined his tenure in the White House.\n\nIn a CBS interview prior to the Super Bowl, Trump attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling her \"very bad for the country\" and accusing her of supporting human trafficking. The comments \u2014 which related to Pelosi's position of opposing a border wall \u2014 aired about 48 hours before Trump's big speech on \"unity.\"\n\nTrump spent his first two years in office slurring Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), using foul language to attack Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), and using Twitter to attack Democrats hundreds of times.\n\nDuring the 35-day Trump shutdown, Trump slammed his hands on the desk and stormed out of a meeting with Schumer and Pelosi rather than have a serious discussion about reopening the government.\n\nTrump can't even keep his own administration unified. During a Senate hearing last week, Trump's own intelligence chiefs contradicted Trump on issues ranging from North Korea, to Iran, to ISIS. Trump's show of \"unity\" was to lambast them on Twitter and say they should \"go back to school.\"\n\nA few words about unity placed in a high-profile speech can't change Trump. He can't even pretend to be something besides a vicious partisan hack on the very day he's been asked to speak on unity.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump fills his day watching Fox News and tweeting instead of working.\n\nTrump ignored Monday's statutory deadline for submitting the White House budget to Congress \u2014 even though his private schedule shows he had plenty of free time to work on it.\n\nA 1990 budget law requires the White House to deliver its budget recommendations to Congress no later than the first Monday in February. But the deadline came and went with no budget from the White House, Roll Call reports, and it might not come until sometime in early March \u2014 more than a month later than required.\n\nPast administrations have sometimes missed the statutory deadline, Roll Call notes, but those administrations usually have legitimate reasons like a busy workload for the president and his staff.\n\nBut on the weekend before the budget was due, Trump played golf with his budget director in Florida \u2014 just one of the many times Trump could be found on the golf course rather than working.\n\nA trove of leaked private schedules also shows that Trump consistently spends most of his working day on \"executive time,\" a euphemism for watching television, ranting on Twitter, and calling friends to chat.\n\nAnother reason Trump missed the deadline is that many staffers who prepare the budget were furloughed for 35 days because Trump threw a tantrum and shut down the federal government. Trump was upset that Congress refused to fund his unpopular, unnecessary, racist proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but eventually caved to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's demands to reopen the government without getting a single penny for his wall.\n\nWhile Trump's budget will lay out priorities for the 2020 fiscal year, he is threatening yet another shutdown before 2019 funding is finalized. The current deal to reopen the government ends on Feb. 15.\n\nTrump refuses to take his job seriously on a number of fronts. He's such a bad and capricious boss that prominent members of his administration are constantly either quitting, being fired, or resigning in a cloud of scandal. And when it's time to replace those officials, Trump habitually appoints \"acting\" heads of departments rather than bothering with the process of appointing permanent Cabinet officials \u2014 a tactic even his Republican allies are getting tired of.\n\nTrump also has a long history of pretending the laws don't apply to him.\n\nHe bragged that he can get away with serial sexual predation because he's a star. His infamous Trump University faced a slew of lawsuits that eventually settled for $25 million in damages. His namesake foundation was forced to shut down amid investigations of wrongdoing. His inaugural committee is under investigation for possible money laundering. And his own former personal attorney implicated Trump in campaign finance felonies aimed at illegally influencing the 2016 election.\n\nFor any other president, missing a legally required budget deadline to go golfing might be a real scandal. For Trump, it's just another day at \"work.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The latest development adds to an already enormous roster of corruption investigations related to Trump.\n\nIn a CNN appearance Tuesday, former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin said a \"stench of corruption\" emanated from Trump \u2014 one even worse than former President Nixon's.\n\n\"Just step back for a second and think, what's under investigation right now? Trump's businesses, his campaign, his foundation, his inauguration, his presidency, I mean there has not been anything like the kind of stench of corruption around one president than there has. I mean, Richard Nixon had nothing on this,\" Toobin said on \"New Day.\"\n\nTrump has used the presidency to engage in corrupt practices similar to what he did for years in the real estate and entertainment industries.\n\nHe has refused to put his private businesses in a blind trust or sell it off, opening up his hotels and resorts to transfusions of cash from big business, foreign entities, and political committees. The conduit allows Trump to essentially be bribed in the open.\n\nHis campaign is under investigation for its involvement with Russian operatives seeking to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. On multiple occasions, he and senior members of his campaign, including his son Donald Jr. and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, have lied or been evasive about the extent of this collaboration.\n\nTrump was forced to shut down his corrupt \"charity\" while it is under criminal investigation.\n\nAnd members of his administration are under investigation for living high on the hog at taxpayer expense, while also violating existing rules and laws.\n\nAs Toobin noted, the scope of Trump's corruption is looking like it exceeds even Nixon's, who resigned in disgrace.\n\nFor his first two years, Republican leaders in Congress effectively ignored the corruption stench, leading voters to put Democrats in charge of the House. Now, along with existing federal and state investigations from law enforcement, Congress is finally doing its job and working to get to the bottom of things.\n\nTrump's corruption is having its moment in the sunlight and the disinfecting has just begun.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Steve Cohen of Tennessee, and John Lewis and Hank Johnson of Georgia.\n\n\u201cThe thought of spending Tuesday night in the House Chamber listening to the reckless, self-centered man who occupies the White House holds no interest for me,\u201d Blumenauer \u2014 who skipped Trump's 2018 State of the Union, as well as Trump's 2017 speech before a joint session of Congress \u2014 said in a statement.\n\n\u201cJust like in past years, I plan to skip a speech that will be filled with lies, deception and divisiveness,\u201d Blumenauer continued.\n\nLewis, a hero of the civil rights movement who also skipped Trump's SOTU in 2018, won't be in attendance either, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n\nAnd Johnson told the Journal Constitution that he'd \"rather be somewhere else.\"\n\n\"I have a problem with defiling the speaker\u2019s chair in the House of Representatives,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it lowered, as is what happens when Donald Trump comes to our floor and starts talking about groups of people, particularly Latinos, and disparaging them as a people.\"\n\nCohen, for his part, said he will watch the speech from home.\n\n\"I'll be joining @RepJohnLewis and others in boycotting the #SOTU,\" Cohen tweeted on Monday. \"I\u2019ll come to the House Chamber for the State of the Union when I can hear from a president who will tell the #Truth. I\u2019ll watch on TV, Trump\u2019s preferred medium, although I won\u2019t be his audience, his believing base.\"\n\nTrump is expected to use the speech to try and build support for his pet border wall project that nobody wants.\n\nTrump has tried to convince Americans of the need for the wall by lying \u2014 and even contradicting the crime and immigration statistics that come from his own administration.\n\nFor example, Trump has said that a wall will help mitigate the opioid crisis by stopping drugs from entering the country. However, the Trump administration's National Drug Control Strategy report lists a number of policies to curb drug addiction, and not one of them is building a wall.\n\nTrump has also made up stories on crime at the border, including one story about women being found duct-taped as they are trafficked across the border \u2014 a ludicrous tale that his own administration couldn't find evidence to back up.\n\nThe White House also laughably claims that Trump wants to use Tuesday's speech to call for a \"bipartisan way forward on immigration,\" according to CNBC.\n\nHowever Stephen Miller, Trump's virulently anti-immigrant aide, is expected to have a heavy hand both in the speech and Trump's preparation for the address \u2014 a sign that the speech will be anything but unifying, and almost certainly be dark and racist.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Yesterday, two separate investigations \u2014 one by state prosecutors in Maryland and another by federal prosecutors in New York \u2014 kicked into high gear.\n\nThe New York federal prosecutors are pursuing an incredibly wide-ranging investigation into Trump's inauguration committee.\n\nMonday's subpoena from federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York demands documents about the inaugural committee's donors, vendors, and contracts, as well as all the federal disclosure filings.\n\nIt's also possible that those federal prosecutors are investigating money laundering, election fraud, and perhaps making false statements to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller has already interviewed a number of people over whether any donors to the inauguration fund were foreign nationals, which is prohibited.\n\nBut even if Mueller wraps up soon, federal prosecutors now have a long list of other potential investigations.\n\nMeanwhile, Maryland's attorney general is demanding records from DJT Holdings, the Trump family-owned business that owns the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., and Trump's golf courses in Scotland.\n\nThere's really no question that Trump's D.C. hotel is a way for Trump to profit off of foreign governments, given the huge amount of money spent by those governments at that hotel. That's why the attorneys general in Maryland and D.C. are bringing an emoluments lawsuit looking into whether Trump is improperly profiting off his presidency.\n\nNow, it looks like Trump's Scottish golf courses are entangled in that lawsuit as well. Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh believes that obtaining information about the golf courses will help him prove that Trump is still profiting from his businesses.\n\nIt isn't likely that the golf courses themselves are what is profitable, however. Turnberry, Trump's flagship Scottish course, lost $43 million in the last four years. It was such a bad risk that even Deutsche Bank, which loaned Trump hundreds of millions when no one else would, wouldn't give Trump more money to shore the thing up back in 2016.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that the House is now controlled by Democrats, and they have vowed to investigate basically everything. Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, has said he wants Deutsche Bank's records because they might show some form of a compromise between Trump and Russia.\n\nBetween a special counsel investigation, a state emoluments lawsuit, a federal prosecutor poking around, and the House going after all aspects of his finances, Trump has a lot of storms to weather \u2014 and it's probably only going to get worse."

They also want to change party rules so that only the most loyal pro-Trump activists make it to the nominating convention.\n\n\"It is an acknowledgement that Trump ... hasn't completely cemented his grip on the GOP,\" AP wrote.\n\nBut a recent poll from Monmouth University found that 43 percent of Republicans want to see the primary contested, rather than blindly back Trump.\n\n\"They're doing too much. It looks weak,\" John Weaver, a senior adviser to former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, said of the Trump campaign tactics. Kasich is supposedly considering a challenge to Trump. He is currently a talking head on CNN.\n\nThere have also been rumblings that Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is considering a run against Trump. He would be an unlikely nominee from an extremely Democratic state, and one who is out of sync with the Republican base on many key issues.\n\nYet Trump is clearly concerned about threats from potential candidates like Kasich and Hogan. The fear could be connected to realizing that he is extremely unpopular.\n\nTrump has never had approval above 50 percent and has lately been closer to 40 percent as the world saw him stumble before Speaker Nancy Pelosi with the shutdown.\n\nThe 2018 election was also unkind to Trump and Republicans in Congress backing his legislative agenda. Trump lost 40 seats as a blue wave washed over them.\n\nEven going back to Trump's biggest political triumph \u2014 winning in the 2016 general election \u2014 more people voted for Secretary Hillary Clinton than voted for him. The margin of her popular vote victory was nearly 3 million.\n\nTrump has never received the support of a majority of voters. He came in second place in the popular vote for the presidential election and lost his party 40 seats in 2018.\n\nTrump should be riding high as the economic recovery that began under President Barack Obama continues. Instead, his campaign is looking over its shoulder at long-shots, seemingly afraid of voters turning on Trump, and trying to ensure that Trump is the only option for Republicans in 2020.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Neomi Rao, Trump's pick to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, thinks women are at fault if they are sexually assaulted after drinking. And that's only the beginning.\n\nSince Brett Kavanaugh's disgraceful ascension to the United States Supreme Court, his seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguably the second-most powerful court in the country, has been vacant. And Trump's pick to fill the spot, Neomi Rao, manages to be nearly as awful as Kavanaugh himself.\n\nTrump nominated Rao back in November, but only recently have her terrible, retrograde views come to light.\n\nWhen she was in college in the mid-1990s, Rao wrote articles showing that she is happy to blame other women for being raped. In a 1994 piece for the Yale Herald, Rao wrote:\n\nUnless someone made her drinks undetectably strong or forced them down her throat, a woman, like a man, decides when and how much to drink. And if she drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice.\n\nIn that same piece, she mused that the best way for women to avoid date rape was to stay sober.\n\nRao isn't just a rape apologist; she also cheers women's inequality more broadly. She praised societies where women are subordinate to men, claiming those societies provide women \"greater protection from horrors such as rape.\" In that same article, she slammed women who \"believe falsely that they should be able to go anywhere with anyone.\"\n\nIt should probably go without saying that Rao also loathes multiculturalism. She bragged that Yale largely remained a meritocracy despite dropping its standards for \"a few minorities, some legacies, and a football player here and there.\"\n\nIt's really no surprise that the person Trump picked to replace Kavanaugh would be such an echo of Kavanaugh himself. The GOP went all-in on being the party of rape when it elevated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court even after he was credibly accused of sexual assault by multiple women, and even after his shameful rage-fueled meltdown during his confirmation hearing.\n\nBesides the fact that Rao shares the sexist views of both the man she will replace on the D.C. Circuit and the man who nominated her, Rao is also a conservative favorite because she fetishizes deregulation as an inherent good.\n\nShe's currently the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which is part of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Her work there seems to mostly consist of gutting regulations. In a recent speech, she boasted about allowing 22 deregulatory actions for every one regulatory action at government agencies.\n\nKavanaugh also hates regulations, particularly those relating to slowing climate change.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, there are rumors that Rao is on Trump's short list for the Supreme Court.\n\nRao is only 45 years old. If she managed to get confirmed to the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land would be stuck with another Kavanaugh clone \u2014 and Trump's conservative majority on the judiciary would be cemented for decades to come.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

James Lankford (R-OK) told the Post, referring to the large number of acting leaders in Trump's Cabinet. \"You want to have confirmed individuals there because they have a lot more authority to be able to make decisions and implement policy when you have a confirmed person in that spot.\u201d\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) also told the Post she was concerned that the U.S. lacks a permanent secretary of defense, and said one should be appointed \"in order to reassure allies and also to push back on our adversaries.\"\n\nTwo years after Trump took office, seven of the top roles in his administration are filled by acting heads who haven't been confirmed by the Senate. They include an acting chief of staff, an acting attorney general, an acting secretary of defense, an acting secretary of the Interior, an acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, and an acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThose acting heads came in after a number of top Trump administration officials either resigned in disgrace following ethical scandals, were pushed out by Trump for not being loyal, or merely quit because they had enough of working in Trump's chaotic White House.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, hours after the Washington Post story came out, Trump announced on Twitter that he will officially nominate David Bernhardt, the current acting secretary of the Interior, to be the department's permanent secretary.\n\nTrump, for his part, admitted that he likes having acting secretaries because they are more beholden to him, and thus are more \"responsive\" to his demands.\n\n\"I like acting because I can move so quickly,\" Trump told CBS News in an interview that aired on Sunday. \"It gives me more flexibility.\"\n\nBut this \"flexibility\" could end up causing legal troubles for the Trump administration, the Post reports.\n\nTrump hasn't even tried to nominate people to fill 150 out of 750 other top roles in federal agencies that require Senate confirmation. Without permanent replacements for those roles, the Post reported that some Cabinet agencies are using questionable legal workarounds to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act \u2014 a 1998 law that bans people from serving in an acting capacity for more than 300 days.\n\nLegal experts told the Washington Post that any actions from officials who are violating the Federal Vacancies Reform Act are \"legally problematic\" and could be \"subject to challenge.\"\n\nWhile Trump says he likes having acting officials, there may be another more embarrassing reason he can't fill the roles on a permanent basis: No one wants to work in his White House.\n\nAfter firing former Chief of Staff John Kelly, Trump struggled to find a replacement. He ultimately settled on Mick Mulvaney, who is working in an acting capacity.\n\nIt's been so difficult to find people willing to work for the administration, the White House even turned to a job fair in June to fill some staffing roles.\n\nIf Trump either can't or won't do the basic work required to keep the federal government staffed and functional, it's no wonder even some of his allies in Congress are getting nervous.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) proposed a 70 percent marginal tax rate on Americans earning more than $10 million a year, Republicans have been hysterically warning that Democrats will turn the United States into a version of socialist Venezuela.\n\nHowever, a new poll out Monday shows most Americans simply don't share these fears. Taxing the ultra-rich is very, very popular, with more than three-quarters of registered voters supporting the idea.\n\nAccording to a new Politico/Morning Consult survey, 76 percent of registered voters say the \"wealthiest Americans\" should pay more in taxes. That includes a majority, 54 percent, of Republican voters.\n\nWhen asked about specific policies, 61 percent of registered voters backed a \"wealth tax\" similar to the one Sen.

A creature of television, both as a rabid viewer and performer, appearing before such a large global audience thrills him more than doing the real work of leading the nation.\n\nBut the guests who will be attending the event after being invited by congressional Democrats are set to ruin Trump's big night.\n\nReal people hurt by his administration's worst actions will stare him down in front of millions of viewers from around the world, and their collective attendance will only make his historically unpopular presidency seem even smaller in stature, humanity, and decency.\n\nCommunity organizer Ana Maria Archila, who memorably confronted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) on an elevator over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has been invited to the speech by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\n\"You're telling me that my assault doesn't matter, that what happened to me doesn't matter, and that you're going to let people who do these things into power,\" Archila said, demanding the Republican senator look her in the eye.\n\nDoing Trump's bidding, Flake voted for the nominee despite the credible allegations of sexual assault against him. Trump, who is a sexual predator, hailed the nomination and considers the installation of Kavanaugh onto the court as one his major achievements.\n\nSandra Diaz, an undocumented immigrant from Costa Rica who worked as a housekeeper at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, will be in attendance. Diaz was invited by Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA).\n\n\"She is living proof that President Trump couldn't be more wrong \u2014both morally and factually \u2014 when he demonizes those who come to America seeking a better life,\" said Gomez in a press release. Attacking immigrants has been one of the core elements of Trump's political identity for years. He has done so to pander to racists within the Republican Party's base of voters.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) has invited Regina Moller, who heads Noank Community Support Services, as his guest. Moller's organization has helped provide services for the children affected by Trump's racist immigration policies like child separation, and also gave support to families affected by the unnecessary government shutdown.\n\nCameron Kasky, one of the students who survived the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida, will attend the speech after being invited by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA).\n\nKasky is one of the co-founders of the gun violence prevention group Never Again MSD and helped to organize the massive March for Our Lives nationwide protest.\n\nTrump is a stooge of the gun extremists at the NRA who repeatedly attacked the Stoneman Douglas students for trying to protect their fellow Americans. Despite multiple mass shootings on his watch, including the tragically historic casualties in Las Vegas, Trump has remained steadfast in opposing gun legislation.\n\nNavy Lt. Cmdr. Blake Dremann is the first openly transgender servicemember to be promoted in the history of the U.S. military and will be the guest of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).\n\nService members like Dremann \"make our armed forces and our country stronger,\" Gillibrand said.\n\nTrump is trying to exclude people like Dremann from the military, ignoring the extraordinary sacrifice and commitment that transgender Americans have been willing to take to defend the country.\n\nTrisha Pesiri-Dybvik, an air traffic controller from California, lost her home in the wildfires there \u2014 and was also furloughed during the Trump shutdown. She will attend the speech with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).\n\n\"As my family and I have begun to rebuild after losing our home in the Thomas Fire, the hardship we faced during the government shutdown \u2014 and the looming uncertainty of another potential shutdown \u2014 have added a further layer of stress to our already challenging situation,\" Pesiri-Dybyik said in a release.\n\nTrump has pushed absurd conspiracy theories about the fire, blaming them on environmentalists, while his administration has refused to acknowledge the role climate change plays in causing the devastating disasters.\n\nTrump's hate and ignorance do not occur in a vacuum. Everything he does in the presidency reflects on his cynical outlook on the world and has a real human cost.\n\nOn his big night, during the big speech he's been waiting forever to give, Trump will be stared down by those he caused to suffering.

In reality, they're admitting just how much of a disaster they've created.\n\nIn a court filing, the administration stated it \"would present grave child welfare concerns\" to remove children currently living with the \"sponsor\" homes hosting them after Trump separated them from their families. The administration effectively wants to pass over those with sponsor families.\n\n\"The Trump administration's response is a shocking concession that it can't easily find thousands of children it ripped from parents and doesn't even think it's worth the time to locate each of them,\" said Lee Gelernt, the lead ACLU attorney in the case forcing the latest Trump disclosure.\n\nA recent report from the inspector general conducting oversight of the Department of Health and Human Services said the number of children separated from their families is much more than the 2,737 the Trump team claimed in court documents.

    "text": "In just 15 minutes, Trump said he might shut down the government and invade both Iran and Venezuela, grumbled about witch hunts, praised Kim Jong Un, and said Barron shouldn't play football.\n\nOn Sunday, Donald Trump sat down with CBS' Margaret Brennan before the Super Bowl. As with all Trump interviews, it was a whole lot of rambling filled with lies.\n\nHe started by saying that he won't take another shutdown off the table, and implied he's already decided to call a national emergency over the wall. \"It's national emergency, it's other things and you know there have been plenty national emergencies called,\" he said.\n\nHe also repeated some of his favorite lies \u2014 that Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"wants open borders\" and \"doesn't mind human trafficking.\" He's also sure that somehow, magically, he'll win the fight over the wall now because \"we have a much better issue.\"\n\nIf his domestic policy about the wall is a mess, this interview showed his foreign policy is even worse. He tried to explain that he's gotten rid of ISIS, saying, \"We will be announcing in the not too distant future 100 percent of the caliphate, which is the area- the land \u2014 the area \u2014 100. We're at 99 percent right now, we'll be at 100.\"\n\nIt wasn't at all clear what that means.\n\nTrump also bragged about how, if things went south with his plan, the U.S. would just go right back to the Middle East, because \"We have very fast airplanes, we have very good cargo planes. We can come back very quickly, and I'm not leaving.\"\n\nIn his weird, offhand way, he also said that he'll keep troops in Iraq \"to be looking a little bit at Iran because Iran is a real problem.\" When Brennan pointed out that sounded a lot like he was keeping troops in Iraq so he could be able to strike Iran, he explained that he just wanted to \"be able to watch.\"\n\nTrump also wouldn't rule out invading Venezuela, saying he doesn't want to meet with Nicolas Maduro to help negotiate an orderly exit, because many horrible things have been happening and Venezuela \"was the wealthiest country of all in that part of the world which is a very important part of the world.\"\n\nYou can always count on Trump to fall back on pointless superlatives when he doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\nTrump deployed plenty more of those when talking about his upcoming summit with North Korea, which Trump declared could be a \"tremendous economic behemoth,\" thanks to the \"fantastic chemistry\" and \"tremendous correspondence\" that he has with Kim Jong Un.\n\nHe also trotted out his lie about how he has been tougher on Russia than any other president. Sure, if you ignore that we just found out about a secret Trump-Putin meeting and saw Trump pull out of a key nuclear arms treaty, a move that helps fracture NATO unity and allows Putin to build some new missiles.\n\nAnd it wouldn't be a Trump interview if he didn't complain about a witch hunt, whine about how no one is investigating Hillary Clinton, and gloss over the fact that over 30 people have been indicted in the special counsel's investigation.\n\nOf the 34 people, many of them were bloggers from Moscow or they were people that had nothing to do with me, had nothing to do with what they're talking about or there were people that got caught telling a fib or telling a lie.\n\nHere, Trump neatly overlooks the fact that lying to the FBI and Congress is a crime, not merely getting caught \"telling a fib.\"\n\nFinally, Trump was asked if he'd let his son Barron play football. He said he wouldn't steer him that way because football is a \"dangerous sport\" and although helmets have gotten better, they haven't \"solved the problem\" \u2014 presumably, the problem of concussions. This is rich coming from the man who mocked an NFL rule that requires players to be removed from the field if they sustain a concussion: \"Concussions \u2014 'Uh oh, got a little ding on the head? No, no, you can\u2019t play for the rest of the season.'\"\n\nTrump thinks that NFL players who don't continue to play while concussed are wimps, but when it comes to his child, acknowledges the danger inherent in the sport. It's a classic \"danger for thee but not for me\" mindset that governs his entire presidency, a mindset that was on display this entire interview.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

They paint a picture of Trump expending part-time effort despite having a very real full-time job. In a transparent attempt to cover up Trump's lazy habits, his daily schedule refers to these activities as \"executive time.\"\n\n\"Executive time\" allows Trump to spend hours upon hours in his residence indulging in social media and cable television, safely secluded from staff, meetings, and actual work. Trump rarely bothers to show up for work in the Oval Office before 11 a.m., spending the mornings \"watching TV, reading the papers, and responding to what he sees\" by either calling aides, friends, or just firing off a series of unhinged tweets.\n\nThe leaked schedules show Trump spent more than 297 hours in \"executive time\" over the past three months. That's almost four times as many hours as Trump spent in meetings (77 hours), and about eight times as many hours as he spent at events (38 hours).\n\nTrump's lazy approach to his job has \"almost no [historical] parallel,\" Chris Whipple, author of \"The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency,\" told Axios.\n\nThe rotten fruits of Trump's \"executive time\" are often on full display in Twitter tantrums he throws early in the morning. Between 8:50 a.m. and 9 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 30, for example, Trump lashed out at his own intelligence chiefs, who contradicted Trump on a number of topics such as North Korea, Iran, and ISIS. According to his schedule, his tweets were in the middle of a three-hour block of \"executive time,\" which lasted from 8 a.m. until 11 a.m.\n\nIn addition to being unfit for the job, Trump is showing over and over again that he's just too lazy to govern.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is on his way out the door, but he may have one last brutal move: making it much harder for victims of domestic violence, including children, to seek asylum.\n\nThe Trump administration has long been dead-set on harming immigrants and asylum-seekers. And now Matthew Whitaker, Trump's acting attorney general, may be preparing to bar domestic violence victims \u2014 including children who are victims of sexual abuse \u2014 from seeking asylum in the United States.\n\nIf Whitaker does this, he will be extending and increasing the cruelty of his predecessor, Jeff Sessions. Last June, Sessions issued a rule saying that generally, claims by people suffering from domestic violence or gang violence wouldn't be eligible for asylum.\n\nA federal court slapped down that ruling in late December, permanently enjoining the government from enforcing it. But now, immigration and domestic violence advocates are raising alarms that Whitaker appears poised to try a different approach to accomplish the same objective.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that Whitaker is taking the unusual step of directing the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to let him decide a particular case on asylum claims \u2014 which attorney generals typically do in order to set a legal precedent.\n\nOne way immigrants can claim asylum is by showing they are a member of a \"particular social group\" (PSG) that faces persecution in their home country. A family can count as a PSG, and victims of domestic violence \u2014 particularly victims of child sexual abuse \u2014 often make PSG claims because their attacker is a member of their family.\n\n\u201cEspecially when it comes to child abuse cases this is the best mechanism for arguing those cases,\u201d immigration attorney Eileen Sterlock told The Daily Beast. \u201cAlso in incest cases, where a father rapes a daughter, those are really egregious cases and losing that ability to argue a family-based PSG claim is going to make those cases even more difficult.\u201d\n\nThat's exactly what it looks like Whitaker is preparing to do.\n\nWhitaker has asked the parties in a case, Matter of L-E-A, to brief him on whether, and under what circumstances, someone can establish persecution on account of their membership in a PSG.\n\nWith his order last year, Sessions tried to say women who fear domestic violence from a family member were not a member of a PSG. Whitaker is taking a different tack, but it is similarly designed to narrow who qualifies.\n\nThe Matter of L-E-A case involves an asylum-seeker, L-E-A, who said he was targeted by a drug cartel because of his family relationship.\n\nL-E-A's father owned a store in Mexico City. A drug cartel approached his father and demanded to sell drugs in the store. The father refused, and then the cartel approached L-E-A and asked him to sell the drugs in his father's store. When he refused, the cartel tried to kidnap him. He got away and fled to the United States to seek asylum, saying that his particular social group was his family.\n\nAn immigration judge denied L-E-A's claim, saying he wasn't only threatened because of his family \u2014 he was threatened because he was interfering with the drug trade. The BIA found that PSG claims where the membership was based on a familial relationship were a permissible way to seek asylum and sent the case back down to an immigration judge. That's when Whitaker stepped in.\n\nIn taking the case away from the BIA and asking the parties to brief him on the issue, Whitaker is likely interested in undercutting the use of familial relationships as membership in a PSG.\n\nThis has severe consequences for victims of domestic violence. Those claims are based on being able to say it is because of their membership in their family unit that they are being harmed.\n\nIf that avenue is taken away, many people fleeing brutal familial violence will have no grounds for asylum \u2014 which is exactly what the Trump administration wants. And victims of violence have to hope that once again, a court will intervene to protect them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Former CIA director John Brennan says Russian collusion 'may have gone to the very top of the Trump campaign.'\n\nNow that close Trump adviser Roger Stone has been indicted, former CIA director John Brennan is more convinced than ever that Robert Mueller's investigation will prove damning for Trump.\n\nBrennen said Friday that he thinks it's \"quite evident\" the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election, that this collusion may have \"gone to the very top\" to Trump himself, and that it could even rise to the level of \"criminal conspiracy.\"\n\n\"There was an extensive effort to try to influence the outcome of the [2016] election that involved the Russians, that involved U.S. persons, and that may have gone to the very top of the Trump campaign,\" Brennan said during an appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\n\"I defer to the special counsel's office to make the determination about what they did crossed that threshold from collusion \u2014 which I think is quite evident \u2014 to criminal conspiracy,\" he said.\n\nBrennan also speculated that more indictments are on the way, and noted that Trump and his family members have a \"fair amount\" of vulnerability to being indicted.\n\n\"It's whether or not it's past that threshold that is going to lead then to an indictment of individuals that are close to Mr. Trump, that are part of his family, or others,\" Brennan said.\n\nStone's indictment is just the most recent arrest stemming from Mueller's investigation. Stone is the 34th person facing an indictment, and one of half a dozen people who were close to Trump or served as high-level officials in the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump's campaign chairman (Paul Manafort), deputy campaign chairman (Rick Gates), foreign policy adviser (George Papadopoulos), first national security adviser (Michael Flynn), and longtime attorney and fixer (Michael Cohen) have all pleaded guilty to various felonies, and all cooperated in one way or another with the Mueller investigation.\n\nDespite initial denials from Trump, his campaign is known to have made more than 100 contacts with officials linked to the Russian government.\n\nAs Brennan said, collusion is quite evident indeed \u2014 and the only question is just how far it went.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Putin just reminded Trump that he has saved all the receipts from their interactions \u2014 and he's not afraid to use them.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin fired a warning shot at Trump this week, strategically dropping compromising information to remind Trump that he has saved all the receipts from their interactions \u2014 and he's not afraid to use them.\n\nCiting a Russian government official, the Financial Times reported Tuesday that Trump met with Putin at last year's G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, without a translator or anyone from his administration present during the exchange.\n\nThe revelation provides the most detailed account to date of Trump and Putin's interactions during the November summit \u2014 and the details don't line up with the White House's description of the event.\n\nWhile Trump and Putin had initially been scheduled to meet at the summit, Trump publicly canceled the meeting amid new revelations about his financial and business ties to Moscow. Trump cited Russia's increased aggression toward Ukraine as a reason for canceling the meeting just ahead of the annual summit.\n\nThe Kremlin pushed back on Trump's attempt to cancel the meeting, saying Putin would still have a brief, impromptu meeting with Trump at the summit. In response, a White House official told reporters traveling with Trump to the summit that \"there is no scheduled pull aside\" between the two leaders.\n\nNews reports after the event discussed Trump's interactions with other world leaders attending the summit, but did not mention any meetings with Putin.\n\nAnd although the White House acknowledged in a statement at the time that Trump and Putin had briefly exchanged words on the sidelines of the summit, the encounter was described as casual and unplanned \u2014 just one of \"a number of informal conversations with world leaders.\"\n\nBut according to the new report, the meeting was not so brief, nor was it just a casual conversation.\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times, a Kremlin official said the meeting lasted upwards of 15 minutes and included discussions about substantive issues including the conflict in Syria, as well as Russia's recent aggression toward Ukraine and seizure of two Ukrainian Navy vessels.\n\nTrump and Putin also discussed potential arrangements for a formal meeting, the Kremlin official said.\n\nPutin clearly had the upper hand during the exchange, as he was accompanied by a translator. Trump, meanwhile, was accompanied by Melania, and no one else.\n\n\"The four of them sat at a table and were among the last to leave,\" the Financial Times reported.\n\nNone of this was disclosed by the White House, and the timing of the leak from the Kremlin comes just as the Russian government is publicly expressing its anger with the Trump administration for its position on recent events in Venezuela.\n\nThe revelation that Trump and Putin discussed Syria policy is particularly damning. Less than three weeks after the November meeting, Trump abruptly and unexpectedly announced that he was ordering U.S. troops to withdraw from Syria \u2014 a move that stands to greatly benefit Putin, who praised Trump's decision, which Trump's own military and intelligence advisers had warned against.\n\nSince Trump was not accompanied by a notetaker or translator, there is no way to know whether Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria was part of a deal he struck with Putin.\n\nThe revelation that Trump was not forthcoming about his November meeting with Putin comes just weeks after the Washington Post reported that Trump had withheld details of his previous talks with Putin from top officials in his administration, including confiscating notes from an interpreter who was present during one of the meetings."

    "text": "In just one day, House committee chairs announced three new investigations into Trump.\n\nOver the last two years, the House of Representatives was controlled by Republicans, who ran interference for Trump, ensuring there would never be any legitimate investigation into his mountain of misdeeds.\n\nWith control of the House now shifted to Democrats, the investigations are piling up. If it seems like new ones are being announced every day, that's because they are. In fact, yesterday saw three new investigations crop up.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) sent a letter to the White House announcing an investigation into the Trump team's shoddy handling of the security clearance process.\n\nJust a couple hours later, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) said his committee will look into whether Trump's tangled network of business dealings are influencing foreign policy decisions.\n\nIt's a logical choice for an investigation. We already know that Trump's D.C. hotel is a conduit for foreign money, particularly Saudi Arabian money, to make its way to Trump. Also, Trump is disturbingly willing to go easy on Saudi Arabia, even after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was likely personally ordered by that country's crown prince.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, we learned that House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) and House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) are teaming up to dig into Deutsche Bank. This line of inquiry likely feels very worrisome for Trump, given that special counsel Robert Mueller has already subpoenaed the bank for its records related to Trump and his family.\n\nSchiff says that the bank is an \"obvious place to start\" in examining whether the Trump Organization laundered money. It is indeed an obvious place, as Deutsche Bank was recently fined several hundred million dollars for helping the Russians launder money. Additionally, that bank seems to be the only one that wants to lend money to the Trump Organization.\n\nTrump is learning just how precarious his position is, and how much protection the GOP members of the House had provided. For someone with this much to hide, the next two years are going to be grueling.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The administration is refusing to protect Americans from cancer-causing chemicals in the nation's water supply.\n\nIn a move described as \"absolutely unconscionable,\" the Trump administration is reportedly refusing to set limits on two toxic chemicals linked to serious diseases like cancer, potentially exposing more than 110 million Americans to contaminated drinking water.\n\nCiting two sources familiar with the matter, Politico reports that Andrew Wheeler, the acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has signed off on an unreleased draft plan that will let the chemicals remain unregulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nThe two chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, have been used for decades by manufacturing plants and on military bases, and are present in everyday products like Teflon-coated cookware, fabric protectors, and firefighting foam. They have also been found in the bloodstreams of an estimated 96 percent to 98 percent of Americans.\n\nResearchers have detected dangerously high levels of PFOA and PFOS in at least 40 states, putting an estimated 110 million Americans at risk of adverse effects, including cancer, thyroid diseases, pregnancy complications, and other serious health problems.\n\nBecause of their widespread use, the toxic pollutants have contaminated groundwater near hundreds of military bases and chemical plants across the country. As a result, any attempt to regulate the chemicals would leave companies like 3M, as well as the Defense Department, on the hook for billions of dollars in cleanup efforts.\n\nSo instead of setting a legal limit under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, Wheeler is refusing to move forward with any type of regulation, meaning that \"utilities will face no federal requirements for testing for and removing the chemicals from drinking water supplies,\" according to Politico.\n\n\"It is absolutely unconscionable for the Trump administration to refuse to even start the process of setting a limit on these poisonous chemicals,\" said Erik Olson of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).\n\nOlson called the move \"a total abdication of EPA's role in protecting the American people.\"\n\nBut with industry insiders calling the shots at Trump's EPA, the health and safety of Americans are increasingly taking a backseat to companies' bottom lines.\n\nLast year, the EPA blocked the release of a federal study showing that PFOA and PFOS pose a serious risk to human health at much lower levels than previously thought.\n\nTypically, such findings would be released as quickly as possible so they could be used to set new safety standards and inform new policies to protect the health of the American public. But not in the Trump administration.\n\nFearing a \"public relations nightmare,\" the White House and the EPA devised a scheme to suppress the findings to avoid having to do anything about the nationwide public health threat.\n\nAnd now, more than eight months later, they're still refusing to take action \u2014 leaving millions of Americans at risk of consuming dangerously high levels of the toxic chemicals.\n\n\"Sadly, it's no surprise the Trump administration is failing to protect Americans from these dangerous chemicals,\" Food & Water Watch executive director Wenonah Hauter said in a statement. \"This administration prioritizes corporate profits over public safety, pure and simple.\"\n\nWhile the cost of the Trump administration's war on science will likely never be known, one thing is already quite clear: The American people will be paying for it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But even his underlings can't back them up.\n\nTrump's tall tales of horrors at the border are so absurd that his own team can't substantiate them.\n\nAn official within the administration admitted to ABC News that they tried to find evidence to back up Trump's lurid stories about duct-taped women being trafficked or prayer rugs supposedly found at the border. They couldn't.\n\nTrump has been going on and on (and on) with these stories, using them to justify his demand for a racist and useless border wall.\n\n\"Women are tied up, they're bound, duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths,\" he breathlessly proclaimed, \"In many cases, they can't even breathe. They're put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks.\"\n\nExperts in human trafficking have no idea what he's talking about. One director of an anti-trafficking organization speculated that Trump is getting his stories from \"action films.\"\n\nTrump's scenario does show up in the movie \"Sicario: Day of the Soldado.\" Esquire speculated that perhaps he watched it during the Christmas holiday and now believes that it really happened.\n\nTrump has a history of vividly describing events that never occurred. He once claimed that he saw \"thousands\" of people in New Jersey cheering after the 9/11 attack. That didn't happen. He has a history of vividly describing events that never occurred.\n\nTrump has also alleged that \"prayer rugs\" have been found near the border. He uses this to justify the claim (echoed by Mike Pence) that Islamic terrorists are crossing into America.\n\nThis is also made up. It's a long-ago debunked story originating from the right-wing media, specifically the extremely pro-Trump Breitbart News.\n\nAmericans don't buy Trump's fearmongering about the border. They don't support his obsession with building a wall, and his decision to shut down the government over his bigoted obsession was a major disaster.\n\nTrump and his fellow Republicans have created a fantasy world that doesn't exist citing crimes that didn't happen for a wall that isn't needed.

That gets people hurt and killed.\n\nActress Ellen Page delivered a fiery condemnation of the anti-LGBTQ bigotry that Mike Pence has supported throughout his political career and its dangerous consequences of it.\n\nPage spoke during an interview on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" about how people are often hurt and even killed as a direct result of the rhetoric and policies championed by Republicans like Trump and Pence.\n\n\"The president and the vice president, Mike Pence,\" Page said, \"wishes I could not be married, let's just be clear.\"\n\n\"The vice president of America wishes I didn't have the love with my wife. He wanted to ban that in Indiana, he believes in conversion therapy.\"\n\nFor years Pence was at the forefront of anti-LGBT and radical social conservative policy while he served as governor of Indiana.\n\nHe opposed same-sex marriage. He was an advocate for gay conversion therapy. He even signed the so-called \"Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\" which allowed businesses in the state to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans.\n\nPage connected Pence's hateful approach to the recent attack on actor Jussie Smollett. Smollett had racist and homophobic slurs yelled at him by attackers who poured what police called an \"unknown chemical substance\" poured on him. A noose was tied around his neck.\n\n\"Connect the dots,\" Page implored, \"This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them.\"\n\n\"You go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused, and they're going to kill themselves.

He pushed for a Muslim ban on travel to the United States, wants to spend billions on a racist southern border wall, and is trying to ban transgender service in the military.\n\nTrump, along with Congressional Republicans, also went all-in to install Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh is an opponent of reproductive rights and that was enough to ensure conservative support of his nomination despite credible accusations of sexual assault.\n\nTrump even called Nazis \"very fine people.\"\n\nTrump is an unpopular president who is reeling from the negative press associated with his decision to shut down the federal government.\n\nHe reportedly plans to use his State of the Union speech to rally the Pence-aligned segment of conservatives to shore up his presidency.\n\nPolitico reports that Trump is telling allies \"he wants to incorporate firm anti-abortion language\" into his address and \"potentially include an anti-abortion figure among his list of invitees.\"\n\nThe political calculation is clear. He's doing this because, as the outlet notes, he is hoping to \"energize his evangelical supporters\" and \"has maintained strong support from religious conservatives who might otherwise be turned off by his persona thanks to his administration\u2019s attentiveness to their social-conservative agenda.\"\n\nTrump and Pence do not care if their support for such bigotry and intolerance hurts and kills people.\n\nPage's speech exposed the dark cynicism hiding under the Trump-Pence ticket and the fact that the lives they hurt aren't theoretical.

Mark Meadows (R-NC), leader of the Freedom Caucus, bragged to Politico. But this time, he said, those ideas \"are being used in a unified way in the minority.\"\n\nAnd now, Politico reports, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the GOP leadership are \"coalescing around the bomb-throwers' playbook\" more commonly used by the far-right elements of the GOP.\n\nSuch radical ideas have already had disastrous results for the Republican minority. The GOP, following the lead of the Freedom Caucus, indulged Trump's tantrum by letting him keep the government shut down over an unpopular border wall. The 35-day shutdown caused 800,000 federal workers to go without paychecks, wreaked havoc on air travel across the country, and put America's national security at risk.\n\nIn the end, Trump \u2014 and House Republicans \u2014 caved to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and reopened the government without giving up a single penny for a border wall.\n\nFormer Republican leader John Boehner scoffed at the idea of following the lead of the Freedom Caucus \u2014 which he referred to as the \"knucklehead caucus,\" made up of people who \"don\u2019t know how to vote yes on anything.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time the GOP has made a large-scale commitment to obstructing the basic governing duties of Congress. President Obama faced unprecedented obstruction from congressional Republicans starting in 2010, when the GOP won large midterm victories.\n\nAt the time, then-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said, \"The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\" Saying no to everything and obstructing the Senate was McConnell and Republicans' big plan to accomplish that.\n\nMcConnell failed, as President Obama went on to win a second term. McCarthy's gambit has already failed once, as Pelosi ended the Trump shutdown on her terms.\n\nIf history is any guide, Republican obstructionism is a failing strategy that only polarizes the country. But rather than work with the leaders American voters put in place, McCarthy and GOP leadership would rather obstruct, delay, and be a nuisance.\n\nNo wonder voters ousted them in record numbers.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Right-wing extremists killed more people in the U.S. last year than in any year since 1995 \u2014 and Trump is dismantling our ability to deal with the threat.\n\nEvery extremist murder in the U.S. in 2018 was linked to right-wing extremism, according to an alarming new report from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism.\n\nThe annual report found that at least 50 people were killed by extremists in 2018, marking a 35 percent increase from 2017. This makes 2018 the fourth-deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings since 1970.\n\nAll 50 murders were committed by people with ties to at least one right-wing extremist movement, making right-wing extremists responsible for more killings in 2018 than any year since 1995, when Timothy McVeigh bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City.\n\nCurrently, there are more than a dozen active right-wing extremist movements in the U.S. that engage in violence, including white supremacists, anti-government sovereign citizens and militias, and anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant extremists.\n\nIn 2018, the vast majority of extremist killings were carried out by white supremacists, and guns were involved in 42 of out the 50 killings, the report said.\n\nIncluded among the incidents in the report was the October mass shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 Jews were murdered by a white supremacist convinced that Jews were responsible for the so-called \"caravan\" of asylum-seeking migrants traveling towards the U.S. border.\n\nIn another incident, a white supremacist with ties to the Christian Identity movement allegedly set his African American roommate on fire at a Veterans Affairs home in Tennessee, then bragged about the killing in a jailhouse letter to a white supremacist group.\n\nThe Christian Identity movement preaches racist and anti-Semitic beliefs, often accompanied by extreme anti-government sentiments \u2014 demonstrating the frequent convergence of different right-wing extremist ideologies within one movement.\n\nOther incidents in 2018 included the mass shooting at a Florida yoga studio, which was carried out by a misogynistic \"incel\" who posted racist rants on YouTube, and the Parkland, Florida, school shooting perpetrated by a student who said he wished \"all the Jews were dead.\"\n\nAccording to aggregate data from the ADL's Center on Extremism, nearly three out of four extremist-related killings over the last decade can be linked to domestic right-wing extremists.\n\nBut as this new report shows, right-wing extremist violence is not only the greatest domestic terror threat \u2014 it's also the threat that is increasing most rapidly.\n\nThese findings are in line with other recent reports documenting a spike in right-wing extremism and associated violence over the past two years.\n\nAccording to a November 2018 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the number of terrorist attacks in the U.S. committed by far-right perpetrators more than quadrupled between 2016 and 2017.\n\nThat same month, the Washington Post published an analysis showing that incidents of right-wing violence have surged since Trump took office. Also in November, the FBI released new statistics documenting a rise in hate crimes coinciding with Trump's presidency, with particularly notable increases in anti-Hispanic and anti-Semitic crimes.\n\nWhile Trump has attempted to deny his role in inspiring violence, experts say right-wing extremists believe Trump is \"offering them tacit support for their cause.\" And they\u2019re right \u2014 he is, as are his GOP allies.\n\nWhen MAGA hat-wearing white supremacists rioted in Charlottesville and killed an innocent bystander, Trump called them \"very fine people.\"\n\nWhen members of a synagogue were brutally murdered by an anti-Semitic gunman motivated by a conspiracy theory floated by Republican lawmakers and right-wing media figures, Trump blamed the victims for not being armed.\n\nWhen members of the pro-Trump extremist group known as the Proud Boys unleashed a violent mob attack following an appearance at a mainstream Republican institution in New York City, the GOP responded with nothing but deafening silence.\n\nBut when non-violent asylum seekers showed up at the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump sent thousands of troops to deal with the manufactured crisis.\n\nWhen Trump floated conspiracy theories about terrorists sneaking through the border and invented wild tales about women being bound with duct-tape and smuggled into the U.S., Republicans lined up behind him and supported his demand for a border wall \u2014 even when that meant shutting down the entire government as leverage.\n\nThis is a continuation of a trend that started before Trump took office and continues to this day.\n\nEven in the face of a mountain of evidence showing that right-wing extremists pose the greatest danger to the homeland, Trump and members of his administration still point to Islamic extremism and illegal immigration as the primary domestic terror threats in America.\n\nWhen one immigrant commits a crime, Trump uses them as an example to demonize all immigrants, but when white supremacists commit violent crimes en masse, Trump ignores it completely \u2014 or even worse, shuts down programs to prevent the violence and redirects resources to focus on threats other than white supremacist terrorism.\n\nAnd now, the same racism and anti-immigrant fervor that are fueling Trump's ongoing demands for a border wall to keep people out are blinding him to the greatest threat \u2014 the one that's already here.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump seems to think being president should work just like investing in real estate.\n\nTrump described the office of the presidency itself like a real estate deal, calling it a \"loser\" because he claims he has been unable to make money from his position.\n\n\"I lost massive amounts of money doing this job,\" Trump whined to the New York Times in a Thursday interview. \"This is not the money. This is one of the great losers of all time. You know, fortunately, I don\u2019t need money. This is one of the great losers of all time. But they\u2019ll say that somebody from some country stayed at a hotel. And I\u2019ll say, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 But I lose, I mean, the numbers are incredible.\"\n\nTrump's comments aren't just distasteful; they're also false. He squeezes money out of the Oval Office and into his own pockets on a regular basis.\n\nBut even if Trump ends up losing money on these corrupt deals, it doesn't matter \u2014 they're still corrupt, and this is still not how the presidency is supposed to work.\n\nTrump has put in place several different strategies that have made it possible for him to personally profit from the presidency.\n\nTrump refused to follow the tradition embraced by both Democratic and Republican presidents of setting up a blind trust or selling off their assets in order to keep their private financial interests separate from their duties as president.\n\nInstead, Trump put his sons in charge of the Trump Organization \u2014 and the profits from the company still flow to him. Trump also remains free to strategize about the family business with his children while he's supposed to be serving the public.\n\nIf foreign governments or domestic corporations want to seek favors from the U.S. government, they know that they can effectively bribe Trump by patronizing venues like Trump's D.C. hotel.\n\nThe hotel itself has capitalized on this by adding a premium to its rates compared to other facilities in the area. That means even more money can make its way into Trump's pockets.\n\nIn fact, Trump started profiteering before he was even sworn in. One out of every $10 donated to Trump's presidential campaign ended up coming back to Trump himself. The Trump Organization billed the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee for renting office space at Trump Tower and for flights on Trump's private jet.\n\nRepublican campaign money has continued to flow into Trump properties during his two years in office \u2014 and with the bully pulpit of the White House, Trump can rake in more cash than ever before.\n\nTrump has also improperly used his duties as president to fundraise for his re-election campaign. He wore his campaign hat while on official government business preparing for hurricane landfall, using the backdrop of suffering and property destruction to earn money for himself.\n\nTrump created another cynical fundraising opportunity after he shut down the federal government because Congress won't give him billions to erect a racist border wall. He sold his supporters \"bricks\" to be sent to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), with the proceeds going toward his campaign.\n\nIf Trump pulls the same grift with his 2020 campaign that he did in 2016, some of that money will also profit him personally in addition to funding his campaign.\n\nWhile in office, Trump has also taken frequent trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort and club in Florida, which serves as free advertising for the property. And now one of the perks of Mar-a-Lago membership is the opportunity to rub elbows with the president of the United States \u2014 or even influence how agencies like the Office of Veterans Affairs do business.\n\nDespite his disingenuous protesting, Trump has made a lot of money from the presidency, using methods that an ethical leader would never dream of.\n\nTrump uses the office to rake in donations for his party, which then funnels funds back to his companies. Or he simply makes it clear that doing business in his White House involves transferring money to Trump properties as a sort of tip.\n\nIt's corruption all the way down.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A new class-action lawsuit alleges that Trump, his kids, and the Trump Organization all helped prop up a multi-level-marketing scheme.\n\nDonald Trump, his children, and the Trump Organization are facing a new class-action lawsuit over their promotion of some shady multi-level-marketing (MLM) businesses. It's well in keeping with the family's obvious desire to make as much money as possible off as many people as possible.\n\nBack in 2005, right as \"The Apprentice\" was becoming, regrettably, a sensation, the Trump Organization began partnering with ACN, a multi-level-marketing (MLM) company. ACN's business model was pretty much a standard MLM racket: People only made money by recruiting other people downstream, who would then ostensibly sell ACN's product and make payments upstream to the people who recruited them.\n\nACN sold things like internet plans, but its primary product was a fantastically outdated videophone. As Skype and other video technologies were taking off, ACN was pushing a Frankenstein behemoth that was a desk telephone plus a video screen plus a webcam plus a handset plus a keypad. And if you wanted to call someone, they had to be using an ACN phone too.\n\nTrump didn't just casually endorse this MLM scheme. He did videos for ACN, wrote blog posts for them, and put some ACN folks on \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" The Trump children also pushed ACN, appearing with the founders. Trump told people it was a low-risk investment, which is just not the case for MLM ventures. He bragged that ACN was selling a half-billion dollars worth of video phones annually, which was also not true.\n\nTrump also forgot to tell anyone that, between getting paid for his speeches at ACN conferences and ACN ponying up to be featured on \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" he made millions off of his work with the company.\n\nWhile Trump made a ton of money off this endeavor, the people who signed up with ACN did not. One of the plaintiffs alleges she spent several thousand dollars to attend ACN events and try to recruit other salespeople. Eventually, she made a grand total of $38. Another plaintiff was homeless and went into debt to be able to participate. He never made any money, and the debt remains today.\n\nThe lawsuit is brought on behalf of everyone that was scammed by Trump and ACN. These plaintiffs took a chance on ACN, they say, because they felt like Trump's backing made it a sure thing.\n\nThis lawsuit also covers yet another MLM scheme Trump was involved in called the Trump Network. It was basically the same situation as ACN, albeit with health and wellness products. That venture, Trump claimed, was \"an exciting opportunity to opt out of the recession.\"\n\nAnd then there was the thing about the teens.\n\nACN and Trump were involved with a nonprofit called SUCCESS Foundation. (Yes, it was in all caps.) The noble purpose of the organization was to provide personal development books for teenagers. When ACN connected Trump with this organization, they said they did so because \"no one knows better than Mr. Trump the importance of personal development for our youth and the direct impact it can have on their future.\"\n\nWhen Trump signed on, SUCCESS announced his involvement by saying, \u201cTrump has become a household name synonymous with success.\u201d There was also a giant picture of teenagers on a stage with the headline, \"The TRUMPS of TOMORROW.\"\n\nIt's unclear why Trump bothered to connect with SUCCESS, save for his relationship with ACN. The lawsuit speculates that ACN used SUCCESS as a sort of feeder group to get recruits for the MLM business.\n\nOne of the most pathetic parts of this lawsuit is just how tawdry it all is. These are nothing but unremarkable multi-level-marketing (MLM) scams, although the \"Teens of Tomorrow\" part is a bit of a twist.\n\nTrump isn't a stranger to tawdry scams. His \"charity,\" the Trump Foundation, was forced to shut down after the New York Attorney General determined the foundation was \u201clittle more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump\u2019s business and political interests.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was Trump University, which was the subject of another class action lawsuit \u2014 this time from people who had paid to attend real-estate seminars that would supposedly provide them with Trump's secrets to real estate investing, taught by instructors hand-picked by Trump.\n\nInstead, they spent as much as $35,000 to learn definitely-not-secret things such as the fact that you can go to the IRS to learn about tax deductions, and you can use real estate websites like www.trulia.com to find properties. Shortly after the election, Trump settled the Trump University lawsuit, agreeing to pay $25 million to the class.\n\nThat a sitting president would face these sorts of lawsuits once seemed unthinkable, but now they're just part of the landscape. That's what happens when you have a grifter-in-chief rather than an actual leader.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Nevada tried to tell the federal government not to ship weapons-grade nuclear material across the state, but the Trump administration did it anyway, and secretly.\n\nIn December of last year, the state of Nevada sued the Trump administration to try and stop it from shipping weapons-grade plutonium into the state.\n\nEarlier in January, a judge refused to immediately stop the shipment, saying she wouldn't rule until February. But she went on to say that she hoped the government wouldn't ship any plutonium while they waited for her ruling.\n\nThey didn't wait. They shipped it anyway \u2014 in secret, and against Nevada's wishes. In fact, they shipped it before the litigation ever began.\n\nIt's not clear when, if ever, Nevada would have known that the government was shipping plutonium across the state, but the litigation seems to have forced the administration's hand.\n\nSo, they admitted in a court filing that they had completed the shipment of approximately one-half ton of plutonium to the Nevada National Security Site, which is only about 90 miles from Las Vegas.\n\nUnder Obama, a plan to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain was essentially halted, but the Trump administration revived the plan. Throughout, however, Nevada officials have been very clear they don't want nuclear material passing through their state or stored in their state.\n\nThey're worried there's a risk of exposure, particularly to water sources. They were worried that the Department of Energy (DOE) hadn't adequately considered the environmental impacts. They were afraid that any path for the plutonium would go right through Las Vegas.\n\nAnd Nevada said no, again and again. In May 2018, when the DOE announced the nuclear material would be moved from South Carolina to Nevada, then-Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) and Nevada members of Congress denounced the move. Then they tried to negotiate with the DOE, to no avail. Then, the December lawsuit. None of it mattered.\n\nAfter ignoring Nevada's wishes and secretly shipping nuclear material across the state, the DOE now has the nerve to say that Nevada's lawsuit is moot. Why? Because the lawsuit was about blocking the shipment of the nuclear material, but the government already secretly shipped the plutonium, so there's no reason for a lawsuit about it to continue.\n\nNevada officials, rightly, rejected this nonsense. They point out that the state is, more than ever, in need of an injunction to stop shipments because the government's actions have made them suspicious that more plutonium shipments will be coming to Nevada.\n\nGiven that the government already let Nevada believe that they were negotiating in good faith while secretly shipping nuclear material anyway, there is no reason for Nevada to trust the federal government here.\n\nCan anyone be surprised that this administration would ignore the will of a state, potentially exposing its residents to danger when it suited them to do so?\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Yet again, a new survey shows that the Republican tax scam is an epic failure.\n\nContrary to boasts from Trump that the GOP tax scam would be \"rocket fuel\" for the economy, a survey published earlier this week shows the bill didn't spur more hiring or more investment from businesses.\n\nThe GOP tax bill \"appeared to have no major impact on businesses' capital investment or hiring plans,\" reports Reuters. The reporting is based on a National Association of Business Economics' (NABE) survey showing the overwhelming majority of businesses (84 percent) made no changes to their capital investment or hiring plans after the tax scam became law.\n\nThe survey adds to a long list of evidence showing Trump and the Republicans added trillions to the deficit while workers got basically nothing.\n\nSo instead of \"rocket fuel,\" the tax scam turned out to be a giant dud. While the economy has continued to add jobs, it has done so at a slower rate than the end of President Obama's second term. That's a far cry from the investment and job growth the White House promised when shilling for the tax scam.\n\nMeanwhile, wealthy corporations have raked in massive profits from the bill, which slashed their tax rates. Wall Street banks saw record profits, while corporations gorged on stock buyback schemes meant to enrich investors and corporate shareholders.\n\nAs the richest 1 percent of Americans saw more than 80 percent of the benefits from the scam, middle-class families were left out in the cold. Wages were mostly stagnant, and Republicans embarrassingly bragged about a secretary receiving an extra $1.50 per week.\n\n\"The GOP's tax law gave corporations license to put profits over people \u2014 and they have stopped at nothing to make more money at the expense of working families,\" Ryan Thomas, Tax March spokesperson, told Shareblue Media in response to the survey.\n\nWhile corporate America is enjoying handouts from the Republican Congress, the cost to America is in the trillions. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts the tax scam will add nearly $2 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. As he adds more and more to the debt, Trump is reportedly unconcerned, saying others will clean up the mess he is creating.\n\nA GOP-controlled Congress rammed through a partisan, deficit-busting tax law that has completely failed to deliver on the promises Republicans made.

Susan Collins (R-ME) helped Trump secure a major win by voting for his tainted Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. But now Collins is trying to recover her reputation as a \u201cmoderate\u201d by waffling on whether she\u2019ll support Trump\u2019s re-election.\n\nWhen Collins was asked Tuesday by PBS host Judy Woodruff about whether she will endorse Trump in the 2020 election, Collins replied that she\u2019ll \u201chave to see what happens.\u201d\n\n\"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to have to see what happens between now and then and look at what his record is,\" Collins said.\n\nCollins clearly sees a political advantage in trying to distance herself from Trump. She is facing re-election in 2020 in Maine, where only 45 percent of voters approve of Trump\u2019s presidency and 51 percent disapprove. And she has long claimed to be an independent who is willing to buck her party on issues like supporting reproductive rights for women.\n\nYet Collins will have a hard time explaining to Maine voters why she was willing to do Trump's dirty work in the Senate \u2014 and sell out women \u2014 by providing a key swing vote to install Kavanaugh, an accused sexual predator who is also suspected of lying under oath, onto the Supreme Court.\n\nKavanaugh made a disastrous appearance before Congress to respond to allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he had attempted to rape her in high school.\n\nIn a shrill, belligerent meltdown, Kavanaugh fumed about how unfair it was that he might be denied a seat on the highest court in the land. He also made several statements about his high school years that seemed like obvious lies \u2014 and that may soon get him investigated by Congress for possible perjury.\n\nAfter this display of petulance, Collins' home newspapers made it clear that Kavanaugh was unfit for the high court.\n\n\"A no vote on his nomination is appropriate and necessary,\u201d The Bangor Daily News editorial board wrote.\n\n\"Based on what he demonstrated in his own testimony, Kavanaugh lacks the character and judgment to serve on the Supreme Court,\u201d the Portland Press Herald editorial board said.\n\nThe majority of Americans agreed: Kavanaugh was the least popular Supreme Court nominee in the history of Gallup polling.\n\nBut Collins ignored the people she is supposed to represent, and instead voted to confirm the accused abuser to a lifetime seat on the court.\n\nIn addition to the assault allegations, Kavanaugh has a terrible record on women\u2019s issues and would likely provide the fifth vote to gut Roe v. Wade and abortion rights in America. Collins claims to support reproductive rights, but naively chose to believe that Kavanaugh wouldn\u2019t dare to harm them.\n\nAfter Republicans lost from coast to coast in 2018, Collins is the only Republican in New England's congressional caucus. She is likely to struggle to win re-election if she backs the unpopular Trump.\n\nBut when it really counted, Collins picked Trump over Maine voters and women across the country. It won\u2019t be easy for voters to forget that, no matter what Collins says about Trump now.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "State GOP officials in Texas should have checked their math before alleging a massive voter fraud scheme that doesn't exist.\n\nLast week, the Republican secretary of state in Texas, David Whitley, made a truly startling claim: that 95,000 people in Texas were registered to vote despite not being citizens, and 58,000 of those had voted in at least one Texas election.\n\nAlthough it was clear almost immediately that the numbers were suspect, that didn't stop Republicans \u2014 from top Texas elected officials all the way up to Trump \u2014 from spreading panic about it.\n\nKen Paxton, Texas' GOP attorney general, declared a \"VOTER FRAUD ALERT\" on Twitter. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott praised Whitley for allegedly \"uncovering and investigating this illegal vote registration.\" Trump tweeted to lie once again about voter fraud being rampant in California.\n\nNow, however, evidence for this claim has completely collapsed \u2014 the same thing that happens every time Republicans cry \"voter fraud.\"\n\nWhitley's irresponsible claim was based on a cursory look at the voter rolls with no follow-up research. First, he looked at a list of people the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) showed had applied for a driver's license or other ID using a form of documentation, like a green card, that showed they weren't a citizen. Then, he compared that to the voter rolls.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that many of people may have become naturalized citizens since applying for their driver's license, and other names may merely be duplicates.\n\nThis is exactly what county elections officials found when they started looking more closely at the names. Harris County reviewed 30,000 names and quickly determined that at least 60 percent of the voters they'd reviewed so far were actually citizens, and 400 of the names on the list were duplicates.\n\nIn fact, one attorney for the county told the New York Times that officials are \"not willing to conclude at this point that we know of anybody on this list who is not a United States citizen.\"\n\nOther counties also reported that their lists contained a \"significant\" number of names that shouldn't be included.\n\nIn the face of this, Whitley walked back his claim somewhat. Five large counties in Texas have already received calls from Whitley's office saying that some of the 95,000 people marked as suspect shouldn't be on those lists.\n\nBut while Whitley and other GOP officials were willing to shout the initial false claims of voter fraud from the rooftops, they have been very quiet about reversing those claims.\n\nRepublicans frequently raise the specter of in-person voter fraud, even though evidence shows that such fraud is so rare it's essentially nonexistent. Trump even set up a voter fraud commission to try to convince people to believe his made-up stories about busloads of people crossing state lines to fraudulently vote \u2014 but he was forced to shut it down when the commission couldn't find evidence to back up his claims.\n\nWhile in-person voter fraud almost never happens, election fraud can and does. But when real election fraud does occur, as in North Carolina's 9th District, the GOP ignores it entirely. The GOP candidate for that House seat, Mark Harris, hired someone who had been linked to previous election fraud \u2014 and that person allegedly ran an illegal scheme to collect absentee ballots from real voters and then throw those ballots away.\n\nAll along, the GOP has really been interested in voter suppression, not voter fraud. They know that keeping people from the polls tends to be the only way they can win \u2014 and spreading lies like Whitley, Paxton, Abbott, and Trump did is part of that scheme.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-NY) district agree with her ideas about taxing the super-rich.\n\nThe conservative, pro-Trump propaganda network sent reporter Lawrence Jones (who has a history of embarrassing himself on air) to New York's 14th Congressional District, apparently hoping to find voters who would bash the freshman Democrat.\n\nThey were disappointed.\n\nAsked by Jones about Ocasio-Cortez's proposal to tax earnings over $10 million at a rate of 70 percent, one woman said she agreed: \"I am all for it.\"\n\n\"Absolutely, they make so much money, tax them!\" another woman emphatically said.\n\nOne man said he thought 70 percent was actually \"too low,\" and that a 90 percent marginal tax rate on income above $10 million would be a better idea.\n\n\"The people believe in her,\" Jones said incredulously. \"People should be afraid.\"\n\n\"I don't know what's scarier: her policies or the fact that so many people will agree with her,\" fretted Fox and Friends co-host and consummate Trump booster Brian Kilmeade.\n\nJones and Kilmeade seem terrified that a popular member of Congress might actually represent the views of her constituents.\n\nThe constituents Jones interviewed were also receptive to Ocasio-Cortez's push to abolish ICE because of the agency's repeated abuses of immigrants.\n\n\"Yes,\" one woman replied when asked if she thought the agency should be dissolved. Another man interviewed said he wasn't sure if ICE needed to be fully abolished, but that he did think \"major changes, radical changes\" need to be made.\n\nFox, and other members of the right-wing media like Rush Limbaugh, have trained their sights on Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive members of the new Democratic House majority \u2014 precisely because of how popular they are.\n\nFor many years, Fox has refused to challenge the Republican-backed economic policies that have mostly benefited the super-rich.\n\nBut the public has been extremely receptive to more progressive economic ideas like the ones Ocasio-Cortez is promoting \u2014 and has largely rejected the kinds of ideas Fox promotes.\n\nThe tax scam that Trump and Republicans passed may have been hailed on Fox News, but it has been a big dud in public opinion and has done nothing to help the economy.\n\nBy contrast, Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent marginal tax rate idea isn't just popular \u2014 it's also something America has successfully tried before. The top marginal tax rate went as high as 91 percent under President Eisenhower, and fell to 70 percent under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. These were some of America's most economically prosperous decades.\n\nFox promotes itself as the voice of the people, but has allied itself with the worst of the super-rich.\n\nThe propaganda network thought it could help bring down progressive Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez. But actually talking to regular Americans is all it took for the effort to blow up in their faces.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump decides to break yet another treaty \u2014 and this time it could spark a new nuclear arms race.\n\nOn Friday morning, the Trump administration announced the United States will withdraw from a major nuclear weapons treaty with Russia. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. will no longer comply with the agreement and will initiate the withdrawal process, which takes six months.\n\nThe Washington Post calls the treaty, formally known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, a \"cornerstone Cold War agreement,\" noting that Trump's actions elevate \"fears of a new nuclear arms race.\"\n\nBacking out of this agreement will make \"everything more dangerous,\" former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, co-chair of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, told CNN.\n\nThe INF treaty was signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, and was meant to prevent a surprise nuclear strike by forcing both countries to eliminate all of their nuclear missiles that had a short enough range (500 to 5,500 km) to be launched without early warning.\n\nThe United States alleges Russia has broken the treaty. While European allies agree Russia has not lived up to their end of the bargain, NATO did not endorse Trump's previous threats to withdraw from the treaty, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe Trump administration has been itching to ditch the treaty for months, and word leaked in October 2018 that they were likely going to move forward with the plan.\n\nAt that time, Michael Carpenter, a foreign policy adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden, said Trump would be \"handing Vladimir Putin a gift\" if he did so.\n\nTrump is now inviting a level of global instability the world has not seen in decades.\n\n\"We are heading into a direction we have not been in in 40 years: no arms control limits or rules that we are both following and that is very dangerous,\" Lynn Rusten, a senior official at the National Security Council during President Obama's administration and current vice president at the Nuclear Threat Initiative, told CNN.\n\nIn his short, unpopular tenure, Trump has made a habit of isolating the United States from global pacts.\n\nOver the past two years, Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord, ditched the multi-country Iran nuclear agreement, and snubbed a dozen countries working on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.\n\nTrump is often a global laughing stock, seemingly doing his best to alienate allies and coddle adversaries. Unfortunately, his increasingly reckless tactics are putting America and our global allies at very serious risk.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Unlike Trump, the White House National Drug Control Strategy doesn't say that a border wall will help tackle issues like the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe Trump administration released its first official drug control strategy Thursday \u2014 and not once does it suggest that building a border wall might help curb drug addiction or the opioid crisis, undermining one of Trump's key arguments in favor of a wall.\n\nThe report, the National Drug Control Strategy, lays out an array of policies to reduce \"illicit drug use through education and evidence-based prevention programs.\" But not one of those policies includes building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe report does mention drugs coming into the country in ways a wall would not prevent, such as through the mail. But Newsweek points out that the words \"wall\" and \"barrier\" are never mentioned in the same context that Trump uses them.\n\nThe report's silence on a border wall speaks volumes about Trump's repeated, absurd claims that such a wall is needed to stop illegal drugs from flowing into the country from Mexico.\n\nTrump shut down the federal government for 35 days demanding Congress pay a $5.7 billion ransom to build Trump's wall. During the shutdown, Trump repeatedly invoked illegal drugs as a scare tactic to try to convince Americans to support the wall.\n\nIn his first prime-time Oval Office address to the nation, Trump claimed a wall was needed to prevent drugs like heroin from entering the country. At the time, fact-checkers pointed out that most drugs coming across the border actually travel through ports of entry, hidden among legal goods \u2014 so a wall wouldn't stop them.\n\nThe issue came up again earlier this week when a record amount of fentanyl was seized at the U.S.-Mexico border. Even though the 254 pounds of drugs were found in a tractor-trailer stopped for inspection at a legal border crossing, Republicans and White House officials bizarrely claimed the drug bust was evidence that a border wall is needed.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's national security team testified before Congress on Tuesday about top national security threats facing the country. As the Washington Post pointed out, not a single official said there was a crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIt's not surprising that the shutdown ended with Trump getting no money for his wall. It's an obviously unnecessary waste of money, and a racist symbol to boot.\n\nBut Trump still isn't willing to face reality. He desperately wants to build a border wall \u2014 but his excuses for building one make so little sense that even his own administration can't defend them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "When it comes to the border, Trump has been treating the troops as his own personal army. With Democrats in the House, that has to change.\n\nTrump is sending several thousand more troops to the border for no real reason. Department of Defense (DOD) officials couldn't even be bothered to tell the House how many troops they would be sending.\n\nNow that the Democrats control the House, Trump and his DOD aren't going to be able to be as cavalier or close-mouthed as they were under the single-party Republican rule of the past two years.\n\nOf course, Trump announced this troop deployment via tweet, saying that the additional troops were necessary to stop the \"Invasion of Illegals, through large Caravans.\" In the same tweet, he inevitably lamented the lack of a wall, saying it would be easier and less expensive to build the wall.\n\nIt's beginning to look like Trump may just keep sending troops to the border for non-urgent and non-military tasks, only because he sees it as leverage to get his wall.\n\nThe additional 3,500 troops are being sent to the border to help string concertina wire. That's on top of the 2,300 troops that have been there since before the election. The request came from DHS and was made during the shutdown.\n\nBut the administration seems to have gotten a bit rusty about having to explain to Congress what it is going to do and why. On Tuesday, there was a House Armed Services Committee meeting. At that meeting, the Pentagon wouldn't tell the committee the size of the deployment. This was even though the committee asked them several times to explain what would happen next at the border.\n\nIn a letter to Patrick Shanahan, the acting secretary of defense, Armed Services Committee Chair Adam Smith noted that this omission was \"at best an error in judgment, and at worst flat-out dishonesty.\"\n\nAll along, Trump has treated troops with shocking disrespect. He took them away from their families at the holidays to perform the vital function of shoveling horse poop. Then their deployments were significantly extended. They were supposed to come home December 15, but now they're stuck at the border until September 30.\n\nNow he is moving thousands of troops around on a whim, and his defense officials don't feel obliged to answer questions about troop deployments \u2014 even when those questions come from the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nThis administration already appears to be chafing from the most minor of oversight actions. They're in for a long two years.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Cory Gardner, who said he 'will not support someone who brags about degrading and assaulting women,' changed his mind. He'll support Trump in 2020.\n\nBack in 2016, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) said he absolutely could not vote for Trump, based on principle. On Wednesday, Gardner cast those claims aside.\n\nIn an interview with the Independent Journal Review, Gardner said he would \"be supporting the president\" in 2020.\n\nThat's much different than Gardner's position just two years ago, when he said he \"cannot and will not support someone who brags about degrading and assaulting women.\"\n\nGardner distanced himself from Trump in 2016, after a video surfaced of Trump bragging about serially assaulting women. In the video, Trump claimed he enjoyed grabbing women \"by the pussy,\" and kissing women without their consent because, as a star, he \"can do anything.\"\n\nAt the time, Gardner said Trump \"shows a disgust for American character and a disdain for dignity unbecoming of the Presidency.\" He called on Trump to step aside, saying Republicans needed a \"new nominee that reflects the values of our country and our party.\"\n\nNow, as parties gear up for the 2020 race, it seems Gardner has had a change of heart about sexual predators, and plans to support the very person he said lacks the dignity to sit in the Oval Office.\n\nThe sudden change has not gone unnoticed.\n\n\"Now, after separating families and putting children in cages at the border, after shutting the government down for over a month for his stupid wall that isn't ever going to happen, after many in Trump's inner circle have pled guilty to a preposterous list of crimes, after losing the House of Representatives in a blowout election in 2018, Cory Gardner endorses Donald Trump,\" Ian Silverii, executive director of Progress Now Colorado, told Shareblue Media. \"I guess Donald Trump finally became the kind of candidate Cory Gardner can support.\"\n\nWhile Gardner may be excited about Trump, the vast majority of Coloradans most assuredly are not. In December 2018, only 40 percent of Coloradans approved of Trump's job performance, dwarfed by 56 percent who disapproved. It is little surprise how out of touch Gardner is with the residents of his state. After all, they are none too pleased with his job performance either.\n\nIn a late 2018 poll, only 38 percent of Coloradans had favorable feelings toward Gardner. The poll came after voters elected Democrats to top positions throughout the state, including the governor's mansion and a majority in both state legislative chambers. The state sent a clear rebuke to Trump's influence on the Republican Party.\n\n\"Senator Gardner is letting everyone know why he won't be re-elected in 2020: he's standing with President Trump and against Colorado,\" DSCC spokesperson David Bergstein said in a statement. \"We hope he's proud of his endorsement because he's going to spend the next two years explaining it.\"\n\nThumbing his nose at his own principles and the will of Coloradans, Cory Gardner is embracing Trump. If GOP insiders were worried about Gardner's re-election chances before \u2014 and they were \u2014 they must be terrified now.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Jim Jordan (R-OH). Trump senior aide Kellyanne Conway retweeted Jordan and called the bust \"big news.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee's official Twitter account also promoted the story.\n\nBut as others quickly pointed out, these Republicans accidentally made the case against Trump's wall by highlighting this story.\n\n\"Over 600 pounds of drugs hidden inside vegetables were driven into a checkpoint full of armed police and drug dogs,\" Rep. Lou Correa (D-CA) pointed out. \"Tell me again how a wall will stop this?\"\n\n\"Walls don\u2019t work, but smart #BorderSecurity investments at ports of entry do,\" noted Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX).\n\nTrump keeps insisting that we can't have real border security without a wall \u2014 but this huge drug bust shows that our current border protection system, which includes inspections by trained law enforcement officials, works just fine.\n\nDemocrats have offered to spend even more money on border security measures that, unlike a wall, would actually be effective. But Trump stubbornly refuses to consider any of them because of his childish obsession with building a big wall.\n\n\"Walls can't scan for drugs,\" wrote Rep. Sean Maloney (D-NY), noting that the latest Democratic border security proposal includes funds for imaging technology like what was used for the fentanyl bust.\n\nRepublicans are so obsessed with keeping Trump happy that they are willing to abandon basic reason and good sense.\n\nThe latest CPB arrest is just the latest example of why a border wall would be a waste of taxpayer dollars and a concession to fear and bigotry.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump spent 24 hours attacking America's intelligence leaders for contradicting him \u2014 and then tried to claim they're all on the same page after all.\n\nFor more than 24 hours, Trump unleashed a series of unhinged attacks against his top intelligence officers after they repeatedly contradicted him during a Senate hearing Tuesday.\n\nYet in a sudden reversal on Thursday afternoon, he called in his intel leaders for a photo-op and tweeted out a statement claiming they now agreed with him.\n\n\"Just concluded a great meeting with my Intel team in the Oval Office who told me that what they said on Tuesday at the Senate Hearing was mischaracterized by the media - and we are very much in agreement on Iran, ISIS, North Korea, etc.,\" he tweeted. \"Their testimony was distorted press.\"\n\nThen he insisted that a full reading of their testimony, which aired live on C-SPAN, would show they did not disagree with him.\n\n\"I would suggest you read the COMPLETE testimony from Tuesday,\" he continued on Twitter. \"A false narrative is so bad for our Country. I value our intelligence community. Happily, we had a very good meeting, and we are all on the same page!\"\n\nThe latest chapter in this three-day saga is perhaps the most confusing, with Trump making conflicting statements hours apart and once again blaming the media in an attempt to deflect the humiliating reality.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Dan Coats, director of national intelligence, and Gina Haspel, director of the CIA, testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the biggest threats facing the U.S. While under oath, the two repeatedly contradicted statements Trump has made about major global issues, including North Korea (yes, they are still working on missiles that can reach the United States), Iran (yes, they are in compliance with the multi-party nuclear agreement), ISIS (no, they are not defeated) and Russia (yes, they attacked our democracy in 2016 and may do so again in 2020).\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Trump attacked his top intelligence officers, calling them\"extremely passive and naive,\" and \"wrong,\" and saying they need to \"go back to school.\" Trump's attacks on the American intelligence community were so outrageous that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter to Coats asking intel leader to stage an intervention with Trump and teach him the basic facts about these issues.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump resumed his attacks on Coats and Haspel to reporters. When asked if he has confidence in the two, Trump said, \"No, I disagree with them on certain things they said.\" He added, \"Time will prove me right, probably.\"\n\nREPORTER: Do you have confidence with Gina Haspel and Dan Coats to give you advice?

He included a photo of himself with them in the Oval Office.\n\nIt is difficult to see how the media could mischaracterize the testimony, since the entire hearing aired on C-SPAN. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) had a pointed response to Trump's sudden turnaround, tweeting at Trump that Coats' testimony \"both in writing and in person, shows that you are lying.\"\n\nDear @realDonaldTrump: Here is the written statement submitted by DNI Coates. I suggest you read it. https://t.co/NlKbj5SM0B His testimony, both in writing and in person, shows that you are lying. https://t.co/7ym2Wajek5 \u2014 Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) January 31, 2019\n\nEither Coats and Haspel were lying under oath to Congress, or Trump \u2014 a man who has told more than 8,150 lies since entering the White House \u2014 is lying.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Cain was at the White House and met with Trump on Wednesday.\n\nWhen Cain was head of the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s, the group paid out $35,000 \u2014 a full year's salary \u2014 in severance to a woman who accused Cain of sexual harassment.\n\nAnother woman at the organization was paid $45,000 after lodging a formal complaint about Cain sexually harassing her.\n\nWhen these settlements surfaced during his failed 2012 presidential campaign, Cain repeatedly lied about them. He first said he was \"unaware\" of the payouts, then lied about how large the payout was.\n\nSharon Bialek, who worked at the association, said Cain groped her at a dinner in 1997.\n\n\"He said, 'You want a job, right?\" Bialek said. Then, she said, Cain put his hand on her leg beneath her skirt, \"toward my genitals,\" and pushed her head toward his crotch.\n\nTrump infamously admitted on tape to being a sexual predator in the Access Hollywood recording, and has been accused by many women of harassment and assault.\n\nWhen the reports of Cain's behavior surfaced, Trump defended Cain, falsely alleging that the women were seeking \"free fame.\"\n\n\"They probably do love their names splashed across the front pages,\" Trump said \u2014 even though the women had remained anonymous at the time.\n\nTrump has a long history of supporting and protecting abusers.\n\nHe defended serial abuser and former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. He attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford after she accused his Supreme Court appointee, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault. He stuck up for Fox News founder Roger Ailes, who abused multiple women for decades. His current communications director, Bill Shine, is a former Fox News executive who orchestrated the cover-up of sexual harassment at Fox News when he was there.\n\nBy contrast, Trump actually complained that former Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen was too short for the position \u2014 and nominated a man, Jerome Powell, to replace her.\n\nCain and Trump are cut from the same cloth.

When voter suppression succeeds, conservatives win.\n\nThe Democratic bill is a far-reaching effort that would allow for automatic voter registration, increase early voting, and improve voter access through measures like making Election Day a federal holiday and actively encouraging private employers to give workers Election Day off.\n\nOf course, McConnell scorned that, calling it a \"new paid holiday for government workers.\"\n\nOn the House floor, Rep.

McConnell called it a giveaway to \"any federal bureaucrat who decides they would like to hang out at the polls during an election\" and that government workers would use that time to go work on Democratic campaigns.\n\nOf course, the bill says no such thing. It gives federal workers paid leave to provide \"election administration assistance to a State or unit of local government at a polling place on the date of any election\" and time to receive training to provide that assistance.\n\nWorking at the polling place isn't working on a campaign, and people need the training to work in polling places. Only in the minds of voter suppression enthusiasts like the GOP would training more people to work at the polls be viewed as something that favors their opponents.\n\nMcConnell wound up his remarks by claiming darkly that the Democratic bill is \"a power grab that is smelling more and more exactly like what it is.\" Believing that increased voter access is a \"power grab\" is now something the GOP is happy to say right on the Senate floor rather than just behind closed doors.\n\nPublished with the permission of The American Independent."

Deripaska, a close ally of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.\n\nA wealthy Republican donor linked to Mnuchin stands to financially benefit from the lifted sanctions. And because Mnuchin refused to recuse himself from key decisions around the sanctions, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) called it a \"deeply troubling\" conflict of interest.\n\nIn April 2018, the Trump administration announced sanctions on more than half a dozen Russian oligarchs and their companies. Those slapped with sanctions included Deripaska, who owns a giant aluminum company called Rusal.\n\nBut in late December, the Treasury Department announced it would be lifting sanctions against several of Deripaska's companies, including Rusal. One of the key financial beneficiaries of lifting these sanctions is Len Blavatnik, a major Republican donor who has a personal relationship with Mnuchin.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and Sen. Ron Wyden wrote to Mnuchin demanding to know more about Mnuchin's \"personal and professional relationships with major Rusal shareholder Len Blavatnik.\"\n\nSpeier, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, called Mnuchin's refusal to recuse himself from these discussions \"alarming,\" adding in her letter to Mnuchin, \"The fact that you did not recuse yourself from deliberations surrounding the proposed termination of sanctions on RUSAL and En+ [another Russian company] is deeply troubling and a conflict of interest.\"\n\nA Treasury spokesperson said Mnuchin \"had no direct business relationship with Mr. Blavatnik and any suggestion of a conflict of interest is baseless.\"\n\nHowever, the Treasury Department has not yet indicated that it will actually prove the claims to be \"baseless\" by handing over all the documents and information Congress is requesting.\n\nAnd Congress isn't going to let that go.\n\n\"We do not believe termination of the sanctions has relieved Treasury of its obligation to explain fully this deal to Members,\" Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-MA), House Foreign Affairs Chair Eliot L. Engel (D-NY), House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA), and House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) wrote in a statement.\n\nThe chairs of the four powerful committees vowed to \"continue our oversight of Treasury's decision by examining the terms of this deal and its implementation.\"\n\nEngel, Schiff, and Waters sent a subsequent letter to Mnuchin to \"formally request documents pertaining to the decision-making process\" to lift these sanctions.\n\nAfter overwhelming victories across the country in the 2018 midterm election, Democrats are keeping their promise to hold the Trump administration's feet to the fire. It's a new day for Congress, and that means real accountability for all of Trump's Cabinet officials \u2014 including Secretary Mnuchin.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

While Democrats spent January crafting legislation to address the situation, Republicans can't be bothered to help.\n\nWith the shutdown over, an estimated 800,000 federal workers will soon receive back pay. But according to Vox, another 580,000 contractors \u2014 including janitors, cafeteria workers, and security guards \u2014 might never see a penny of back pay from the 5-week shutdown.\n\nDemocrats in the House and Senate are working on legislation to fix this loophole.\n\n\"As a former hotel worker, I understand all too well the reality of living paycheck to paycheck and the struggle to make ends meet,\" Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) said in a statement introducing the Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act.\n\nThe Trump shutdown \"further exacerbated these challenges for the thousands of low-wage service workers and their families across the country who have had to take on second and third jobs just to keep the bills paid and food on the table,\" she added.\n\nHer legislation would ensure federal contract workers would receive back pay for wages lost during the shutdown.\n\nDuring the shutdown \"federal contractors were left in the dark, unaware of when their next paycheck would come,\" Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), a cosponsor of the bill, told Shareblue Media. He added that \"receiving their well-deserved backpay is a step towards correcting the injustice that this president has inflicted upon them.\"\n\nWhile the bill has 29 cosponsors so far, not a single Republican has signed on to endorse the bill. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and the Republican Party fought tooth and nail in 2017 to ensure Wall Street billionaires and wealthy corporate CEOs received billions of dollars in tax breaks, while leaving middle-class families out in the cold fought tooth and nail in 2017 to ensure Wall Street billionaires and wealthy corporate CEOs received billions of dollars in tax breaks, while leaving middle-class families out in the cold.\n\nThe same Republican Party that was eager to increase the national deficit by almost $2 trillion in order to provide tax breaks that mainly benefited the richest one percent, but now is willing to turn a cold shoulder to janitors and security guards.\n\nIt is not only House Republicans who cannot be bothered to help half a million workers. Senate Republicans also refuse to support a complementary effort in that chamber, led by Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN). That bill, which has the same title as the House companion version, has the support of 32 Senators.\n\n\"This is about fairness \u2014 American workers shouldn't be forced to go without a paycheck simply because of President Trump's government shutdown,\" Smith said in a statement introducing the bill. \"It's especially unfair for the low-wage contractor employees who provide the critical work to keep federal buildings clean, operate cafeterias, and keep government property secure,\" she added.\n\nBut again, not a single Republican is willing to support the effort. Instead of focusing on the plight of unpaid janitors and cafeteria workers, Senate Republicans are trying to pass another tax break for the wealthy, this time for 1,700 of the richest families in the country.\n\nVox notes that federal agencies have the ability to provide back pay, but they are not required to do so. Legislation from these Democratic lawmakers would change that, and seek to make whole those who lost wages because of Trump's tantrums.\n\nAs Democrats fight for all workers across the country, Republicans sit idly by, showing the entire nation exactly where their values lie.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The same poll finds Trump currently with 38 percent approval in the state, which he won in 2016. Back then, he received 51 percent of the vote.\n\n\"She is just a great spokesperson. She's an incredible leader. She has led the charge for voting rights which is at the root of just about everything else,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer (NY) said upon making the announcement.\n\nAbrams narrowly lost her gubernatorial election against Brian Kemp, who was Trump's choice in the race and who used voter rights scare tactics to secure his victory. Kemp's margin of victory was merely 1.4 points.\n\nShe is considering running for the Senate seat in Georgia currently held by a Republican, Sen. David Perdue. Perdue has an approval of 45.4 percent, above Trump but below Abrams.\n\nTrump had the State of the Union taken away by Speaker Nancy Pelosi until he gave in to her and reopened the federal government.\n\nNow, in his weakened political condition, he will have his speech responded to by an up-and-coming Democrat who could snatch control of her red state from Republican hands.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

During the hearing, both leaders regularly contradicted remarks Trump has made over the past several years, showing Trump to be wildly uninformed \u2014 or just plain lying \u2014 about some of the biggest global security issues including North Korea, Iran, Russia, and ISIS.\n\nNorth Korea \"is committed to developing a long-range nuclear-armed missile that would pose a direct threat to the United States,\" Haspel said under oath. In the summer of 2018, Trump said the opposite, falsely claiming the country was no longer a nuclear threat.\n\nThe leaders said Iran is upholding its end of the multi-country nuclear agreement, despite Trump breaking America's agreement with Iran because of fears it was not.\n\nAs for the fictional \"border crisis\" that has been Trump's latest obsession, and his justification for demanding billions of dollars to build a wall, the leaders of U.S. intelligence had nothing to say about it.\n\n\"None of the officials said there is a security crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, where Trump has considered declaring a national emergency so that he can build a wall,\" reports the Washington Post.\n\nTrump's fragile ego must not have been able to handle such humiliation, leading him to attack the very people who are sworn to protect this country.\n\n\"They are wrong!\" he tweeted.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has attacked the American intelligence community. In the summer of 2018, Trump stood on a global stage next to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and sided with Putin over his own intelligence community. At the time, even Fox News called Trump's actions \"disgusting.\"\n\nTrump's disregard for the U.S. intelligence community is as shocking today as it was when he humiliated himself on stage with Putin. Trump's reckless disregard for the women and men who work day and night to protect this country is an embarrassment, and leads one to question where Trump's true loyalties lie.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

This time it's Foxconn.\n\nAs has happened so many times in his past, a deal announced by Trump has completely collapsed into a humiliating mess.\n\nFoxconn will not be building a mega-plant in Wisconsin to make advanced liquid crystal display panels. \"In terms of TV, we have no place in the U.S.,\" Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn CEO Terry Gou, told Reuters.\n\nThe announcement is a complete reversal from the grandiose promises Trump made about the jobs and manufacturing boom the Foxconn deal he put together would bring to the country.\n\nIn July of 2017, Trump hosted Foxconn at the White House to announce the deal, which he described as \"a major jobs announcement.\" Later he cited the announcement as part of how in his first year he was \"making America great again.\"\n\nBack in June 2018, Trump was the ringleader in a loud public ceremony to announce the facility, which he said would be \"the eighth wonder of the world.\" The Foxconn complex would be an example of how his administration was \"reclaiming our country's proud manufacturing legacy,\" the serial financial failure announced.\n\nAt the time, White House officials said Trump was closely involved in the negotiations to bring Foxconn to the United States. Then-Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus told a local TV station that Trump personally directed Foxconn's executives the specific location for where the plant should be placed: \"that place in Kenosha.\"\n\nThe centerpiece of this was a multibillion-dollar tax giveaway to the company put together by then-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R).\n\nFrom the beginning there were concerns about the arrangement and how the rules had been bended to please a corporate giant.\n\nBut Trump didn't care. He continued to tout the deal he had arranged, at taxpayer expense, with his Republican allies.\n\nIn the Foxconn flop there are echoes of the $7 million bribe (with tax dollars) that Trump and Pence announced with Carrier. Trump touted the giveaway to the company as a deal he had orchestrated to keep jobs in America. That soon evaporated and big business got money from Trump while it was still allowed to ship jobs overseas.\n\nLike his deals in private industry, the Foxconn story has fallen flat. Trump is used to leaving investors holding the bag as he runs along to the next scam. This time, it is the taxpayers who were pushed into giving their money to Foxconn in exchange for nothing.\n\n\"President Deals\" has struck again.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Matt Bevin thinks it's wrong to close schools to keep children safe.\n\nToday, the Midwest is in the cold grip of a historically brutal polar vortex, with wind chills approaching 60 below zero. It's the coldest it has been in an entire generation. In Minnesota, Illinois, and elsewhere, schools have closed so that schoolchildren don't have to be outside in weather so awful that frostbite can set in within two to five minutes.\n\nBut Kentucky's hard-right Gov. Matt Bevin thinks that closing schools to protect people means we are \"getting soft.\"\n\nBevin is angry because schools are closed today in Kentucky, where the wind chill could hit 15 below zero. True, Kentucky's temperature today is much warmer than the cold gripping states to its north in the Midwest, but it is still a temperature where frostbite can occur within 30 minutes. Closing schools keeps students \u2014 and staff \u2014 safe.\n\nBut Bevin thinks keeping people safe is indicative of some problematic trend in America, one where we coddle children by, perhaps, not letting them freeze to death.\n\n\"[I]t does concern me a little bit that in America \u2014 on this and any number of other fronts \u2014 we're sending messages to our young people that if life is hard, you can curl up in the fetal position somewhere in a warm place and just wait until it stops being hard,\" Bevin said.\n\nIt seems Bevin has some peculiar hostility involving schools. When they were closed in Kentucky for a day in April 2018 so teachers could lobby the government for more money for schools, Bevin said: \"I guarantee you somewhere in Kentucky today a child was sexually assaulted that was left at home because there was nobody there to watch them,\" and that children also may have been introduced to drugs that day.\n\nWhen pushed to apologize for those remarks, he issued a classic non-apology, saying that people were confused and misunderstood what he had to say.\n\nOf course, this isn't the only thing Bevin is heartless about. Like most in the GOP, he hates Medicaid, but he took it one step further \u2014 much further. Early last year, he argued that Medicaid in Kentucky didn't work because there were still people getting sick.\n\nHe also showed a disgusting disdain for people that oppose him politically. When people pushed back on his plan for pension reform, he said they were like drowning victims explained that they were \"pulling [people] under\" and you have to \"knock them out and drag them to shore. It's for their own good.\"\n\nHis casual cruelty is pervasive and breathtaking, and he has no shame about hurting the vulnerable\u2014like school children\u2014in his quest to burnish his tough-guy hard right bona fides. Bevin is one of the most unpopular governors in the nation, and rightly so with an attitude like this.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump Cabinet members would love to avoid accountability forever.\n\nLess than one month into Democratic control of the House of Representatives, three of Trump's Cabinet secretaries \u2014 Kirstjen Nielsen, Alex Azar and Steve Mnuchin \u2014have refused invitations to testify before Congress.\n\nDemocrats in the House have sought to hold hearings on border security, family separation, and the impact of the Trump shutdown, but Trump's Cabinet officials apparently want to hide rather than defend their actions.\n\nThe attempt to hide from accountability infuriated committee leaders, resulting in sharp rebukes from some of the most powerful members of the House.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), chair of the Homeland Security Committee, slammed Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's refusal to testify as \"unreasonable and unacceptable.\" Thompson invited Nielsen, head of the Department of Homeland Security, to a Feb. 6 hearing to speak about border security, which he called \"the very issue that caused the recent shutdown.\" Thompson asked Nielsen to reconsider her attempts at avoiding scrutiny.\n\nNielsen's office says she never refused the invitation but merely sought to change the date of the hearing to another day. However, Thompson's spokesperson told CNN that there is nothing false in the chairman's letter.\n\nRep. Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee wanted to learn more about the Trump administration's unconscionable family separation policy. More than 2,500 children were ripped away from their families based on Trump's heartless policy, and Pallone invited Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Alex Azar to testify about it. But in a desperate attempt to avoid being the face of this cruel policy, Azar declined to show up, trying to send lower-level officials instead, according to Politico.\n\nPallone said in a statement, \"The stonewalling must end, and Secretary Azar must agree to appear before the Committee to answer questions and take accountability for his agency's actions,\" Pallone said in a late January statement.\n\nAzar's testimony is all the more important after an internal investigation from his own department found thousands more children than previously acknowledged may have been taken from their families by the Trump administration.\n\nAfter calling Azar's refusal unacceptable, Pallone said, \"we are going to get him here at some point one way or another.\"\n\nThe third Cabinet member hiding from Congress is Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), chair of the Ways and Means Committee, scheduled a hearing about the impact of the Trump shutdown on tax filing. In the midst of the 35-day shutdown, questions were raised about the ability of the IRS to process tax refunds for millions of families.\n\nRather than defend the actions of the administration \u2014 and the potential harm caused by Trump's childish behavior \u2014 Mnuchin wanted to send other officials to testify. In the end, the hearing was canceled, denying the American public valuable insight into key aspects of our government.\n\nAs a co-equal branch of government, Congress has a constitutional duty to oversee the activities of the Executive Branch. And Trump's Cabinet may have to face real accountability sooner or later, whether they like it or not.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump's boldest claims about North Korea, Iran, Russia, and ISIS are simply wrong, according to CIA Director Gina Haspel and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, who testified about the annual \"Worldwide Threat Assessment\" report.\n\nNorth Korea \"is committed to developing a long-range nuclear-armed missile that would pose a direct threat to the United States,\" Haspel said. Coats concluded that North Korea \"will seek to retain its WMD capability and is unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capability.\"\n\nThese statements, given under oath before Congress, stand in stark contrast to Trump's frequent boasts after his on-again, off-again, on-again June 2018 meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. After their initial meeting, Trump claimed that there was no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.\n\nHe has continued to brag, without evidence, that he has made great progress with North Korea. But many reports, including one just a week ago, have revealed that the country is continuing work at more than a dozen secret ballistic missile sites.\n\nAs Trump brags about his non-existent success in North Korea, he has emphasized the supposed threats posed by Iran. But according to Coats, Iran is not \"currently undertaking the key activities we judge necessary to produce a nuclear device.\"\n\nWhen asked if Iran is upholding its end of the multi-party nuclear deal, Haspel admitted that Iran is, indeed, abiding by the agreement. One again, Trump's own intelligence community contradicted Trump. When he broke America's agreement with Iran and other countries last May, he said Iran would \"be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons.\"\n\nBoth Coats and Haspel also warned that Russia will try to interfere in the 2020 election in much the same way it did in the 2016 election. The threat assessment report warned about Russian election interference, as well as cyberattacks \"to disrupt or damage U.S. civilian and military infrastructure during a crisis.\"\n\nYet over and over again, Trump has sided with and defended Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. In one of the most humiliating moments in American foreign policy, Trump stood on stage next to Putin before a global press gathering last summer and took Putin's side over that of American intelligence community.\n\nTrump's recent declaration that ISIS was defeated, which he used as part of his rationale for withdrawing American forces from Syria, is also wrong, according to U.S. intelligence leaders. The threat assessment report states that ISIS \"still commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria,\" and has dozens of networks around the world.\n\nEven Trump's former envoy to the global coalition fighting ISIS said Trump was mistaken about the terrorist group being defeated. To the contrary, Trump's decision to pull American forces out of Syria is tantamount to giving ISIS \"new life.\"\n\nTrump has long been a global laughing stock, spending his time alienating allies and coddling adversarial regimes. Now his own intelligence chiefs are contradicting Trump, which is unsettling.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

One shows him walking shoulder to shoulder with Trump along the famous West Wing Colonnade, just a few feet away fom the Oval Office. Another snapshot shows the author at the Resolute Desk across from Trump.\n\n\"Team of Vipers: My 500 Extraordinary Days in the Trump White House\" is out today, written by the most famous \"gofer\" in the world! Enjoy! https://t.co/Eovn8jMVhk pic.twitter.com/V013bIe0r2 \u2014 Cliff Sims (@Cliff_Sims) January 29, 2019\n\nThe last picture does a great job of showing up Trump, with his signature below a note that reads \"Cliff Great Job! Thanks.\"\n\nTrump's attempt to distance himself from the author is a tried-and-true tactic. He famously described top campaign official George Papadopoulos as merely a \"coffee boy\" despite his work at the campaign's highest level. Like Sims, Trump called him \"low-level.\"\n\nThe book has so incensed the White House that they are threating to sue over the content. \"The Trump campaign is preparing to file suit against Cliff Sims for violating our NDA,\" wrote Trump's re-election campaign COO Michael Glassner.\n\nTrump threatened to sue author Michael Wolff for his book \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" but he never did and the book went on to become a major sales success.\n\nThere are several embarrassing stories in the book from Sims, a Trump supporter, that may explain Trump's hostility to its publication.\n\nThe book claims that Trump created an \"enemies list\" that included members of his own administration he thinks are conspiring against him. According to Sims, he wrote the list with Trump and he \"proceeded to name White House staffer after White House staffer.\"\n\nSimes also wrote that Trump has a bizarre obsession with the chyrons from cable news shows, and that he has his staff assemble \"screenshots of all the chyrons\" to be delivered to him before his speeches.\n\nSims describes Trump as completely enraptured by television. He \"consumed TV like the late Roger Ebert must have watched movies,\" Sims writes.\n\nAnd he wrote that Trump is so paranoid he tried to essentially bribe a reporter into revealing who in his inner circle had been leaking information about him.\n\nSims overall conclusion about Trump is unflattering as well. He notes that in Trump's eyes, \"we were all disposable,\" and that he showed little loyalty to anyone.\n\nThe attack from Trump has raised the book's profile, and instead of it fading into obscurity after launch, it is likely to get a sales boost from his anger. Trump can't resist charging a red flag in front of him, even if he ends up hitting himself in the head.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Mike Simpson (R-ID) told Politico, frankly, that \"shutdowns don't work, and they're stupid.\" Simpson was one of the very few Republicans to support Speaker Nancy Pelosi's repeated efforts to reopen the government.\n\nAn exasperated Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was not happy about the possibility of another shutdown either. \"I want to be able to say that: 'no, it's not possible that we would go back into another shutdown,'\" she said. \"But I didn't think the first one that was 35 days was possible either.\"\n\nEven former Massachusetts governor Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), a fan of Trump's most vile anti-immigrant instincts, is not a fan of another shutdown. He told Politico, \"It goes almost without saying that shutdowns are a very bad idea. And we should not use them as a political weapon.\"\n\nIn late December, Trump initiated what would come to be the longest shutdown in American history \u2014 lasting five weeks \u2014 by throwing a tantrum, demanding $5.6 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. When Democrats refused, Trump resisted reopening the government for over a month.\n\nAs Trump pouted, his actions caused massive pain and suffering across the country. Thousands of federal workers, denied their paychecks, visited soup kitchens and food pantries. Airline workers warned of unprecedented risks for air travelers while the FBI warned of risks to national security. Due to lack of personnel to work at then, national parks were severely damaged and may take centuries to recover.\n\nAfter forcing people to endure 35 days of a shutdown, Trump finally relented and endorsed Pelosi's plan to reopen the government. However, the agreement only provided funding for three weeks, and is set to run out on Feb. 15. During that time, congressional negotiators need to see if they can come to an agreement on border security. If they can't, Trump is already contemplating plunging the country into yet another shutdown if he doesn't what he wants.\n\nWhen asked if Trump was prepared to shut down the government in mid-February, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said yes. When Trump was asked if he would support an agreement with less than his desired amount for a border wall, he said, \"I doubt it.\"\n\nWhile Republicans run to the media after seeing the damage Trump caused with the recent shutdown, many were cowardly accomplices in helping Trump maintain the extended shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) showed a severe lack of leadership, and many other Republican senators were too afraid of Trump to even contemplate voting to reopen the government over his objections.\n\nRepublicans may call another shutdown a stupid idea \u2014 which it is \u2014 but that doesn't guarantee most of the party won't run and hide if Trump goes down that path in a few weeks.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Beale's death and today, January 29, Trump has tweeted about other things 51 times while on a near-constant online tirade, throwing out opinions and complaints about an array of issues.\n\nTrump took the time to tweet \" BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!\" three times as he continued to flail over his government shutdown.\n\nHe whined about the ongoing criminal investigation of his campaign and the prosecution of insiders who helped him along the way, including Michael Cohen and Roger Stone.\n\nTrump also took the time to flog conspiracy theories about votes from \"non-U.S. citizens.\"\n\nAnd he sat, on the taxpayer's dime, and watched hours and hours and hours of Fox News, promoting the content of the quasi-official pro-Trump propaganda network by tweeting quotes.\n\nHe could have offered condolences to the soldier's family, but he chose not to. Instead, it was more worth his time to indulge in familiar all-caps tweets, like \"WITCH HUNT!\"\n\nIgnoring military sacrifice is a fixture of the Trump presidency. He prioritizes his own private grudges and vanity, and the promotion of his sycophants, over acknowledging the men and women of the armed services.\n\nTrump has no respect for military service or any of the people who serve in uniform under his command. He doesn't care about them at all, and it shows.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "William Barr, Trump's pick for attorney general, is looking worse than ever.\n\nOn Monday, Trump's pick for attorney general, William Barr, submitted his written answers to Senate questions, and they do little to quell the fear that he will work to protect Trump instead of serving the people.\n\nFirst, Barr admitted that he has previously discussed special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation with Mike Pence. Pence long ago hired a criminal lawyer to represent him in his dealings with the special counsel. Pence has also pressured Mueller to end his investigation, saying \"[I]n the interest of the country, I think it's time to wrap it up.\"\n\nThe fact that Pence has discussed this investigation with Barr would, in any other administration, likely be grounds for disqualification from the position. Combine this with Trump trying to hire Barr to represent him personally in the Russia probe, and it is absurd that this nomination proceeds.\n\nBarr is also engaging in some complicated wordsmithing about Mueller and the final report from the Russia investigation. He has said that he would resign rather than terminate Mueller for anything other than good cause. That's great, but he also refuses to say he would release the entirety of the Mueller report. Instead, he said his \"goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law.\"\n\nBarr appears to base part of that refusal on his belief \"that it is Department policy and practice not to criticize individuals for conduct that does not warrant prosecution.\" Tell that to Hillary Clinton. When James Comey was director of the FBI, he ignored that edict and gave an unprecedented press conference during the 2016 election slamming Clinton for her use of a personal email server even though the investigation found no wrongdoing.\n\nNow Barr is planning to work for a man who routinely demands that Clinton be locked up. And he has previously said that he thinks Clinton, not Trump, should be investigated.\n\nGiven Trump's displeasure with Jeff Sessions' recusal from overseeing the Russia probe, it's difficult to believe that Trump would nominate someone who isn't going to protect him from the consequences of that investigation. It's looking an awful lot like Barr is willing to do just that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's time in office has been defined by one catastrophe after another, and Americans are sick and tired of it.\n\nAfter two years defined by racism, incompetence, and cruelty, 56 percent of Americans say they will definitely not vote for Trump in 2020. In the same Washington Post poll, barely one in four Americans (28 percent) say they will definitely vote for Trump on 2020.\n\nIt's not hard to understand why most Americans want to get rid of him. A majority thinks he is untrustworthy (61 percent), a weak leader (51 percent), and lacks the temperament for the job (58 percent). Most think he makes the wrong decisions for the country (64 percent) and say he's a failure as a dealmaker (58 percent).\n\nAmericans don't just disapprove of his demeanor; they're displeased with his policies too. For example, 56 percent of Americans think Trump has done a poor job helping the middle class. Trump's primary accomplishment in this area is the Republican tax scam passed in 2017 that showered Wall Street billionaires with massive tax giveaways while leaving middle-class families out in the cold.\n\nFormer Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) was mocked and ridiculed when he bragged about a secretary receiving a measly $1.50 per week more from the tax scam, while at the same time big banks are raking in record profits.\n\nWhen it comes to improving the health care system, a majority of Americans \u2014 62 percent \u2014 think Trump has done a miserable job there too. During the 2016 campaign, he vowed to reduced the cost of health care and make sure more people could afford health insurance.\n\nOnce in his office, he championed the Republican bill to gut Obamacare, threatening to take health care away from more than 20 million people, including ripping away protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions like asthma and cancer. While the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare failed, Trump has actively tried to weaken and undermine it.\n\nMost recently, Trump shut down the government for a record 35 days, over a border wall most people don't want, inflicting massive damage and cost on the country. Around 800,000 federal employees suffered without pay for more than a month, all because of Trump's temper tantrum on an unpopular wall. Thousands of federal employees visited food banks and soup kitchens in order to feed themselves, yet Trump is still contemplating shutting down the government again in three weeks. The pain he inflicted on families is immeasurable, but the cost to the country came to a whopping $11 billion.\n\nTrump's tenure in the White House has been nothing but a disaster. As Americans are regularly exposed to the unpalatable combination of cruelty and unfairness, a solid majority are already saying they will reject him in 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Americans across the country swarmed the polling places to reject the Trump agenda and put Nancy Pelosi back in her rightful place as speaker of the House. As Trump continues to grossly mismanage the country, Americans are looking to rid themselves of him in 2020.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's dangerous anti-science agenda may very well be his longest-lasting legacy.\n\nSince the day Trump took office, his administration \u2014 with the help of Republicans in Congress \u2014 has waged war on science, prioritizing industry interests instead of evidence and putting their right-wing agenda ahead of the public good.\n\nNow, public health experts and former government officials who have worked in both Republican and Democratic administrations are warning that this pattern of putting politics ahead of science is endangering the health and safety of Americans in ways that have never been seen before, with consequences that could last far into the future.\n\n\"It's as egregious as I've ever seen it, starting from the very top with the president just denying the existence of science, manipulating the system on behalf of special interests,\" former surgeon general Richard Carmona told the Guardian.\n\nWhile the Trump administration's hostility toward climate science has often taken center stage (for good reason), this has allowed other anti-science policies \u2014 and their devastating human impact \u2014 to go unnoticed.\n\nFor example, the administration dismissed evidence showing that healthier school lunch standards established during the Obama administration were not only effective in encouraging kids to eat healthier foods but could prevent nearly 2 million cases of childhood obesity over the next decade.\n\nIn December, the Department of Agriculture rolled back the healthier lunch standards, which had required schools to serve meals with more whole grains, less salt, and nonfat milk.\n\nThe consequences of the decision could affect children for the rest of their lives. Research shows that whole grains help children concentrate better in school, and also contribute to healthy weight maintenance. In contrast, refined grains can cause people to overeat and promote weight gain, leading to an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease.\n\nWith more than half of the U.S. schoolchildren on track to be obese by age 35, the decision to roll back school lunch standards could put even more children at risk of obesity and associated diseases.\n\nIn another anti-science move, the Trump administration has cut funding for sex education and teen pregnancy prevention programs, replacing comprehensive evidence-based programs with ineffective abstinence-only education.\n\nWhile comprehensive sex education has been shown to promote healthy sexual behavior, reduce teen pregnancy, increase contraceptive use, and reduce sexually transmitted infection rates, the opposite is true for abstinence-only programs.\n\nCompared to teenagers who receive abstinence-only education, teens who receive comprehensive sex education are 60 percent less likely to get pregnant.\n\nIn fact, because abstinence-only education programs withhold critical information on safe sex and pregnancy prevention, they are associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behaviors, leading to higher rates of teen pregnancy and certain sexually transmitted infections.\n\nThat helps explain why states with abstinence-only education in schools have the highest rates of teen pregnancies \u2014 and the Trump administration's anti-science agenda will likely only make the problem worse.\n\nWhen it comes to sex education policies, \"The administration is really not using science,\" Sara Flowers, vice president of education for Planned Parenthood, told The Guardian. \"The administration is really using ideology, and those are very different.\"\n\nScientists also expressed alarm at the administration's decision to overturn a ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos, which was is associated with serious health problems and developmental delays in children, as well as sickness and even death among people of all ages.\n\nThe pesticide was set to be banned, but in March 2017, Trump's EPA reversed course and decided not to implement the ban. A short time later, the chemical was blamed for sickening nearly 50 farm workers in California.\n\nThe Guardian's report on the far-reaching consequences of the Trump administration's anti-science agenda comes just days after the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists published a report deeming 2018 to be a \"banner year in the war on science.\"\n\nIn a list highlighting the most egregious attacks on science by Trump and his GOP allies, the Bulletin pointed to trends such as the surge of anti-vaccine beliefs among Republican lawmakers (including Trump), as well as Trump's rejection of evidence documenting Hurricane Maria's death toll in Puerto Rico, which was estimated at 3,000 people \u2014 a number that stands in stark contrast to Trump's claim that less than a dozen people died.\n\nAmong the other attacks on science highlighted by the Bulletin were the administration's attempt to sabotage a U.N. resolution promoting global breastfeeding guidance, and an attempt by the Department of Health and Human Services to define transgender and intersex people out of existence.\n\nThese anti-science policies and positions are in line with Trump's agenda from the very beginning of his presidency.\n\nFor the past two years, the Trump administration has taken aim at science by undermining the role of evidence in public policy, cutting funding for vital programs, rolling back critical health and safety regulations, peddling pseudoscience and disinformation, and limiting public access to scientific information and data.\n\nThese actions not only pose an immediate threat to the health and safety of the American population, but also limit our ability to confront future challenges. Of all the reckless and destructive decisions Trump has made, his war on science may very well be his longest lasting legacy.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Congress may investigate Trump's tainted Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, for lying under oath.\n\nA Democratic member of the powerful House Judiciary Committee says there's \"no question\" alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh committed perjury by lying to Congress during his confirmation hearings last fall \u2014 and that the Judiciary Committee is \"likely to take that up.\"\n\n\"There's no question he [Kavanaugh] committed perjury during the confirmation hearings,\" Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO) said Friday in response to a question from a supporter about Kavanaugh.\n\nNeguse did not offer details about which statements from Kavanaugh were lies. But Kavanaugh has been accused of lying to Congress on many, many subjects \u2014 from trivial ones, like the meaning of certain inside jokes from high school, to serious ones, like whether he knew about or used stolen emails from Democrats during his time in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nTrump nominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018, and credible allegations of attempted rape and other sexual assaults soon followed. In a high-profile second confirmation hearing, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford described an incident when a drunk Kavanaugh forced himself on her and attempted to rape her. Both were in high school at the time.\n\nEven though Kavanaugh was belligerent and visibly unstable when he denied the allegations, a Republican Senate majority decided to place yet another man accused of criminal sexual activity, the second after Clarence Thomas, on the Supreme Court.\n\nBut allegations of perjury against Kavanaugh persisted. For example, Kavanaugh claimed he never drank alcohol to the point of blacking out. Several of his colleagues from college strongly disputed this claim. \"There\u2019s no problem with drinking beer in college,\" one said. \"The problem is lying about it.\"\n\nVox laid out several other instances where Kavanaugh seemed to, at a minimum, fail to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\nNeguse's comments about a possible congressional investigation line up with statements Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) made before the 2018 midterm elections. At the time, Nadler promised to open an investigation if Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives.\n\n\"It is not something we are eager to do,\" Nadler told the New York Times in October 2018. \"But the Senate having failed to do its proper constitutionally mandated job of advise and consent, we are going to have to do something to provide a check and balance, to protect the rule of law and to protect the legitimacy of one of our most important institutions.\"\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, voters across America elected a Democratic majority in order to hold Trump and his corrupt cronies accountable. An investigation into potential perjury by Brett Kavanaugh is exactly what that kind of accountability looks like.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump quietly rolled out the move on Sunday evening, apparently hoping that no one would notice his capitulation to Putin.\n\nThe Trump administration on Sunday quietly lifted sanctions on three businesses linked to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of Vladimir Putin who also has ties to former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.\n\nIt was a shockingly brazen move \u2014 and \"a big win for Putin,\" as one former U.S. ambassador to Russia put it.\n\nThe move to lift sanctions on three companies linked to one of Putin's closest allies came despite objections from lawmakers, who say the Trump administration is going too easy on Putin and his allies.\n\nThe sanctions had been imposed in April to punish Russia for malign activities, including its annexation of Crimea and continued aggression in Ukraine, its interference in the 2016 presidential election, and its support for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nDemocrats mounted an effort this month to stop Trump\u2019s Treasury Department from lifting sanctions on the Russian companies, but Republicans used their majority in the Senate to block the legislation. Only 11 Republicans were willing to vote against Trump\u2019s demands to ease up on Russia.\n\nUpon hearing the news, Russian state media literally laughed at the GOP's capitulation, saying the sanctions were only imposed in the first place to make Trump and the GOP look tough ahead of the midterms.\n\nTo make matters worse, despite the Treasury Department's claim that the sanctions were being lifted as part of a deal that would reduce Deripaska's control and ownership of the businesses, newly revealed confidential documents show that Deripaska and his allies will actually retain majority ownership of the holding company.\n\nAs a result, Deripaska is now in a position to wipe out hundreds of millions of dollars in debt that he would have otherwise had to repay \u2014 precisely the opposite of what the sanctions were supposed to achieve.\n\nThat may explain why Trump rolled out the sanctions on a Sunday evening, apparently hoping that no one would notice the huge gift he was handing to Putin, whose economy has been hit hard by U.S.-backed sanctions.\n\nBut the move didn't go unnoticed in Russia. According to The New York Times, Deripaska's companies celebrated Sunday when the sanctions were removed, with the main holding company calling it \"a turning point in this great company\u2019s fortunes.\"\n\nAnd it looks like Deripaska won't be the only one sharing in the riches: Immediately after the sanctions were officially lifted, one of Deripaska's companies announced that it was appointing seven new directors as part of its deal with the Treasury Department.\n\nIncluded among those new directors is a banker named Christopher Bancroft Burnham \u2014 who also happened to serve on Trump\u2019s transition team.\n\nAnd what did the U.S. get in exchange for this deal? Precisely nothing.\n\nNo wonder Russia is laughing.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Nancy Pelosi put Trump in his place last week, so naturally he took to Twitter to soothe his ego.\n\nLast Friday wasn't a great day for Trump. Yet another of his campaign advisers, Roger Stone, was indicted. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) forced him to cave on his ill-advised wall, leading hard-liners like Ann Coulter to slam him for being a wimp. So of course Trump was going to spend the weekend melting down.\n\nHe started by whining about how he didn't actually concede, and then rapidly descended into all-caps rhyming: BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL. He liked that one so much he tweeted it twice.\n\nThere was also a tweet with absurdly precise immigration numbers, saying that the one-day cost of undocumented immigrants was $603,331,392 and the year-to-date cost is $18,959,495,168. In the same tweet, he more than doubled America's population of undocumented immigrants, increasing it arbitrarily from 11 million to over 25 million. No one knows where he got those numbers.\n\nThen there were the inevitable tweets about all the people that should be prosecuted for lying: \"Comey, Brennan, Clapper, Lisa Page & lover, Baker and soooo many others? What about Hillary to FBI and her 33,000 deleted Emails? What about Lisa & Peter\u2019s deleted texts & Wiener's laptop?\" Eventually, he lost steam and just resorted to typing WITCH HUNT.\n\nHe also dipped back into an old favorite: voter fraud. \"Fox and Friends\" latched on to an assertion that 58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, and 95,000 non-citizens are registered to vote there \u2014 and Trump was clearly watching TV Sunday morning. Of course, by the time Fox was whipping Trump into a frenzy about it, it had already been debunked.\n\nBut by Sunday night, there was trouble in Trump-Fox paradise, with Trump getting mad at Fox's John Roberts and Gillian Turner for having \"even less understanding of the Wall negotiations than the folks at FAKE NEWS CNN & NBC!\"\n\nProving his overall pettiness, and major lack of compassion, Trump also went after journalists at the Huffington Post and BuzzFeed who had just lost their jobs.\n\nAnd then he closed out the weekend running down his \"accomplishments,\" complete with both his usual refrain about how he has done more than any president ever and a threat: \"does anybody really think I won't build the WALL?\"\n\nAs last week made clear, unless Nancy Pelosi wants that wall, Trump isn't getting it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "He profited off of them when it was convenient for him, and threw them under the bus when it wasn't.\n\nTrump has been demonizing Latin American immigrants and claiming they're bad for the economy ever since he started running for president. But as it turns out, Trump has also spent years personally benefiting from the labor of undocumented Latin American immigrants at his golf clubs.\n\nNow that his secret is out, the Washington Post reports at least one of Trump's golf clubs is suddenly scrambling to fire undocumented workers who have been loyal employees in good standing for years \u2014 even though their undocumented status was hardly a secret.\n\nThrough interviews and documents, the Post learned that about a dozen undocumented workers from Latin America were fired on Jan. 18 from the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, New York.\n\nMany had worked there for years, and said the firings felt like a shocking betrayal. One former maintenance worker from Mexico, Gabriel Sedano, told the Post that he started to cry after being fired from the job he'd held since 2005.\n\n\"I had worked almost 15 years for them in this club, and I'd given the best of myself to this job,\" Sedano said. \"I'd never done anything wrong, only work and work.\"\n\nMargarita Cruz, a housekeeping employee from Mexico who was fired after eight years, said her bosses had said \"absolutely nothing\" about her immigration status before suddenly firing her.\n\n\"They never said, 'Your Social Security number is bad' or 'Something is wrong,'\" Cruz said. \"Nothing. Nothing. Until right now.\"\n\nAnd according to one former manager of the club, the Trump Organization took a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach to hiring undocumented immigrants. They knew it was likely to happen, the former manager said, but they didn't care \u2014 all they cared about was getting \"the cheapest labor possible,\" and they thought they could get away with it because immigration raids seemed unlikely to happen at posh golf clubs.\n\nThis is the second Trump golf club to make the news for using undocumented labor. In December, the New York Times published a report featuring interviews with two women who said they'd worked at a Trump golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for years despite their undocumented status, and that they had other coworkers in similar situations.\n\nThe two reports from the two clubs have a lot in common. They both feature workers who had been loyal employees for many years \u2014 some of whom even had fond personal memories of Trump \u2014 but who felt betrayed by their employers and by Trump's vicious anti-immigration rhetoric.\n\nAnd both include credible allegations that the Trump Organization either knew or should have known that it was likely employing undocumented workers. Multiple workers even claimed that their supervisors actively helped or encouraged them to get better illegal paperwork to avoid detection.\n\nAnibal Romero, an attorney who organized the interviews between the Post and the fired New York golf club workers, told the Post that the Trump Organization has shown \"a pattern and practice of hiring undocumented immigrants, not only in New Jersey, but also in New York.\"\n\nTrump still owns the two clubs, along with 14 others worldwide, and his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. handle the day-to-day business concerns.\n\nIn a statement, Eric Trump tried to pretend that because the \"system is broken,\" the Trump Organization is now responsibly cracking down on something it had no reason to know about before. He also claimed that this debacle is one of the reasons \"my father is fighting so hard for immigration reform.\"\n\nIt's pretty rich to claim that Trump's insistence on causing the longest government shutdown in history over funding for an ineffective border wall counts as \"fighting\" for \"immigration reform\" \u2014 especially when Trump himself has made money off the same people he claims to want to keep out of the country.\n\nIf Trump really wanted to fight hard for immigration reform, he could easily have started in his own back yard. Instead, he chose to profit from the sweat of hard-working people when it suited him, and throw them under the bus when it didn't.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Some workers worried about homelessness while others could not provide asthma medication for their children. Celebrity chef Jose Andres tried to feed thousands of federal workers while others relied on food banks and soup kitchens.\n\nWhile families suffered, FBI agents warned about the national security threats caused by the shutdown, as well as noting decreased enforcement efforts against criminals such as sex traffickers and gang members. As the economy was on it's way to losing $3 billion, airline workers warned of unprecedented risks to air travel.\n\nThe Trump shutdown \"inflicted needless pain and chaos in the lives of millions of Americans, and stole billions of dollars from the economy,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said in a statement. \"Workers' financial security, families' well-being and America's economic strength all were senselessly sacrificed because of President Trump's callousness,\" she added.\n\nTrump initiated the government shutdown after demanding $5.6 billion for a border wall. He told Democratic leaders he would be proud to \"own\" the shutdown, and led the country into the longest government shutdown in history, lasting 35 days. In the end, Trump caved and signed a bill to reopen the government without receiving a single penny for the wall.\n\nIn a shocking statement, Trump's chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told \"Face the Nation\" that Trump was prepared to shut the government down again in mid-February if he doesn't get his way.\n\nTrump doesn't care who he hurts \u2014 or how much it costs \u2014 as he barrels forward with a singular obsession with a wall most Americans don't want.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's acting chief of staff says Trump is prepared to shut down the government again in mid-February.\n\nJust days after Trump caved and signed legislation ending the government shutdown, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney spent Sunday morning saying Trump is prepared to shut it down once again.\n\nHost Margaret Brennan asked Mulvaney, \"Is the president really prepared to shut down the government \u2014 again \u2014 in three weeks?\"\n\nMulvaney didn't flinch before he answered, \"Yes, I think he is.\"\n\n\"Keep in mind he's willing to do whatever it takes to secure the border,\" he added.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says \"um, yeah!\" Trump would shut down the government again in three weeks. pic.twitter.com/acn32Z65E2 \u2014 Matt Shuham (@mattshuham) January 27, 2019\n\nTrump shut down the government in late December after throwing a tantrum over funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump held the paychecks of federal employees hostage for more than a month, then finally caved and agreed to reopen the government on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's terms.\n\nBut the agreement only reopens the government for three weeks, during which time Congress will meet to discuss border security issues. Funding for several agencies expires on Feb. 15, and Mulvaney says Trump may once again engage in shutdown politics again at that time.\n\nPolls showed the public strongly disapproved of Trump's decision to shut down the government in December. Over the course of the shutdown, Trump's approval ratings plunged, and the public was significantly more supportive of Pelosi's handling of the situation, which included passing legislation to reopen the government.\n\nThroughout the process, congressional Republicans were too afraid to stand up to Trump and fund the government over his objections. Their cowardice led to the longest shutdown in history, with horrendous results. In addition to 800,000 unpaid federal workers, FBI agents warned about national security concerns and air travel was less safe. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the U.S. economy lost $3 billion because of the Trump shutdown.\n\nDespite the harm caused to families across the country, Mulvaney admits Trump is ready to go down the very same path in only three weeks. He is willing to take the very same federal employees \u2014 and the American economy \u2014 hostage yet again, all because of his unhealthy obsession with a border wall.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "In a wildly inappropriate move, Trump took a meeting with Justice Clarence Thomas' wife, Ginni Thomas. They even discussed issues that are soon to be before the Supreme Court.\n\nClarence Thomas' wife, Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, has long used her platform to spread hard-right views and even conspiracy theories. She doesn't just have the ear of her husband, though. She also gets private meetings with Trump to push her agenda.\n\nThe New York Times reported that last week Ginni Thomas got a group of ultra-conservative activists a meeting with Trump. The meeting was clearly a chance for her to push her hyper-partisan, hyper-bigoted agenda.\n\nOne person that attended the meeting used the time to say that women shouldn't serve in the military because they have smaller lung capacity and less muscle mass than men. Another said that gay marriage is wrecking the United States. The group also went after transgender people serving in the military.\n\nThe meeting was decidedly odd for other reasons. When the meeting opened, Thomas told the White House staff members in attendance that she didn't trust them. Thomas' group has some candidates they've picked for administration jobs, but they believe that the current White House staff is blocking those appointments.\n\nAlso, the meeting opened with a prayer, there was prayer by different members at different times during the meeting, and it was all apparently so bizarre that even Trump appeared \"taken aback.\"\n\nMeetings with Trump aren't the only place Ginni Thomas highlights her hard-right views: She's shared right-wing Facebook posts about the Parkland high school student gun control activists, alleging that some shadowy group is bankrolling the students; and she also posted about Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), who faces allegations he was aware of numerous reports of sexual assault when he coached wrestling at Ohio State, saying he was under attack because \"he threatens the elite.\"\n\nA meeting over whether transgender people should serve in the military is especially problematic given that the Supreme Court, a few days after Thomas and her group met with Trump, ruled on the transgender troop ban. Justice Clarence Thomas joined the conservative majority in allowing Trump's bigoted ban to go into effect while cases proceed through the lower courts.\n\nThere are no rules as to when Supreme Court justices must recuse themselves and remove themselves from hearing a case. Where his wife is concerned, Justice Thomas seems very disinclined to recuse. He didn't do so in Bush v. Gore, even though Ginni was collecting applications from people who wanted to work in the Bush administration if Bush won. He didn't do so in the Obamacare case, even though Ginni Thomas's group, Liberty Central, lobbied Congress to repeal the health care law.\n\nBoth Justice Thomas and Trump display a breathtaking disregard for ethics and norms, and now Ginni Thomas is able to exploit the failings of both of them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Women hate Trump more than ever, according to new polls.\n\nMost Americans think Trump is a lousy dealmaker who can't be trusted and doesn't understand the problems of ordinary people \u2014 and women especially think so.\n\nIn a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, only 35 percent of Americans said they are confident Trump can make the right decisions for the country's future, compared to 64 percent who disagree.\n\nMost of those who don't trust Trump really, really don't trust him. Almost half of Americans, 48 percent, say they have no confidence in Trump \"at all\" to do the right thing for the country, compared to about 30 percent who feel the same negative intensity about either Republicans or Democrats in Congress.\n\nMajorities of Americans also give Trump poor marks on specific leadership abilities, like having the right personality and temperament for the office, being honest and trustworthy, and understanding the problems of people like them.\n\nOf course, Trump isn't exactly known for being an even-tempered or empathetic person. But most Americans don't even think Trump is any good at the few things his supporters claim he excels at: bringing \"change\" to Washington and making political deals.\n\nBoth men and women hold these negative assessments of Trump. But there's also a huge gender gap between men, who are more evenly split on Trump, and women \u2014 who overwhelmingly can't stand him.\n\nMost women (55 percent) have a \"strongly\" unfavorable view of Trump in general, compared to 35 percent of men.\n\nWomen are also much less likely to give Trump credit for making political deals; just 25 percent say he's good at them, compared to 48 percent of men.\n\nAnother poll released on Friday found that Trump's current approval rating, 37 percent, is the worst of any president in the entire 72-year history of presidential approval polling.\n\nThis record is mostly driven by Trump's record-low 27 percent approval rating among women, compared to 49 percent approval among men.\n\nTrump got the worst marks from men on the question of basic empathy, or whether Trump \"understands your problems.\" Just 41 percent of men and 27 percent of women agreed with that statement.\n\nThe empathy question, ABC notes, \"can provide cushioning for a politician when the chips are down, as it did for Clinton and Barack Obama alike.\" But Trump doesn't have that cushion when he screws up in other ways.\n\nAnd not only has Trump screwed up spectacularly in every possible way during his first two years in office, his most recent government shutdown debacle might be his most spectacular screw-up yet.\n\nBy forcing the longest government shutdown in history over funding for his useless border wall, Trump caused unnecessary and self-inflicted damage to the economy and to the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nNo wonder Americans don't trust him.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The pro-Trump propagandists at Fox News have been busy constructing an alternate reality in which the indictment of a sixth Trump campaign adviser is secretly good news.\n\nOn Friday, Trump's longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone became the latest Trump associate to face charges in special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation into Russian interference and potential coordination with the Trump campaign.\n\nStone was indicted on seven counts, including one charge of obstructing Congress, five charges of making false statements, and one charge of witness tampering. His indictment makes him the sixth former Trump adviser who has been hit with criminal charges stemming from the Russia probe, five of whom have pleaded guilty.\n\nMost observers would consider this to be a pretty dire development \u2014 but not the folks at Fox News, who have spent the past three days desperately trying to make the case that Stone's indictment is secretly good news.\n\nDuring the network's first segment on the indictment, co-host Steve Doocy and national correspondent Ed Henry wrote off the seven counts as mere \"process crimes,\" and claimed that the indictment shows \"there is no Russia collusion, which is what the whole investigation was about.\"\n\nPro-Trump commentator and frequent Fox News guest Dan Bongino latched onto the \"process crime\" talking point, arguing that it was the Mueller investigation \u2014 not Stone's alleged criminal behavior \u2014 that \"produced the crime.\"\n\nBongino then offered up his own theory on the charges, suggesting \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that Mueller had rushed to produce the indictment to get ahead of bad news. That bad news, as it turned out, was a Fox News conspiracy theory about wrongdoing at the DOJ and FBI.\n\nOn a later segment, Bongino laughably asserted that Stone's indictment \"proves\" there is \"zero evidence\" of collusion, and accused Mueller of \"doing the country an enormous disservice\" by continuing the investigation until its completion.\n\nFox News guest and National Review columnist Andrew McCarthy parroted a similar line on Monday, arguing that Stone's indictment makes it clear that there was no collusion with Russia.\n\n\"If Trump and his campaign were in a criminal conspiracy of espionage with Russia, if they had colluded with Russia, why would the campaign have had to turn to Roger Stone to find out what WikiLeaks had?\" McCarthy asked, ignoring the fact that Stone is Trump's longtime adviser and was part of the campaign. \"They would've known that from Russia. They wouldn't have needed people like Roger Stone.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sean Hannity spent the weekend ranting about how unfair it was that Stone had been charged for criminal activity, calling his indictment and arrest \"the biggest abuse of power scandal in modern American history.\" He then echoed Bongino's ridiculous talking point about Mueller being responsible for Stone's behavior, saying, \"Robert Mueller started an investigation. This is, in other words, created by the fact that Mueller had an investigation.\"\n\nUnfortunately for the pro-Trump propagandists at Fox News, their alternate reality doesn't match up with the stone cold truth presented in the indictment.\n\nAmong other things, the charging document alleges that Trump\u2019s campaign asked Stone to act as an intermediary to contact WikiLeaks and solicit information about future releases of emails and other documents that were hacked by Russian intelligence agents for the purpose of damaging Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. According to the indictment, Stone agreed to the request \u2014 and then lied repeatedly to cover it up.\n\nDespite Fox News' attempts to brush off Stone's charges as mere \"process crimes,\" the indictment makes it clear that the alleged crimes were carried out with the goal of obstructing investigators so they couldn't find out the truth about the Trump campaign's response to and potential coordination with Russia's efforts to interfere in the election on behalf of Trump.\n\nAnd although Stone wasn't charged with conspiracy in this indictment, that's not an indication that the evidence for such charges doesn't exist. As former U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade explained, the indictment actually hints at more charges to come.\n\nGiven the language used in the charging document, McQuade says it appears that Mueller is still actively investigating coordination between the Trump campaign, WikiLeaks, and Russia.\n\nIn the second paragraph, the indictment makes note of the fact that the Democratic National Committee came out in June 2016 and \"publicly announced that it had been hacked by Russian government actors.\" The indictment also says that after WikiLeaks dropped some of the hacked DNC emails in July 2016, \"a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [WikiLeaks] had regarding the Clinton campaign.\"\n\n\"Together,\" McQuade writes, \"these two paragraphs allege that when this directive was made, the Trump campaign knew that WikiLeaks was working with Russia. It further suggests that the directive was made by a high-level official in the campaign. Who would have the authority to direct a senior Trump campaign official but an even more senior Trump campaign official, or even Trump himself?\"\n\nIf the allegation is true, any individuals who sought damaging information about Clinton could potentially face charges for violating campaign finance laws prohibiting the solicitation or receipt of a \"thing of value\" from a foreign national.\n\nMcQuade also points out that the indictment suggests there may be a basis for charging some Trump campaign associates with conspiracy to defraud the United States for their alleged participation in staging the release of stolen documents in an effort to influence the election.\n\nHacking and stealing emails are only part of the conspiracy, McQuade explains. Another part of the conspiracy involved exploiting the hacked emails to damage Clinton's campaign by coordinating messages about the content of those emails \u2014 for example, by pushing disinformation about Clinton's health.\n\n\"Any Trump campaign members or associates who knowingly helped to coordinate the timing or messaging around the release of the emails could be guilty as co-conspirators,\" McQuade says.\n\nFinally, the latest indictment \u2014 along with the Cohen sentencing memo filed in December \u2014 shows that Mueller is aggressively pursuing Trump associates who may have lied to Congress. If he finds evidence that anyone perjured themselves while testifying about substantive matter, McQuade writes, \"you can expect charges to follow.\"\n\nWith the future of Trump's presidency at stake, Fox News is doing what it does best: desperately trying to construct an alternate reality into which Trump can escape because the world outside of the bubble is too much for him to handle. While that may provide some short term reprieve, it's only going to make things harder for Trump when that bubble pops and forces him to confront the reality that Fox News is not reality.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy defended Trump's tantrums and table-slapping over the shutdown as 'reasonable.'\n\nBy any objective standard, Trump's behavior during the longest government shutdown in history was erratic and childish. But House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) recently had the gall to defend Trump as \"reasonable\" during a weekend interview with Chuck Todd on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nWhen asked if Trump would be willing to make a compromise with Democrats in order to get funding for an unpopular border wall, McCarthy said Trump \"is the only one who has been reasonable in these negotiations.\"\n\nBut all available evidence shows Trump has been far from reasonable in any negotiations.\n\nThe entire shutdown began when Trump, egged on by far-right conservative media personalities, threw a tantrum demanding over $5 billion for his border wall. In a televised meeting with Democratic leaders, Trump boasted that he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government unless Democrats paid his ransom.\n\nWhen Democratic leaders balked at being bullied into funding a wall no one wants, Trump went ahead and shut down the government.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, in one of her first acts as leader of the Democratic House majority, passed legislation to reopen the government. Pelosi's stance, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, was simple: Democrats would engage in negotiations on border security once the Trump shutdown was over.\n\nThen, for more than 30 days, Republicans held the paychecks of 800,000 federal workers hostage, voting against every single bill to reopen the government. And at the same time, a very unreasonable Trump threatened to veto those funding bills should they pass.\n\nIn a mid-January meeting with congressional leaders, an angry Trump slammed his hands on the table and stormed off before talks could be completed.\n\nLater, when Pelosi politely requested Trump think about postponing the State of the Union until after the shutdown ended, Trump lashed out at her. In a move that imperiled Pelosi's safety and the safety of American troops and allies, the Trump White House leaked details about a trip Pelosi and members of Congress were planning to take to Afghanistan to visit military leaders.\n\nFinally, in a desperate attempt to end the shutdown on his terms, Trump pushed a sham proposal to temporarily extend legal protections for Dreamers \u2014 protections he himself rolled back \u2014 in return for funding for a border wall and unconscionably cruel changes to the immigration system. The bill was roundly rejected.\n\nIn the end, Trump caved and agreed to Pelosi's terms to end the shutdown and reopen the government, at least temporarily.\n\nMcCarthy cannot rewrite the history we all watched unfold before our very eyes. Trump's tantrums and hissy fits harmed America, endangered our security, and wreaked havoc on the economy.\n\nThere was nothing reasonable about that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's campaign and transition teams had extensive contact with Russian officials \u2014 and they lied about it every single time.\n\nA new analysis reveals that members of Trump's campaign and transition teams had more than 100 contacts with officials linked to the Russian government, despite two years of constant denials from Trump's team that these conversations and meetings ever happened.\n\nAt least 28 high-level campaign officials and Trump advisers knew of these contacts \u2014 and not one was ever reported to the authorities. Instead, the new analysis notes, \"the Trump team tried to cover up every single one of them.\"\n\nUsing publicly available court documents and news reports, researchers at the Center for American Progress (CAP) counted the number of known contacts between the Trump team and Russian operatives. Many of the operatives had close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and other politicians, and some were officials linked to Russian intelligence services and state-run banks.\n\nWith the news this week that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former campaign aide Rick Gates shared polling data with Russian operative Konstantin Kilimnik, the total number of contacts now stands at 101, according to the CAP analysis.\n\nThe 101 contacts include face-to-face meetings, phone calls, text messages, emails, and video chats. To come up with that number, researchers counted each meeting and communication as a separate contact, but omitted many contacts in which intermediaries stood in for members of Trump's team.\n\nThe total number of contacts they counted is considered to be a conservative estimate, the report says \u2014 so the actual number could be much higher.\n\nContacts between Trump's team and Russian officials included 28 meetings, starting in November 2015. The contacts continued through January 2017 \u2014 the month that Trump took office.\n\nMembers of the Trump team who had contacts with Russia during the campaign or transition include, but are not limited to, Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, former Trump adviser Roger Stone, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates, former Trump campaign advisers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner are among the other members of Trump's team who had contacts with Russian officials during the campaign and/or transition period.\n\nFor two and a half years, however, Trump and his associates have denied these contacts and lied to keep them hidden.\n\nLooking only at the 13 months after the infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, the Trump team denied having any involvement with Russia at least 20 times.\n\nDuring the height of the presidential campaign in July 2016, Paul Manafort called it \"absurd\" when he was asked if there were \"any ties between Mr. Trump, you or your campaign and Putin and his regime.\" He went on to flatly deny having any ties to Russia, saying \"there\u2019s no basis to it.\"\n\nThat same month, Trump claimed it was a \"conspiracy theory\" to suggest that Russia was trying to help him win the election, adding, \"I have nothing to do with Russia. I don\u2019t have any jobs in Russia. I\u2019m all over the world but we\u2019re not involved in Russia.\"\n\nHe repeated that blanket denial at an October 2016 campaign rally, telling the crowd, \"I have nothing to do with Russia, folks, I\u2019ll give you a written statement.\"\n\nThe following month, Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks claimed that \"there was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.\" A short time later, Kellyanne Conway suggested that it was \"dangerous\" to state that the campaign had contact with Russians who were trying to influence the election.\n\nTrump continued his denials as he prepared to take office, often using Twitter to broadcast his lies. Just days before his inauguration, Trump wrote an all-caps tweet declaring, \"I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\"\n\nA few months later, he issued nearly the same denial, saying, \"I have nothing to with Russia ... no loans, no nothing.\"\n\nEven with all of the evidence that has been revealed publicly, Trump still denies reports of contacts between his associates and Russian officials. Just last month, he blasted the Russia investigation in a tweet and once again denied any wrongdoing related to Russia.\n\n\"AFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30,000,000), NO COLLUSION!\" he tweeted.\n\nBut unfortunately for Trump, most Americans don't believe him. According to a December 2018 poll, nearly 60 percent of Americans express little or no trust in Trump's denials. In contrast, most Americans (53 percent) say they have a lot or some trust in special counsel Robert Mueller to be fair and accurate.\n\nThe CAP analysis shows that Americans are right not to believe Trump. No matter how many times he tries to deny it, the evidence clearly shows that not only did members at every level of his campaign have extensive contact with Russia \u2014 they also lied about it every time.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The rejection was overruled in a seriously sketchy fashion.\n\nTrump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, holds a top-secret security clearance, which lets him access highly sensitive national security material. He shouldn't hold that clearance. In fact, NBC News reports, career security officials initially rejected his application \u2014 but they got overruled by someone hand-picked by Trump.\n\nMuch like his father-in-law, one of the concerns with Kushner is whether foreign governments have influence over him, given his financial dealings and other issues. Because Kushner's FBI background check highlighted those concerns, two career security specialists rejected Kushner's application for top-secret clearance.\n\nIn this administration, however, national security comes second to Trump's family getting access to power and state secrets, so the security specialists were overruled.\n\nInstead, Carl Kline, who Trump appointed as director of the personnel security office, overruled the rejection and granted the clearance.\n\nKushner isn't the only one who benefited from Kline's lax view of national security. Before Kline took office, career security officials had been overruled only once in the previous three years. But Kline has already overruled career experts in at least 30 cases \u2014 granting top-secret clearances to White House employees even though there was unfavorable information about those people.\n\nKushner also applied for an even higher-level clearance than top-secret, NBC reports, but the CIA rejected that out of hand. After reviewing Kushner's file, sources told NBC, CIA officials \"balked\" \u2014 and one called over to the White House security division to ask how Kushner even got even a top-secret clearance in the first place.\n\nThe GOP has been protecting Kushner for a long time. When Republicans were still in control of the House, they blocked a bill that would have prohibited security clearances for anyone in the Executive Office of the President who was under a criminal investigation. This was shortly after it had been reported that the FBI was investigating Kushner as part of the Russia probe.\n\nIt was just two days ago that Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the chair of the House Oversight Committee, said he was going to take an in-depth look into the security clearance process at the White House, noting that the Trump administration and transition team had engaged in \"grave breaches of national security.\"\n\nIn light of Thursday's news, Cummings issued a statement saying that his investigation \"explicitly covers\" Kushner, and that the security clearance system is supposed to be non-partisan rather than \"an ad hoc approach that overrules career experts to give the President\u2019s family members access to our nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets.\"\n\nThis feels very similar to what happened with Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. There, a senior Department of Justice (DOJ) ethics official found that Whitaker should recuse himself from overseeing Robert Mueller's investigation to avoid the appearance of a conflict. But partisan political advisers to Whitaker overruled that, and Whitaker did not step aside.\n\nThis administration is rife with conflicts of interest, security breaches, and more. But now, the Democrats control the House \u2014 which means that Trump and his family can no longer count on oversight committees to look the other way.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "As Trump and his right-wing media allies seized on the Covington teen controversy, Russian propaganda outlets followed in their footsteps.\n\nThe racist incident involving a group of white students from Covington Catholic High School surrounding and taunting a Native American elder in Washington, D.C., last weekend has officially become the latest battle in America's culture war.\n\nDays after the initial viral video surfaced, the story is still making headlines, with one narrative spreading in mainstream media outlets, and an alternative reality being peddled by right-wing outlets and figures like Gateway Pundit, Fox News, Sean Hannity, and Tucker Carlson.\n\nNaturally, Trump was happy to amplify the narrative being spun by the right, which portrayed the MAGA hat-wearing students as the victims of a biased, left-wing media mob \u2014 just innocent teenage boys caught in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and then unjustly accused of racism.\n\nBut Trump and his right-wing allies weren't the only ones who seized on the incident.\n\nRussian state-sponsored propaganda outlets like RT and Sputnik were also hard at work, churning out multiple stories a day with sensational headlines emphasizing violence, media bias, and the divide around racism in America.\n\n\"Breaking the silence: Trump blasts media for pouncing on 'MAGA boys,'\" read one headline by RT, a state propaganda outlet formerly known as Russia Today.\n\n\"'MAGA kids go into the woodchipper': Disney producer tweets violent threat against Covington boys,\" declared another headline by RT.\n\nNotably, the pro-Trump website Gateway Pundit blasted nearly the exact same headline, writing, \"Hollywood Producer Calls For the Murder of Covington Catholic Kids: 'Go Screaming \u2013 Into the WOODCHIPPER.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, another RT headline focused on the apparent \"death, arson & bomb threats\" that the school received after the incident.\n\nThe overlap between right-wing media and Russian propaganda channels was hard to miss. Sputnik News, another state-sponsored propaganda outlet, followed the lead of networks like Fox News, portraying the students as \"falsely accused\" and pushing a narrative that blamed the press for rushing to judgment before the \"real story\" was revealed.\n\nIn the ultimate moment of irony, pro-Trump commentator and former CNN contributor Scottie Nell Hughes, who now works for RT, appeared on the Russian propaganda outlet to blast \"the shoddy, partisan media for spreading fake news about the youths and suppressing the truth about the encounter.\"\n\nThe incident made perfect fodder for Russia's propaganda machine \u2014 and in this case, as in many others, the messaging came straight from Trump and his right-wing allies, who often find themselves in the position of aiding the Kremlin's attempt to undermine U.S. society through information warfare.\n\nAs former Army officer, FBI special agent, and counterterrorism expert Clint Watts has warned, the goals of Russia's information war against America go far beyond influencing an election or propping up certain candidates.\n\nThe broader and much more corrosive goal is to disrupt U.S. democracy and divide our society by exacerbating existing divisions in U.S. society \u2014 often, the very same divisions that Trump seizes upon and amplifies.\n\nUltimately, Russia seeks \"to undermine democracy, to make Americans lose confidence in democratic institutions and elected officials by turning every crack in our country into a chasm and pitting different race, ethnic groups, religious groups, socioeconomic groups, Second Amendment, abortion rights, whatever it might be where we fight, instead of being a unified front against them,\" Watts told PBS in June 2018.\n\n\"The biggest challenge we face moving forward isn't the Russians,\" Watts warned. \"It's really other Americans who see this technique and see the political gain that can come from it and adopt it on their own, meaning they come up with their own news outlets which maybe aren't telling the truth, but tell a truth that is preferred.\"\n\nThis is exactly what happened in the days following the Covington incident, as Trump and his preferred media outlets told their own version of the story, spinning the \"facts\" into a narrative they wanted to tell \u2014 one in which the MAGA hat-wearing teens were the real victims of a biased media that collectively \"rushed to judgment\" because the students were Trump supporters.\n\nIn the right-wing echo chamber, the same few talking points were repeated relentlessly, with the ultimate effect of discrediting objective sources of information and encouraging people to distrust not only the media but their own eyes.\n\nThe Daily Signal even used the controversy to call into question the very notion of American democracy.\n\nIn order to push their narrative and avoid confronting reasonable evidence that conflicted with their version of events, right-wing media sources resorted to one of their favorite tactics: finding the most extreme examples of bad behavior on the other side, amplifying them, and disingenuously portraying them as representative of \"the left\" as a whole.\n\nWhen a few isolated Twitter users called for violence or outing the teens' personal information, right-wing media homed in on them, presenting them as if they reflected a widespread pattern.\n\nAs seen in the coverage by Russian propaganda outlets, these extreme examples were seized upon, weaponized, and used as proof of the decline of American society.\n\nAnd this is far from the first time we've seen such close alignment between Trump, his media allies, and Russia's propaganda machine. Whether he's undermining the intelligence community and attacking special counsel Robert Mueller, demonizing immigrants and refugees, exploiting racial animosity, or peddling Islamophobic messages, Trump's talking points consistently advance the Kremlin's agenda.\n\nUltimately, Russia's information war against America is succeeding not because of its sophistication, but because it found an accomplice in the White House \u2014 and an entire right-wing media ecosystem that is willing to wage war from the inside.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Friday's indictment of Roger Stone contains clues that may have serious implications for Steve Bannon and the right-wing website Breitbart.\n\nFriday's indictment of longtime Trump ally Roger Stone by special counsel Robert Mueller's office could spell major trouble for Steve Bannon, Trump's former campaign CEO and White House chief strategist, as well as Breitbart News, the right-wing news outlet Bannon led from 2012-2018.\n\nIt has been previously reported that the FBI was scrutinizing conservative websites, including Breitbart News and InfoWars, to determine whether they may have assisted Russia's cyber influence operation during the 2016 campaign.\n\nMore recently, in November 2018, the Washington Post reported that special counsel Robert Mueller's team had interviewed Bannon about Stone \u2014 specifically, whether Stone had privately admitted to knowing in advance about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nFriday's indictment sheds new light on those previous reports \u2014 and gives new reason for Bannon and Breitbart staff to be worried about the Russia investigation, given their inclusion in an indictment that essentially lays out the case for collusion.\n\nPart of the FBI's broader investigation into collusion is about whether anyone associated with the Trump campaign assisted or coordinated with Russia as it carried out an influence operation aimed at boosting Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton. The Wikileaks email dump was a key part of that influence operation.\n\nAnd the new Mueller indictment \u2014 which charges Stone with crimes including obstruction of an official proceeding, making false statements, and witness tampering \u2014 includes the text of emails that feature both Bannon and a Breitbart reporter asking Stone if he had any inside information from Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Stone received an email from \"a reporter with connections to a high-ranking Trump campaign official\" on or about Oct. 3, 2016.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the reporter wanted to know about the content of hacked emails that were in the possession of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. In the email to Stone, the reporter allegedly referred to Assange, asking, \"what\u2019s he got? Hope it\u2019s good.\"\n\nStone responded \"It is,\" then said he had been trying to get in touch with the \"high-ranking Trump campaign official,\" but that the official hadn't returned his calls.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the \"high-ranking Trump campaign official\" reached out to Stone the next day (Oct. 4, 2016) and asked him about the \"status of future releases\" from WikiLeaks.\n\nWhile they remain nameless in the indictment, the identities of the \"high-ranking campaign official\" and the reporter connected to him can be gleaned from a series of emails published by the New York Times in November 2018.\n\nBased on the information in that email chain, Bannon was the Trump campaign official who turned to Stone hoping to get the inside scoop on what Assange had. The reporter who said he hoped it was something \"good\" was Breitbart\u2019s Washington editor, Matthew Boyle.\n\nBannon was the head of Breitbart before joining the Trump campaign, and returned to his role after leaving the White House. He stepped down from his position at Breitbart in 2018.\n\nThe specific wording of the emails mentioned in Friday's indictment lines up verbatim with the emails released by the Times in November, as do the dates of the emails and the relationships of those in the email chain.\n\nStone had allegedly been trying to get in touch with Bannon to speak to him about upcoming WikiLeaks releases, including the Oct. 7, 2016 release of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails.\n\nThe emails released by The Times show Boyle encouraging Bannon to call Stone on Oct. 4, 2016, writing, \"Well clearly [Stone] knows what Assange has. I\u2019d say that\u2019s important.\"\n\nAccording to both the emails released by The Times and the information in the indictment, Bannon emailed Stone on Oct. 4, 2016, after Assange held a press conference announcing his intent for future document leaks related to the Clinton campaign, but did not actually drop any new documents.\n\nApparently anxious to know if and what Assange planned to release in the near future, Bannon allegedly reached out to Stone, who allegedly assured Bannon that WikiLeaks would release \"a load every week going forward.\"\n\nStone, it seems, was viewed by members of the Trump campaign as having a direct line to Assange.\n\nAs noted by the Times, \"The emails show how closely intertwined Breitbart News and the campaign were and how people in Mr. Bannon\u2019s orbit saw Mr. Stone as a direct link to WikiLeaks.\"\n\nBased on today's indictment, we now know that Mueller's team also saw Stone as a direct link to Assange and WikiLeaks.\n\nAnd given the names mentioned in the indictment, it seems Mueller may also be interested in why the CEO of Trump's campaign was reaching out for information about hacked emails, and why the editor of the right-wing publication he headed appears to have been involved in the effort to coordinate with Stone and WikiLeaks.\n\nIn addition to communicating generally about future WikiLeaks releases, the emails released by The Times show an apparent effort to coordinate messaging, as well as a discussion about a \"targeted\" campaign that Stone said he raised money for using a political organization structured to keep its donors secret.\n\nIn the final email sent from Stone on Oct. 4, 2016, he told Bannon to direct Trump campaign surrogates to spread his conspiracy theory alleging, without evidence, that Bill Clinton had a love child named Danney Williams. At the time, websites including InfoWars and Russian propaganda outlet RT were pushing the conspiracy theory referenced by Stone.\n\nStone also directed Bannon to \"tell Rebecca [Mercer] to send us some $$$,\" mentioning that he had developed a \"targeted black digital campaign.\"\n\nAccording to The Times, Stone was referring to Rebekah Mercer, the daughter of billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, who co-founded the now-defunct data firm Cambridge Analytica with Bannon.\n\nDuring his time working with Cambridge Analytica, Bannon reportedly oversaw efforts to develop targeted messaging to suppress black voters \u2014 a potential explanation for Stone's reference to having developed a digital campaign targeting black voters.\n\nWhile Friday's indictment doesn't allege any wrongdoing on the part of Bannon, Breitbart, or Boyle, it does show that Mueller is aware that they were apparently involved in efforts to obtain information about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked Clinton campaign emails \u2014 and potentially to coordinate the Trump campaign's messaging so it would align with the document dumps.\n\nThe involvement of a Breitbart editor also calls into question whether the media outlet coordinated with the Trump campaign to unofficially push out campaign messages.\n\nSuch coordination is among the issues that the FBI is reportedly investigating in its probe of whether right-wing outlets in America and/or Russian propaganda outlets were involved in Russia's campaign to influence the election by strategically pushing disinformation aimed at hurting Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Those stories got amplified by fringe elements of our media like Breitbart,\" said Mike Carpenter, a former senior Pentagon official who served during the Obama administration.\n\n\"They very carefully timed release of information to shift the news cycle away from stories that clearly hurt Mr. Trump, such as his inappropriate conduct over the years,\" he said in reference to the October 7, 2016 release of the infamous Access Hollywood video.\n\nThat incident corresponded with the release of the Podesta emails, which were leaked by WikiLeaks on Oct. 7, 2016, as well as with a surge in bot activity pushing anti-Clinton stories.\n\nOnly time will tell if Bannon and Breitbart were involved in these efforts. But Friday's indictment is a sure sign that Mueller is looking \u2014 and based on the fate of other Trump campaign associates who have come under Mueller's microscope, that's not a good place to be.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The arrest of top Trump henchman Roger Stone prompted congressional condemnation and a push for more investigation.\n\nThe indictment of longtime Trump adviser and confidant Roger Stone has prompted a round of condemnation of Trump's embrace of criminality from Congress. Senators and members of Congress also noted the vindication of the Mueller probe and the need to protect the investigation from interference from Trump.\n\nThe indictment again brought to the fore ongoing concerns about how election outcomes and results were tampered with, thanks to outside Russian interference enabled by the Trump campaign.\n\n\"It is very interesting to see the kinds of people that the president of the United States has surrounded himself with,\" said Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). \"This connection to the very integrity of our elections is obviously something we have to get the truth about.\"\n\nThe indictment lays out a timeline during the 2016 presidential campaign in which Stone was the go-between for the Trump campaign and Wikileaks. At the time, Wikileaks was releasing emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee by Russian operatives.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC, \"At the very time that then-candidate Trump was publicly encouraging Russia's help in acquiring Clinton-related emails, his campaign was privately receiving information about the planned release of stolen Clinton emails.\"\n\nThe arrest also points directly at Trump, an avenue Congress will pursue.\n\n\"Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn... What did the President know and when did he know it?\" asked Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) said he \"look[s] forward\" to working with Nadler on the Judiciary Committee to find the answers to what Trump knew and when.\n\n\"This witch hunt sure has turned up a lot of witches,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). Trump has often claimed, without evidence, that the investigation into his campaign is a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe indictment indicates that Stone lied when he testified before the House Intelligence Committee. Committee member Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) took note of the deception and said, \"You have to be straight with Congress. He wasn\u2019t. And he's paying the price now. And I suspect he won't be the last.\"\n\nMembers of Congress also indicated that the arrest continues to vindicate special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which has secured a series of convictions and guilty pleas from Trump insiders.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said the Stone indictment \"shows Mueller\u2019s investigation as active & ongoing as ever & with more to be done before any report.\"\n\n\"Today is another stark reminder that Special Counsel Robert Mueller must be allowed to complete his job without any political interference,\" said Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). \"Legislation must be brought to the Senate floor immediately to protect his investigation.\"\n\nRepublicans have refused to pass legislation that would protect Mueller from possible removal by Trump.\n\nRep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) asked, \"If there's nothing to hide, why do so many people from the @realDonaldTrump campaign & administration keep doing it? What are they covering up? Who are they lying for?\"\n\nFBI agents are currently unpaid thanks to the Trump shutdown, which Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) noted in her reply to the Stone indictment: \"Thanks to the FBI for doing their jobs even though they aren\u2019t getting paid.\"\n\nRepublicans in Congress gave Trump a pass on the atmosphere of criminality and corruption that he surrounded himself with. Voters in 2018 responded by putting Democrats in charge of the House. The indictment of Stone and their reaction shows that Trump's free pass has now been revoked.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

These are just some of the new members of the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nAfter two years of a complicit GOP majority covering up all manner of corruption, Trump's worst nightmare was just made real. Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a slew of high-profile freshmen representatives who will be on the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee, the main investigative committee in Congress \u2014 and they're set to hold Trump accountable.\n\nThe new freshman members on the committee include Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Katie Hill (D-CA), Ayanna Presley (D-MA), and Harley Rouda (D-CA). The all-star additions highlight House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's fearless approach to confronting Trump.\n\n\"If you're Pelosi, this is not the crew you put on the committee with subpoena power if you a) intend to play nice with Trump or b) care what conservatives think,\" Sahil Kapur, a Bloomberg political reporter, said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has become an obsession of some conservatives even as she uses social media to regularly skewer her critics. She is an outspoken progressive, and has already used her Twitter account to warn Donald Trump Jr. about the perils of trolling \"a member of a body that will have subpoena power.\"\n\nTlaib made waves when she enthusiastically embraced the idea of impeaching Trump at a gathering with supporters, saying she wanted to \"impeach the motherfucker.\" While the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over impeachment proceedings, Tlaib will join her colleagues in investigations into Trump's corrupt administration.\n\nHill, who ousted a Trump lackey congressman in the Los Angeles suburbs, is such a rising star that she gave a high-profile weekly Democratic address before she was sworn in as a member of Congress. Regarding her appointment to Oversight, Hill said in a statement that \"we desperately need accountability\" if the government is going to function properly.\n\n\"I want people to be aggressive, especially on that committee,\" Rep. Dan Kilde (D-MI), a member of the Democratic steering team that helped decide what members serve on the various committees, told Politico. \"It's good to have people who aren't afraid,\" he added, noting, \"They're going to be dealing with some pretty important stuff.\"\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chair of the Oversight Committee, is already preparing for several high-profile investigations. Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, is scheduled to publicly testify in early February. And Cummings recently announced that his committee is looking into possible national security breaches by the Trump administration.\n\nIn a statement welcoming the new members, Cummings reiterated the goals of the committee in light of the 2018 midterm election. \"Our Committee is the primary investigative body in Congress,\" he said, \"and we will address the issues that affect the American people every day while we root out waste, fraud, and abuse.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has spent two years getting away with all kinds of fraud and abuse of power. But led by Cummings, and joined by some of the most dynamic new members of Congress, the House Oversight Committee is poised to bring accountability back to Washington.\n\nAnd we can't wait to see it happen.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump gave in to what Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have demanded all along: ending the government shutdown before even beginning negotiations on border wall funding.\n\nA defeated Trump announced Friday afternoon that he will support a bill to temporarily end his weeks-long, unpopular government shutdown, without funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nDespite his earlier bravado in vowing not to \"cave\" on the wall funding, Trump finally did exactly that \u2014 and did exactly what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told him to do, which was to stop holding government funding hostage to his wall.\n\n\"We have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government,\" Trump said in a Rose Garden press conference.\n\nHe added that \"at this time,\" he will not exercise the \"powerful alternative\" that he was rumored to be considering. He was likely referring to the speculation that he might declare a national emergency \u2014 and even steal funds from disaster areas like Puerto Rico \u2014 in order to fund the wall without the consent of Congress.\n\nUnable to stop himself, Trump also rambled for several minutes about the alleged importance of the border wall, which will not receive any funding in this legislation and which has been strongly rejected by both Congress and the majority of Americans. Even the anti-immigrant hate groups who usually egg Trump on have complained that his wall is a stupid idea.\n\nThe deal will reopen the government for three weeks as the White House and congressional leaders continue to negotiate on border security and other issues. If approved by Congress, this deal will end the longest government shutdown in history.\n\nPrior to the Rose Garden announcement, even Fox News admitted: \"It's difficult to see this as anything but the president giving in to Democrats on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nThe deal comes one day after Republican senators sided with Trump and rejected a House-passed bill to reopen the government.\n\nThe Trump shutdown started in late December when Trump threw a tantrum demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall. In a televised meeting shortly before the shutdown began, Trump told Democratic leaders he would be \"proud\" to own a shutdown if Democrats refused to give in to his ransom demands.\n\nAs the Trump shutdown dragged on, its impact became increasingly dire. Air travel has become less safe, federal workers have been denied their paychecks, and national security has been weakened \u2014 all because of Trump's unhealthy obsession with a border wall.\n\nBut under the unwavering leadership of Pelosi, Democrats refused to be bullied by Trump's increasingly unhinged bluster. The Democratic-led House of Representatives passed numerous bills to reopen the government, only to be rebuffed by Trump and his obedient lackeys in the Senate.\n\nThe position from Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was consistent from the start: End the Trump shutdown with a clean funding bill, and only then will Congress engage in negotiations about border security.\n\nAt the end of his remarks, Trump once again threatened to take federal workers hostage and shut down the government in three weeks if he does not get the border wall he so desperately wants.\n\nBut if he does, he'll have to face Pelosi and Democrats again \u2014 and it probably won't end well for him.\n\nIn addition to maintaining a firm stance against funding for a wall, Pelosi engaged in a high-stakes negotiation around Trump's State of the Union address. Pelosi threatened to deny Trump use of the House chamber for the address while the government was shut down. Trump tried to force himself on Congress anyway, but then Pelosi made the denial official \u2014 and Trump relented, foreshadowing his caving on the shutdown.\n\nThe American people had much more confidence in Pelosi to handle the shutdown than Trump's \u2014 and in the end, they picked the right person to trust.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Special counsel Robert Mueller is closing in, and Trump is freaking out.\n\nAn unhinged Trump finally made his first statement after his close adviser, Roger Stone, was indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller, and it was a doozy.\n\nTrump unleashed a torrent of anger in a single tweet, exposing his deep-seated insecurity as the Mueller investigation closes in on the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia.\n\n\"Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION!\" Trump tweeted. \"Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better. Who alerted CNN to be there?\"\n\nWhile those surrounding Trump may not be witches, they are certainly criminals. And thus far, Stone is the 34th person Mueller indicted, and the sixth person with close, direct ties to Trump himself. So in a sense, Trump is correct \u2014 Mueller is running a great investigation into corruption.\n\nThe FBI showed up at his Florida home before dawn to arrest him. Stone was charged with seven criminal offenses, including obstruction of an official proceeding, making false statements, and witness tampering. Stone he is currently free on $250,000 bail.\n\nIn Stone's indictment, Mueller says a high-ranking official in the Trump campaign of \"was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information,\" Wikileaks may have regarding Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nThe Washington Post says it \"it seems entirely possible\" that the person who gave the order was Trump, which would link Trump directly to colluding activities, despite Trump's all-caps denial.\n\nFormer CIA director John Brennan said collusion \"is quite evident,\" and that he thinks Mueller's team is simply determining who crossed the line into criminal conspiracy.\n\nBut then he questions why CNN was able to capture exclusive footage of Stone's arrest. The answer is simple: good journalism.\n\nCNN\u2019s ability to capture the arrest of Roger Stone was the result of determined reporting and interpreting clues revealed in the course of events. That\u2019s called journalism. #FactsFirst https://t.co/71zu7RylxX \u2014 CNN Communications (@CNNPR) January 25, 2019\n\nCNN's David Shortell said he noticed unusual grand jury activity on Thursday, and had a hunch something may happen Friday morning. Further, Stone had been a target of the Mueller investigation for months, so one journalist acted on his instinct and decided to stake out Stone's Florida home.\n\nTrump is likely just trying to shift the conversation away from yet another of his close confidants facing a litany of criminal charges.\n\nMueller has thus far collected guilty pleas from some of Trump's closest associates as well as top campaign officials. Trump's longtime attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to a litany of criminal activities. Mueller also extracted guilty pleas from Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates.\n\nStone is just the latest alleged criminal caught by Mueller. And Trump is freaking out, as well he should.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

In the dark hours of the morning, the FBI arrived at Stone's house and arrested him for a litany of criminal activity, including obstruction of an official proceeding, making false statements, and witness tampering.\n\n\"With Stone\u2019s indictment, the special counsel investigation has now led to charges against 34 people and guilty pleas by six Trump associates and advisers, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos,\" reports the Washington Post.\n\nAccording to Mueller's office, Stone, who was arrested at his home in Florida, will appear in federal court in Fort Lauderdale at 11 am Friday.\n\nStone had been interviewed by Mueller's team several times about his connections to Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, and Russian interference in the 2016 election. While his communications were cited in previous court filings, Mueller waited until now to arrest him.\n\nThe Trump campaign initially denied any communications with Russian associates. But that was a lie, as the campaign made more than 100 contacts with officials linked to the Russian government.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Stone and an associate used a reference from \"The Godfather: Part II\" to discuss lying to Congress. Stone told an associate he should do a \"Frank Pentangeli\" when testifying in order to avoid contradicting Stone's own testimony. In the film, Pentangeli lied in congressional testimony, saying he did not know critical information when he did, in fact, know it.\n\nStone's arrest is the latest in a long line of bad news for Trump. Earlier this week, Trump was implicitly accused of witness tampering when Cohen, his former attorney and longtime \"fixer,\" sought to cancel his testimony before Congress due to threats Trump made against his father-in-law.\n\nEven outside of the Mueller investigation, Trump is embroiled in tanking poll numbers after he initiated a government shutdown in late December. As a result of his reckless behavior, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi postponed the State of the Union address, denying Trump what he most craves: being on television.\n\nDue to the Trump shutdown, the FBI agents who arrested Trump's longtime associate did it despite not receiving a paycheck, like an estimated 800,000 federal workers.\n\nIn the past, several Trump associates arrested by Mueller have decided to enter into a plea bargain, agreeing to cooperate with Mueller's investigation. Only time will tell if Stone is offered such a deal, and if he joins the growing list of former associates turning on Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Ted Lieu (D-CA), in reaction to the LaGuardia news.\n\n\"We have a growing concern for the safety and security of our members, our airlines, and the traveling public due to the government shutdown,\" said a joint statement from the Air Line Pilots Association, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.\n\nFormer FAA Administrator Michael Huerta appeared on CNN to raise concerns about the shutdown's impact on safety.\n\n\"I am concerned about fatigue and concerned about distraction,\" he said, \"It's ridiculous. They find themselves in a situation where they have to drive for Uber, they perhaps have to wait on tables during their time off. That is wrong.\"\n\nAirline industry executives have been sounding the alarm about the mess Trump is causing.\n\n\"We are close to a tipping point as employees are about to miss a second paycheck,\" Jetblue CEO Robin Hayes told analysts and investors in a conference call on Thursday. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said in an interview, \"We'd be crazy not to be concerned about this.\" He added, \"Common sense tells us the longer this goes on, the more problems are likely.\"\n\nThe flight halts could also be another negative hit on the economy.\n\n\"Flight and security delays will reduce demand for air travel, and that's going to require discounts to attract passengers.

While the investigation has already led to multiple indictments, plea deals, and cooperating witnesses, no one but Mueller knows what 2019 may bring.\n\nThis article is an update to an Aug. 24 article written by Caroline Orr.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone was reportedly so eager to get recognition for his work that he demanded credit for collusion.\n\nLongtime Trump ally and former campaign adviser Roger Stone may like to think of himself as the ultimate \"dirty trickster,\" but as special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly zeroes in on his contacts with WikiLeaks, it appears that Stone may have been outmaneuvered.\n\nAccording to CNN, Mueller has obtained recordings of Stone saying he should get credit for coordinating with WikiLeaks \u2014 a revelation that would undermine Stone's repeated denials and potentially put him in a position to face perjury charges.\n\nThe recordings were provided to Mueller's team as part of its broader investigation into Stone's communication with WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange.\n\nInvestigators are particularly interested in whether Stone passed along information that he believed was from WikiLeaks, such as the content of upcoming leaks, to members of Trump's campaign.\n\nDespite publicly suggesting that he was privy to such information during the presidential campaign, Stone has since denied that he had any prior knowledge of WikiLeaks' document dumps. He has similarly denied sharing any information about WikiLeaks with the Trump campaign.\n\nBut now, investigators reportedly have their hands on recordings that captured Stone saying he frequently talked to Trump early in the 2016 presidential campaign, which would have given him the opportunity to pass along this type of pertinent information.\n\nEven more damning: In separate communications later in the campaign \u2014 after WikiLeaks had dropped major documents like the hacked emails from the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta \u2014 Stone was reportedly caught on tape saying he should receive credit for his work coordinating with WikiLeaks.\n\nAs CNN noted, \"The queries about whether Stone may have shared information with the Trump campaign are a strong indication that Mueller's team is still actively investigating the possibility that someone close to Trump engaged in collusion with the Russians.\"\n\nApparently, Stone was so eager to get recognition for whatever work he did that he demanded credit for collusion.\n\nThis is par for the course for Stone, who has long faced suspicion stemming from his work with the Trump campaign, in large part due to his own words and actions.\n\nPerhaps most infamously, Stone sent a series of tweets raising questions about whether he had advanced knowledge that WikiLeaks was about to publish emails hacked from Podesta's account.\n\n\"Trust me, it will soon the Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel. #CrookedHillary,\" he tweeted on Aug. 21, 2016.\n\nThe first of Podesta's emails were published on Oct. 7, just hours after the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" video, in which Trump brags about sexually assaulting women, came out. The published emails allowed the Trump campaign to divert attention away from the \"Access Hollywood\" scandal engulfing Trump, which led to speculation that there may have been coordination between the campaign and WikiLeaks.\n\nIt has also been revealed that Stone communicated with a Russian intelligence agent, Guccifer 2.0, during the 2016 campaign. This communication was described in an indictment earlier this year, though Stone remained unnamed.\n\nThe new report did not say who provided Mueller's team with the recordings. However, investigators are reportedly scrutinizing a widening circle of Stone's allies and also putting the pressure on Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager who was convicted of eight felony charges in August, to hand over information about Stone, so it appears that some of these efforts are producing results.\n\nAs for the existence of the recording, Stone has no one but himself \u2014 and his oversized ego \u2014 to blame for that one.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

One of those senators appears to be Mitch McConnell (R-KY). According to the Washington Post, McConnell said that the shutdown isn't working, and he never wanted a shutdown in the first place. McConnell being McConnell, he even deployed a folksy saying to show that he doesn't like shutdowns: \"There is no education in the second kick of a mule.\"\n\nMcConnell also got in a spat with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) after Johnson told him \"This is your fault.\" Johnson was referring to the complete fiasco of Thursday, when both the Democrats and the Republicans advanced bills that failed to proceed.\n\nWorse still for them, the Democrats' bill got more votes than the GOP version, thanks to six GOP senators crossing the aisle. That didn't seem to register with Trump, who bragged about \"winning\" a 50-47 vote on the GOP bill in the Senate, a place where 60 votes are required.\n\nThe GOP is cracking under the pressure of backing Trump's ridiculous \u2014 and incredibly unpopular \u2014 demand for the wall. Their constituents are yelling at them. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) complained about \"a parade of horribles of how people who are having to cope with not getting paid, and it's not good.\"\n\nIt's becoming clear that there's no good path out of this for the GOP. A majority of Americans blame them, blame Trump, and think Pelosi is doing a much better job negotiating. So-called moderate GOP senators like Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) are demanding the shutdown end as soon as possible and crossing the aisle to vote with Democrats.\n\nAs the caucus continues to shudder and crack, you can expect more Republican intra-party brawling as this shutdown drags on.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The shutdown is happening because Trump has demanded that billions of tax dollars be wasted on an unnecessary, racist border wall.\n\nTrump and his inner circle are largely millionaires and billionaires with little to no understanding of the paycheck-to-paycheck lives of many Americans, particularly those working for the government.\n\nJust a little before Kudlow's derisive remark, Trump Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a reporter he just didn't understand why furloughed federal workers have to seek food from homeless shelters. Instead he suggested they take out loans against their future income.\n\nBoth men are reflecting the message from their boss, Trump, who said his wall serves a \"higher purpose than next week's pay\" for federal workers.\n\nThey're all wrong.

She shamelessly invoked the Bible to justify tearing immigrant families apart, for example. Perhaps that is why it was so pleasing to see Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) quote the Bible to put Sanders in her place.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Sanders mocked Ocasio-Cortez while talking to Fox News host Sean Hannity. Ocasio-Cortez is an enthusiastic proponent of the Green New Deal, which aims to make the country carbon-neutral within a decade while also striving to eliminate poverty and demand universal health insurance.\n\nOf course, to the right, a desire to save the Earth is something worth mocking. Sanders sneered at Ocasio-Cortez's goals, saying, \"I don't think that we are going to listen to her on much of anything, particularly anything that we will leave into the hands of a much, much higher authority\" \u2014 presumably, God.\n\nSanders probably didn't count on the fact that Ocasio-Cortez knew her Bible verses well enough to easily swat aside this lazy attempt to appeal to a higher power.\n\nWednesday on Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez quoted three Old Testament verses to push back on Sanders:\n\nGenesis 1: God looked on the world & called it good not once, not twice, but seven times. Genesis 2: God commands all people to \"serve and protect\" creation. Leviticus: God mandates that not only the people, but the land that sustains them, shall be respected.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has proven to be remarkably adept at pushing back against conservatives, especially on social media. She called out Fox News hosts for their evident and outright bigotry. When the right tried to shame her for a college-era video of her dancing, she responded by filming a video of herself dancing her way into her House offices.\n\nQuoting the Bible isn't just an instance of Ocasio-Cortez being clever or savvy. It is also a way to show conservatives they don't hold a monopoly on faith or the Bible. As Ocasio-Cortez also said on Twitter: \"You shouldn't need a Bible to tell you to protect our planet, but it does anyway.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Diana DeGette (D-CO) told the Times. \"They are literally running for their lives and asking for our country to help. Instead of offering them help, this proposal would require border officials to turn a deaf ear to their desperate pleas and send these kids back to the very places they just risked their lives to escape.\"\n\nSenate leaders were just as incensed.\n\n\"The asylum changes are a poison pill if there ever was one, and show the lack of good faith that the president and now Leader McConnell have,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the Senate floor.\n\n\"Kids will lose their lives, plain and simple,\" Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, told the Washington Post.\n\nThe sham compromise \"is just another drive to hurt immigrants,\" Sanaa Abrar, advocacy director at United We Dream, said in a statement. \"It is cruelty personified,\" she added.\n\nTrump instigated a shut down of the federal government in December, and has continued to reject every offer from Democratic leaders to reopen the government and engage in a discussion about immigration policy.

If enough Republicans join Democratic colleagues in doing the right thing, the Trump shutdown could finally come to an end.\n\nBut that's a big \"if.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

I agreed. She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date. This is her prerogative,\" Trump tweeted after 11 p.m. \"I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over.\"\n\nThat, of course, is exactly what Pelosi had instructed him to do.\n\n\"I am not looking for an alternative venue for the SOTU Address because there is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber,\" he continued.\n\nThis was a complete reversal for Trump, who had very publicly insisted that he would deliver a State of the Union address to Congress, even after Pelosi strongly suggested he should open the government first.\n\nHe even went to far as to send her a letter on Wednesday saying he didn't care about the concerns she had expressed for Secret Service agents and other government employees who would be forced to work \u2014 without pay \u2014 to provide security during such a speech.\n\n\"Therefore,\" he wrote, \"I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of the Union.\"\n\nPelosi responded with a letter of her own, informing he that he was officially banned from addressing Congress until he did his job and ended his petulant and increasingly dangerous shutdown.\n\nLess than 12 hours later, Trump conceded.\n\nIn his earlier semi-threat to Pelosi, he had warned, \"It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!\"\n\nObviously, Trump is the so very sad one now.\n\nFor a man who holds himself out as a master negotiator, Trump has thus far demonstrated an utter lack of understanding about how to negotiate anything. He has kept the government shut down for more than a month, forcing 800,000 employees to go without pay, and even requiring some of them to show up at work for free.\n\nAll of the polls are against him; Americans overwhelmingly want him to end his shutdown, without getting $5.7 billion to build his vanity wall on the border.\n\nNow, despite all the posturing from the White House that Trump could somehow out-maneuver Pelosi and get to deliver his big prime-time speech before Congress, he has been beaten yet again.\n\n\"Mr. President, I hope by saying 'near future' you mean you will support the House-passed package to #EndTheShutdown that the Senate will vote on tomorrow,\" Pelosi responded even later on Wednesday night. \"Please accept this proposal so we can re-open government, repay our federal workers and negotiate our differences.\"\n\nBy Thursday morning, Trump had yet to respond to Pelosi's latest request that he end his extended tantrum. Instead, he tweeted about \"Fox & Friends,\" attacked his own former longtime attorney Michael Cohen as a \"bad attorney,\" complained about the \"Fake News Media\" not giving him credit for his relationship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and recited his new campaign slogan: \"BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL!\"\n\nTrump rolled out his shiny new rhyme earlier this week and has repeated it several times since, declaring it the official 2020 campaign slogan for the Republican Party. it's an odd slogan to claim, since Trump had promised during his last campaign that he'd immediately build the wall if elected in 2016.\n\nBut it's also quite perfect for Trump: proudly admitting his failure without even realizing it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But as the government shutdown drags on, even the hardcore anti-immigrant racists are complaining that the wall is a dumb idea.\n\n\"It's disappointing to see what he's doing now,\" RJ Hauman, government relations director at Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Politico. FAIR is an anti-immigrant hate group with ties to white supremacists, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups across the country.\n\n\"We're obviously a little frustrated because so much focus has been on barriers, walls and fences,\" Chris Chmielenski, director of content and activism at NumbersUSA, told Politico. NumbersUSA has been criticized by the SPLC and other groups for its anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nTrump demanded a government shutdown in December 2018 unless Congress paid a $5.7 billion ransom so Trump could build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Since the shutdown started, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has passed multiple bills to reopen the government \u2014 without funding for a border wall \u2014 only to be rebuffed by Trump and cowardly Republicans in the Senate.\n\n\"The president really has no intention of caving on this,\" Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), told Politico after meeting with Trump and others in the White House. Despite being listed as an anti-immigrant hate group known to associate itself with white nationalists, the group was nonetheless invited to meet with Trump at the White House to discuss the standoff over the shutdown.\n\nLike other critics of Trump's wall, these groups complain that the wall is too simplistic and won't actually change much about the status quo on immigration.\n\nUnlike other critics, however, these groups think the other problem is that the wall isn't racist or anti-immigrant enough.\n\nThe hate groups would prefer to see Trump abandon his desire for a physical wall and focus on other anti-immigrant measures that they think might have a better chance of passing Congress. And they fear Trump's obsession with a wall will lead to him making a deal with Democrats on issues like DACA protections, which the hate groups oppose.\n\nMost Americans, however, reject both Trump's anti-immigrant extremism and his wall. They also consistently blame Trump and congressional Republicans for the shutdown, and put far more trust in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to handle the shutdown than Trump.\n\nThus far, Trump has failed to grapple with this basic reality. All he's done so far is grandstand and suggest bogus proposals in bad faith.\n\nTrump's unhealthy obsession with a border wall is damaging America. Some 800,000 federal workers are not receiving paychecks, FBI agents warn of national security dangers, air travel is less safe, and the nation's food supply is not being inspected.\n\nTrump is becoming increasingly isolated. The general public \u2014 and now even some of his most ardent allies \u2014 are all turning away from him. Pelosi has denied Trump use of the House chamber to deliver the State of the Union address until the shutdown is over.\n\nThe myth of Trump as a dealmaker is quickly unraveling.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

In a series of votes, Republicans proved once again that they are more loyal to the racist whims of Trump than to the American people.\n\nFor the first time since Trump initiated the current government shutdown, the Senate held votes to reopen the government.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) first scheduled a vote on a virulently anti-immigrant proposal cooked up by the White House. The bill would give Trump $5.7 billion for his unpopular border wall, and would also add horrendous, draconian restrictions to current asylum laws. As expected, that vote failed 50-47, needing 60 votes to move forward.\n\nNext, McConnell finally relented and allowed a vote on a clean funding bill that had already passed the House of Representatives. Given that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said time and again that the House will not support funding for an unpopular and unnecessary border wall, this was the only bill that could end the Trump shutdown.\n\nDespite unanimous support from every Democratic senator who was present, an overwhelming majority of Republicans voted against the bill, denying the necessary 60 votes it needed to move forward by a vote of 52-44.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Republicans voted against the bill, denying the necessary 60 votes it needed to move forward. Only six Republicans \u2014 Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitt Romney of Utah \u2014 voted against Trump and McConnell's demands and to reopen the government.\n\nIn a humiliating rebuke to Trump, the Democratic plan backed by Pelosi received more votes in the GOP-controlled Senate than Trump's sham proposal did.\n\nThanks to Republican intransigence and obstruction, some 800,000 federal workers will continue to be denied their paychecks. Air travel will continue to be less safe. Our national security will continue to be at risk.\n\nSo Trump's shutdown, which he started in December and has refused to end for more than a month, will continue, with no end in sight \u2014 all because Senate Republicans, led by a feckless Mitch McConnell, are too cowardly to stand up to the racist tantrums of the hostage-taker in chief.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "But will Republicans actually vote to do the right thing?\n\nFor more than a month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has helped Trump keep the government shutdown \u2014 and held the paychecks of 800,000 workers hostage.\n\nBut on Tuesday, McConnell finally caved to the enormous and growing pressure to at least hold a vote on one of several bills passed by the Democratic House to end Trump's shutdown, reopen the government, and finally pay all those workers.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate will vote on two separate bills: one that would give Trump the $5.7 billion he has demanded to build a wall the majority of Americans oppose, and one that would reopen the government and fund it through Feb. 8, without paying Trump's ransom.\n\nEither bill would need 60 votes to pass the Senate. While a handful of the more vulnerable Republicans have voiced their desire to end the shutdown, even without giving Trump his wall money, unless McConnell gives his caucus permission to vote against Trump's wishes, there probably won't be enough votes to actually reopen the government on Thursday.\n\nAnd that is unlikely to happen, as long as Trump insists he will veto any bill that doesn't give him $5.7 billion.\n\nOf course, the Senate could override such a veto. A bill to keep the government funded, without money for Trump's wall, passed unanimously in the Senate before the shutdown. McConnell could easily call upon his fellow Republicans to do it again, and to serve the wishes of the American public instead of the petulant demands of the hostage-taker in chief.\n\nAs the shutdown drags on into its second month, and the American public becomes even more anxious about the immediate and longterm consequences of Trump's tantrum, the will among Republicans \u2014 especially those up for re-election in 2020 \u2014 to actually fix the problem might grow stronger.\n\nAnd it is up to Republicans to fix the problem of their own creation. Before Trump shut down the government in December, he said he would be \"proud\" to take responsibility for doing it. Since then, he's tried to shift blame to Democrats, but Americans aren't buying it.\n\nThe Democratically controlled House has passed bill after bill to reopen the government, and voters know know it's Trump's fault that the government remains closed.\n\nTrump and his party made this mess. It's up to Trump and his party to clean it up. They will have the chance to do so on Thursday. The question is whether they will, for once, actually do the right thing.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Members of the Coast Guard are facing an entire month without pay.\n\nMilitary families are in crisis thanks to Trump's shutdown \u2014 and now they're lobbying Congress directly to demand that lawmakers do something to stop it.\n\nWhile other branches of the military are still getting paid during the shutdown, that's not true for the Coast Guard \u2014 whose 42,000 service members are being forced to work without a paycheck. Coast Guard members already missed their January 15 pay, and are now on track to receive nothing on their January 30 payday too.\n\nA group of 30 Coast Guard service members and their spouses went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to make members aware of their dire situation, and to ask for legislation that would get them paid even if the shutdown continues.\n\n\"People are buckling down, going to food pantries, worrying whether they can pay for their kids sports, calling companies to get bills deferred and payments deferred,\" Michelle Alonso, a Coast Guard spouse, told Military Times. The worst part, she added, is \"the stress not knowing how long you can go without a paycheck.\"\n\nTrump has forced the longest federal government shutdown on record, over than a month and counting, because Congress won't agree to his $5.7 billion ransom demand to fund an unpopular, unnecessary, and racist border wall.\n\nRepublicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), have the power to stop the shutdown. They could pass bills to reopen the government that have already made it through the House, and they could override Trump if he vetoed those bills.\n\nBut McConnell has refused to even hold a vote on these bills, denying pay to over 800,000 federal workers \u2014 including members of the military who perform vital national security functions. On Tuesday, McConnell blocked an attempt by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) to fund the Department of Homeland Security, the source of Coast Guard funding.\n\nWhile Trump likes to claim that a wall would stop the flow of illegal drugs into the United States, the vast majority of illegal drugs actually come in by sea. That means the best way to stop those drugs is to fund the Coast Guard, not build a wall.\n\nInstead, Trump is making sure that for the first time in American history, members of the military aren't getting paid because of a government shutdown.\n\nAnd Coast Guard members, their families, and communities are all hurting.\n\n\"Now they can\u2019t pay their rent,\" Jon Ostrowski, national president of the Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, told Military Times. \"Many may have made arrangements with landlords or banks to help them for the first month. Missing another paycheck will hit them hard.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has not held a press briefing since the shutdown began, which has allowed the White House to avoid questions about the damage it's inflicting on these military families.\n\nTrump has spent the last two years routinely attacking and denigrating our armed forces and our veterans. Now he's threatening their livelihoods \u2014 and his Republican Party is standing with him all the way.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans might change the rules so that Trump's unqualified nominees can sail right through the Senate.\n\nIn a move that should surprise no one, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is considering changing the Senate's rules yet again to rush even more of Trump's nominees through the confirmation process. The expedited confirmations could start as soon as next week.\n\nRepublicans are unhappy about the fact that under the current rules, Democrats get to demand a thorough debate period of up to 30 hours per nominee. The proposed rule would drastically cut debate time for mid-level agency appointees to 8 hours, and limit post-cloture discussions for district court judicial nominations to a mere 2 hours.\n\nRepublicans like to claim Democrats are engaging in unprecedented obstruction of Trump's nominees. But that doesn't pass the laugh test given how badly the GOP obstructed nominations by President Barack Obama \u2014 obstruction that left Trump with almost twice as many judicial vacancies to fill as Obama had at the start of his presidency.\n\nTrump seems to have more openings than he knows what to do with. He has dragged his feet on nominations, and even bragged about nominating far fewer people to agency roles.\n\nYet with McConnell's help, Trump has still been remarkably successful at packing the courts with his ultra-conservative judicial choices \u2014 so much so that right-wing outlets like Townhall praise McConnell for his \"valiant role\" in cementing Trump's judicial legacy.\n\nMcConnell began this shameful process when he refused to even meet with Obama Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, let alone bring his nomination to the Senate floor. He continued it when the Senate used the \"nuclear option,\" getting rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, to ensure that Justice Neil Gorsuch got confirmed even though it was clear the GOP didn't have the votes under the existing rules.\n\nNow, the Senate will likely change its rules yet again \u2014 all to benefit future Trump nominees, who may suffer from the same shocking lack of qualifications as his some of his past ones.\n\nIn the Trump era, the GOP has no interest in pretending that the legislative branch is independent of the executive \u2014 just in letting Trump do whatever Trump wants. The constitutional requirement of advice and consent is utterly foreign to Republicans now. Instead, they're willing to eviscerate the rules and norms of the Senate so that Trump's often sub-par nominees can sail through the process ever faster.\n\nDisgust at the GOP's poor behavior no doubt contributed to the stellar performance of Democrats in the 2018 election. This poor behavior may very well help underpin a blue wave in 2020 as well. If that happens, Republicans will find that their weakening of Senate rules and norms can be used against them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans gave Russia exactly what it wanted \u2014 and Russia's having a good chuckle about it.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Senate rejected legislation this week that would have required the U.S. Treasury Department to keep sanctions on companies linked to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with close ties to Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe move is a major win for Putin, whose economy has been hit hard by U.S.-backed sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, its involvement in human rights abuses around the world, and its malicious cyber activities including the 2016 influence operation targeting the U.S. presidential election.\n\nWhile Democrats had mounted an effort to block Trump's Treasury Department from lifting sanctions on the Russian companies, Republicans used their majority in the Senate to hand Putin a victory by easing the sanctions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the Democratic effort to keep sanctions in place a \"stunt.\" Only 11 Republicans were willing to vote against McConnell and Trump's demands to ease up on Russia.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vote came as welcome news in Russia, where state-run media seized on the development and celebrated the fact that Republicans had enough votes to stop the Democratic effort to keep sanctions in place.\n\nAs investigative journalist and Russian media analyst Julia Davis first reported on Twitter, the hosts of the popular Russian state TV program \"60 Minutes\" used Thursday's episode to highlight the move by Republicans, touting it as the first time since 2014 that the U.S. has lifted sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe show's hosts, Olga Skabeeva and Evgeny Popov, \"laugh[ed] out loud about the Democrats not getting enough votes to block the effort,\" Davis reported. The pair then \"expresse[d] hope that this is just the beginning\" of sanctions relief now that the midterms are over and Republicans have maintained their majority in the Senate.\n\nAs Davis has noted previously, Russia experts believe the desire for sanctions removal was a key reason why the Kremlin rooted for Republicans to maintain their congressional majorities in the midterm elections last year.\n\nRussian state media reported before the November election that recent economic sanctions proposed by Trump were likely just for show \u2014 a ploy to make him look \"tough on Russia\" \u2014 and that he would likely soften his position after the election.\n\nRussian officials even devised a plan to indirectly influence U.S. sanctions policy by fostering a closer alliance between the two countries, focusing on joint economic and business ventures. The Kremlin reportedly believed that a stronger American economy, or at least the image of one, would allow Trump to go easy on sanctions without political consequences.\n\nPart of that plan, according to multiple Russia analysts, involved touting Trump's supposed economic achievements and cultivating relationships with elected Republicans \u2014 many of whom traveled to Moscow last summer and fall.\n\nRussians don't see Republicans as a \"viable threat,\" Davis reported, and they believe they'll capitulate to Trump on foreign policy matters like sanctions. The Kremlin thinks it is particularly promising to promote Trump's nationalist base as part of an effort to pressure elected Republicans into agreeing to policies that are compatible with Russia's national interests and goals.\n\nClearly, the Kremlin was correct in its assessment.\n\nDespite Trump's frequent claims of being \"tough on Russia,\" his administration has repeatedly slow-walked sanctions and attempted to remove existing sanctions. And while Republicans have previously forced Trump's hand on sanctions, this week was among the first times they gave the green light to Trump to lift sanctions that were initially imposed in response to Russia's election interference.\n\nSanctions relief has been one of the Kremlin's top priorities for years. With this week's vote, Trump and his GOP allies handed Russia a major win without asking the Kremlin for anything in return \u2014 publicly, at least.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Witness intimidation is the latest credible charge against Trump.\n\nFormer Trump fixer and personal lawyer Michael Cohen cancelled his planned testimony to Congress, citing \"ongoing threats against his family from President Trump.\"\n\nIn a statement released by his attorney Lanny Davis, Cohen said threats from Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani had led him to decide to postpone his testimony. The release concluded, \"This is a time where Mr. Cohen had to put his family and their safety first.\"\n\nNBC News reported from a source close to Cohen that \"the threats are real,\" adding, \"Trump knows what he's doing.\"\n\nNBC also reported that Cohen's wife \"feared physically attending the hearing.\"\n\nCohen has been cooperating with ongoing investigations into Trump. He admitted arranging for the payoffs from Trump to women he'd had affairs with, which appear to have been violations of federal law. Cohen was also privy to the discussions that occurred between members of the Trump campaign and Russian operatives before the election.\n\nTrump has been fuming for months about Cohen and has singled out both Cohen and members of his family on Twitter.\n\nWhining about Cohen's guilty plea, Trump wrote, \"He makes up stories to get a GREAT & ALREADY reduced deal for himself, and get his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free.\"\n\nJust a few days ago, Trump again invoked Cohen's family, writing, \"Lying to reduce his jail time! Watch father-in-law!\"\n\nTrump made similar comments about Cohen's father-in-law in a Jan. 12 Fox News appearance. The day after that appearance, the chairmen of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees, Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) reprimanded Trump for attempting to \"discourage, intimidate, or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress.\"\n\nAfter the Wednesday announcement, Cummings released a statement with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, acknowledging the \"completely legitimate concerns for the safety and security of Mr. Cohen and his family members in light of the attacks last week by President Trump and again this past weekend by his attorney, Rudy Giuliani.\"\n\nThey also called Trump's intimidation \"textbook mob tactics that we condemn in the strongest terms.\"\n\nAmong the articles of impeachment that were offered against Richard Nixon in 1974 was a charge that he attempted to interfere in a congressional investigation.\n\nTrump has showed a complete disregard for the law and ethics during his entire presidency \u2014 and his apparent intimidation of Cohen and others who could reveal his secrets comes straight out of Nixon's criminal playbook.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump has continued to embrace racism and bigotry from the office of the presidency \u2014 and clearly, his MAGA-hat wearing supporters have taken notice.\n\nJust days after a viral video surfaced showing a mob of high school students wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats and chanting in the face of a Native American veteran, Trump weighed in on the racist incident \u2014 and once again, both he and his White House are taking the side of the racists.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump publicly defended Nick Sandmann and other students from Covington Catholic High School, an elite, all-male, nearly all-white private school in Kentucky, who were captured on camera engaging in a shocking confrontation with a Native American elder.\n\n\"Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be,\" Trump tweeted. \"They have captivated the attention of the world, and I know they will use it for the good - maybe even to bring people together. It started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream!\"\n\nThe video originally sparked widespread condemnation, and rightly so. It showed a mob of dozens of young white men laughing and doing the \"tomahawk chop\u201d \u2015 a chant and gesture that Native Americans condemn as racially insensitive \u2015 while Sandmann stared down and smirked for an uncomfortably long time at Native American elder Nathan Phillips, who was singing and playing a drum.\n\nIn the days since that video went viral, other videos and stories from other students suggested that it's not at all unusual for Covington students to express bigoted views.\n\nBut conservative commentators still managed to spark a backlash to the backlash by claiming that the whole thing had just been a misunderstanding and taken out of context, and that the media was unfairly condemning the Covington students.\n\nAnd Trump was happy to amplify that narrative. Ignoring the video that clearly showed the students were the aggressors in the incident, Trump raged that the high school students had been \"treated unfairly\" and \"smeared by the media.\" Apparently, Trump saw kindred spirits in these privileged white males who were caught engaging in racist attacks.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders also released a statement announcing that the students had been invited to the White House. And in a Fox news appearance, Sanders bemoaned the allegedly unfair treatment the students had suffered at the hands of the media.\n\nIn the version of events endorsed by Trump and Sanders \u2014 laid out in a carefully worded statement from Sandmann, who has refused to apologize \u2014 the dozens of students were innocent victims of verbal harassment from a small group of four black religious activists, and the racist tomahawk chants and creepy staring match were nothing more than awkward attempts at solidarity and confusion after Phillips approached the students to try to defuse the conflict.\n\nPhillips, who was participating in the Indigenous People\u2019s March, did say he felt compelled to go stand between Sandmann and the black activists to defuse what he believed was a potentially dangerous situation. But he also said he found the Covington students' reactions to be racist, and that he heard them chant slogans like \"Build that wall!\"\n\nWhat's more, it has become apparent that the students' behavior wasn't an isolated incident.\n\nChristian Bales, the valedictorian of Holy Cross High School \u2014 one of the other private religious schools run by the Kansas Covington Diocese \u2014 told NBC News that he \"was not surprised at all\" to hear about the incident.\n\n\"It was only a matter of time that something this school community did would blow up to this degree, and I think they need to be held accountable,\" Bales said, adding that Covington is \"notorious for being a not-well-disciplined school.\"\n\nOther accusations of racist, sexist, and anti-gay behavior soon emerged. One Twitter user spoke out about being harassed by Covington students for being gay, while documentarian Arlen Parsa reported that members of the community acknowledged there \"is an ingrained sexism problem\" at the elite private school.\n\nOn the sexism front, the group of male students was in D.C. to participate in an anti-abortion march \u2014 and additional video surfaced from last weekend of another Covington student shouting, \"It\u2019s not rape if you enjoy it.\"\n\nParsa also quoted black students who said they got bullied at the nearly all-white school. And yet another video, this time from 2011, showed white Covington students in what appears to be blackface at their basketball games.\n\nThis obvious and repeated racist behavior has been widely condemned \u2014 but not by Trump and some of his supporters, who have tried to blame the media instead of being honest about the harms of racism.\n\nOf course, this is nothing new for Trump, who has repeatedly sided with racists and sympathized with even the most unsympathetic, violent neo-Nazis.\n\nOn the one-year anniversary of the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, during which a neo-Nazi murdered anti-racist protester Heather Heyer, Trump refused to condemn the racists responsible for the horrific attack.\n\nHis statement gushing about his \"dream\" that the Covington students' ugly behavior would \"bring people together\" echoes his initial response to Heyer's murder, when he blamed people on \"both sides\" for the neo-Nazi violence and later described the white supremacists who attended the rally as \"very fine people.\"\n\nSince the tragedy in Charlottesville, Trump has continued to embrace racism and bigotry from the office of the presidency \u2014 and clearly, his MAGA-hat wearing supporters have taken notice.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Jeff Merkley (D-OR) is demanding the FBI open a perjury investigation into Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen over her lies about the Trump administration's family separation policy.\n\nIn a letter to the FBI, Merkley said \"compelling new evidence has emerged revealing that high-level Department of Homeland Security officials were secretly and actively developing a new policy and legal framework for separating families as far back as December 2017.\"\n\nNielson has a long and documented history of lying about the family separation policy she oversaw. In June 2018, Neilsen definitively stated, \"We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.\"\n\nNeilsen told the same lie \u2014 under oath \u2014 to Congress. But in April 2018, Neilsen signed a memo outlining the Trump administration's so-called \"zero-tolerance\" border policy, knowing full well that such a policy would lead to family separations.\n\nAnd the new evidence from Merkley provides even more evidence of Neilsen's deceptiveness. The 2017 memo from top officials at both the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department outlined \"policy options to deal with illegal immigration at the border.\" The memo specifically lays out a policy to \"separate family units,\" and states that \"an upshot of such policies will be the 'substantial deterrent effect,'\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe new documents show that officials were \"exploring family separation policies as a deterrent for illegal immigrants a full year\" before Neilsen's congressional testimony, according to Roll Call.\n\nFor there part, the DHS is claiming Neilsen never committed perjury. \"As Secretary Nielsen has said publicly and testified multiple times, DHS has never had a blanket policy of separating families in custody,\" Katie Waldman, a DHS spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nThe family separation policy led to thousands of children \u2014 that we know of \u2014 being ripped away from their parents. The creation of baby jails and the subsequent images of kids in cages sparked national and international horror.\n\nThe cruelty of the policy, and the callous attitude toward the potential harm inflicted on young children, was lambasted by religious leaders as immoral and led former retired four-star general Michael Hayden, former head of the CIA and NSA, to compare the practice to Nazi Germany.\n\nA recent internal report by the Department of Health and Human Services uncovered potentially thousands more children who were separated from their families than previously acknowledged. According to the Washington Post, \"the report said the practice appears far more common under Trump and began nearly a year before administration officials publicly acknowledged it.\"\n\nIn light of all the evidence, Merkley called on the FBI to \"immediately investigate whether Secretary Nielsen's statements violate 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1621, 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1001, or any other relevant federal statutes that prohibit perjury and false statements to Congress.\"\n\nThe heartless policy of the Trump administration was bad enough. It's high time the Trump administration officials who lied about the practice are held accountable, and Sen. Jeff Merkley is leading that effort.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Now the organization has released a 71-page report that shows how this prediction is coming true.\n\nOne FBI source investigating crimes against children and sex trafficking said the shutdown \"puts children in jeopardy\" because the funding shortfall means \"I have had to put pervs on standby.\"\n\nAnother source told the group, \"Victims from domestic minor sex trafficking cases are not receiving the attention they need and/or visits and counseling services.\"\n\nThe Trump shutdown has cut off money that was being used to pay informants, who are key to giving investigators information about the activities of terrorists and spies. Agents can't even buy the phone cards they need to speak to sources who have information on terrorism.\n\n\"We have lost several sources who have worked for months, and years, to penetrate groups and target subjects,\" a terrorism task force coordinator explained in the report.\n\nSimilarly, money isn't available to pay for travel used to investigate child sex traffickers.\n\nTrump has often invoked the criminal MS-13 gang to push his fearmongering agenda on immigration restrictions. But by keeping the government shut down, Trump is effectively aiding and abetting gangs like MS-13.\n\nOne FBI operative working on MS-13 cases noted that Spanish speakers haven't been available to help with those cases since the shutdown. \"We have several Spanish speaking informants,\" the operative said. \"We are only able to communicate using a three-way call with a linguist in another division.\"\n\n\"I currently investigate a particularly violent street gang,\" an FBI source said in the report. \"I have had to tell our local law enforcement partners that I cannot assist in funding these operations because my field office does not have money.\"\n\nAnother FBI source said the shutdown is hurting investigations into \"trafficking of methamphetamine and heroin by street gang members.\" Without federal dollars, the source said, \"our task force is unable to continue these critical investigations.\"\n\nThe shutdown is also hurting FBI investigations into cybersecurity, as well as the FBI's ability to provide critical assistance to local police investigating serious crimes like homicide.\n\nCriminals and terrorists are more likely to get away with hurting innocent people thanks to the Trump shutdown, and the Republicans who are allowing it to continue. The shutdown is a huge gift to the darkest side of humanity.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

We saw it again with the Covington students. I\u2019ve never seen people so happy to destroy a kid\u2019s life.\"\n\nThe Trump team, led by a serial liar and staffed with many other liars like Sanders and Pence, has no business attacking reporters for accuracy \u2014 especially in an interview with multi-decade liar and Trump sycophant Sean Hannity.\n\nBut Sanders' complaint about supposed \"attacks\" on young people is even more remarkable given the very real, very harmful attacks that the Trump administration has launched on young people.\n\nTrump put migrant children in cages and tore them away from their families \u2014 some of whom may never see each other again. This was a deliberate decision on the Trump administration's part; it broke with tradition and decided to prosecute every single misdemeanor border violation in federal criminal court, where minors could not be detained with their parents.\n\nIt is also the Trump administration that, appealing to Trump's racist base of voters, rescinded protections for Dreamers who were brought to America as children and have grown up as Americans. These young people are now justifiably afraid of being swept up in ICE raids and deported to countries they don't even remember living in.\n\nTrump himself has exhibited far more cruelty to children than anyone in the press. He put out a full-page ad calling for the execution of the five young black men known as the Central Park 5, who were wrongly accused of raping a jogger. Even after DNA evidence exonerated the men, Trump has continued to insist that they should be killed.\n\nFox News \u2014 which seems to be the only place Sanders will speak in public these days \u2014 has also pushed savage, unfair attacks on young people like the teenage survivors of the Parkland mass shooting. The young advocates for gun safety were smeared as \"crisis actors\" by many conservatives, and one teen was personally taunted by Fox News host Laura Ingraham.\n\nWhether it's about racist teens or Supreme Court nominees, the conservative movement is always trying to paint itself as the victim while it destroys others' lives. And Trump and his White House are leading that charge, all while erasing their sordid history of hatred and cruelty toward children.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Joni Ernst (R-IA), who faces an uphill re-election battle in 2020, got an earful from constituents for her complicit role in the Trump shutdown.\n\n\"I am deeply ashamed that we have, at the moment, federal employees in soup lines and trying to find food for their families while they're still working,\" one constituent told Ernst at a recent town hall event. \"And I wonder how in the world anyone in the Senate can defend that,\" the constituent concluded.\n\nWhen Ernst tried to pivot to previous government shutdowns, another constituent was not having it. \"We need to talk about right now because these families don't have food on their tables.\"\n\nWhile Ernst shows no indication that she cares about the plight of 800,000 federal workers who are not being paid, many other Americans are showing more compassion. Celebrity chef Jose Andres opened a pop-up kitchen to help feed furloughed federal employees. Coast Guard families are literally begging Congress to end the shutdown so they can get paid, but those pleas fall on the deaf ears of Senators like Joni Ernst.\n\nErnst, one of Trump's most loyal lackeys in the Senate, has made no public effort to end the Trump shutdown. Trump initiated a government shutdown after throwing a tantrum on national television demanding $5.6 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Rather than take responsibility for her own pathetic inaction, Ernst used the town hall to falsely cast blame on others.\n\n\"Voicing her own frustrations with congressional Democrats, Ernst called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others to return to Washington, and vote on a resolution to reopen the government Thursday,\" reports KMA News. Ernst nows full well that congressional Democrats have passed multiple bills to reopen the government.\n\nFor the past month, Ernst has been mostly silent as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) repeatedly refused to allow the Senate to hold one single vote on a House-passed measure to reopen the government during the first month of the longest shutdown in history.\n\nLike Trump, Ernst would rather blame other people and mislead her constituents rather than accept responsibility for her role in the Trump shutdown. The shutdown is shameful, and so is Ernst's reaction.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Yes, zero.\n\nA senior member of Trump's own economic team has admitted that Trump's shutdown of the federal government could literally crash U.S. economic growth to zero percent if it's allowed to continue much longer.\n\nKevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, appeared on CNN to discuss the shutdown. Anchor Poppy Harlow pointed out that the shutdown has already shaved off half a percent of growth from the U.S. GDP \u2014 and that Hassett's own estimates show that growth could slow to 1 percent if the shutdown continues into March.\n\n\"Couldn't we then see zero growth if [the shutdown] persists through the end of the quarter?\" Harlow asked.\n\nAfter Hassett dissembled for a bit, Harlow persisted: \"Could we get zero growth? I just want to nail this down.\"\n\n\"Yes, we could,\" he eventually replied.\n\nThe admission is a rare moment of honesty from the Trump team about the wide-reaching harms from Trump's completely unnecessary shutdown.\n\nTrump has shut down the federal government because Congress won't agree to waste $5.7 billion of taxpayer money on a southern border wall that will do nothing to either enhance border security or fix America's immigration system.\n\nDemocrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have passed legislation in the House to reopen the government. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), ever the staunch Trump ally, refused to allow a vote on such legislation until this week \u2014 and those votes are likely to fail.\n\nMeanwhile, over 800,000 federal workers are either being temporarily forced to work without pay, or permanently losing income because they are unable to work at all. Many now face food shortages and the danger of being evicted from their homes. This hardship has ripple effects across the entire economy and on millions of American lives.\n\nAmericans widely oppose the shutdown, do not believe a wall is a worthy reason to shut down the government, and blame Trump and Republicans for forcing the whole country to endure this debilitating and embarrassing episode.\n\nTrump has already started chipping away at the economic recovery that began under President Barack Obama. Trump and his fellow Republicans enacted a tax scam that gave the ultra-wealthy a boost while doing nothing for working families, and launched a trade war costing farmers billions in lost sales.\n\nNow Trump is presiding over the longest, and likely the most destructive, government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nA zero-growth quarter would be devastating to America's economy and the global markets. It is not necessary. The only reason it is even a possibility is because Trump is having a tantrum, and Republicans in Congress are giving in to him.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's basically begging Pelosi to let him have his prime-time slot on TV.\n\nTrump's desire to deliver a televised State of the Union to Congress has reached a new level of sad desperation.\n\nThe White House announced this week that Trump was making plans to address Congress next Tuesday, despite Speaker Nancy Pelosi telling him he shouldn't bother unless and until he ends his shutdown and reopens the government.\n\nNow Trump has sent a rather pathetic letter to Pelosi, riddled with typically Trumpian phrases and questionable punctuation, insisting \"it would be so very sad\" if he could not have his big prime-time moment before Congress.\n\n\"Thank you for your letter of January 3, 2019, sent to me long after the Shutdown began, inviting me to address the Nation on January 29th as to the State of the Union,\" Trump says,\n\nTrump then insists that despite Pelosi's concerns about the additional burden and cost of security in the midst of Trump's shutdown \u2014 during which essential federal workers, including those tasked with protecting Trump and escorting him to such an event, are forced to work without pay \u2014 both the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service contacted him \"to explain that there would be absolutely no problem\" providing such security.\n\nTrump of course does not bother to address the blatant cruelty of forcing those men and women to work without pay.\n\n\"Therefore,\" he continues, \"I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of the Union.\"\n\nTrump has no constitutional duty to deliver a prime-time speech in front of Congress. Simply writing a letter to Congress, to inform it of the state of the union \u2014 which is currently shut down, thanks to Trump \u2014 would suffice. It's what presidents did before the existence of TV, and as Pelosi noted, it would be far more appropriate given Trump's shutdown.\n\n\"It would be so very sad for our Country,\" Trump concludes, \"if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!\"\n\nIt is quite obvious that the one person who is sad about the prospect of not holding a televised event before Congress is Trump.\n\nPoll after poll after poll shows that the American people are far more sad that he has shut down the government, and taken the paychecks of nearly 1 million employees hostage \u2014 all to extort $5.7 billion for a wall most Americans don't want.\n\nTrump wants his TV time. That's all he cares about. To publicly grovel for it is yet a further embarrassment to the office he holds.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced the \"in-depth\" probe in a letter addressed to White House counsel Pat Cipollone. The committee will investigate breaches of security and protocol, and avoidance of the law, occurring from the date of Trump's election in 2016 up until the present.\n\nThe Oversight Committee is requesting massive amounts of documents and communications materials related to the lapses in security that could endanger the country.\n\nCummings wrote, \"The Committee on Oversight and Reform is launching an in-depth investigation of the security clearance process at the White House and Transition Team in response to grave breaches of national security at the highest levels of the Trump Administration, including by former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and others.\"\n\nIn a release, Cummings said similar letters have been sent to Mike Pence, the FBI, the State Department, and the NRA.\n\nHe said the investigation has been put in place to determine why the Trump administration and transition team \"disregarded established procedures for safeguarding classified information,\" and allowed top secrets to be given to officials \"who should not have had access to them.\"\n\nLast year multiple White House staffers were terminated or reassigned when it became clear they could not obtain security clearances.\n\nThat information was revealed during the scandal surrounding Trump giving classified information to aide Rob Porter, who could not obtain a security clearance due to a protective order issued against him by his wife. The Trump team tried to cover up the allegations of spousal abuse against Porter.\n\nCummings also said the investigation will find out why the administration is currently defying federal law by refusing to give Congress details of the security clearance process at the White House.\n\nTrump didn't suspend then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's clearance, even after Acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned the White House Counsel that he was \"vulnerable to being compromised by Russia.\"\n\nThe letter from Cummings singles out Mike Pence, noting that he headed the presidential transition team but hasn't come clean about whether Flynn's clearance application was submitted to the appropriate agencies.\n\nSince then, Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is providing evidence in the ongoing special counsel investigation of the Trump campaign and its connection to Russian operatives.\n\nSimilarly, Trump is stonewalling Congress on providing information about why Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner has retained his clearance, despite failing to come clean about meetings with Russian officials.\n\nCurrent National Security Adviser John Bolton worked with admitted Russian spy (and NRA influencer) Maria Butina, but the Trump administration hasn't given Congress the details of that relationship either.\n\nFor nearly two years, Republicans running House committees ignored these serious issues and the massive implications that breaches in security could have for the nation. Less than a month into the new year, the new Democratic chairman and his committee are doing the work the GOP refused to do.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Polling expert Harry Enten said this was the first high-quality poll directly comparing Pelosi and Trump, adding, \"Good for the Speaker and not so good for the President.\"\n\nTrump's handling of the shutdown has been an epic disaster from the start. in a petulant hissy fit, Trump demanded roughly $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in a December bill to fund the government. In a televised meeting with Democratic leaders, Trump boasted that he would be \"proud\" to own a government shutdown. \"I will be the one to shut it down,\" Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), adding, \"I'm not going to blame you for it.\"\n\nIn typical Trump fashion, he shut down the government and proceeded to blame anyone and everyone but himself.\n\nAmericans see through the tantrums and childish antics, and are not happy with Trump. Despite being the least popular president in modern history, his poll numbers have slumped during the shutdown as most Americans place the blame on him and his complicit Republican accomplices.\n\nAnd beyond blaming Trump, Americans think it is a terrible idea to shut down the government over a wall.\n\nIn the same CBS poll, an overwhelming 71 percent of Americans say the shutdown is not worth it. Beyond the sheer stupidity of a government shutdown over a wall, Americans are seeing the harm caused by Trump's reckless and churlish demands.\n\nA full 94 percent of Americans see at least some problems the shutdown is causing this country, with three in five saying the problems are serious. Thanks to the Trump shutdown, 800,000 federal workers are not getting paid. For the first time ever, members of the military \u2014 the Coast Guard \u2014 are not receiving a paycheck. FBI agents are warning that national security is being compromised, airline pilots warn that air travel is less safe, and food inspectors are not inspecting the nation's food supply. Thousands of families are at risk of evictions because of a lapse in funding for certain housing programs, and national parks are filling up with trash.\n\nThrough it all, the American people have seen Nancy Pelosi and Democrats working towards ending the shutdown. The House has passed numerous bills to reopen the government, only to find Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocking every effort thus far to end the shutdown.\n\nTrump eventually offered a sham proposal that only addresses problems he himself created (related to Dreamers) and actually makes the situation worse for families seeking asylum. After more than a month of blocking any and all efforts to reopen the government, McConnell finally caved and will allow a vote on both Trump's sham plan and a House-passed version to end the shutdown.\n\nTrump, McConnell, and the rest of Republicans should listen to the American people and trust Nancy Pelosi's leadership. It's the best way to end the Trump shutdown, reopen the government, and begin repairing the damage Trump wrought.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He's even demanded a time to schedule a walk-through of the House chamber for White House and Secret Service personnel.\n\nPelosi's concerns are well-founded. The State of the Union is a massive security undertaking, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen \u2014 whose department is currently de-funded thanks to the shutdown \u2014 is the person who designated the speech a National Special Security Event.\n\nThanks to Trump's utter refusal to yield in his demand for a wall no one wants, many of the employees who would need to coordinate security for the event are furloughed. It is irresponsible for Trump even to suggest that such a high-profile, high-risk event should be conducted without adequate personnel or with unpaid employees.\n\nIt isn't really surprising that Trump would ignore the fact that, however ceremonial it may be, he does have to be invited to deliver his speech to Congress in the House chamber.\n\nAfter two years of complete Republican control, Trump seems both enraged and befuddled by any pushback from Democrats. That includes an incredibly confusing tweet, even by Trumpian standards, where he appeared to say he already has a contract in place to deliver the speech wherever he wants.\n\nTrump's newfound faith in the binding power of contracts is especially disingenuous given his disdain for them in every other situation. He routinely stiffed the people that worked for him. He had to pay eight figures to settle claims against his scammy \"university.\" To insist that he is owed his day in the House is absurd.\n\nAs Pelosi has pointed out, Trump is free to give his speech from the Oval Office or submit it in writing. She's not blocking him from talking. She's just telling him that he can't do it in her House.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The UCSB Presidency Project told ABC news \"the length of time between briefings is longer than any of the preceding 13 press secretaries.\"\n\nTrump defended Sanders in a tweet, writing, \"The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the 'podium' much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press. I told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway! Most will never cover us fairly & hence, the term, Fake News!\"\n\n(Trump uses the term \"fake news\" to refer to the reporters and stories that uncover the truth about his personal crimes and corruption.)\n\nSince the December briefing \u2014 which largely consisted of Sanders attacking the FBI \u2014 the federal government was shut down by Trump. It is now the longest shutdown in American history, and it continues because Trump insists the country should waste tax dollars on an unnecessary and racist border wall.\n\nWhile Sanders and the White House press operation has been hiding out, they have been giving out interviews to Fox News, the administration's quasi-official propaganda network. While real journalists are more likely to give the Trump team serious questions about the lives Trump is hurting with the shutdown, on Fox the goal is to amplify Trump's message. It isn't journalism.\n\nThe decision to go quiet and hunker down as Trump loses the fight over the shutdown is now part of the playbook. Instead of facing accountability before the press, they hide.

    "text": "Over the last two years, Trump has solidified the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, and today they handed him a major win: allowing his transgender troop ban to go into effect.\n\nToday, the Supreme Court of the United States voted 5-4 to stay lower court decisions and let Trump's transgender troop ban go into effect while the cases proceed through various courts of appeal.\n\nThat victory comes courtesy of an incredibly emboldened conservative majority on the court, installed by Trump and the GOP to carry out Trump's bigoted policies.\n\nThe decision broke along ideological lines, with all four liberal justices voting to deny the stay. The ruling doesn't mean that the Trump administration has won yet, but it does mean that the ban goes into effect now. This is even though lower courts in every jurisdiction that considered a case on the matter ruled against the ban, enjoining the administration from implementing it, although the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals later overturned one of those injunctions.\n\nTypically, what is supposed to happen is that each of those lower court rulings would proceed through the courts of appeal in those jurisdictions. However, the administration engaged in an almost unprecedented procedural move and asked the court to immediately stay those rulings and allow the ban to go into effect. It's essentially jumping the line, but the move worked thanks to Trump-appointed Justices Neil Gorsuch, holder of a stolen Supreme Court seat, and Brett Kavanaugh, a longtime GOP political operative.\n\nSo now, a policy that was created via a Trump tweet, a policy so bigoted even Trump's own military people asked him to drop it, a policy where Trump lied about even consulting with his own generals, now goes into effect.\n\nThe ban makes some nominal concessions, allowing several hundred openly transgender troops to stay in the military and allowing transgender people to serve if they do so in their \"biological sex\" \u2014 in other words, if they don't transition. But it prohibits new individuals from enlisting and means that most transgender troops face the harsh reality they can be kicked out.\n\nThe Court declined the administration's other request to jump the line. The DOJ had asked the Court to review those lower court findings, skipping over any chance for appellate courts to rule.\n\nHowever, that's not a bright spot. Given that five justices voted to grant the stay, it is likely there are at least four justices that will eventually vote to hear the case once one makes its way through the full appeals process. And given this Court's solid conservative majority, it's highly likely they'll vote to permanently ban transgender troops from serving.\n\nThere's just no reason for this policy, save for outright bigotry. Under Obama, the Defense Department engaged in a thoughtful long-term review of the ban on transgender troops, coming to the considered conclusion that transgender troops did not harm unit cohesion or military readiness. Trump reversed all of that with a thoughtless tweet.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

It\u2019s destructive,\" Daudert said of Trump's government shutdown, adding that he wouldn't make the same mistake of voting for Trump in 2020. \"I was certainly for the anti-status quo. \u2026 I\u2019ll be more status quo next time.\"\n\nAnd Daudert isn't the only one backing away from his support for Trump.\n\nCiting recent polling, the Post noted that the government shutdown has caused some key parts of Trump\u2019s base to waver in their support for him \u2014 an alarming sign for Trump, who has relied on his core voter base to keep his poll numbers from sinking even lower as his disapproval ratings soar among the rest of the country.\n\nAccording to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted Jan. 10 to Jan. 13, Trump's net approval rating has dropped 7 points since December. While he lost support across the board, Trump's approval among suburban men plunged a staggering 18 percentage points, representing one of the steepest drops of any group. He also saw net drops of 13 points among white evangelicals, and 10 points among all Republicans.\n\nAnd many of those voters say Trump's \"ridiculous\" position on the border wall was the turning point for them.\n\nTrump made the border wall a centerpiece of his campaign, promising not only to build the wall, but also that Mexico would foot the bill. When he failed to follow through on that promise, he decided to hold funding for the federal government hostage to try to force a deal that he couldn't make on his own.\n\nNow, many of his voters \u2014 especially white working class voters who flipped from Democratic to Republican when they voted for Trump \u2014 are seeing the emptiness of his promises and worrying about the future with such a reckless president calling the shots.\n\n\"I was doing fine with him up until this government shutdown,\" said Trump voter Jeremiah Wilburn, a 45-year-old operating engineer from Michigan.\n\n\"It\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019re not getting the wall built for $5 billion. And Mexico is not paying for it, we all know that, too,\" he said.\n\nTrump's decision to shut down the government over the border wall is \"starting to turn people like me away,\" Wilburn added.\n\nWilburn was one of many Trump voters who told the Post that they are worried about the economic impact of the shutdown, which is being shouldered largely by working class Americans.\n\nWhile Trump claimed that he cared about the interests of the working class, the government shutdown has revealed how out of touch he is with the voters he promised to look out for. Currently, 800,000 federal employees and contractors are going without a paycheck \u2014 and voters like Wilburn are crying foul.\n\n\"You can\u2019t expect people to come to work without getting paid,\" Wilburn told the Post.\n\nAs the longest-ever government shutdown keeps getting longer, Americans are becoming more and more frustrated. Despite his efforts to blame the shutdown on Democrats, voters are increasingly blaming Trump and his unreasonable demand for money to build a border wall.\n\nThe consequences of Trump's decision to shut down the government could spell trouble for him in 2020. With his approval ratings slipping and his base peeling away, more than half of all voters are already saying they definitely won't vote for him in the next election.\n\nTrump promised to shake things up in Washington. But when he failed at doing so, he decided to shut it down instead \u2014 and in 2020, voters are prepared to do the same to him.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Thank you, working hard!\"\n\nApproval doesn't translate into votes, however. Trump failed to mention that the same poll shows only 30 percent of registered voters said they would \"definitely vote for President Trump\" in 2020 \u2014 and a whopping 57 percent of voters said they would \"definitely vote against him.\"\n\nLatino voters gave similar answers to these questions, despite giving Trump higher marks for his overall job performance. Just over one in four Latinos, 27 percent, said they plan to vote for Trump in 2020 \u2014 slightly lower than the support from Latinos he received in 2016 \u2014 while a large majority, 58 percent, said they plan to vote against him.\n\nThe poll also shows that Trump's overall approval ratings have sunk in the last month, from 42 percent in December to 39 percent in January. And 53 percent of voters now disapprove of the job he's doing.\n\nEven support among his Republican base is shaky. When asked if they wanted someone to challenge Trump in the Republican primary, Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters were split: 44 percent said yes, and 45 percent said no.\n\nOverall, these results spell disaster for Trump \u2014 who spent the first half of his term as the most unpopular president in modern history. And the latest poll lines up with with several other polls showing that Trump is becoming even more unlikable as he enters his third year in office.\n\nCNBC reports that polls show Trump is \"hemorrhaging support amid a political standoff over his proposed border wall that has resulted in the longest government shutdown on record.\"\n\nTrump initiated the government shutdown in late December, after telling Democratic leaders he would be \"proud\" to own the shutdown if they refused to hand over more than $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAmericans increasingly blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown. An estimated 800,000 federal workers are not being paid because Trump refuses to reopen the government unless he receives his ransom for the wall. Some will get back pay eventually, but many are simply losing income this year.\n\nWhile the Democratic-led House of Representatives has passed numerous bills to end the shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), taking orders from Trump, has refused to allow a vote to reopen the government.\n\nTrump is wildly unpopular, and has a long history of cherry-picking and misrepresenting polls to pretend that he isn't. His obsession with keeping the government shut down over his border wall is harming the country, making him even more unpopular \u2014 and even threatening his 2020 re-election chances.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Until late December, he was the special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS. He wrote in a recent Washington Post op-ed that Trump's decision to pull American forces out of Syria was tantamount to giving ISIS \"new life.\"\n\nMcGurk wrote that he found out about the Syria decision while he was in Baghdad helping to manage the fight against ISIS. Soon after returning to Washington \"to help mitigate the fallout from this decision,\" McGurk realized such efforts would be fruitless.\n\nSo he tendered his resignation.\n\n\"The president's decision to leave Syria was made without deliberation, consultation with allies or Congress, assessment of risk, or appreciation of facts,\" McGurk wrote, adding that Trump's claim to have defeated ISIS \"was not true.\"\n\nIn McGurk's conversation with Amanpour, he spoke incredulously about Trump's recklessness in making the decision. McGurk said Trump acted \"without any serious consultation with the national security team, with the secretary of defense or others.\"\n\n\"That's just not the way to run foreign policy effectively,\" McGurk said.\n\nMcGurk is not the only high-level administration official who has quit over Trump's dangerously impulsive move on Syria.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned shortly after Trump's misleading declaration, sending Trump a blistering letter on the way out. Mattis was in favor of keeping a U.S. presence in Syria, but Trump ignored this advice \u2014 much to the delight of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who praised Trump's actions.\n\nBut other Trump officials are more than willing to repeat his lies about ISIS. On the very day when ISIS claimed responsibility for the deaths of four American troops, Vice President Mike Pence claimed in a speech at the State Department, \"The caliphate has crumbled and ISIS has been defeated.\"\n\nTrump's reckless foreign policy has made him a global laughing stock and significantly reduced America's global influence. And now, Trump is making the world less safe to cover up for his lies.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Mitch McConnell called bills to end the shutdown 'absolutely pointless' \u2014 but he was happy to bring forward an anti-choice bill that had no chance of passing.\n\nThroughout the shutdown, Mitch McConnell has shown himself to be completely disinterested in the welfare of the American people. He's made no attempt to get the government reopened. His disappearing act is so impressive that it spawned a Twitter hashtag.\n\nBut somehow he managed to find time to come to the Senate floor to engage in some pointless anti-choice theater.\n\nEvery year around the anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, Republicans take to the chambers to pass symbolic bills opposing safe, legal abortion. They do this to please anti-choice extremists, who descend on Washington every year on the anniversary of Roe for the so-called March for Life.\n\nRepublicans decided to bring up such a symbolic bill again this year, even though the government is shut down. And even though McConnell insists it would be \"absolutely pointless\" to vote on bills to end the shutdown if Trump wouldn't sign them into law, he apparently didn't think it pointless to vote on an abortion bill that wouldn't even pass the Senate, let alone find its way to Trump's desk.\n\nMcConnell's hypocrisy is egregious, but the bill itself is even worse. It seeks to stop something \u2014 federal funding for abortion \u2014 that hasn't even existed for decades.\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, which passes every year as a rider on federal budget bills, bans the use of federal Medicaid dollars for abortion except in cases of incest, rape, or danger to the life of the mother. It's not possible for even a single federal dollar to pay for an abortion in any other instance. But this year the Republicans felt it vital to try to codify it into a standalone law.\n\nThere's a growing movement to get rid of the Hyde Amendment entirely because it discriminates against poor women and denies them their constitutional right to an abortion. Democrats have vowed to repeal Hyde.\n\nSo a bill to make Hyde permanent never had even the most slender of chances. It takes 60 votes to open debate on a bill in the Senate, and this bill got only 47.\n\nIt was a little odd to see McConnell working so hard to bring this completely fruitless bill to the floor when he has otherwise refused to do his job. He spent two full days ducking House Democrats who were trying to meet with him to talk about ending the shutdown. He blocked votes on reopening the government, even though he was more than happy to make everyone go through his anti-choice show vote. And he said he won't bring any bills to the floor unless he's sure that Trump will sign them, utterly abdicating his legislative duty.\n\nMcConnell is making quite clear he has no interest in actual governance. He's interested in preserving his power and blocking the progress of anyone he perceives as being on the opposite side. That's why, regrettably, he's the perfect accomplice for Trump's shutdown.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

It's a record-breaking disaster that will negatively affect the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nAnd now Trump is exploiting this disaster to make money for his presidential campaign \u2014 some of which will inevitably land in his own pockets.\n\nThe Trump re-election campaign is selling foam \"bricks\" (to \"build\" Trump's racist border wall) that it promises will be sent to the offices of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in exchange for campaign donations.\n\nAccording to the campaign website, the money-making scheme was \"a brilliant idea\" from Trump himself. The campaign says it has a goal of sending 100,000 bricks to the offices of Democrats, which would translate into a $2,000,000 haul.\n\nIf Trump's 2020 campaign is anything like his 2016 campaign, it's extremely likely that Trump himself will personally profit from the ridiculous brick scheme.\n\nAn analysis of donations given to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign showed that Trump personally took home $1 out of every $10 given to the campaign.\n\nTrump has already made it clear that he intends to use his presidential bully pulpit to inappropriately haul in even more money from his re-election campaign.\n\nThe bricks are just another gimmick to line Trump's pockets \u2014 and another doomed gambit to try to win over public opinion on the shutdown.\n\nTrump has been losing this public relations battle handily so far. The majority of Americans didn't want Trump's wall in the first place, they don't want the government to be shut down over it, and they blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown continuing.\n\nInstead of doing his job and reopening the government, Trump has instead deployed his campaign for yet another money-making scheme on the backs of Americans.\n\nThe missing paychecks for federal workers are hurting not just the families and children who rely on them, but also the neighborhoods and businesses those people live and work in.\n\nStaffing shortages are also hurting national security and endangering public health.\n\nThe Trump campaign, however, is treating the suffering as a fundraising opportunity.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "'This cruelty cannot stand,' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.\n\nIn a new low in Trump's cruel desire to inflict more pain upon the American citizens in Puerto Rico, Trump is opposing funding for nutrition assistance to families on the devastated island.\n\nIn a letter to Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY), chair of the Appropriations Committee, the White House calls $600 million for Puerto Rico's Nutrition Assistance Program, \"excessive and unnecessary.\" The callous statement was only the latest revelation about how little Trump cares for those living in Puerto Rico.\n\n\"President Trump grossly mismanaged the response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, and since then he has added insult to injury by repeatedly trying to shortchange our fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico,\" Lowey said in a statement to Shareblue Media. \"Our bill rights that injustice.\"\n\nLowey is correct in her assessment of Trump. \"Trump told then-White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and then-Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney that he did not want a single dollar going to Puerto Rico\" last September, according to the Washington Post. Instead, Trump wanted to divert the funds to Texas and Florida. Trump, a former reality television show host and failed casino owner, had to be informed by staff that redirecting the money would be illegal.\n\nEver since disaster struck the island, Trump has shown a disdain that often crosses over into outright cruelty. In his trip to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the hurricane, Trump looked like an out-of-touch buffoon as he threw paper towels to a crowd of Puerto Ricans.\n\nLater, he used racist tropes to denigrate the citizens of Puerto Rico, saying they \"want everything to be done for them.\" Trump regularly attacked the mayor of San Juan, even as the city was struggling to rebuild.\n\nWhen information came to light that far more people died in the hurricane and aftermath than initially reported, Trump flat-out denied the truth, and then whined that he was not being given enough credit for the recovery effort.\n\nAs Trump showed the worst of what humanity could do, several heroes did their best to restore faith in humankind. Chef Jose Andres went to Puerto Rico and helped feed hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nBroadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda resumed his title role in the smash musical \"Hamilton\" during a two-week run in Puerto Rico, with all the profits going to charities on the island.\n\nLate-night television host Jimmy Fallon recently went to the island to film several episodes. When asked why he went, Fallon said, \"I'm American, and we've got to step up, we've to help each other.\"\n\nSadly, Fallon's attitude is not shared by Trump, nor congressional Republicans who turned a blind eye after Hurricane Maria struck.\n\nHowever, the new Democratic majority is determined to let those on the island know they are not forgotten. \"Unlike Republican legislation that was brought up in December, House Democrats' bill meets the urgent health care and nutrition needs of Americans in the territories, including Puerto Rico,\" Lowey said.\n\n\"The suffering of our fellow Americans in #PuertoRico has been ignored far too long by the Trump Administration \u2014 and now the President will try to block important support for rebuilding efforts, including nutrition assistance for families,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) tweeted. \"This cruelty cannot stand,\" she added.\n\nTrump may try to prevent nutrition assistance to the American citizens determined to rebuild their homes, but Pelosi, congressional Democrats, and good-hearted people everywhere will prevail.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump really shouldn't be bragging about all the jobs he thinks he's created when he's forcing thousands of employees to work without getting paid.\n\nTrump shut down the government nearly a month ago, and he's forcing tens of thousands of workers to do their jobs without pay, but he's still demanding credit for his bang-up job in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Last year was the best year for American Manufacturing job growth since 1997, or 21 years,\" he tweeted Monday morning. \"The previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the U.S., 'you would need a magic wand.' I guess I found the MAGIC WAND - and it is only getting better!\"\n\nIt's a bizarrely timed claim to make, given that he shut down the government a month ago, depriving 800,000 federal workers of their paychecks. Last week, his administration announced it is forcing thousands of employees to return to work \u2014 but they still won't be getting paid.\n\nJobs don't mean much if they don't come with pay.\n\nWhile Trump boasts about supposed job growth, experts are increasingly anxious about the longterm consequences and cost of his shutdown, and starting to whisper the word \"recession.\"\n\n\"Across Wall Street, analysts are rushing out warnings that missed federal paychecks, dormant government contractors and shelved corporate stock offerings could push first-quarter growth close to or even below zero if the shutdown,\" Politico reports.\n\nAnd experts were already worried, even before Trump shut down the government. The Republican tax bill, rammed through Congress at the end of 2017, has failed to deliver the economic boom Trump and his party swore it would. Trump's extended trade war isn't helping either.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House itself is admitting that it did not properly anticipate the effect of Trump's shutdown, which could be far more expensive and damaging to the economy than Trump's advisers originally thought.\n\nNone of this is phasing Trump, however. On Sunday, he tweeted his thanks \"to all of the great people who are working so hard for your Country and not getting paid\" \u2014 as if they have any say in the matter.\n\nHe has repeatedly claimed, without any evidence at all, that those hundreds of thousands of workers are happy to go without paychecks in order to ensure that he gets funding for his wall.\n\n\"So this really does have a higher purpose than next week\u2019s pay,\" Trump told reporters earlier this month. \"And the people that won't get next week's pay, or the following week's pay \u2014 I think if you ever really looked at those people, I think they'd say, Mr. President, keep going. This is far more important.\"\n\nNone of that is true, of course. Federal workers \u2014 along with the rest of America \u2014 have made their objection to Trump's shutdown perfectly clear. Polling shows the majority of the country wants Trump to reopen the government immediately and is not interested in giving him $5 billion to build a wall.\n\nTSA reports a rise in absences because those workers who have been deemed \"essential\" and are required to show up to work even without getting paid are refusing to do so. Many workers are relying on donations and food banks to support their families while Trump holds their paychecks hostage.\n\nAnd none of them are expressing gratitude to Trump for putting them in this position.\n\nBut to Trump, none of that matters. Instead, he's stealing a snarky headline from the far-right website Twitchy to boast of his imaginary \"magic wand,\" while ignoring all the very real damage he's actually doing.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And a new Washington Post story exposes one reason why: Cowardly Republicans are too afraid of Trump to do their basic constitutional duties.\n\nTrump still insists that he will refuse to sign a bill reopening the federal government unless it contains the $5.7 billion ransom he's demanding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nJust a month ago, the Senate unanimously passed a bill that would fund the federal government without paying Trump's ransom. Now, however, the Post reports that most Senate Republicans who voted for that bill \"have all but surrendered\" to Trump's will, and are too scared of Trump to even consider doing the same thing again.\n\nThe Post asked Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of the few Senate Republicans still willing to consider funding the government without the wall, if she thought her colleagues who disagreed with her were afraid to cross Trump. \"I think some are, absolutely,\" Murkowski said.\n\nAs majority leader, much of the blame for this cowardice falls on McConnell's shoulders.\n\nIf he cared to, McConnell could at least put pressure on Trump to end the shutdown by letting the Senate pass a bill reopening the government. McConnell could allow the Senate to vote on one of the many bills passed by House Democrats to end the shutdown, some of which are identical to the bill the Senate already passed.\n\nAs newspapers around the country have noted, the Senate even could \u2014 and should \u2014 override a potential Trump veto and reopen the government.\n\nBut McConnell refuses to do any of this, and most of the GOP caucus is following in his cowardly footsteps. He's demonstrating poor leadership, and even his own hometown paper is slamming him for it.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution created Congress as a co-equal branch of government. There is nothing stopping McConnell and his Senate colleagues from passing a bill to end the Trump shutdown, other than their own cowardice.\n\nDue to the shutdown, 800,000 federal workers are not receiving their paychecks, including some members of the military. FBI agents say Trump is endangering national security, airline pilots say air travel is less safe, and most of the nation's food supply is not being inspected. Thousands of people might be unjustly evicted from their homes.\n\nIn the end, there are no Republican heroes who will step up and defy Trump. Voters across the country knew this in 2018, which is one reason why Democrats won historic victories and regained control of the House of Representatives.\n\nBut with Republicans ceding their constitutional duties to the White House, America remains paralyzed in the midst of a shutdown. Families are worried \u2014 but Republicans are more concerned about Trump's wrath than the well-being of their constituents.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And what he came up with was comically bad: quoting Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech to brag about the wall.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was, 'Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy,' You think of how he changed America. He inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union.\n\nMike Pence is right. That quote from the \"I Have a Dream\" speech is a great quote. However, it's not entirely clear what Pence is talking about when he says that King \"inspired us to change through the legislative process\" when MLK was, arguably, the best practitioner of civil disobedience as a pressure point to achieve change.\n\nBut it gets worse.\n\nThat's exactly what President Trump is calling on the Congress to do. Come to the table in a spirit of good faith. We'll secure our border, we\u2019ll reopen the government and we'll move our nation forward as the president said yesterday to even a broader discussion about immigration reform in the months ahead.\n\nYes, Pence said that Donald Trump's zeal for a wall that cuts through communities and bars people, largely people of color, from entering the United States is just like Martin Luther King Jr.'s wish that all people live in freedom and equality.\n\nConservatives love Martin Luther King Jr. For them, he is a vessel into which they can pour their most racist and crackpot theories and assure us that MLK would have completely agreed. One of the worst of these was when a GOP congressman, Brad Wenstrup, went on Fox News to explain that the FBI opening a counterintelligence operation on Trump, a possible Russian asset, is just like the FBI spying on MLK.\n\nJust because Pence seeking to capitalize on Martin Luther King Jr.'s historical legacy isn't a novel move doesn't make it any less disgusting. An administration as flagrantly racist as this one should never be allowed to co-opt Dr. King's words for any purpose, much less for a wall that serves as a testament to the racist, nativist ugliness of Trump himself.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Appreciate it.\"\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nWATCH: President Trump and Vice President Pence visit the MLK Memorial in Washington, D.C. https://t.co/lb2RTpUiLK pic.twitter.com/ih2zB0ZqVW \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) January 21, 2019\n\nTrump never originally scheduled the visit, nor did Pence. Neither he nor Pence listed any events for the King holiday on their public schedule.\n\nWhen the news emerged, outlets like Splinter noted, \"Trump isn't making any effort to honor a man whose values were so diametrically opposed to his own.\" The Daily Beast put the snub into context, noting, \"Last year on MLK Day, Trump went golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida.\"\n\nIn the past, Trump has been extremely reactive to both praise and criticism of him in the media. He takes it so seriously that he has made major policy decisions affecting the lives of millions based solely on television.\n\nIt is entirely possible that Trump was made aware of how bad snubbing King made him look, and then hustled with Pence for a visit to the memorial to cover up his behavior.\n\nTrump is a racist. He is opposed to the race-blind society King fought for and was killed over. His lack of interest in King is on full view to the world every day of his presidency and a made-for-TV photo-op won't change that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Polls are already looking good for Stacey Abrams, who is considering running for Senate in 2020 to unseat the pro-Trump Republican David Perdue.\n\nAccording to a new poll, voters in Georgia could help turn the Senate blue again in 2020.\n\nStacey Abrams, a Democrat who narrowly lost the 2018 governor's race to Brian Kemp, is considering a 2020 Senate run against the Republican incumbent, David Perdue \u2014 and she's already more popular in Georgia than Perdue, according to a new poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nAbrams enjoys a healthy 52 percent approval rating overall, and gets positive marks from 60 percent of women, two in three moderates, and 90 percent of black voters. The same poll shows Perdue with just a 45 percent approval rating.\n\nCNN reports that Abrams recently met with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), who is heading up Democratic efforts to regain control of the Senate in 2020, to talk about a possible run against Perdue. And if Abrams decided to run, CNN notes, she would \"instantly be a front-runner in the Democratic primary, and be able to draw on a fundraising base that powered her to a record-breaking $22 million haul in 2018.\"\n\nAbrams, a black woman, also hasn't ruled out a 2022 gubernatorial rematch against Kemp, who implemented numerous voter suppression tactics against minority communities in his former role as Georgia's secretary of state. Abrams received more votes than any Democratic candidate in state history, but it wasn't enough to overcome the barriers Kemp threw in the way.\n\nWhichever office Abrams decides to run for, she is already laying solid groundwork for it. She recently kicked off a \"thank you tour\" across Georgia, seeking to \"outline ways to stay involved during the legislative session and beyond,\" the Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nAs Abrams listens to the people of Georgia, Perdue, a first-term senator, has been busy ingratiating himself to the increasingly unpopular Trump.\n\nWhen the Trump administration started its unconscionable practice of ripping families apart at the southern border, Perdue brushed it off as the \"shiny object of the day.\" The administration stole at least 2,700 children away from their families, and likely thousands more than that \u2014 but Perdue doesn't think that's important.\n\nPerdue is known to be part of \"what passes for a circle of trust within the Trump White House, consulting and advising the president behind the scenes,\" according to a Savannah Morning News editorial. \"This allegiance could make Perdue vulnerable if the election is a referendum on Trump\u2019s performance.\"\n\nIf that's the case, Perdue is certainly in trouble. The same Journal-Constitution poll that showed Abrams with a high 52 percent approval rating in Georgia also showed that Trump is deeply unpopular in the state.\n\nFewer than 38 percent of Georgians approve of Trump, including less than one in five independents. In fact, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has higher a higher approval rating than Trump, 39 percent, in what was once considered a deep red state.\n\nThis suggests that Georgia could be a key swing state in the presidential race as well as in the Senate.\n\nAbrams told Politico that in 2020, Georgia \"will be a battleground state, I believe, for the first time in more than 20 years.\"\n\nAbrams, who said she will decide on her next steps in March, energized Democrats in Georgia and across the nation in her 2018 bid for governor. Now she is in a good position to do the same in 2020 \u2014 and possibly tip the balance of power in the Senate.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump and Pence are rejecting a chance to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. after President Obama embraced his legacy.\n\nBoth Trump and Mike Pence initially refused to hold any public events to honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. on MLK Day.\n\nNeither Trump nor Pence listed any public events on their schedules released to journalists for MLK Day 2019. The rejection of King is a break from recent presidential tradition.\n\nOn his last MLK Day while in office, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama visited a homeless shelter in Washington, D.C., and painted a mural of King on a \"Wall of Hope.\" The year before, the Obamas visited a D.C. elementary school to participate in a National Day of Service.\n\nFor his first King Day in office, Trump embraced racism early by attacking civil rights icon and hero Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who served alongside Dr. King in the fight for racial equality. Trump followed that up by using his presidential campaign to send a casual and cavalier message of \"thoughts and prayers\" to King's family.\n\nIn office, Trump has embodied the values of intolerance that King fought against his entire life. Trump has repeatedly invoked racist ideas and language while denigrating non-Christians. He even praised neo-Nazis as \"very fine people.\"\n\nAt every turn, Trump has tried to roll America back to the sort of country it was before King and the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nBut he has failed. Americans have risen up, resisted him, and repeatedly shown that the path the vast majority of citizens want is the \"dream\" King so eloquently spoke of.\n\nTrump chose not to honor King and it speaks volumes about the values he embodies and the mindset he operates with.\n\nUpdate: At 11 a.m., Trump and Pence headed to the Martin Luther King Memorial for a surprise visit. The trip was not listed on either of their schedules, so it isn't clear when exactly the White House decided on the need for some sort of gesture to honor MLK after all.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump was denying Pelosi and other members of the delegation use of military aircraft to make the journey \u2014 but suggested she could fly commercially if the trip was so important to her.\n\nVisiting U.S. troops was so important to Pelosi that she and her colleagues decided to do exactly that. So Trump ruined that too.\n\n\"After President Trump revoked the use of military aircraft to travel to Afghanistan, the delegation was prepared to fly commercially to proceed with this vital trip to meet with our commanders and troops on the front lines,\" said Drew Hammill, spokesman for Pelosi, in a statement Friday morning.\n\nApparently, the House speaker's determination to visit with our troops did not sit well with Trump.\n\n\"This morning, we learned that the Administration had leaked the commercial travel plans as well,\" Hammill said.\n\nLeaking such highly sensitive information \u2014 all out of an act of unbelievable pettiness, in an attempt to punish and humiliate Pelosi \u2014 led the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service to determine that the danger to Pelosi, her colleagues, and the troops she was going to visit \"had significantly increased,\" according to Hammill.\n\n\"In light of the grave threats caused by the President\u2019s action, the delegation has decided to postpone the trip so as not to further endanger our troops and security personnel, or the other travelers on the flights,\" Hammill said.\n\nIt is disgraceful enough that Trump would try to prevent members of Congress from fulfilling one of their obligations to meet with troops and military leaders stationed in a war zone, to punish them for refusing to give him $5 billion to build a wall.\n\nIt is, however, much worse that he would endanger not only their safety but the safety of our military in order to carry out his petulant act of vengeance.\n\nIn his Thursday letter, Trump claimed that \"postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate\" because of the 800,00 federal workers whose paychecks he is holding hostage because of his shut down.\n\nBut Trump has made it abundantly clear that he couldn't care less about those workers. Earlier this month, he has baselessly claimed that those workers are happy to sacrifice their paychecks to the \"higher purpose\" of his ransom demand.\n\nThose workers are facing an increasingly dire financial situation, forced to rely on donations and food banks to support their families during Trump's extended tantrum.\n\n\"Whether here or abroad, the Speaker always thanks our troops, diplomats and intelligence community for their heroism and service,\" Pelosi's spokesperson said.\n\nSadly, the supposed commander in chief doesn't share that sentiment. He'd much rather inflict a childish and dangerous insult because he's not getting what he wants \u2014 even if that puts our troops in danger.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump just wasted everyone's Saturday with another pointless, racist pitch for his unpopular wall.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump delivered what was billed as a \"major announcement,\" supposedly to address the ongoing crisis he created by shutting down the government in December.\n\nInstead, Trump delivered what was essentially the same boring prime-time speech he gave earlier this month, in which he demanded \u2014 for the zillionth time \u2014 that Congress give him $5 billion to build his wall.\n\nLike his first speech, he spouted absurd and baseless claims about drugs and crime, going so far as to suggest that his wall could cut the crime rate in the United States in half. And he continued to attack Democrats, while at the same time demanding that they work with him to end his shutdown.\n\n\"The radical left can never control our borders. I will not let it happen,\" Trump said.\n\nThe new part of Trump's Saturday speech was an offer of temporary relief to Dreamers \u2014 those young Americans brought to this country by their families when they were children.\n\nOf course, those young Americans already had protection under DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But in 2017, the Trump administration announced it was terminating the program, for no reason other than to try to use those 800,000 young lives as bargaining chips, throwing their lives into chaos as they faced the threat of deportation.\n\nNow, Trump once again is callously treating those immigrants, whose lives he couldn't care less about, as bargaining chips to extort billions of dollars from American taxpayers. Taxpayers, by the way, who do not support his wall and most definitely do not support his shutdown, which he has continued for almost a month.\n\nTrump's \"compromise\" is already dead on arrival. House Democrats have passed several bills to reopen the government, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to even hold a vote on any of them. Trump has insisted he would veto any bill to reopen the government that does not address his $5 billion ransom demand.\n\nBut Democrats have made clear they are not going to give Trump money for a wall most people don't support and that will in no way provide real immigration reform.\n\n\u201cDemocrats were hopeful that the President was finally willing to re-open government and proceed with a much-need discussion to protect the border,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement just before Trump's speech.\n\nBut Trump's proposal, Pelosi said, \"is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives.\"\n\nThat Trump is offering only a three-year reprieve for Dreamers, rather than a permanent solution, is one of several reasons his \"compromise\" is unacceptable.\n\nPelosi also noted that the House will pass yet more bills next week to reopen the government.\n\n\"The President must sign these bills to re-open government immediately and stop holding the American people hostage with this senseless shutdown,\" Pelosi said. \"Each day he prolongs this needless crisis, Coast Guardsmen, FBI agents, border patrol officers, TSA agents, and hundreds of thousands more workers are forced to live without knowing how they can feed their families or pay their bills.\"\n\nNearly 1 million federal workers have had to go without pay and are about to miss yet another paycheck soon if Trump continues to keep the government shut. Those workers are becoming increasingly desperate, forced to rely on donations and food banks to support themselves and their families.\n\nThe solution to the problem entirely of Trump's making is clear. Both the House and Senate have voted for bills to reopen the government. It is up to Trump \u2014 the same man who insisted, during his campaign, that when it comes to America's problems, \"I alone can fix it\" \u2014 to do his job.\n\nTrump \"has taken pride in shutting down government,\" Pelosi said. \"Now, he must take action to open up government.\""

Not only did she fly on a government plane to get there, but at all times she is under the protection of a Secret Service detail.\n\nBecause of the shutdown, those agents will not be paid while defending her life.\n\nYet at the same time Trump allowed his wife to enjoy these luxuries, he canceled a trip led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to thank soldiers stationed in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump revealed the details of the trip through his cancellation letter, while his henchmen leaked the details of a planned commercial flight that Pelosi's team had begun planning.\n\nThe actions from Trump and his team created a security breach for Pelosi, who is second in line to the presidency behind Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nTrump then announced that he had canceled all congressional travel and continued to cite the shutdown for his reasoning.\n\nBut Trump is a hypocrite.

Adam Schiff (D-CA), has also expressed his intent to investigate whether some witnesses may have misled the committee during testimony \u2014 and, if warranted, to bring perjury charges against those witnesses.\n\nOn Sunday, Schiff said he has concerns that \"multiple witnesses\" may have committed perjury, and he has previously stated that \"the testimony of Don Jr., Erik Prince, Roger Stone and others is inconsistent with the public reports of meetings, conversations and other facts that have now been established.\"\n\nSpeier reiterated those concerns Tuesday night while addressing the Women\u2019s National Democratic Club in Washington.\n\n\"There are a number of persons that testified before the committee that I feel were not telling the truth,\" Speier said.\n\nNow that Democrats are in control of the committee, they can finally investigate these instances of potential perjury \u2014 and they're starting with the president's son.\n\nDemocratic committee members have previously pointed to inconsistencies in Trump Jr.'s testimony about his June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer promising \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton.\n\nAmong other things, Trump Jr. failed to disclose his father\u2019s involvement in crafting a misleading statement to deceive the public about the true purpose of the Trump Tower meeting.\n\nOther reports suggest that Trump Jr. may have lied when he testified that no foreign governments had offered or provided assistance to the Trump campaign, despite his attendance at a meeting when representatives from the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said they wanted to help the campaign with a \"social media manipulation effort.\"\n\nDespite these clear inconsistencies, Republicans on the committee refused to provide oversight and blocked efforts by Democrats to obtain documents to investigate whether any witnesses perjured themselves.\n\nThe Republicans who controlled the committee ultimately ended the investigation, and wrote their report, without even interviewing a slew of key witnesses.\n\nSpeier criticized that report as a \"whitewash\" on Tuesday, and said Democrats would work to obtain the documents that Republicans had refused to subpoena.\n\n\"Those documents were never subpoenaed by the Republicans and so they were able to just produce a whitewashed report that probably was written by someone on the presidential staff. I think it was truly a disturbing series of events over the last two years,\" Speier said.\n\nWith Republicans in control of Congress for the last two years, Trump and his associates have not had to face any actual oversight or scrutiny. But all of that changed when Democrats won the majority in the House \u2014 and Trump Jr. is about to be the first to face this new reality.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Those 38 visits were listed on a special \"VIP Arrivals\" list alerting staff to the presence of elite guests, so the actual number of stays could have been higher.\n\nThe surge of bookings came just as T-Mobile started pursuing a merger with Sprint valued at $26 billion. If the merger went through, the combined companies would have over 127 million customers and reduce the number of major wireless competitors from four to three.\n\nSuch a massive deal requires federal approval, which is where the Trump hotel bookings start to look very suspicious. When companies like T-Mobile do business with Trump's hotel, it can be a direct means of bribing him when they need regulatory help from the federal government.\n\nTrump personally makes money off of his hotel, since he has refused to follow tradition and put his assets in a blind trust or sell them off after assuming the presidency.

In a sharp contrast, Democrats elected 35 new women members in 2018.\n\nThe two new Gregs are Reps. Greg Pence from Indiana and Greg Steube from Florida. The lone new woman Republican elected was Rep. Carol Miller of West Virginia.\n\nThe startling contrast was pointed out by a Bloomberg reporter \u2014 ironically named Greg \u2014 during an event host by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) about encouraging more Republican women to run for office. During the event, Stefanik noted a \"crisis level of Republican women in Congress.\"\n\nAfter Republicans wholeheartedly embraced admitted sexual predator Donald Trump's candidacy in 2016, then unreservedly supported accused child molester Roy Moore for Senate in 2017, and then enthusiastically embraced alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court in 2018, women voters overwhelmingly rejected Republicans in the 2018 midterms. At the same time, a record number of women ran for public office as Democrats.\n\nWhile the new Congress has a record number of women, the overwhelming majority of women are Democrats. In fact, the GOP has only 13 women in a House caucus that is 90 percent white men. There are 89 Democratic women in the new Democratic House majority.\n\nWhen Stefanik spoke out after the election about the need to support more Republican women, the man leading the GOP's 2020 campaign efforts, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) called it a \"mistake.\"\n\nWhile Republicans elected more new \"Gregs\" than women, voters elected new Democratic women all over the country. In fact, voters elected more new women named Katie from California (two: Rep. Katie Hill and Rep. Katie Porter) than Republican new women in the entire nation.\n\nThe Republican Party embraces men who abuse and attack women, and embrace policies that deny women control over their own health care and bodies. Trump's vile treatment of women is causing even longstanding Republican women to abandon the party.\n\nIn Kansas, state Sen. Barbara Bollier ditched the Republican Party after four decades, in large part due to Trump's vulgarity toward women.\n\nStefanik is correct in identifying a crisis. But until the Republican Party stops supporting sexual predators and attempted rapists, women are likely going to continue supporting Democrats.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "\"He seems to be running away from us,\" said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has spent two days hiding from a group of determined freshman House Democrats trying to meet with him in hopes of ending the Trump shutdown.\n\nThe effort, spearheaded by Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA), began yesterday with a group of more than a dozen freshman House members walking across the Capitol to seek a meeting with McConnell.\n\n\"We have, since we have gotten here, been voting over and over again to take steps to reopen government, (which is) exactly what the American people asked us to do,\" Hill said on the first day McConnell hid from her and her colleagues. \"Mitch McConnell refuses to take any of those to a vote.\"\n\nIn December, Trump threw a tantrum demanding $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In a televised meeting with Democratic leaders, Trump said he would be \"proud\" to own a shutdown if Democrats refused to pay his ransom. On the first day of the new Congress, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) led the new Democratic majority in passing bills to end the Trump shutdown, but without funding for a wall.\n\nMcConnell, in a complete abdication of his constitutional duties, refused to even bring up House-passed funding bills for a vote. He went so far as to say such a vote is \"absolutely pointless.\"\n\nWhile McConnell has been trying to keep a low profile during the shutdown, his refusal to lift a finger to help end it has earned him the ire of newspapers across the country, including one in his home state of Kentucky.\n\nThe effort by the freshman House Democrats seeks to highlight McConnell's cowardly refusal to even hold a vote on the issue. They want to meet with McConnell in hopes of finding common ground to reopen the government, but McConnell refuses to show his face.\n\n\"He seems to be running away from us,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told the press after a second day of McConnell in hiding. The group of Democrats say they \"ran on political activism and are now bringing it to Congress,\" reports a Washington Post reporter.\n\n\"We're all sick of this shutdown and the suffering it has caused for the 800,000 federal workers,\" Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) said in a statement today, adding she went to McConnell's office \"to urge him to do his job and end this unnecessary shutdown once and for all, so we can begin to focus on policy.\"\n\nWhile the word \"leader\" is in his title, McConnell is failing to provide any leadership on this issue. New members of the Democratic freshman class have only been in Congress for a few weeks, they are showing more courage and care for what happens to this country than McConnell, who has been in office for 34 years.\n\n\"This is Washington politics at its worst,\" Rep. Chris Pappas (D-NH) said. \"This is a national embarrassment,\" he added.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump allegedly told his lawyer to lie to Congress \u2014 which would be an impeachable offense.\n\nTrump will be investigated by at least two committees in the House of Representatives in light of a new report alleging that he directed his personal lawyer to lie to Congress, a federal crime.\n\nBuzzfeed reported, based on information from two federal law enforcement sources, that special counsel Robert Mueller has evidence that Trump \"personally instructed\" Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the details of negotiations to open a Trump Tower in Moscow, Russia. This evidence reportedly includes texts, emails, and interviews with other witnesses, not just Cohen's testimony.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC the newly uncovered information is \"powerful evidence of collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives.\n\n\"He is asking Michael Cohen to lie because the truth would expose what was going on with the Russians early on in the candidacy,\" Swalwell said.\n\n\"We know that the President has engaged in a long pattern of obstruction,\" Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), chairman of the House Judiciary committee, wrote on Twitter. \"Directing a subordinate to lie to Congress is a federal crime. The @HouseJudiciary Committee\u2019s job is to get to the bottom of it, and we will do that work.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement: \"The allegation that the President of the United States may have suborned perjury before our committee in an effort to curtail the investigation and cover up his business dealings with Russia is among the most serious to date. We will do what\u2019s necessary to find out if it\u2019s true.\"\n\nCohen is going to prison because he lied about Trump's Moscow deal to both the Senate and the House.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump claimed that he had no dealings with Russia. But this was a lie, and reporting has indicated that he may have been involved in negotiations with Russia over his tower as late as November 2016.\n\nTrump had at least 10 face-to-face meetings with Cohen about the deal, Buzzfeed reports. Meanwhile, his campaign team is known to have had over 100 contacts with Russian operatives during the campaign and transition.\n\nTrump appears to be at the head of a wide-ranging corrupt and criminal enterprise. Investigations have uncovered evidence of his personal involvement in numerous unethical and illegal dealings. For over two years, Republicans in Congress effectively gave him a complete pass for this, and instead rewarded a political ally and the head of their party.\n\nThis is a large part of why voters turned over control of the House to Democrats.\n\nNow the Democratic heads of committees tasked with upholding the law and conducting oversight of the executive branch are finally going to have Congress do the job it should have done long ago.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Tom Marino (R-PA) announced he will leave Congress to take a job in the private sector just two weeks after Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the gavel back for Democrats.\n\n\"As of January 23, 2019, I am officially stepping down from Congress,\" Marino said in a statement. He said he is going into the private sector, but did not say who he will be working for.\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Jared Smith linked Marino's retirement to his new role in the minority party of the House.\n\n\"It's no surprise that on the same day that House Republicans voted against ending the Trump Shutdown for the ninth time, one of their members has decided he's had enough,\" Smith said. \"While we certainly didn't expect the first Republican retirement to happen just two weeks after they were sworn into the minority, Tom Marino is just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nMarino's announcement comes exactly two weeks to the day after Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) reclaimed her rightful position as Speaker of the House and ushered in a new House Democratic majority. Rather than fulfill the commitment he made to the people of Pennsylvania to serve as their member of Congress in the new Republican minority, Marino decided to quit and go home.\n\nMarino is not even the first Republican to flee Congress after the 2018 wipeout. In the Senate, both Sens. Pat Roberts of Kansas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee announced they will not be running in 2020.\n\nMarino's soon-to-be former district is solidly red-leaning. Trump won it in 2016 by 33 points, and Marino won re-election in 2018 by a 66-34 margin.\n\nMarino entered Congress in the tea party-fueled election of 2010. Until two weeks ago, Marino only served as part of a majority in Congress, as Republicans desperately sought policies to undermine the health and economic prosperity of most Americans.\n\nHe joined the repeated failed efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. He was part of the GOP effort to implement a new health care law which would have caused 23 million people to lose access to health insurance and would have removed protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n\nWith Marino's exit, Trump loses one of his most loyal foot soldiers in Congress. Marino voted with Trump almost 98 percent of the time, clearly unwilling to stand up to any of Trump's whims.\n\nBut after voters from coast to coast rejected the policies of Trump and his congressional lackeys, Marino is no longer interested in fulfilling his duties.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, confirmed on Thursday that he hired a small tech company to rig online polls in favor of Trump \u2014 before the 2016 presidential campaign got started.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the scheme Thursday morning. According to the report, Cohen paid the company, called RedFinch Solutions, to artificially boost Trump's poll numbers in a 2014 CNBC online poll ranking the country's top business leaders, as well as a 2015 Drudge Report poll of potential GOP presidential candidates.\n\nA short time after the Wall Street Journal report was published, Cohen tweeted about the article and confirmed his involvement in the scheme to manipulate online polls, saying he had acted \"at the direction of and for the sole benefit of\" Trump.\n\nThe revelation provides new insight into the Trump campaign's use of digital deception, as well as its willingness to engage in efforts to manipulate the public in a bid to put Trump in the White House.\n\nAnd in this incident, as with so many others, the Trump campaign seemed to take a page right out of the Kremlin's playbook.\n\nArtificially boosting online poll numbers, as Trump allegedly did, may seem somewhat insignificant in its impact. But when used in conjunction with other forms of digital deception and propaganda, rigged polls can contribute to a phenomenon known as \"manufactured consensus,\" defined as \"giving the illusion of significant online popularity in order to build real political support.\"\n\nAs explained by researchers at the University of Oxford's Computational Propaganda Project, \"This theoretically has the effect of galvanizing political support where this might not previously have happened. To put it simply: the illusion of online support for a candidate can spur actual support through a bandwagon effect.\"\n\nTrump clearly knows this \u2014 and he has for quite some time. After all, long before he ran for president, Trump invented two fake personas to boost his own public image by calling into radio shows and bragging about himself.\n\nManufacturing consensus, which can be achieved through a variety of means on social media and other platforms, is also central to the disinformation operations used by the Kremlin at home and abroad.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has been known to rig public opinion polls in his favor, and the Kremlin often uses manipulated polls to influence public sentiment on issues that are important to the government.\n\nWhile the latest revelation only pertains to two online polls, it's not yet known if the campaign made other efforts to rig polls \u2014 and whether those efforts were larger and more successful. Manipulating online polls is frighteningly easy, aided by a black market that facilitates the sale of online votes."

    "text": "Trump has no idea what human trafficking actually looks like \u2014 but he's happy to make up stories about it to push for his wall.\n\nFear-mongering has always been Trump's go-to strategy for drumming up support for his racist border wall. He constantly lies about immigrants bringing drugs, disease, and terrorism into the country \u2014 but his new favorite boogeyman is human trafficking.\n\nTrump has started telling frightening tales about women being kidnapped and brought over the border and arguing that a border wall would somehow solve this problem. In just the past two weeks, Trump has told repeated stories about women being \"thrown into vehicles\" with \"tape over their mouths\" and transported through illegal entry ports.\n\n\"They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs,\" Trump said in a speech Monday. \"They put them in the back seat of cars and vans, and they go \u2014 they don\u2019t come in through your port of entry, because you\u2019d see them. You couldn\u2019t do that.\"\n\nBut according to trafficking experts, Trump's tales are so misleading that they more closely resemble depictions from \"action films\" than anything seen in real life.\n\nThe Toronto Star spoke with six trafficking experts from around the country, all of whom said they had met \"no trafficking victims who had suffered anything like the experience Trump described.\"\n\n\"Either he\u2019s watching action films or he\u2019s watching some other type of movie that involves handcuffs and tape over people\u2019s mouths,\" Lori Cohen, director of an anti-trafficking organization, told the Star. \"But in neither case is it based in any reality of what individuals helping trafficking victims see.\"\n\nMartina Vandenberg, president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center, told the Star that Trump's depiction of the problem \"is practically unrecognizable to those of us who have spent decades in the trenches combating these abuses.\"\n\nOther experts provided similar accounts.\n\n\"I have never had a case where someone\u2019s mouth was taped up and they were brought across the border in the way the president described,\" said Bridgette Carr, director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School.\n\nAs for Trump's claim that a border wall could \"eliminate\" human trafficking from Mexico, experts said this isn't even close to accurate.\n\nMost trafficking victims fall prey to verbal coercion in which traffickers promise them a better life in the U.S. Then, after arriving in the country and realizing that the jobs they were promised don't exist, victims are kept against their will through threats, violence, or a combination of both.\n\nMany victims \"arrive on visas fraudulently obtained by traffickers. Others are exploited by traffickers after they independently arrive in the U.S. on visas,\" the Star reported. \"None of these people would be helped by a wall.\"\n\nNot only would Trump's border fail to address the problem of human trafficking, but his policies are actually making life harder for the victims he claims to care about.\n\nFor example, as the Star noted, the Trump's administration has slashed the number of visas available to protect trafficking victims from deportation if they cooperate with law enforcement.\n\nAs one expert told the publication, if Trump cares about solving the problem of human trafficking, he should stop implementing policies that \"play into the hands of the pimps.\"\n\nBut Trump doesn't care about addressing the problem \u2014 he cares about his border wall, and he's willing to lie, fear-monger, and exploit victims to get it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A government watchdog found that the agency that said Trump's D.C. hotel lease was just fine never bothered to look at the Constitution.\n\nFrom day one, it appeared that Trump's continued ownership of his D.C. hotel could present a violation of the Emoluments Clause. Now, a government watchdog has called out the General Services Administration (GSA) for ignoring that very issue.\n\nThe Emoluments Clause prohibits the president from profiting from any dealings with foreign governments. Therefore, Trump retaining ownership of a hotel that routinely houses foreign dignitaries would seem to run afoul of that clause.\n\nHousing foreign dignitaries seems to be the only way the hotel does stay profitable. The hotel went into the black earlier this year thanks to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia having several members of his delegation stay there.\n\nThere's also the problem of the hotel's lease. The Old Post Office, which houses the hotel, is leased to the Trump Organization by the GSA. That would have been fine, had Trump not become president. The lease specifically prohibits any elected official from sharing in any part of the lease.\n\nOn its face, it seemed clear that Trump couldn't continue to run his hotel, both because the lease would prohibit it and because he'd be profiting off members of foreign governments staying at the hotel. Weirdly, however, the GSA concluded that everything was just fine.\n\nExcept it wasn't. The GSA's Office of the Inspector General reviewed the deal and found that the GSA never considered whether the arrangement violated the Emoluments Clause. The GSA lawyers who reviewed the deal simply refused to consider the issue because it was a constitutional issue, and they thought that was outside their purview.\n\nThey literally said they didn't want to \"spin their wheels\" thinking about it and figured they could address the issue at another time. Even worse, the GSA attorneys said there might really be a violation of the Emoluments Clause, but they decided to \"punt\" the issue.\n\nThat didn't fly with the inspector general, who pointed out that the GSA is obliged to uphold the Constitution, just like everybody else, and therefore they needed to address it.\n\nThis isn't the only Emoluments Clause issue Trump faces. There's an ongoing lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Washington D.C. and Maryland, alleging that Trump's hotel is siphoning business away from other hotels in the area.\n\nThere's also the part where domestic companies, seeking to curry favor with Trump, stay at his hotel when they have business before the government.\n\nSadly, the Inspector General report doesn't say that the lease should be voided, but only that the GSA should reconsider the constitutional issues. It doesn't look like the GSA plans to do that. They issued a response in which they patted themselves on the back for the fact the report didn't find that any constitutional violations had occurred, but instead that it was merely possible.\n\nIt looks like the GSA is going to continue to punt on this issue, which isn't surprising since they make $3 million per year from the lease. But the rest of us know that this Trump is profiting from the presidency in obscene and unprecedented ways \u2014 and it's probably illegal too.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Rudy Giuliani continues his incredibly ineffective representation of Donald Trump.\n\nLast night, Rudy Giuliani went on CNN to talk about collusion, and it did not go well. That's because Rudy got in a shouting match with Chris Cuomo over whether Rudy had previously said the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia.\n\nNow, you'd expect that Giuliani's position here would be that no one had colluded, but you would be wrong. Instead, he went off on Cuomo for \"misstating\" his position. What is Rudy's position? That other people in the campaign colluded with Russia, but not Trump: \"I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign!\"\n\nRudy went on to move the goalposts in a remarkable fashion, declaring \"There is not a single bit of evidence the President of the United States committed the only crime you can commit here, conspiring with the Russians to hack the DNC.\"\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other possible crimes covered by collusion besides whether Trump worked with the Russians to hack the DNC email servers. Also, there's the fact that the Russians did indeed try to hack the DNC the same day Trump asked Russia to hack Clinton's emails. But perhaps most of all, there's a real problem with admitting that collusion may have utterly surrounded the president and somehow believing that the president wasn't touched by that.\n\nIt's a constant source of bewilderment that Rudy Giuliani retains his job as Trump's lawyer, given his near-perpetual ability to say precisely the wrong thing all the time. He recently told Fox News he wasn't really sure when his client stopped working with Russia on the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Last summer, he told George Stephanopoulos that maybe Trump did know, in advance, about the June 2016 meeting, where members of the Trump campaign met with Russians to try to get incriminating material on Hillary Clinton. And earlier in 2018, he went on television to say that it \"was not uncommon\" for Trump to make hush-money payoffs.\n\nBesides admitting the Trump campaign was rife with colluders, Rudy also used his CNN experience to make Trump sound even more disconnected and dumb than usual, insisting that Trump didn't know anything about the changes to the 2016 Republican platform that were made during the RNC. Those changes weakened the party's stance on protecting Ukraine from Russia.\n\nAccording to Giuliani, \"the president had no knowledge\" of the change to his platform. Cuomo was incredulous about this, so Rudy went on to insist that \"candidates don't know a damned thing about the platform.\" Cuomo pointed out that he was \"raised by a guy [Mario Cuomo, longtime governor of New York] who would have corrected the punctuation in the platform.\"\n\nIt says a lot that the best picture Giuliani can paint of Trump is that he was a buffoon who didn't know his party's own platform and was surrounded by people colluding with a foreign country.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A new investigation reveals Trump's cruel family separation policy was even worse than previously reported.\n\nTrump's unconscionable policy of ripping immigrant children away from their families likely affected thousands more children than the administration has previously acknowledged, according to an internal investigation into Trump's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\n\"The total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities is unknown,\" the Office of the Inspector General reports. But the report estimates that \"thousands of children\" \u2014 in addition to the 2,737 children already identified as being separated from their parents \u2014 may have also been separated in 2017, before a federal judge ordered the administration to reunite separated families.\n\nTrump's family separations garnered national and international outrage, and galvanized huge protests against the cruel and dangerous policies.\n\nThe public disgust peaked in the summer of 2018, when investigations revealed that infants and toddlers were being thrown into baby jails, euphemistically called \"tender age facilities.\" People were shocked by images of young children being ripped from their families and audio recordings of frightened toddlers wailing for their mothers and fathers.\n\nRetired four-star general Michael Hayden, former head of the CIA and NSA, compared Trump's family separations to similar actions taken by Nazi Germany.\n\n\"The report released today by HHS paints a drab picture of the realities at these agencies,\" Rep. Lou Correa (D-CA), who led a congressional letter requesting an investigation into the family separation policy, said in a statement. \"I am deeply concerned that any federal agency would implement such a horrific policy so haphazardly.\"\n\nIt's horrifying that thousands of additional children may have been ripped from their families and unaccounted for. But it's also hardly surprising, given how shockingly incompetent and haphazard the Trump administration's handling of the policy has been since the beginning.\n\nAt first, administration officials denied that the family separation policy existed at all. Then they gleefully embraced it as a cruel deterrent that might discourage families from migrating to the U.S. \u2014 and even a point of leverage to negotiate funding for Trump's border wall.\n\nThen, after a federal court stepped in to require the government to reunite the kidnapped children with their families, an investigation revealed that the administration hadn't even bothered to keep proper records about separated families. Border patrol agents used a chaotic system of more than 60 databases, which made it incredibly difficult to identify and locate separated family members \u2014 many of whom had been scattered across the country in different foster homes or detention facilities.\n\nThe Trump administration also regularly failed to meet court-ordered deadlines to reunite families, prolonging the emotional pain it had already inflicted on them.\n\nMany Republican members of Congress also stood by Trump, using lies and misinformation about immigration to support an abhorrent policy.\n\nBut at a December 2017 hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen got a taste of what a new Democratic majority will look like as she was grilled about the family separation policy.\n\n\"On what planet can a humane, democratic country deport parents without giving them the opportunity to have their children with them?\" Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) demanded to know. \"And without maintaining records so you could identify them afterwards?\"\n\nAs more information comes to light, the dark deeds of the Trump administration are proving to be even worse than we knew. But we can be confident that the new Democratic House majority will get to the bottom of it and hold the perpetrators responsible.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is frustrated that he can't just stomp his feet and end the shutdown.\n\nAs the Trump shutdown lingers, Trump himself is baffled that his insults, tantrums, and unpopular demands aren't working.\n\n\"We are getting crushed!\" Trump told White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, according to the New York Times. Trump, who was reacting to unflattering news coverage of the shutdown, bellowed, \"Why can't we get a deal?\"\n\nTrump may be understandably confused. For the past two years, he has relied on insulting congressional leaders and throwing childlike hissy fits in order to get his way. And when Trump lackeys like former Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) were in charge of Congress, the GOP would acquiesce to whatever he demanded.\n\nBut Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and the new House majority refuse to be bullied and intimidated by Trump's amateur tactics. Though that hasn't stopped Trump from trying.\n\nThe shutdown began in December when Trump, in a televised meeting with Democratic leaders, said he would be \"proud\" to own a shutdown unless he received $5.6 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump stormed out of a subsequent meeting with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) after Pelosi reiterated her stance against a wall.\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly passed bills to reopen the government, but every effort has been rejected by Trump and his chief accomplice, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell (R-KY) refuses to allow a vote in the GOP-controlled Senate, going so far as to call such a vote \"absolutely pointless.\"\n\nAll the while, Trump has undermined efforts by his own staff to come to a compromise. When Vice President Mike Pence went to the Democrats with an offer of $2.5 billion for a wall, rather than $5.6 billion, Trump rejected it hours after Democrats rejected it. Trump recently bragged that he would \"never ever back down\" from his demands about the wall.\n\nYet Trump wonders why he and his staff can't get a deal.\n\nBeyond his intransigence, Trump regularly lobs insults at Democratic leaders. Since Trump began the shutdown, he has referred to Schumer as \"Cryin' Chuck\" four separate times on Twitter. He recently called the left \"totally unhinged,\" and said \"the Radical Democrats are a Party of open borders and crime.\"\n\nTrump's lame tactics are failing to win over the minds of Democrats in Congress as he continues to lose the hearts of people across the country. Polls repeatedly show Americans place the blame for the shutdown at the feet of Trump and congressional Republicans.\n\nAnd new polls show Trump losing support not just among independents, but also among his base. \"For the first time, we saw a fairly consistent pattern of having his base showing evidence of a cracking,\" Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, recently told NPR.\n\nIn the most recent show of strength, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump suggesting he reschedule the State of the Union address if the government continues to be shut down. Such a move would deny Trump the one thing he craves most: being in the spotlight on national television.\n\nTrump \"wants Democrats to come back to the table agreeing with his position on a wall, and he does not understand why they have not,\" reports the Times.\n\nTrump's tantrums, insults, and outlandish demands always worked in the past. Trump is having difficulty adjusting to new congressional leadership that is willing to stand up for what is best for the country, and not simply give in to Trump's latest fit.\n\nHe better get used to it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans are happy to put up with Trump's tantrums, but Democrats aren't having it.\n\nMinority Whip Steve Scalise, the second-highest Republican in the House, is whining that Democrats won't waste time listening to Trump yell at them about his useless border wall.\n\n\"First Nancy Pelosi holds paychecks for federal workers hostage,\" the Louisiana congressman tweeted Wednesday, \"and now she holds 'moderate' Democrats hostage to her open borders agenda by not letting them go to the White House to find a solution that opens the government and secures the border!\"\n\nScalise's complaint was in response to the latest humiliation for Trump, who invited congressional Democrats to the White House in the hopes of dividing Democrats, who are unified in wanting to reopen the government without giving Trump $5 billion to build a wall.\n\nBut every single Democrat refused his invitation.\n\nInstead, Trump had to sit down with his fellow Republicans, who are being dragged down with him by a public that clearly rejects both the wall and shutting down the government over it.\n\nWhen Democratic leaders met with Trump last week to discuss ending his shutdown \u2014 now the longest in U.S. history \u2014 he threw a tantrum and stormed out after a mere 30 minutes.\n\nScalise apparently thinks congressional Democrats should waste more time watching Trump melt down about his wall.\n\nBut his complaint is especially hypocritical, considering he is part of the Republican operation keeping the government closed. He has voted against the Democratic bills introduced in the House that would reopen the government and help thousands of employees finally get their paychecks.\n\nThat's the kind of duplicity one might expect from a politician who infamously addressed a white supremacist rally and compared himself to a former grand wizard of the KKK, saying he is \"like David Duke without the baggage.\"\n\nNow Scalise is helping Trump keep the government shut down, denying paychecks to hundreds of thousands of workers. And he has the gall to claim, falsely, that it's the fault of Democrats.\n\nIn reality, Trump and his fellow Republicans are losing the fight over the shutdown, and it isn't even close.\n\nNow, increasingly desperate to find a way out of the mess they've made for themselves, they're trying to pin it on Democrats, who have offered a way out.\n\nBut Republicans leaders like Scalise aided are standing firmly with Trump, instead of the American people who want them to end this shutdown. And whining on Twitter about it isn't going to help them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is a failure, and Americans know it.\n\nTrump has officially cemented his place in history as an epic failure, based on a new comprehensive analysis by Gallup of Trump's first two years in office.\n\nTrump is the only president in modern history who has never once reached 50 percent approval during the first two years in office. He is also the only one with a two-year average approval rating below 40 percent.\n\n\"Trump has now registered the lowest first- and second-year job approval averages of elected presidents since World War II,\" Gallup reports, adding that he is \"well on his way to having the lowest average approval rating for any president\" since 1945, which is when Gallup began polling presidential approval.\n\nWhile Republicans continue to support Trump, Gallup notes that he'll need more than that to get re-elected. Looking forward, Trump's \"overall approval ratings in the 30s and subpar approval among independents currently give him long odds of winning the general election and a second term as president.\"\n\nTrump's massive unpopularity is hardly a surprise given the massive corruption, incompetence, and malevolence he has exhibited during his stint in office.\n\nThe culture of corruption in Washington exploded when Trump came to town. White House staffers and Cabinet officials are regularly embroiled in scandals of their own making, and resignations are rampant. Trump himself is at the center of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump's own former lawyer admitted in federal court that Trump ordered him to commit felonies in order to influence the election's outcome.\n\nOn the policy front, Trump's only accomplishment is a failed tax scam that showers wealthy corporations with kickbacks while leaving most families out in the cold. He eagerly promoted a disastrous health care bill that would have caused 23 million people to lose access to health insurance and eliminated protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions. His foreign policy has coddled adversaries while alienating allies, and his ill-advised trade policy is wreaking havoc on the economy.\n\nBut more than anything, Trump's time in office has been defined by a rampant anti-immigrant racism, both in rhetoric and policy.\n\nTrump's initial campaign announcement attacked Mexicans as \"rapists,\" and it only got worse from there. He referred to the home countries of some immigrants as \"shithole countries,\" yet took pains to defend a riotous mob of neo-Nazis and white supremacists as \"very fine people.\"\n\nAnd as his second inaugural anniversary approaches, Trump is shutting down the federal government over his racist, unnecessary demand to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump is an unlikable oaf and a bigot, and America is fed up with him. The polls, and not to mention the historic 2018 midterms, show that voters wholeheartedly reject Trump and all that he stands for.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He failed to inform the military or congressional leaders before making the radical policy shift, which has thrilled Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis inept handling of major U.S. foreign policy led then-Defense Secretary James Mattis to resign. Mattis sharply criticized Trump in his resignation letter, writing, \"While the U.S. remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies,\" which he indicated Trump had not done.\n\nThe Trump-Pence team has repeatedly botched foreign policy and military issues.

    "text": "Furloughs will make it difficult to provide the necessary security for the event.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Trump urging him to postpone the State of the Union address until he ends his government shutdown.\n\n\"Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government re-opens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has re-opened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on January 29th,\" Pelosi wrote.\n\nThe State of the Union address requires a huge, well-coordinated security operation. But the U.S. Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are not funded due to the Trump shutdown, and Pelosi noted that critical departments are \"hamstrung by furloughs.\"\n\nPelosi also pointed out that State of the Union addresses have never been given during a government shutdown, and that it was traditional for presidents to give the address in writing during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe shutdown started in December after Trump threw a tantrum and demanded Congress pay a $5 billion ransom for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. At the time, Trump announced on national television that he would be \"proud\" to own the shutdown if Democrats refused to fund the wall.\n\nTrump did indeed shut down the government \u2014 but he has refused to own it, choosing instead to blame Democrats for rejecting his unreasonable demands.\n\nIn her first day as speaker, Pelosi led the new Democratic House majority in passing bills to end the Trump shutdown. Unfortunately, Trump's accomplice in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), refused to hold a vote on the bills.\n\nMcConnell even went so far as to ridicule bills reopening the government as \"absolutely pointless.\"\n\nIn an interview with press after the letter was delivered, Pelosi reiterated that the security concerns were based on a statement from DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who designated the State of the Union as a National Special Security Event. Robust security is needed because not just Trump and the entire Congress, but also most of the Cabinet, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Supreme Court justices would all be in the same room.\n\nHundreds of people would be needed to coordinate such security, Pelosi said, but \"most of those people are either furloughed or victims of the president's shutdown.\" She added that Trump was welcome to give the State of the Union from the Oval Office if he wanted.\n\nWhile Pelosi's letter did not disinvite Trump from delivering the State of the Union, some are interpreting it as more than a mere suggestion.\n\nWhen House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) was asked if the move meant Trump was disinvited from giving the address, he said, \"Well I think that was the proper way to read it.\"\n\nCalling Nancy Pelosi \"GOAT,\" (an acronym for \"Greatest Of All Time\") former Sen. Harry Reid's deputy chief of staff Adam Jentleson tweeted, \"Pelosi told Trump that if he doesn\u2019t reopen the government he can't deliver the State of the Union in person but he's welcome to deliver it in writing and I'm dying and it's time once again for us all to appreciate and be thankful for the GOAT,\" adding several crying-while-laughing emojis.\n\nTrump demanded a shutdown, and he got it \u2014 in exchange for putting the nation's security at risk. But perhaps the stakes will be clearer to Trump if the shutdown jeopardizes one of his biggest TV appearances.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

This includes 36,000 federal employees who are being asked to come back to work at the IRS ahead of tax filing season.\n\n\"The move will allow Americans to get their tax refunds on time,\" reports CNN, \"but at the expense of the IRS employees, most of whom won't be paid.\"\n\nIRS employees are not alone. The Interior Department is forcing workers to come back to help sell federal land to oil and gas companies.\n\nAn estimated 800,000 federal workers are not receiving paychecks because of Trump's shutdown. \"Essential employees,\" such as TSA agents at the airport and secret service agents, are being forced to work without pay. However, many others are prohibited by law from performing their job duties until the government reopens.\n\nAs federal workers go longer and longer without paychecks, difficulties increase. One employee in Pennsylvania worries about homelessness. Another in Wisconsin is taking a life-and-death risk by cutting back on critical medication.\n\nMallory Lorge, who has Type 1 diabetes, is rationing her insulin because she can't afford to buy more until she is paid. NBC News reports on her coping strategy.\n\nHer blood sugar rose to a high level last week, but she said she felt forced to ignore it. Instead, she went to bed. \"When it gets that high you can go into diabetic ketoacidosis, you can go into a coma,\" she said. \"I can't afford to go to the ER. I can't afford anything. I just went to bed and hoped I'd wake up.\"\n\nIt is bad enough that Trump and his Republican accomplices are forcing people like Mallory to make these types of decisions. But now the Trump administration is forcing more of these furloughed employees back to work without paychecks, and not for safety or national security reasons. The whole point is to try to influence public opinion.\n\n\"The practical effect is that more government workers will be doing their jobs without their paychecks,\" reports CNN, \"but it will also work to mute the impact of the shutdown in the everyday lives of Americans who aren't directly touched by the shutdown.\"\n\nThe general public knows full well that Trump and his Republican accomplices are responsible for the shutdown and all the harm to come from it. First of all, Trump boasted \u2014 on national television \u2014 he would be \"proud\" to own the shutdown. Despite Trump's obstinance, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and congressional Democrats have passed numerous bills to reopen the government, all of which have been rejected by Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nPoll after poll shows the general public blaming Trump and Republicans for the shutdown. Forcing even more federal workers to come back to work without paychecks isn't going to sway those opinions.\n\nThe only way to stem the harm from the shutdown is for Trump to admit defeat and sign a bill to reopen the government.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Protecting Trump may not be the only reason that Devin Nunes has tried so hard to undermine Mueller's investigation.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) has made a name for himself over the past two years by going out of his way to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation in an effort to shield Trump from scrutiny.\n\nBut according to a new report, Nunes may have had more than one reason to want to obstruct Mueller's probe. Besides protecting Trump, Nunes may have been trying to protect himself.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported Monday night that Mueller's team and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are scrutinizing a meeting involving Nunes, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and a slew of foreign officials, including diplomats representing governments around the world.\n\nAbout 60 people attended the meeting, which was held at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 18, 2017 \u2014 just days before Trump's inauguration.\n\nThe meeting was already being investigated by Manhattan federal prosecutors \"as part of their probe into whether the Trump inaugural committee misspent funds and if donors tried to buy influence in the White House,\" The Daily Beast reported.\n\nNow, Mueller is looking into the event to determine if foreign officials gave money to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund and PAC, using Americans as intermediaries to funnel the cash. Taking foreign donations is not allowed under federal elections laws, so this would be an illegal scheme.\n\nNunes has not been accused of any specific wrongdoing, but the revelation that he has come under scrutiny by Mueller's team casts new light on his antics as the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and Trump's top defender in Congress.\n\nAfter serving on Trump's transition team, Nunes emerged as one of Trump's closest allies and enablers. He used his role as the head of the Intelligence Committee to obstruct attempts to hold Trump and his associates accountable, while also propping up conspiracy theories about a so-called \"Deep State\" trying to undermine Trump's presidency using the Russia investigation.\n\nLast year, Nunes led a deceptive campaign against the FBI that involved peddling a misleading memo accusing the bureau of misconduct in its investigation of Trump and his associates. The FBI came out with a rare statement slamming the debunked memo, saying it contained \"material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy.\"\n\nNunes has also pushed conspiracy theories about the FBI spying on the Trump campaign, and regularly used his power as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to do Trump's dirty work.\n\nAt one point, Nunes was forced to recuse himself from the committee's Russia investigation after he attempted to provide cover for Trump\u2019s lie about being \"wiretapped\" by the Obama administration. However, Nunes never really stepped back from his role \u2014 he simply continued working behind the scenes in an effort to undermine Mueller and the FBI.\n\nAll along, it appeared as though Nunes was acting in the interest of protecting Trump. While he likely was trying to shield Trump from scrutiny, the new report suggests that he may have had a more personal reason for wanting to obstruct the Russia investigation.\n\nUnfortunately for Nunes, his antics failed \u2014 and now, he finds himself entangled in the investigation that he worked so hard to shut down.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Pro-Trump propagandists are calling to disband the FBI for investigating Trump's ties to Russia.\n\nThe recent revelation that the FBI opened up a counterintelligence investigation to determine whether Trump was threatening national security by acting as an agent of Russia came as alarming news to most Americans, and rightly so.\n\nBut to Trump's far-right supporters, the alarming part is not that an acting president may have been working as a pawn of a hostile foreign government. In the pro-Trump bubble, they think the real problem is that the FBI ever dared to investigate this potential national security threat.\n\nNow, pro-Trump propagandists are taking to the airwaves and penning breathless articles calling for the FBI to be shut down for doing its job.\n\nAppearing on \"Hannity\" Monday night, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett called the FBI an \"all powerful, out of control, rogue agency,\" and falsely stated that it had launched the counterintelligence investigation against Trump without any \"credible evidence.\"\n\nIn fact, the FBI had some pretty convincing evidence \u2014 including Trump's firing of then-FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into Russian interference and potential collusion with the Trump campaign, and Trump's own admission during an NBC interview that he had fired Comey over the Russia probe. These are, in part, what drove the agency to open up the counterintelligence probe.\n\nAnd in the backdrop of these incidents is the fact that Trump's team had more than 100 contacts with Russian officials \u2014 and lied about all of them.\n\nBut rather than be concerned about why Trump's team had such extensive contact with a hostile foreign government or why Trump wanted to end the Russia investigation so badly that he fired the person in charge of it, Jarrett turned his ire toward the FBI and called for it to be dismantled.\n\n\"Frankly,\" Jarrett said, \"it's time that it be halted in its tracks, reorganized, and replaced.\"\n\nBut Jarrett isn't along in his call to get rid of the FBI as we know it.\n\nJoel Pollak, senior editor-at-large at pro-Trump Breitbart News, wrote a column Monday arguing incorrectly that the idea of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia is nothing more than a \"conspiracy theory,\" and that Trump had every right to fire the director of the FBI, regardless of his reason for firing him.\n\nWhile Trump has the power to fire the FBI director, he does not have the right to do so with corrupt intent, nor does he have the right to obstruct justice in the process.\n\nBut Pollak glossed right over those details and slammed the FBI for \"react[ing] to the constitutional exercise of presidential duties by investigating the president.\" To make his case against the FBI, Pollak also invoked a conspiracy theory that claims the FBI was \"spying on Trump campaign associates,\" and then threw in a line about the FBI \"excusing Hillary Clinton's misdeeds\" for good measure.\n\n\"The best solution,\" Pollak concluded, \"may be to scrap the FBI and start fresh with a reorganized agency under a new name.\"\n\nOther pro-Trump propagandists played a supporting role but stopped just short of calling for the FBI to be abolished.\n\nOver at the Federalist,\" a far-right, pro-Trump publication, author Mollie Hemingway falsely claimed the FBI \"never had a good reason to investigate Trump\" and called the counterintelligence probe a \"grand abuse of power\" that was launched to \"retaliate against Trump\" for firing Comey.\n\nMeanwhile, on Fox News, Sean Hannity told his viewers Monday night that the top ranks of the FBI are \"filled with hatred, and frankly, anti-Trump rage\" and \"were seeking redemption for the firing of James Comey\" when they launched the counterintelligence probe.\n\n\"They actually plotted to destroy your duly-elected president,\" Hannity raged.\n\nAlso on Fox News, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, an outspoken Trump supporter, said someone needs to take a \"vacuum cleaner to go over to the FBI and just clean out the leadership.\"\n\nHe also called for some senior FBI officials \"to be prosecuted for using their positions as a political weapon.\"\n\nOf course, this isn't the first time pro-Trump media figures have waged war against the FBI and other institutions in an effort to discredit the Russia investigation by delegitimizing everyone associated with it.\n\nAs the personal propaganda arm of the Trump White House, Fox News has gone all-in to shield Trump and his supporters from having to face the stark reality of the Russia investigation.\n\nFox has played a key role in denying, deflecting, minimizing, and covering up damning evidence about anything Russia-related, while also leading Trump's ongoing smear campaign against the intelligence community and regularly providing a platform for Trump stooges like Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA).\n\nAs legendary Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein put it, Trump's apologists at Fox News and other right-wing outlets are \"abetting a cover-up\" by lying on behalf of Trump to hide his misconduct from the public.\n\nWith the evidence against Trump getting harder to deny, pro-Trump propagandists have apparently decided to stop trying to discredit the institutions investigating Trump and start calling to shut them down entirely. After all, if there were no agencies to investigate Trump, there wouldn't be any evidence to deny.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Private companies and individuals are stepping up to help Coast Guard members get through the Trump. shutdown, but it's simply not enough.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump hit a milestone: the dubious distinction of being the architect of the longest shutdown ever. Then, this week, he managed to rack up another ignominious achievement: United States service members in the Coast Guard are going without pay for the first time. Other countries expect their military to serve without pay, but those are places like North Korea.\n\nService members in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines are currently getting paid. However, the Coast Guard is funded through the Department of Homeland Security, rather than the Department of the Defense, and only the former is defunded during this shutdown.\n\nThankfully, private citizens and corporations are stepping up to make sure that members of the Coast Guard receive some pay, food, and more.\n\nThe largest donation came from United Services Automobile Association (USAA), an insurance and financial services firm for service members and their families. They've provided $15 million. That money will go toward giving interest-free loans to Coast Guard members, a vital lifeline at this time.\n\nHowever, that money only goes so far. Coast Guard members with dependents are eligible for loans up to $1,000, while members without dependents can get $750. At most, it is estimated to help cover two weeks of financial shortfalls thanks to the shutdown, and not for all members. The Coast Guard expects the payroll costs for that stretch at $150 million.\n\nIn Alameda, California, residents of that Bay Area community donated enough food to feed over 600 Coast Guard personnel and there's another food donation coming up next weekend. USO Wisconsin, a military support organization, is collecting gift cards to support the Coast Guard members that are breaking ice and doing rescue operations on the freezing Great Lakes.\n\nIt's heartening to see people come together to support the Coast Guard. But it's also wholly unnecessary. Service members are going without pay because Trump is throwing a weeks-long tantrum about his wall. People aren't going to be able to make it by stringing together donations and having garage sales or babysitting.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's latest scheme to end his own government shutdown just blew up in his face.\n\nThe White House's attempt to sow seeds of discord among House Democrats has failed spectacularly in yet another humiliating defeat for Trump.\n\nHoping to divide House Democrats, who are united in their determination to reopen the government, Trump invited a handful of the most conservative Democrats to a meeting to discuss his obsession with a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. But every single member rejected the invitation outright.\n\nRep. Lou Correa (D-CA), co-chair of the conservative Blue Dog Caucus, was one of the House members to snub Trump's summons.\n\n\"Congressman Correa welcomes the opportunity to talk with the President about border security, as soon as the government is reopened,\" his spokesperson told Roll Call.\n\nThroughout the course of the Trump shutdown, Democrats have remained united in their desire to reopen the government without paying Trump's $5 billion ransom for a border wall.\n\nOn her first day as House speaker, Nancy Pelosi passed legislation to end the Trump shutdown. In the days and weeks since, the House Democratic majority has passed several bills to reopen the government, but Senate Majority Mitch McConnell has refused to even hold a vote on any of them.\n\nTrump, who regularly lies about virtually everything, claimed without evidence that Democrats are calling him and offering to help end the shutdown. That claim was met with laughter and ridicule by Rep. Jackie Spear (D-CA).\n\n\"There's not a Democrat that I'm aware of, in the House, that would have called the President to say, 'I want to work with you and I want this wall to go up,'\" Spier told CNN.\n\n\"There's not a Democrat that wants to see five billion dollars wasted,\" she added.\n\nWhen it came time for Trump to show off all the Democrats who supposedly wanted to help him build a wall, the White House was unable to get even a single member to meet with Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, some vulnerable Republican senators are publicly breaking with Trump and his key henchman, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Colorado's Cory Gardner and Maine's Susan Collins, both up for re-election in 2020, have made tepid public statements supporting an end to the Trump shutdown even without money for a wall.\n\nOn Monday, after Trump rejected yet another proposal to end the longest shutdown in U.S. history, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski responded by asking, \"Well, then Mr. President when are you going to help us open the government?\"\n\nInstead of trying to divide Democrats, Trump would be better served listening to the voices across the political spectrum who are sick and tired of his political games. Polls regularly show voters blame Trump and his Republican enablers for shutting down the government. After 25 days, Trump still refuses to work toward a bipartisan solution.\n\nTrump, and his accomplice McConnell, have the power to end the shutdown whenever they choose. If he continues to try to find division among the Democratic majority, he'll just run into a big blue wall.\n\nAnd it's the only wall Trump will ever see."

    "text": "What a waste.\n\nA new analysis shows the Trump shutdown is likely to waste billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars before the government is reopened. In fact, the New York Times reports that the shutdown costs more than an open, functioning federal government.\n\nWhile the Times analysis does not provide an exact estimate of the cost of the shutdown, it uses evidence from previous shutdowns to highlight how fiscally wasteful Trump and the Republicans are in forcing a government closure.\n\nFor example, there is a high likelihood that any bill to reopen the government would provide backpay to the 800,000 federal workers currently surviving without paychecks. In 2013, the Obama administration estimated a 16-day shutdown cost the federal government $2.5 billion in backpay and benefits, paid for work that employees were not allowed to perform. The current Trump shutdown has already exceeded 16 days, and Trump has said it could last for months or years.\n\nBut backpay is only part of it. During the shutdown, the federal government cannot collect some taxes and fees. According to the National Parks Conservation Association, a shutdown costs national parks $400,000 per day in lost fees. In 2013, the Times notes the parks service lost roughly $7 million in 2013, while the Smithsonian museums lost another $4 million.\n\nFinally, a prolonged shutdown could have devastating consequences for the economy as a whole. \"The longer the shutdown lasts, the faster the economy could fall,\" reports the Times. \"If the government stops issuing nutrition assistance for low-income families, if agencies can't process federally backed home loans, if unpaid airport security workers call out sick en masse and air travel is strangled \u2014 that could add up to a major economic disruption.\"\n\nIn addition to the fiscal mess, the shutdown is already putting air travelers at increased risk and could lead to thousands of people being evicted due to the lack of funds for certain housing programs. National parks are filling up with human waste, and the FDA recently announced it can't perform most food safety inspections.\n\nTrump demanded a shutdown in late December, going so far as to say he would be \"proud\" to own it. While Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has led the House to pass bills to reopen the government, Democrats refuse to pay Trump's $5 billion ransom demand to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), with the backing of Senate Republicans, refuse to even hold a vote on bills to end the shutdown without funding for the wall.\n\nIn addition to the daily harm a Republican-led shutdown does to so many Americans, it is also wildly fiscally irresponsible.\n\nIn other words, par for the course for Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "William Barr, Trump's choice for attorney general, has already called for Clinton to be investigated and downplayed any concerns about Trump. That's probably why he was chosen.\n\nEarlier this morning, President Trump nominated William Barr to be his next attorney general. Barr previously served in that same role under George H.W. Bush.\n\nBut don't be fooled into thinking that Barr's past experience means he'll be an adult in the room and provide a check on Trump. Barr has already made outrageous public statements that show he is entirely in line with Trump's way of thinking.\n\nAlthough Barr might not have as tawdry or shady a past as acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, he's just as committed to baselessly accusing Hillary Clinton of crimes while blithely dismissing any of Trump's wrongdoings.\n\nLast year, the New York Times asked ten former attorneys general if they'd be willing to comment on whether the Justice Department should open an investigation into the Uranium One deal that occurred when Clinton was secretary of state.\n\nAll of them declined to respond, save for Barr, who said he saw more basis for investigating that deal than in looking into the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia.\n\nThis isn't the only time Barr has backed Trump's outrageous position that the DOJ should be going after his political rivals. After Trump publicly demanded that the Justice Department open a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton, Barr came forward to claim that \"there are things that should be investigated that haven't been investigated.\"\n\nBack in May 2017, Barr penned an op-ed backing Trump's decision to fire former FBI director James Comey. He even endorsed the ludicrous fiction that Trump fired Comey because of Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation rather than the real reason, which is that Comey had refused to look the other way regarding Michael Flynn.\n\nBarr also thinks that Mueller is obliged to police the political donations of the prosecutors he employs and thinks there should be more \"balance\" in the group. While that isn't quite as bad as Trump calling the prosecutorial team \"13 hardened Democrats,\" it still isn't a good look.\n\nIn a lot of ways, it looks like Barr has been auditioning for this job for quite some time. He's consistently made high-profile statements signaling his approval for Trump's actions.\n\nGiven Trump's very public loathing of Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, it's easy to believe that Trump picked Barr precisely because he thought Barr would meddle in \u2014 or shut down \u2014 Mueller's investigation.\n\nAnd given his public proclamations, there's no reason to think that Barr won't do just that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) if under his leadership the Department of Justice would \"jail reporters for doing their jobs.\"\n\nInstead of rejecting the premise out of hand, Barr paused for several seconds before giving a frighteningly equivocal answer.\n\n\"I can conceive of situations where as a last resort, and where a news organization has run through a red flag or something like that, knows that they're putting out stuff that will hurt the country \u2014 there might be a \u2014 there could be a situation where someone would be held in contempt,\" he said.\n\nRight now, we have no idea what Barr means when he refers to journalists doing something \"that will hurt the country\" after ignoring \"red flags.\" These comments would give him plenty of room to rubber-stamp Trump's toxic war on the free press.\n\nTrump repeatedly attacks news outlets that accurately report unflattering or embarrassing information about him and his administration. If a story makes Trump look bad, he automatically labels it \"fake news\" without providing evidence of why the story might be wrong.\n\nThe Trump administration even revoked the White House press credentials of CNN reporter Jim Acosta largely due to his skeptical coverage of Trump's repeated lies and racism. A judge later forced the White House to back down and give Acosta his badge back.\n\nIf Barr would even consider letting Trump decide the limits of the First Amendment, he wouldn't be doing his job as attorney general to protect and defend the Constitution.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Asking about citizenship on the census is racist, and gives us a less accurate count of the country's population.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge flatly rejected the Trump administration's racist attempt to insert a question about citizenship status into the 2020 census.\n\nJudge Jesse M. Furman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross committed \"egregious\" violations of the law when he made the \"arbitrary and capricious\" decision to add the citizenship question.\n\nAsking about citizenship would likely make the census less accurate, because it would discourage many immigrants from returning their census forms. Undercounting minority communities on the census would hurt those communities on a variety of fronts, from congressional representation to funding for roads and schools.\n\nIt could also give Republicans an unfair political advantage. If the citizenship question is allowed on the 2020 census, it \"could shift the nation's balance of political power from cities to more rural communities over the next decade and give Republicans a new advantage in drawing electoral boundaries,\" the Washington Post reported last year.\n\nAdvocates and former census officials alike say it's a bad idea to add a citizenship question.\n\n\"Trump tried to twist the 2020 census into just another weapon in his war on immigrants, aiming to drive down responses and intentionally leading to a less representative government by hiding millions,\" Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA), chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), said in a statement to Shareblue Media. \"I'm glad the court has intervened to stop this hastily crafted and dangerous question from distorting our census.\"\n\nThe judge's decision was based on how Ross and the administration made the decision to add the citizenship question, not the racist impact of such a question, the New York Times reports.\n\nBut it's still a victory for the plaintiffs, and for those who care about the integrity of the census \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\"Today's ruling is a strong signal to the Trump administration that any attempts to politicize and corrupt the 2020 census will fail,\" Thomas Wolf, executive director of the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement.\n\n\"While today's ruling is a victory, we cannot rely solely on the courts to swat down this xenophobic and politically nefarious question,\" Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said in a statement. \"Congress must come together, across party lines, to ensure we protect the census from politicization and ensure every person is counted justly and accurately.\"\n\nThe Trump administration, of course, has come to be defined by its virulent anti-immigration policies. Trump kicked off his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans \"rapists,\" and one of his first acts after his sparsely-attended inauguration was an ill-fated ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump has defended white supremacists after a hate-filled rally in Charlottesville, denigrated immigrants from Haiti and Africa by claiming they come from \"shithole countries,\" and instigated the country's longest government shutdown over a racist attempt to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe attempt to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census is just another in a long line of anti-immigrant racism from the Trump administration. And once again, the courts have to step in to squash the most egregious excesses.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Among these was a request for the Trump Organization to provide documents relating to its \"process for identifying payments from foreign governments and foreign-government controlled entities.\"\n\nIt's clear that Trump is corrupt and has made money on the backs of the American people.

    "text": "It took Steve King proudly proclaiming himself to be a white nationalist and a white supremacist before House GOP leadership finally took some action.\n\nIt finally happened. After being an unrelenting and obvious white supremacist for ages, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) finally suffered the most minor of consequences \u2014 being stripped of his House committee assignments.\n\nAnd all it took for the Republican Party to finally do something, anything, about King was for him to say something completely racist \u2014 which for some reason got more public backlash than all the other completely racist things he's said in the past.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, King mused philosophically about his racism. \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d\n\nFor some reason, after a decade and a half of Steve King being viscerally and publicly racist, this statement is what finally got him in hot water with GOP leadership.\n\nAfter House Democrats made it clear they would punish King even if the GOP took no action, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy finally did something by stripping King of his committee assignments. McCarthy said he wouldn't rule out censuring or reprimanding King, but also went on to say that he won't remove King from the House GOP conference, which means he still goes to party meetings and still votes.\n\nMcCarthy couldn't even explain why these particular remarks constituted a tipping point in light of King's rampant public racism for years. Instead, he pretended not to have known about King's previous remarks: \u201cMaybe I did not see those, but I disagree with these.\u201d\n\nThe GOP could have taken official action against King when he tweeted about America being overrun with someone else's babies, or when he praised the agenda of European Nazis, or when he retweeted a self-described Nazi sympathizer. They didn't.\n\nInstead, King's fellow Iowa Republicans fell over themselves to praise and court him.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley endorsed King in the 2018 midterms. \u201cIowa needs Steve King in Congress,\" he said. \"I also need Steve King in Congress.\u201d Senator Joni Ernst did a campaign rally with King right before the 2018 election. Iowa's Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, declined to remove him as a campaign co-chair, saying, \"I can't be held responsible for everyone's comments.\"\n\nTo be fair, it is probably difficult for the GOP to entirely repudiate King when Trump, as the head of their party, is such an unvarnished racist himself. And of course, Trump hasn't come forward to condemn King's latest comments, saying only, \"I haven't been following it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, King issued a statement claiming that the New York Times \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 misunderstood what he was saying, and insisted \"the Left\" is to blame for assigning \"slanderous labels\" such as \"white supremacist\" to conservatives. This defense rings hollow given King's record of embracing white supremacy, and the blame-shifting attempt is almost comically bad.\n\nThe GOP is getting a lot of headlines for supposedly rebuking King. But in reality, their action is pathetically miniminal, and comes much too late.\n\nIn other words, it's all business as usual in the Republican party.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

James G. Stavridis, the former supreme allied commander of NATO, told the Times.\n\nHe added such a blunder would be \"a geopolitical mistake of epic proportion.\"\n\nAdmiral Stavridis was not alone in his warnings about Trump's dangerous thinking. Withdrawing from NATO \"would be the wildest success that Vladimir Putin could dream of,\" Michele A. Flournoy, undersecretary of defense under President Barack Obama, told the Times. The move \"would destroy 70-plus years of painstaking work across multiple administrations, Republican and Democratic, to create perhaps the most powerful and advantageous alliance in history,\" she said.\n\nWeakening NATO, which Russia sees as a threat, is one of Putin's top goals. National security officials told the Times that an American withdrawal from NATO \u2014 made up of the United States, Canada, and many of America's closest allies in Europe \u2014 would be doing Putin's work for him.\n\nTrump's cowering subservience to Putin was on full display at a joint press conference with Putin last summer when Trump attacked U.S. intelligence agencies and backed Putin on the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThis report of Trump contemplating withdrawing from NATO adds to a litany of worrying reports about Trump's behavior.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of two major reports that question Trump's loyalty to the United States. A New York Times piece broke the story that FBI officials opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was working on behalf of Russia and against American interests. That report was followed by a Washington Post expose on Trump seeking to keep his conversations with Putin secret from even his own administration. In at least one case after a meeting with Putin, Trump took the notes from an interpreter and instructed the interpreter not to discuss the meeting with anyone.\n\nIn his resignation letter, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned that Trump's fidelity to alliances was worrying. \"My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign acts and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,\" Mattis wrote, noting Trump does not share these key values.\n\nTrump has spent two years rejecting alliances and weakening America's position on the global stage. From trade deals to the Paris Climate Accord to the G-7 to the multilateral Iran nuclear deal, Trump has shunned allies and empowered adversaries.\n\nTrump mulling over withdrawing from NATO is the latest \u2014 and one of the most dangerous \u2014 gifts Trump is giving to America's adversaries.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Frazier released a statement skewering Trump for having \"once again taken a racist jab\" that was deeply insulting to Native Americans on a number of levels.\n\nBy using \"Pocahontas\" as a dismissive nickname for a political opponent, Frazier said, Trump is \"exploiting native women as an insult for political machismo.\" Pocahontas was a \"victim of European colonialism,\" Frazier pointed out, and \"to use her name in that manner is disgusting and reflective of the President of the United States' ignorance.\"\n\nFrazier also reminded Trump that the Wounded Knee Massacre is nothing to joke about.\n\n\"It is an incident in which soldiers of the United States hunted down and murdered hundreds of Lakota men, women and children in the middle of winter,\" Frazier wrote. The killing was \"the sum of white hatred, bigotry and racism,\" he added, which Trump trivialized by making it the punchline of a weak political attack.\n\nFrazier concluded, \"The President of the United States has once again utilized racism and ignorance to attack the natives of this land. I will not remain silent when the Lakota people and our accomplishments are used in this manner.\"\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians similarly denounced Trump. President Jefferson Keel said in a statement, \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms the casual and callous use of these events as part of a political attack. Hundreds of Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho people lost their lives at the hands of the invading U.S. Army during these events, and their memories should not be desecrated as a rhetorical punch line.\"\n\nTrump has a long, public history of denigrating and attacking Native Americans. In the Oval Office, he has simply continued that tradition with a much larger audience than he has ever had in the past. Even worse, his hateful rhetoric has been combined with policies that have done outsized harm to an already marginalized community.\n\nTrump is a racist. He lives and breathes bigotry. He only cares about the torture and mass murder of Native people if he can use it as a sick punchline for his ineffective political attacks. This is who he has always been.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "In Senate testimony, William Barr said Congress should comply with Trump's ransom and pay for his fantasy border wall to end his government shutdown.\n\nIn a sad show of carrying Trump's water, Attorney General nominee William Barr implied Congress should pay Trump's $5 billion ransom for a border wall as a way to end the Trump shutdown.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) asked Barr what he would say to the thousands of federal employees currently furloughed as a result of the government shutdown. Rather than speak to the hardships faced by workers who have gone weeks without getting paid, Barr parroted White House talking points about the need for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"I would like to see a deal reached whereby Congress recognizes that it\u2019s imperative to have border security and that part of that border security as a commonsense matter needs barriers,\" Barr said.\n\nThe government shutdown started at the end of December when Trump threw a tantrum demanding billions of dollars to build a border wall. At the time, Trump boasted that he was \"proud\" to own the shutdown if Democrats refused to succumb to his partisan demands. Despite repeated efforts by House Democrats to reopen the government, Trump and his Republican accomplices refuse to pass funding bills to end the Trump shutdown.\n\nWhen he was Attorney General for George H.W. Bush, Barr also advocated for building a barrier along the southern border. The Daily Beast describes Barr's quest to build a steel fence along the border outside of San Diego. \"Unfortunately for Barr,\" they report, \"the fence was an epic failure.\"\n\n\"The deterrent effect of tens of billions of dollars in investments in Barr's approach to immigration control never materialized,\" Wayne Cornelius, a professor at the University California, San Diego, told the Daily Beast.\n\nIn follow-up questions, Klobuchar walked Barr through numerous Democratic compromises where funding for a wall was offered and rejected by Republicans. But Barr refused to give up on Trump's talking points, saying, \"The point is, we need money right now for border security, including barriers and walls and slats and other things.\"\n\nBarr's wall failed before, and Trump's obsession with a wall today is doing nothing but making life harder for hundreds of thousands of hardworking federal employees. It's clear from just this testimony that Barr cares more about pleasing Trump than he does about the harm this Trump policy \u2014 or any Trump policy \u2014 may have on the American public.\n\nTrump nominated another lackey to serve in his cabinet, and William Barr is living up to Trump's expectations.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's choice for attorney general has started to make the rounds on Capitol Hill, but he really doesn't want to talk to Democrats.\n\nWilliam Barr, Trump's pick to replace Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, has already shown himself to be a Trump loyalist. He thinks Hillary Clinton, not Trump, should be investigated and sent a lengthy \u2014 and unsolicited \u2014 memo to the Department of Justice criticizing the Russia probe. He's also, evidently, so dismissive of Democratic senators that he can't even be bothered to talk to them unless they raise a ruckus.\n\nSens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), both members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, tried to meet with Barr, as his confirmation hearing is coming up next week. Sen. Klobuchar was initially told that Barr couldn't meet until after his confirmation hearing. Given that senators meet with nominees before their hearings precisely to learn more about the candidate and discern whether they deserve their support, it somewhat defeats the purpose to offer a meeting post-hearing.\n\nBoth Klobuchar and Blumenthal were told that Barr was unable to meet because of the government shutdown. It was a confusing explanation, given that such a meeting would only require the senators and Barr, not any othered furloughed workers or shuttered resources. It was also a bald-faced lie, as Barr had proven himself able to meet with GOP Senators Lindsey Graham and Chuck Grassley, regardless of the shutdown.\n\nAfter complaints from Democrats, Barr did deign to meet with some Democrats on Thursday, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Klobuchar. But Democrats shouldn't have to beg Barr to meet with them so that they can perform their Constitutionally required function of advising and consenting to Trump's nominees.\n\nOf course, this is nothing new. When Neil Gorsuch was nominated for the Supreme Court seat that Mitch McConnell stole from both President Barack Obama and Merrick Garland, he didn't bother to meet with Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) even though they made multiple requests.\n\nBarr's behavior doesn't bode well for anyone who wants to pretend that he's going to behave in a neutral, judicious fashion. He received his nomination for the twin purposes of protecting Trump and baselessly thwarting Democrats, and he's made very clear, very early, that he's perfectly happy to do both.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Before he approached William Barr to be his next attorney general, Trump had already tried to hire Barr as his private defense counsel in the Russia investigation.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Trump tapped William Barr to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general of the United States. Barr shares many of Trump's delusions about the Russia investigation, like the idea that Hillary Clinton should be investigated instead of Trump, or that Robert Mueller hired too many Democrats for the special counsel team.\n\nBut it gets worse. Barr got on Trump's radar because of his sycophantic comments in the press \u2014 and Trump liked what he heard so much that he tried to hire Barr as private counsel to lead his defense in the Mueller case.\n\nIt's no secret that no one of note wanted to represent Trump in the Russia investigation. Four of the highest-profile law firms out there declined the honor in 2017, and at least a dozen big-name lawyers had said no by April of 2018.\n\nOne of the people that the White House reached out to back in 2017 was none other than William Barr. Barr and Trump had a meeting, and Trump offered him the job, Yahoo News reports.\n\nBarr didn't quite say no, but said he'd need to think about it and that he had other obligations.\n\nThe White House later tried again to get Barr on board after John Dowd, Trump's lead attorney for the Russia matter, left in May of this year because Trump wouldn't listen to any of his advice.\n\nRudy Giuliani ended up getting that job instead. It's not clear if Barr actually said no, or if Giuliani was picked instead because he was so eager to become Trump's new attack dog and perennial defender.\n\nBarr playing hard to get seems to have paid off \u2014 for both him and Trump. Barr gets to be the next attorney general, if the Senate confirms him, and Trump gets to appoint a Justice Department chief who has already made it very clear that he's more interested in protecting Trump than pursuing justice.\n\nIt's exactly what is to be expected of this administration. It's also exactly what everyone should keep in mind when pundits inevitably claim that Barr will be a noble and upstanding public servant.\n\nBarr was asked to take this job because he'll provide the sort of cover Jeff Sessions wouldn't.

    "text": "Earlier this year, Bill Barr sent a lengthy memo to the DOJ explaining why Trump shouldn't be investigated for obstruction. That alone should disqualify him from serving as attorney general.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last night that William Barr, Trump's pick for Attorney General, sent an unsolicited 20-page memo criticizing the Russia investigation to the Department of Justice back in June. It's a startling case of overreach and one that should disqualify him from becoming attorney general.\n\nThe memo itself is unsurprising, given the source. Barr doesn't believe Trump can be investigated for obstruction; he thinks the president should have full authority to fire whoever he wants for whatever he wants. Further, Barr argues, unless collusion can be proved first, Trump can't be on the hook for obstruction. From a purely legal standpoint, Barr is just pushing a theory he's pushed for 30 years: that the President should largely be able to do whatever he wants.\n\nWhat's startling here is that Barr thought it appropriate, as a past attorney general, to send a letter leaning on Rod Rosenstein, who considers Barr a role model, to try to get him to kill a duly-authorized investigation. The memo is also surreal because Barr begins by freely admitting that he doesn't know all the facts but then proceeds to opine about the law anyway.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer pointed out that Barr's views are \"deeply misguided\" and constituted an \"unproved attack.\" With that, says Schumer, Barr is \"unquestionably disqualifie[d]\" to serve as attorney general. At the very least, the matter should be robustly addressed during Barr's confirmation hearings, as the existence of the memo should worry both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nIt's unclear whether Barr shared this memo directly with Trump, giving Trump a potential strategy to follow, and serving as a sort of audition for the job. Barr had already spent a portion of 2017 writing op-eds calling for the investigation of Hillary Clinton instead of Trump. Trump definitely took notice, offering Barr a job as his personal attorney in the Russia probe.\n\nIn any normal setting, all of this would result in Barr's nomination being withdrawn, but these are not normal times.\n\nIt will probably take a couple months for Barr to get confirmed, which means that Matthew Whitaker remains acting attorney general. There was a question as to whether it was appropriate for Whitaker to oversee the Russia investigation, given his assertions that the investigation is a witch hunt. But Whitaker didn't bother to get a formal ruling about whether it would be a conflict. A senior DOJ ethics official did tell Whitaker that he should recuse, but senior appointed officials then told him he didn't need to do so. While Whitaker is on his way out the door, there's still enough time for him to kill the investigation or starve it of vital resources and personnel.\n\nTrump's acting attorney general and incoming attorney general seem to exist for one key purpose: protecting Trump from an investigation into the depths of his collusion and obstruction. And with a GOP-majority Senate, there's no reason to think Barr won't be confirmed and he get to work dismantling all that Mueller has carefully built.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "William Barr has gotten off to a disgraceful start.\n\nThere's an outside chance that Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, was picked just because he seems like a shoo-in. Barr already held the job once, during the George H. W. Bush administration, and went on to have a long career as a lawyer for big corporations and at a white shoe firm.\n\nHowever, it's clear that Barr got the nod from Trump for other reasons, including his enthusiasm for pardoning high-level political operatives and his belief that it is \"very destructive to personal liberty\" if political appointees don't perform \"political supervision\" of nonpartisan Department of Justice (DOJ) employees and their cases.\n\nBarr isn't just abstractly worrisome. He's already injected himself into the Mueller investigation in impermissible ways. In 2018, he sent an entirely unsolicited 20-page memo to the DOJ criticizing the Russia investigation. Perhaps he felt warranted in doing so because Trump had already tried to hire him as his personal attorney for the Mueller investigation. He thinks Hillary Clinton, not Trump, should be investigated.\n\nWith all of that baggage, it's tough to believe Barr when he says that Mueller will be allowed to finish his report. Even in that statement, there is still some hemming and hawing. Barr says that the public should \"be informed of the results of the special counsel's work.\"\n\nThat's not the same as saying the report should be public and gives Barr some wiggle room to provide only a stripped-down version of what Mueller concludes. Additionally, given that Barr supported Bush's decision to pardon high-level people who lied to the American public during the Iran-Contra affair, there's no reason to believe Barr wouldn't support the same sort of action by Trump.\n\nJust as frightening, Barr is also a strong proponent of executive privilege \u2014 the idea that a president can do whatever they want. During his time serving under George H.W. Bush, Barr opined that Bush didn't need Congressional permission to invade Iraq and that the FBI could arrest people abroad whether that country consented or not. Given that Trump is currently contemplating declaring a national emergency to build his border wall, the idea of an Attorney General who will back Trump's every whim is terrifying.\n\nThough it is unlikely that GOP senators would listen to their constituents on this matter, recent polling makes very clear that the majority of voters want their senators to refuse to confirm Barr unless Barr commits to allowing Mueller to release his findings publicly. A substantial majority \u2014 68% \u2014 of all voters surveyed don't think Trump should be allowed to handpick the person overseeing an investigation into Trump's administration. And 56% of all voters think Trump should be indicted and prosecuted if Mueller determines Trump committed a crime.\n\nRegrettably, in the end, it's hard to genuinely believe that Trump would have nominated Barr had Barr not already assured him of both fealty and protection. At this point, Trump is only looking out for Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) is showing signs of frustration as Trump holds the federal government hostage over his border wall obsession.\n\nIn hopes of ending the shutdown, a plan was recently floated to pass a 3-week funding bill so Congress could debate the issues while the federal government was open. But Trump rejected that plan.\n\nWhen a CNN reporter asked Murkowski about Trump's rejection, she said, \"Well, then Mr. President when are you going to help us open the government?\"\n\nIt is his singular focus on a border wall that prevents 800,000 federal workers from receiving a paycheck. The shutdown is the longest in U.S. history, and a frustrated Murkowski is laying the blame at Trump's feet\n\n\"It's just not good for any of us,\" she added.\n\nMurkowski is not alone in her thoughts. In poll after poll, the public has put the blame squarely on Trump and congressional Republicans. In fact, Trump's tactics are backfiring. According to a Washington Post analysis of recent polls, Trump's approval rating is dropping and opposition to building a wall is growing.\n\nBlaming Trump for the shutdown makes sense. After all, Trump bragged about being \"proud\" to own the shutdown if Democrats refused to pay a $5 billion ransom for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nSens. Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Susan Collins (R-ME), two of the most vulnerable senators in the country, have also expressed concern at the ongoing shutdown and voiced tepid support for reopening the government without funding for Trump's wall.\n\nThe country is losing billions of dollars because of the shutdown, and despite the best efforts of congressional Democrats, there seems to be no end in sight. Perhaps Trump will listen to Murkowski and work on a plan to reopen the government.\n\nBecause Murkowski is right about one thing: It's not good for any of us.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Both the New York Times and the Washington Post ran blockbuster stories on Trump's Russian entanglements over the weekend \u2014 and Trump imploded in spectacular fashion.\n\nIt was a bombshell weekend for Trump news.\n\nThe New York Times dropped the news that the FBI wasn't just investigating obstruction but had also been trying to figure out whether he was acting as a Russian asset while he was already president. Then the Washington Post reported that Trump is trying so hard to keep his conversations with Putin quiet that he's blocked his own interpreter from keeping notes or talking with other officials.\n\nTrump has responded to this one-two punch with his traditional approach: melting down on Twitter, then calling in to the friends at Fox News.\n\nHe kicked off Saturday by using Twitter to go after some of his favorite targets, like James Comey (a \"total sleaze\") and Hillary Clinton (who committed \"Real Collusion\"). Trump also got mad about reports that he has no real plan to end the shutdown, tweeting that he does have a plan, but \"to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election\" and that \"elections have consequences.\" It's still unclear what the election has to do with his shutdown \"plan\".\n\nTrump hit his meltdown stride on Saturday evening, when he phoned into Judge Jeanine Pirro's Fox News show for a remarkable performance, even by Trump standards.\n\nHe started with his usual fearmongering about the border, hyping the presence of a new caravan and bragging that he stopped the last one. Egged on by Pirro, he complained about the Democrats and weirdly insisted that he hadn't left the White House in months even though he was just at the border last Thursday.\n\nThings didn't get really spectacular until Pirro asked him, in light of the New York Times report, if he had ever worked for Russia. Trump utterly failed to deny that he worked for Russia, instead pivoting to say that the report was the \"most insulting article\" ever written about him and the Times was \"failing,\" then bragging about firing Comey and claiming he is tougher on Russian than anyone, among other diversions.\n\nPirro also succeeded in whipping Trump into a frenzy over Michael Cohen's upcoming public congressional testimony. Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer, said he'd testify voluntarily before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. In response to Pirro, Trump, predictably, talked about how Cohen has nothing to do with him. But then he went on, incredibly, to say that Cohen's father-in-law should be investigated: \"But [Cohen] should give information maybe on his father-in-law because that's the one that people want to look at. Because where does that money \u2014 that's the money in the family.\"\n\nHaving someone in the Oval Office who throws tantrums about unfavorable press coverage, won't confirm that he isn't a Russian asset, and suggests prosecuting the family members of people he doesn't like is already terrifying. But as the walls close in on Trump, it's likely his behavior will get even worse.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\"\n\nReps. Bobby Rush (D-IL) and Tim Ryan (D-OH) have called for a formal censure of King, the most severe punishment for members of Congress other than expulsion from the body.\n\nRyan's legislation called King's comments \"abhorrent to the founding principles of our nation.\"\n\n\"Steve King\u2019s pattern of despicable comments harken back to the dark days of American history where his rabid, racist remarks would have been acceptable to a significant portion of our nation,\" Rush said in a statement.\n\nRep. James Clyburn (D-SC), the majority whip, is the most prominent Democrat to move to reprimand the Republican congressman. Clyburn told the Washington Post that his legislation is in part tied to the 90th anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birth, \"We've got to break our silence on these kinds of things.\"\n\nA few Republicans have also come forward to rebuke King's comments in recent days \u2014 but it's ultimately too little, too late.\n\nSenate Majority Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said King's comments have \"no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind.\"\n\nSenator Tim Scott (R-SC), who is black, said, \"When people with opinions similar to King\u2019s open their mouths, they damage not only the Republican Party and the conservative brand but also our nation as a whole.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) promised that \"action will be taken\" to address King, but was not specific about what that action would be.\n\nIt will take more than strongly worded statements for Republicans to escape their association with King's racism.\n\nIf anything, the Republican Party has come to embrace more and more of King's racism in the last decade \u2014 which reached a tipping point when the party decided to throw its support behind Trump.\n\nMcConnell, Scott, and McCarthy have all regularly locked arms with Trump, despite his description of neo-Nazis as \"very fine people\" and his constant demonization of Latino immigrants and Muslims.\n\nAnd it turns out that many of Trump's racist ideas about immigration policy are carbon copies of ideas Steve King has been pushing for years.\n\nKing has espoused even more openly racist and white nationalist ideas than Trump for years \u2014 yet he never suffered a loss of power or influence within the Republican Party as a result.\n\nNo matter what Republicans may say or do now after King's most recent embarrassment, their record is clear.\n\nRepublicans were quite fine with King's racism as long as they thought they could use it to get ahead. And now that it's blowing up in their face, they will own the fallout for not rejecting it right away.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

You're fucking it all up, Mick,\" Trump reportedly told Mulvaney.\n\n\"It was so awkward, I was looking down, like I couldn't watch,\" one White House official who was present told CNN.\n\nTrump, it seems, got mad at Mulvaney because Mulvaney dared to suggest that negotiating might involve trying to find common ground.\n\nTrump's typical negotiating skills consist of refusing to offer any alternative positions, slamming the table, and walking out. So he may have been perplexed by Mulvaney's attempt, however feeble, to come to some sort of settlement to end the government shutdown that is now the longest in this country's history.\n\nAnd perhaps Trump felt so sanguine going after Mulvaney because the latter did not exactly revere Trump before getting the nod to work in the Trump administration. In 2016, Mulvaney called Trump a \"terrible human being\" and said that Trump wouldn't be a role model for his 16-year-old triplets.\n\nWhatever the underlying reason, it's entirely unsurprising that Trump would try to pin the spectacular failure of the shutdown on someone else. He has a habit of refusing to take responsibility for his actions.\n\nWhen a grieving father wanted to know why his Navy SEAL son died in a botched mission, Trump blamed the military. When Trump had a lackluster State of the Union address, he blamed Democrats for being insufficiently enthusiastic.\n\nAnd while Trump initially said he would be proud to own his shutdown, he now insists that the \"buck stops with everybody.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see how conservatives react to Trump's foul language, given the tantrum they threw about newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) saying, of Trump, \"We will impeach this motherfucker.\"\n\nTrump, the man who once boasted of grabbing women by the pussy, clutched his pearls over Tlaib's swearing and said that her comments were \"disgraceful.\"\n\nWhat's actually disgraceful is that this shutdown drags on, with no end in sight, because Trump is a petulant child who has no idea how to get the country out of the mess for which he is 100 percent responsible.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Engle is determined to look into Trump's activities and uncover \"how those dark dealings affect our national security.\"\n\nThe statement comes on the heels of two major stories from the weekend highlighting Trump's unusual behavior when it comes to Putin.\n\nAfter Trump fired FBI director James Comey, the FBI \"began investigating whether he had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests,\" reports the New York Times. America's own counterintelligence officers were concerned Trump's \"actions constituted a possible threat to national security.\"\n\nThe day after the Times report, the Washington Post reported Trump's bizarre activities after meeting with Putin. At least once, Trump \"[took] possession of the notes of his own interpreter and instruct[ed] the linguist not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials,\" the Post reports.\n\nWhat was Trump hiding? Why was he so concerned about those notes getting out? Did the FBI uncover evidence that Trump was working against American interests?\n\n\"America deserves the truth,\" Engel said, \"and the Foreign Affairs Committee will seek to get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nIn 2018, voters made clear that Republican complicity in Trump's \"dark dealings\" with Putin and Russia was unacceptable. In a historic election, voters put Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) back in charge of the House with a mandate to hold Trump accountable for his actions. For two years, Republicans acted as accomplices, refusing to uphold their constitutional duty as a co-equal branch of government.\n\nBut those days are over.\n\nEngel's hearings will be just one of several seeking to uncover the truth of Trump's actions. In early February, Trump's longtime attorney and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, will publicly testify before a House investigative committee. As more truth comes to light, the GOP is panicking and attacking the efforts of House Democrats.\n\n\"Every time Trump meets with Putin, the country is told nothing,\" Engel said. With Republican no longer able to cover up Trump's \"bizarre\" relationships, the country will soon learn a great deal more about Trump, Putin, and their dark dealings.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

I need my money, so I can plant my crop.\"\n\nNorth Carolina farmer Kent Revels told a local station, \"They're playing a game of basically Russian Roulette, and it affects the people out here.\"\n\nJohn Myer, a farmer in New York, told the New York Times that the shutdown was a \"personal power stance\" by Trump \"because he doesn\u2019t really care about anything, I don\u2019t think, besides himself.\"\n\nAll Trump seems to care about is his wall, and Democrats' refusal to give in to his unreasonable demands that have disrupted the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nBut Americans don't want Trump's wall, and they also don't want Trump to shut down the government to try to make it happen.\n\nA newly released Quinnipiac poll emphasizes how out of touch with the country Trump is. By a margin of 63 to 32 percent, the public opposes shutting down the government for the pointless wall, and 56 percent of the public blames Trump for the impasse.\n\nTrump and his fellow Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), are clearly losing the fight over the shutdown.\n\nThe most Trump can muster is more whining and complaining. And the farmers, who likely wanted to hear what Trump will actually do to help them, were stuck being nothing more than a captive audience for his latest public meltdown.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But every day, he is choosing not to.\n\nTrump now owns the longest federal government shutdown in American history \u2014 but he couldn't have pulled it off without having Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) as a willing accomplice.\n\nMcConnell is single-handedly preventing the Senate from even voting on legislation that would end the shutdown, which Trump insisted on in a tantrum because Congress refused to waste $5 billion on his useless border wall. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives have passed bills to reopen the government, but McConnell won't allow a vote on any of them unless and until Trump promises to sign them.\n\nNow, public pressure is mounting on McConnell to just cut it out and end Trump's shutdown already \u2014 because McConnell is the one person other than Trump who could actually make this happen, if only he bothered to try.\n\nA Washington Post analysis notes that McConnell \"could bring a 'clean' funding bill to the floor, free up his GOP caucus to support it and could quite possibly secure enough votes to override a presidential veto.\"\n\n\"How much longer can Mitch McConnell sit it out?\" the L.A. Times asked, referring to McConnell's unwillingness to lift a finger to help end the shutdown. The Wall Street Journal also took note of McConnell staying on the sidelines.\n\nEven McConnell's hometown newspaper has called on him to reopen the government, hoping he would do so even if that means overriding a Trump veto on spending bills.\n\nYet even though the shutdown is literally putting American lives at risk, McConnell refuses to stand up to Trump in any way.\n\nMcConnell's fellow senators are also starting to notice his cowardice.\n\n\"Sen. McConnell and his caucus are AWOL in the middle of this shutdown,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said on Friday, when McConnell was heading home to Kentucky rather than staying in Washington to work on a solution to the shutdown.\n\n\"This is the Trump shutdown, but Sen. McConnell and his caucus are becoming bigger and bigger accomplices,\" Van Hollen said.\n\nVan Hollen and other Democrats tried to bring up legislation to reopen the government. But rather than allowing Senators to vote on the bills, McConnell called the attempt \"absolutely pointless.\"\n\nThis is the case even though, before Trump's wall tantrum, McConnell supported identical funding legislation that passed the entire Senate with no opposition.\n\nWhile McConnell may think it's \"pointless\" to stop denying paychecks to 800,000 federal workers, the American public is becoming more and more fed up with his obstructionist ways.\n\nA recent Quinnipiac poll shows 56 percent of the public blames Trump and the Republicans for the current shutdown, while only 36 percent place the blame on Democrats.\n\nThese are results are consistent with other polling: As Bloomberg reports, six recent polls show the public places the blame for the shutdown squarely with Trump and congressional Republicans.\n\nMitch McConnell has the power to end the shutdown. Unfortunately, he lacks the willpower to do so.\n\nThat's not leadership. That's cowardice.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump took forever to answer a direct and damning charge.\n\nFor at least 61 hours, Trump avoided directly responding to a bombshell report revealing that the FBI had opened an investigation into whether he was secretly working on behalf of Russia.\n\nIn a brief reply to a reporter's question on the White House lawn, Trump said, \"I never worked for Russia. Not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question. Because it's a whole big, fat hoax. It's just a hoax.\"\n\nThe statement was the first direct response Trump made to the new and disturbing allegation since the New York Times posted their story around 8 p.m. on Friday night. It took 61 hours for Trump to say something.\n\nThe Times reported that after Trump fired then-FBI director James Comey, law enforcement officials were \"so concerned by the president's behavior that they began investigating whether he had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests.\"\n\nAs part of that investigation, officials \"had to consider whether the president\u2019s own actions constituted a possible threat to national security.\" They also tried to determine if Trump was working as a Russian asset in an active capacity or unwittingly.\n\nThe concern that Trump was attempting to obstruct justice by removing Comey was also a part of the investigation.\n\nThese lines of inquiry led to the creation of the investigation currently being headed by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nDespite the seriousness of the information that was reported, Trump has studiously avoided responding to the charges.\n\nAfter the story was published he used his Twitter account to do his usual venting and fuming about the free press, whining about \"the Failing New York Times and the corrupt former leaders of the FBI\" and slamming \"fake reporting\" that \"creates anger and disunity.\" He also wrote that he was \"FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton.\"\n\nHe did a phone interview on Fox News with fan and unhinged conservative Jeanine Pirro, who asked him directly about the report \u2014 but instead of denying the information, Trump filibustered and complained that the issue had come up at all. He said the article was \"insulting\" and again reasserted that he's been \"tougher on Russia than anybody else.\"\n\nBut he didn't directly deny the allegation at the heart of the story.\n\nThe denial, weak and dismissive and only a few words long, took 61 hours to come out. The hesitation combined with Trump's long track record of dishonesty and duplicity gives enormous credibility to the ongoing concerns that he is compromised and is not acting in American interests.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

By cutting off their pay, the Trump administration is making it harder for them to keep up on their bills, and credit. That kind of financial strife raises red flags in security clearance checks. So, Trump is literally jeopardizing the jobs of many federal workers, even past the Trump shutdown.\"\n\nThe financial hardship for veterans is also increasing concerns of suicide within this vulnerable group of Americans.\n\n\"If this shutdown does not stop, we are going to have fatalities.

Canales, veteran liaison officer with the American Federation of Government Employees, told ABC News.\n\nCanales, who served in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm, said he has been referring calls to the Department of Veterans Affairs over concerns that a veteran might self-harm.\n\nThe shutdown is happening \u2014 and depriving hundreds of thousands of veterans of their much-needed paychecks \u2014 because Trump has demanded that American taxpayers foot the bill for an unnecessary border wall costing billions of dollars. Polling has consistently shown that Americans do not support his wall and certainly do not support the shutdown he's so \"proud\" of.\n\nThe public has repeatedly made clear that the government should be reopened and that Trump's obsession with appeasing racist supporters with the wall is not worth the harm to the global economy.\n\nBut Trump is refusing to listen, and has threatened to keep the government shutdown for months or even years unless Congress gives him $5 billion of taxpayers' money to build a wall he insisted repeatedly that Mexico would pay for.\n\nNow, thanks to Trump's stubborn and destructive behavior, the same veterans he claims to care so much about are being harmed. Trump has a history mistreating and insulting veterans, but now he's putting their lives and livelihood at risk, all for a \"vanity wall\" no one even wants.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

A spokesman told the Post that 6,400 of those workers have been on furlough because of Trump's shutdown, while 2,100 are working without pay because they have been identified as essential workers.\n\nThe Coast Guard memo suggested that government workers find \"supplemental income\" during the shutdown by \"having a garage sale,\" selling unwanted items \"through the newspaper or online,\" babysitting children, walking pets, house-sitting, \"[turning] your hobby into income,\" tutoring students, or becoming a \"mystery shopper.\"\n\nAs a last option, the document suggested employees could \"file bankruptcy.\"\n\nThe suggestions reflect a desperate response to Trump's unnecessary shuttering of the federal government.

Jim Jordan (R-OH), a man accused of turning a blind eye to students getting molested, is now outraged at the idea of Democrats investigating Trump's alleged criminal activity.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chair of the powerful House Committee on Oversight and Reform, announced earlier this week that Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime lawyer and \"fixer,\" will testify publicly before the committee on Feb. 7.\n\nCohen has spent months cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and the Trump campaign's potential involvement in it. Cohen testified in federal court that Trump directed him to pay hush money to multiple Trump mistresses \u2014 which prosecutors say were felony attempts to influence the 2016 election by avoiding campaign finance laws.\n\nJordan, a co-founder of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus and a longtime Trump lackey, was apoplectic that Democrats would dare to do their constitutional duty by conducting oversight of Trump and investigating his potential crimes.\n\nJordan claimed in a statement that Cummings \"will be using the committee as a venue for political theater rather than legitimate oversight.\"\n\nHe refused to elaborate on why Trump's alleged criminal activity is not a \"legitimate\" line of congressional investigation.\n\nWithout providing any evidence, Jordan claimed that simply interviewing one of Trump's most trusted colleagues \"makes clear that Chairman Cummings and the Democrats will do whatever it takes to attack this President.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, chair of the House Freedom Caucus, also complained about questioning Cohen \u2014 and said that if Cohen is going to be called to testify, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should be too.\n\nIn a show of caution and restraint, Cummings announced that he has consulted with Mueller's team and has \"no interest in inappropriately interfering with any ongoing criminal investigations.\"\n\nCummings also noted that the 2018 elections show Americans want Congress to get back to its \"Constitutional responsibility to serve as an independent check and balance on the Executive Branch by restoring accountability and transparency.\"\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time Jordan thought it was fine to look the other way when people in power commit crimes.\n\nLast year, almost a dozen people accused Jordan of helping to cover up predatory sexual behavior by a team doctor when Jordan worked as a wrestling coach at Ohio State University. After Jordan denied having known about the doctor's crimes, one of his former student-athletes said he believes Jordan \"is absolutely lying if he says he doesn\u2019t know what was going on\" at the time.\n\nFor the past two years, the GOP-led House of Representatives has followed the Jordan method of ignoring alleged criminal activity.\n\nPrevious GOP \"investigations\" led by Trump lackeys like Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) were so pathetic that even fellow Republicans mocked them. The GOP-led oversight was so lax Cohen was able to lie to Congress when Republicans were in charge with no repercussions \u2014 until Mueller's team caught him.\n\nBut now that voters have put Democrats back in charge of leading these investigations, Cummings seems determined to do them right and get to the truth.\n\nIt's a new day in Congress, and no amount of whining from Trump's Republican allies will stop the new Democratic majority from doing its job and properly investigating Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Elijah Cummings (D-MD).\n\n\"I thank Michael Cohen for agreeing to testify before the Oversight Committee voluntarily,\" Cummings said in a statement. \"I want to make clear that we have no interest in inappropriately interfering with any ongoing criminal investigations, and to that end, we are in the process of consulting with Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s office. The Committee will announce additional information in the coming weeks.\"\n\nCohen also released a statement Thursday saying that he had agreed to testify publicly before the committee \"in furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers.\"\n\n\"I look forward to having the privilege of being afforded a platform with which to give a full and credible account of the events which have transpired,\" he added.\n\nThe announcement was perfectly timed to ruin Trump's day \u2014 coming just as Trump arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border for a photo-op designed to rally support for the wall that no one wants.\n\nWhile Trump had hoped to dominate the headlines with his stunt, the revelation that Cohen had agreed to testify publicly stole the spotlight as networks interrupted their coverage with the breaking news.\n\nIt's not yet known what Cohen will be asked about when he appears before the congressional committee, but investigators have no shortage of material to work with.\n\nIn December, Cohen was sentenced to 3 years in prison after pleading guilty to multiple criminal charges, including two campaign finance violations stemming from illegal hush money payments made to women during the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Trump directed Cohen to commit those crimes. If Cohen testifies publicly about Trump's role in the illegal scheme, that will put Trump in a vulnerable position.\n\nCohen also pleaded guilty to felony counts of lying to Congress about Trump's business dealings with Russia and failing to report millions of dollars in income.\n\nWhen he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, Cohen admitted that he had provided false statements to the Senate Intelligence Committee about the Trump Tower Moscow project in order to minimize Trump's actual role in the effort to build a Trump property in Moscow.\n\nHe also admitted to lying about the timeline of the negotiations for the project, claiming they had ended before the Iowa caucuses in February 2016 when they were actually ongoing through the summer of 2016 \u2014 meaning that Trump was engaged in negotiations with Moscow, and lying about it, throughout the presidential primary election.\n\nThe news about Cohen agreeing to testify publicly marks a significant development in the ongoing investigations encircling Trump and his associates.\n\nAs Trump's longtime lawyer and \"fixer,\" Cohen was involved in the inner workings of Trump's financial and business dealings, as well as his personal life. He knows Trump's secrets \u2014 and now he is about to have an opportunity to tell them to the public.\n\nAs former FBI special agent Josh Campbell put it, Cohen's testimony \"will be unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in recent memory\" because \"[h]e\u2019s a witness essentially unencumbered by personal legal jeopardy (he\u2019s already going to jail) and he will not have to respect classification restraints (he doesn\u2019t work for the govt). Buckle up!\"\n\nThe era of oversight has begun \u2014 and if this development is any indication, the road ahead is a rough one for Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The White House has reached a new low in trying to spin the Trump shutdown.\n\nWhile Lori McLaurin, a furloughed federal worker, wonders just how close she is to becoming homeless, Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, claims federal workers are \"better off\" because of the Trump shutdown.\n\n\"When they say, 'one paycheck away from homeless,' I'm not there, but I\u2019m real close. And it's disturbing,\" McLaurin, a single mother from Philadelphia, told USA TODAY.\n\nWhile McLaurin and 800,000 federal workers go without a paycheck, an out-of-touch White House is trying to make the claim that federal workers should be happy about their situation. In an interview with PBS Newshour, Hassett, chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, made a bizarre case of why unpaid federal workers are the lucky ones.\n\n\"A huge share of government workers were going to take vacation days, say between Christmas and New Year\u2019s,\" Hassett said. \"And then we have a shutdown, and so they can\u2019t go to work. So then they have the vacation, but they don't have to use their vacation days.\"\n\nThus, Hassett concluded, \"In some sense they're better off.\"\n\nIt is hard to imagine an administration more out of touch with the pain it is causing than this one. Workers like McLaurin are concerned about becoming homeless, and Hassett has the audacity to call her situation a \"vacation.\" A food bank in Washington, D.C., is hosting five \"pop-up markets\" to distribute free food to workers hurt by the Trump shutdown. The Coast Guard went so far as to recommend families host garage sales or take up babysitting gigs in an effort to get by until Trump decides to open the government again.\n\nAll the while, the Trump administration is doing little to ease their pain, and a whole lot to exacerbate it. Trump belittled the concerns of workers, claiming his obsession with a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border is \"a higher purpose\" than paychecks for almost a million people.\n\n\"So this really does have a higher purpose than next week's pay,\" Trump said a week ago. \"And the people that won't get next week's pay, or the following week's pay \u2014 I think if you ever really looked at those people, I think they'd say, Mr. President, keep going. This is far more important.\"\n\nThat is not what federal workers are saying \u2014 especially now that many of them received pay stubs this week showing their $0 \"paychecks.\"\n\nTrump, a failed casino owner and former reality TV gameshow host, was regularly bailed out by his daddy when he ran multiple businesses into the ground. But as workers face increased pressure from a prolonged Trump shutdown, most don't have wealthy family members to bail them out.\n\n\"Many federal workers will not be receiving their paychecks,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told reporters. \"And what that means in their lives is tragic in terms of their credit rating, paying their mortgage, paying their rent, paying their car payment, paying their children\u2019s tuition and the rest.\"\n\nTrump, she said, \"seems to be insensitive to that. He thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money, but they can't.\"\n\nThe shutdown isn't a vacation for furloughed workers. While Trump is busy throwing tantrums demanding a border wall, real families are facing real hardship. Pelosi is leading a new Democratic majority in the House which continues to pass bills to reopen the government and issue paychecks to federal workers.\n\nYet Trump, and complicit Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, refuse to end the shutdown.\n\nIn the meantime, workers like Lori McLaurin will continue to edge closer to homelessness, a situation no one in their right mind would call \"better off.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Even as federal workers are getting 'paychecks' that read $0.00, Mitch McConnell still refuses to schedule a vote to end the Trump shutdown.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell still refuses to schedule a vote to end the Trump shutdown and reopen the government \u2014 even as thousands of federal workers literally received $0.00 paychecks today.\n\n\"Pay for about 800,000 government employees lapsed nearly three weeks ago, and Friday marks the first wave of missed paychecks,\" reports HuffPost. Given Trump's churlish tantrums, and the spineless acquiescence of McConnell, it seems possible that the shutdown could go on for weeks, months, or even years.\n\nMcConnell cares so little about the fate of the country that he was actually planning on adjourning the Senate on Thursday, giving his complicit colleagues a three-day weekend.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) was incensed that McConnell would even think about doing this.\n\n\"Why would the Senate leave town this weekend before voting to reopen the government?!\" Kaine exclaimed on Twitter. \"Countless federal workers aren't being paid. People are worrying about how to pay bills. Congress could act now to fix it if Mitch McConnell would just take up a bill. Let's stay here and do it!\"\n\nMcConnell ultimately abandoned his plan to adjourn Thursday, but no votes are expected Friday or over the weekend.\n\nSince the Trump shutdown began in December, 800,000 federal workers have been going without pay because Trump threw a tantrum about wanting a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAt the time, Trump boasted he would be \"proud\" to own the shutdown \u2014 and recent polls show Americans do, indeed, blame Trump for it.\n\nThe new majority in the House, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has been working diligently to pass legislation to reopen the government. On the first day of the new Congress, Pelosi shepherded bills through the House to end the shutdown.\n\nMore recently, the House has also passed bills to reopen individual agencies within the government, which so far include the departments of Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture. This plan would put at least some federal workers back on the job, allow them to receive their paychecks, and restore vital government services for the rest of the nation.\n\nBut McConnell has consistently refused to put forth even the minimal effort of scheduling a vote. McConnell even went so far as to call it \"absolutely pointless\" to vote to end the Trump shutdown.\n\nBut it's not pointless at all to hold such a vote, even if Trump threatens to veto the resulting bill. Actually sending a bill to Trump's desk puts more pressure on him to sign it and back down from his unreasonable demands. McConnell could also tell his caucus to simply override Trump's veto with a two-thirds majority vote.\n\nSome of McConnell's GOP colleagues are making tepid statements about reopening the government, especially Republicans who will face tough re-election battles in 2020.\n\nBut so far, their leader in the Senate is choosing steadfast loyalty to Trump over the American people \u2014 who now have to deal with the fallout from this heartless decision.\n\n\"We have about a month in savings and that's it,\" a mother who is furloughed from the Department of Homeland Security told Buzzfeed News. \"Just like everyone else, we're one or two paychecks from being in serious trouble.\"\n\nMcConnell refuses to lift a finger to help this mother, or the thousands across the country who are struggling like she is. He is so determined to show his unfettered allegiance to Trump than he won't put even an ounce of pressure on him to do the right thing.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Instead, the top Republican is bolstering Trump's shutdown of the government for a nonsensical wall.\n\n\"Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen,\" Trump complained on Twitter Wednesday. \"Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money.\"\n\nMcCarthy represents California's 23rd Congressional District, home to over 707,000 Californians \u2014 but he's not standing up for them and Trump's threat to cut off their emergency funding. Instead, McCarthy is tweeting video of the Republican leader supporting Trump's shutdown of the federal government.\n\nMcCarthy also didn't say anything about Trump's threat against McCarthy's own constituents on his official web page or on his Facebook page.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, however, who represents California's 12th District, did speak up for her home state. On Twitter Pelosi wrote, \"@realDonaldTrump\u2019s threat insults the memory of scores of Americans who perished in wildfires last year & thousands more who lost their homes.\"\n\nShe also took note of McCarthy's silence and subservience to Trump, saying McCarthy \"must join me to condemn & call on POTUS to reassure millions in CA that our govt will be there for them in their time of need.\"\n\nSince taking office, Trump has often attacked California, where Hillary Clinton defeated him in 2016 by over 4.2 million votes.\n\nWhen wildfires killed over 30 people in the state, Trump lied about the cause of the fire and blamed the victims. He threatened to withhold federal aid to help fellow Americans and refused to acknowledge the victims or praise firefighters there.\n\nOfficials within his administration followed suit and also attacked victims of the fire.\n\nAfter his withering attacks on the state, voters there rose up and purged Republicans at both the federal and local level. The Republican presence in California is at one of its lowest points in history, and that can be traced directly to Trump and his extreme unpopularity there.\n\nFaced with standing up for the state that sent him to Congress or ingratiating himself to Trump, McCarthy has clearly chosen the same path as his predecessor, failed Speaker Paul Ryan, who was always eager to turn a blind eye to Trump's vicious attacks on Americans.\n\nNow Trump is attacking the very people McCarthy supposedly represents. But instead of standing up for them, McCarthy is standing in favor of Trump's petty vendetta against the people of California.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "In his quest to build his racist border wall, Trump is seeking to divert disaster funds from places like California and Puerto Rico.\n\nTrump went to the border on Thursday for his big photo-op and softball interview with Fox's Sean Hannity \u2014 but even with Hannity feeding him his lines, Trump still couldn't explain what his emergency declaration would be or how it would work.\n\nApparently, however, Trump has one very clear idea about how he'd pay for the wall under that declaration: Stealing money from areas that have suffered actual disasters, including Puerto Rico and California.\n\nTrump's White House has asked the Army Corps of Engineers, which builds infrastructure both to alleviate the effects of past natural disasters and reduce the risks from future ones, to figure out how to redirect money to the border wall. The money would be taken from a $13.9 billion emergency supplemental bill from February 2018. That bill included $2.4 billion for projects in California to prevent floods and $2.5 billion for reconstruction projects in Puerto Rico.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Trump has displayed his disdain for Puerto Rico. His administration's utter refusal to respond to the post-Hurricane Maria humanitarian disaster led to the deaths of nearly 3,000 people.\n\nInstead of displaying any compassion for the people of the island or shame for his own failures, Trump called his response \"an incredible unsung success.\" He even went on to whine about how he didn't get enough credit for his non-response.\n\nTrump's cruelty even extended after death. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved only 3 percent of the requests for funeral assistance for deaths related to Hurricane Maria.\n\nTrump has also made no secret for his hatred of California.\n\nEven as California reels from the Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in that state's history, Trump tweeted earlier this week that he would withhold all FEMA funds from California. This is thanks to his willfully perverse belief that it is a failure of forest management, rather than the effects of climate change, that is causing California's now year-round fire season.\n\nIn a way, Trump's behavior has a terrible symmetry.\n\nIn 2017, he created a humanitarian disaster in Puerto Rico by ignoring the island after Hurricane Maria, resulting in thousands of unnecessary deaths.\n\nNow, he's created a humanitarian disaster at the border, as people fleeing horrific domestic violence and gang violence are unable to apply for asylum, and children are dying while in the custody of the border patrol.\n\nTrump's solution \u2014 to rob money from Puerto Rico in order to build his wall no one wants \u2014 will continue to harm Puerto Rico, and will do nothing to stem the harms he's created at the border.\n\nIn short, it's precisely what we would expect from Donald Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And his latest idea would not only keep the battle going \u2014 it would also expand his presidential powers.\n\nAt next week's State of the Union, Trump is expected to ask Congress to give him new powers to increase tariffs if he feels that other countries' non-tariff measures are problematic. A \"non-tariff measure\" includes things like customs duties or other regulatory laws.\n\nIn other words, Trump wants the option to increase U.S. tariffs in order to punish other countries for policies other than tariffs that he doesn't like.\n\nTrump has already been pushing the limits of his power on trade for months, and now he's asking for even more power. He already employed a little-used law to get around Congress once before so he could place steep tariffs on Chinese goods, and on aluminum and steel from other trading partners.\n\nEven without his disastrous new ideas, Trump's trade war is already a massive failure.\n\nMidwestern farmers are going bankrupt in record numbers partly because the trade war means China is no longer purchasing soybeans from America. Trump was kind enough to tell those farmers that they'd suffer, but he would \"make it up to them\" later.\n\nThings aren't any better for the auto industry. GM is cutting nearly 15,000 jobs, and considering closing five plants, because it has lost $1 billion thanks to Trump's steel tariffs.\n\nMajor employers like Caterpillar and Honeywell, which collectively employ close to 100,000 people in America, are suffering 10-figure losses because of the trade war.\n\nGiving Trump more executive power is a bad bet in any situation.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) called out the \"outright bigotry\" of two of Fox News' prime-time conservative hosts.\n\nIn a tweet, Ocasio-Cortez wrote, \"Many have recognized that @FoxNews has crossed a line beyond conservatism and into outright bigotry with their financing of Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham.\"\n\nThe newly sworn-in congresswoman took on Carlson after the right-wing site he co-founded, the Daily Caller, pushed a fake nude photograph of her. The outlet described the photo as a \"Photo Some People Described As A Nude Selfie of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\"\n\nBut the picture had been debunked long before the Daily Caller promoted it.\n\nCarlson and partner Neil Patel launched the site in 2010 with $3 million from right-wing financier Foster Friess. Ocasio-Cortez highlighted how Carlson, with his program \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" has spent years catering to white supremacists and using the bigoted language of racists.\n\nOn his program, Carlson said immigration makes America \"poorer and dirtier.\"\n\nCarlson's show, on which he has said immigration makes America \"poorer and dirtier,\" is so deeply infused with racism that advertisers have been pulling their sponsorship of his show rather than be associated with such blatant hate-mongering.\n\nRecently, Red Lobster pulled their advertising from Carlson's program. In a statement, the restaurant chain said they support programming \"that represents the highest standards of good taste, fair practice and objectivity.\" In dropping Carlson, they noted his program \"is no longer in line with our criteria.\"\n\nDespite this backlash \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014 Mike Pence recently sat down with Carlson for an interview. Carlson and the Trump-Pence team are unified in their racist attacks on immigrants.\n\nAlso singled out by Ocasio-Cortez was Laura Ingraham, host of \"The Ingraham Angle,\" which follows Carlson's show.\n\nIngraham has spent years on the right, mainly on the radio, bashing immigrants and generating racist programming. After Trump's presidential victory, the network hired her and added her to their lineup (she was reportedly in the running to be his press secretary).\n\nFrom that elevated perch she has continued her racist attacks and demagoguery. After athletes like NBA superstar LeBron James condemned Trump's racism, Ingraham whined and complained and insisted that he and other black athletes not speak up on political issues. She was widely ridiculed and condemned for the attempt to silence Trump's detractors.\n\nIngraham recently suffered a major setback when her attacks on the teenage survivors of the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, led over 130 advertisers to drop her show.\n\nFox News is a racist propaganda outlet that has spread racial demagoguery for over 21 years on the air. They helped Trump to spread his racist conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama's birth certificate, and that helped to make Trump into a political figure.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is helping the public by succinctly laying out the network's pernicious role in fostering, broadcasting and bankrolling bigotry.

    "text": "In the words of one former FBI agent, Michael Cohen's public testimony will be 'unlike anything we've seen in recent memory.'\n\nTrump's former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, has agreed to testify in an open session of Congress early next month, marking the first major move by the new Congress to increase accountability for Trump and his associates.\n\nThe hearing, scheduled for Feb. 7 before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, was announced Thursday afternoon by new committee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).\n\n\"I thank Michael Cohen for agreeing to testify before the Oversight Committee voluntarily,\" Cummings said in a statement. \"I want to make clear that we have no interest in inappropriately interfering with any ongoing criminal investigations, and to that end, we are in the process of consulting with Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s office. The Committee will announce additional information in the coming weeks.\"\n\nCohen also released a statement Thursday saying that he had agreed to testify publicly before the committee \"in furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers.\"\n\n\"I look forward to having the privilege of being afforded a platform with which to give a full and credible account of the events which have transpired,\" he added.\n\nThe announcement was perfectly timed to ruin Trump's day \u2014 coming just as Trump arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border for a photo-op designed to rally support for the wall that no one wants.\n\nWhile Trump had hoped to dominate the headlines with his stunt, the revelation that Cohen had agreed to testify publicly stole the spotlight as networks interrupted their coverage with the breaking news.\n\nIt's not yet known what Cohen will be asked about when he appears before the congressional committee, but investigators have no shortage of material to work with.\n\nIn December, Cohen was sentenced to 3 years in prison after pleading guilty to multiple criminal charges, including two campaign finance violations stemming from illegal hush money payments made to women during the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Trump directed Cohen to commit those crimes. If Cohen testifies publicly about Trump's role in the illegal scheme, that will put Trump in a vulnerable position.\n\nCohen also pleaded guilty to felony counts of lying to Congress about Trump's business dealings with Russia and failing to report millions of dollars in income.\n\nWhen he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, Cohen admitted that he had provided false statements to the Senate Intelligence Committee about the Trump Tower Moscow project in order to minimize Trump's actual role in the effort to build a Trump property in Moscow.\n\nHe also admitted to lying about the timeline of the negotiations for the project, claiming they had ended before the Iowa caucuses in February 2016 when they were actually ongoing through the summer of 2016 \u2014 meaning that Trump was engaged in negotiations with Moscow, and lying about it, throughout the presidential primary election.\n\nThe news about Cohen agreeing to testify publicly marks a significant development in the ongoing investigations encircling Trump and his associates.\n\nAs Trump's longtime lawyer and \"fixer,\" Cohen was involved in the inner workings of Trump's financial and business dealings, as well as his personal life. He knows Trump's secrets \u2014 and now he is about to have an opportunity to tell them to the public.\n\nAs former FBI special agent Josh Campbell put it, Cohen's testimony \"will be unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in recent memory\" because \"[h]e\u2019s a witness essentially unencumbered by personal legal jeopardy (he\u2019s already going to jail) and he will not have to respect classification restraints (he doesn\u2019t work for the govt). Buckle up!\"\n\nThe era of oversight has begun \u2014 and if this development is any indication, the road ahead is a rough one for Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's obsession with a border wall is getting truly dangerous.\n\nA group representing FBI agents sent a letter to Congress warning that the Trump shutdown is \"not sustainable,\" and that it's dangerously close to compromising national security.\n\nThe letter from the FBI Agents Association lays out the reasons a government shutdown is a problem both for law enforcement agents and for the nation as a whole.\n\n\"This situation is not sustainable,\" the FBIAA warned. \"The important work done by the Bureau needs to be funded immediately.\" The FBIAA represents the overwhelming majority of active FBI agents.\n\nThe FBIAA cautioned that \"as those on the frontlines in the fight against criminals and terrorists, we urge expediency before financial insecurity compromises national security.\"\n\nBut this dire warning is falling on deaf ears.\n\nBefore leaving for a politically motivated photo-op at the southern border, Trump had the audacity to attack Democrats as being unconcerned about the security and safety of the country.\n\n\"Again, there is no reason why we can't come to a deal,\" Trump told reporters. \"But you have another side that doesn't care about border security. The Democrats \u2014 which I've been saying all along \u2014 they don't give a damn about crime.\"\n\nContrary to Trump's untethered bloviating, it is the Democrats who are diligently trying to end the shutdown.\n\nOn her first day leading a new Democratic majority as Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) passed bills to reopen the government, which included funding the FBI. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), in cowering deference to Trump, blocked the Senate from taking similar action.\n\nAs Pelosi put it, Republicans refuse to take \"yes\" for an answer. And the dangers of Republican inaction are mounting.\n\nOne of the main issues identified in the letter involves the security standards needed to be an FBI agent. In order to maintain their security clearances, agents must undergo \"routine financial background checks to ensure that Agents are financially stable and responsible.\"\n\nBut with the Trump shutdown, there is a danger that agents \u2014 who are among the 800,000 federal workers going without a paycheck right now \u2014 could miss payments on debts they owe.\n\n\"Not only could the shutdown delay new or renewed security clearances, it could keep some agents out of active duty,\" Politico reports.\n\nTrump is constantly lying about immigrants posing a danger to national security. But in reality, it's Trump's actions \u2014 aided and abetted by complicit Republicans in Congress \u2014 that are truly endangering the country.\n\nThis danger is coming in many forms. Recently, the world's largest union of airline pilots warned that air travel could become less safe because of the Trump shutdown. And the FDA is currently unable to properly inspect the nation's food supply, which could have monumental consequences if contaminated food makes it to market.\n\nIn addition to those dangers, thousands of people are at risk of being evicted from their homes because of the lack of funds available for certain housing programs. National parks have closed or become overridden with human excrement.\n\nIn December, Trump boldly proclaimed he would be \"proud\" to own the shutdown. With that ownership comes the responsibility for dealing with the consequences. And right now, those consequences include making America a less safe, less secure place to live.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is blaming everybody but himself for the shutdown he caused.\n\nExactly 30 days after he proclaimed he would be \"proud\" to shut down the federal government if he didn't get funding for his border wall, Trump is now massively backpedaling.\n\n\"The buck stops with everybody,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House on Thursday, responding to a question about how to resolve the government shutdown that he created.\n\nThat statement is a perversion of a slogan from President Harry S. Truman, who had a sign on his desk in the White House that said, \"The Buck Stops Here.\"\n\nIn his farewell address to America in 1953, Truman said, \"The President \u2014 whoever he is \u2014 has to decide. He can't pass the buck to anybody. No one else can do the deciding for him. That's his job.\"\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is passing the buck to everybody except himself.\n\nJust a month ago, though, Trump was singing a completely different tune.\n\nIn his infamously embarrassing public conversation with Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Trump said, \"I'll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck. Because the people of this country don\u2019t want criminals and people that have lots of problems \u2014 and drugs \u2014 pouring into our country.\"\n\nHe added, \"So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn\u2019t work. I will take the mantle of shutting it down.\"\n\nAs usual, Trump was lying.\n\nThe shutdown is unpopular and totally unnecessary. Trump is single-handedly causing it because he's obsessed with spending billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to erect a useless wall on the southern border, after promising for years that Mexico would pay for the boondoggle.\n\nNow Trump is facing serious backlash as thousands of federal workers go unpaid and trash piles up from coast to coast at America's national parks.\n\nDemocrats have been trying to reopen the government. The only obstacle is Trump, and the Republicans who enable his tantrums.\n\nTrump also claimed Thursday that Democrats in Congress \"could solve this problem in literally 15 minutes.\" But on Wednesday, he stormed out of a meeting with Democratic leaders after 30 minutes because he wasn't immediately given everything he wanted.\n\nWith his cowardly blame-shifting, Trump has shown once again how out of step he is with the traditions embraced by previous presidents like Truman. When the going gets tough, Trump runs away with his tail between his legs.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The FDA has to stop doing all of its routine food inspections because of the shutdown \u2014 and that could start making people sick.\n\nThe harmful effects of Trump's government shutdown are widespread. Safety is already compromised at airports, with TSA agents quitting and airline pilots becoming increasingly worried about the safety of their passengers. Trash is piling up in national parks, and thousands of people living in low-income housing may soon be out on the street.\n\nBut not even these crises are likely to be as far-reaching as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suspending all of its routine domestic food inspections. The FDA oversees about 80 percent of the country's food supply, which means every American is now at higher risk of eating contaminated food.\n\nHundreds of food inspectors were furloughed at the start of the shutdown. That meant that the FDA hasn't been able to perform the roughly 160 routine food inspections it conducts each week.\n\nThis is bad enough generally, but especially frightening for food that is at high risk of contamination, including vegetables, fruits, seafood, and soft cheeses. And those inspections were stopped too.\n\nNow the FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, says that he is \"working on a plan\" to bring employees back to inspect those facilities that handle high-risk food or have a history of food safety problems, perhaps next week. But that doesn't take care of the fact that those facilities have gone uninspected thus far.\n\nThings were bad for food safety even before the FDA went down to a shutdown skeleton crew. 2018 saw 22 food safety investigations by the CDC, the highest number of alerts in over ten years. One of the most widespread of these \u2014 an E. coli outbreak that killed five people \u2014 was possibly caused by contaminated irrigation water, as the lettuce farm was located near a large cattle feedlot.\n\nThe Obama administration was set to impose new rules in January 2018 that would have provided greater oversight of irrigation water. Under Trump, however, the FDA decided to suspend those rules, which meant that the FDA largely stopped checking to see whether irrigation water was contaminated with manure.\n\nPrior to the shutdown, the FDA was already a victim of Trump's mania for deregulation \u2014 his assumption that everything is best when there is less oversight. When you combine that mindset with Trump's childish insistence on keeping the government closed over a wall no one wants, you get a country where things like shellfish are going uninspected.\n\nFoodborne illnesses are widespread even when the FDA is fully staffed, sickening millions and killing thousands. When you take away the agency's ability to inspect food effectively \u2014 even just for a short while \u2014 there's no way that number isn't going to spike dramatically.\n\nNow, all we can do is wait for the fallout.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The Republican Party has fully embraced both Rep. Steve King, a long-time racist and neo-Nazi sympathizer, and his extremist immigration policies.\n\nFor a period near the end of the 2018 midterms, the Republican Party briefly pretended to be offended by the blatant racism and openly white supremacist views of Rep. Steve King (R-IA). But with the election in the rearview mirror, King is once again a member of good standing in the Republican Party.\n\nAnd it's even worse than that, according to a shocking report on King the New York Times published Thursday. Republicans haven't just failed to adequately condemn King's white supremacy \u2014 they've also fully embraced his white-supremacist approach to immigration policy.\n\nBefore Trump made a racist border wall and anti-immigration rhetoric the core of his campaign, King spent years in Congress pushing the same agenda. And these days, King's anti-immigrant racism is so ingrained in the Republican Party that GOP leadership is willing to join Trump in shutting down the government to fight for it.\n\nThe Times report includes some shocking new racist quotes from King. But even if Republican leaders eventually break their silence and condemn these quotes, they can't escape the fact that King's anti-immigrant racism is now the Republican party line.\n\n\u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d King told the Times in an interview. \u201cWhy did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\u201d\n\nHe also dismissed the new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, which is the most diverse and representative in the history of the country, by saying, \"You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men.\"\n\nIn reality, white men are slightly over-represented in the new Democratic majority. Roughly 31 percent of the American population is made up of white men, and 38 percent of Democrats in the House are white men. But King is obviously more comfortable in the new Republican minority, which is made up of 90 percent white men \u2014 most of whom are embracing the radical Trump-King immigration policy that includes demanding a useless wall to be built along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nWhen freshman Democratic lawmaker Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) was caught on video using a curse word to describe Trump, Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) rushed in front of the cameras to denounce her rhetoric.\n\nBut when King uses racist rhetoric and sympathizes with neo-Nazis, McCarthy is silent.\n\nThe Times explains how Trump \"embraced the once-fringe views\" of King, who bragged about having \"market-tested\" Trump's immigration policy \u2014 and how the entire Republican Party went along with it:\n\nWith the federal government in a third week of paralysis over a border wall, Mr. Trump\u2019s positions are a reminder of how Mr. King\u2019s ideology and his language maligning undocumented residents helped shape the Republican message in 2016 and 2018 and define Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda and prospects for re-election. ... Early in Mr. Trump\u2019s term, the president invited Mr. King \u2014 who was long snubbed by establishment Republicans like the former House speaker John A. Boehner \u2014 to the Oval Office. There, the president boasted of having raised more money for the congressman\u2019s campaigns than anyone else, including during a 2014 Iowa visit, Mr. King recalled in an interview with The Times. \u201cYes, Mr. President,\u201d Mr. King replied. \u201cBut I market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something.\u201d\n\nIn October, King claimed that the agenda of the Republican Party was the same as far-right white supremacist groups in Europe.\n\nAnd King knows a lot about European white supremacists. In an August 2018 interview with an Austrian outlet, the Times notes, King \"spoke of 'the Great Replacement,' a conspiracy theory on the far right that claims shadowy elites are working behind the scenes to reduce white populations to minorities in their own countries.\"\n\nWhen he made those statements, King \u2014 with the full support of the GOP majority in the House \u2014 was chairman of the Constitution & Civil Justice subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nThese were also the same sentiments echoed by the neo-Nazis who marched on Charlottesville with torches and chanted, \"Jews will not replace us.\"\n\nThese are the types of people King, and the Republican Party, now openly court. After all, the Times points out, \"Mr. King's full-throated embrace of nativism has long found a supportive constituency in the rural Midwest, the region that was a key to Mr. Trump's 2016 victory and represents his most likely path to re-election.\"\n\nKing's once-fringe views are no longer an outlier; they are the core of what it means to be a Republican today. And the complicit silence from leaders like McCarthy show just how strongly King and his radical message are embraced by the GOP as a whole.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But the actual workers say this is a lie and are calling for the government to reopen.\n\nIn addition to putting travelers' lives at risk, the shutdown is also causing serious inconveniences.\n\nLines at major airports like LaGuardia in New York City are growing because TSA agents are beginning to call out sick at a higher rate than normal. On a normal day, 3.5 percent of workers call out. That has recently risen to 5.5 percent.\n\nOne frequent business traveler told ABC News he's \"never seen the line in LaGuardia that bad and I probably take the shuttle 40 to 50 times each year, 25 round trips.\"\n\nTrump's obsession with his wall isn't just creating havoc across America; airline pilots also say it is making travel unsafe across the world.

    "text": "According to Rudy Giuliani, the years just 'merged together' for Trump.\n\nRudy Giuliani went on Fox News Radio yesterday to say Trump has no idea when his corporation stopped negotiating with Russia over the Trump Tower in Moscow, continuing his tradition of confusing the narrative about Trump's business dealings.\n\nAccording to Giuliani, the talks could have lasted all the way up until November 2016, which flies in the face of Trump's own July 2016 assertion that he had no dealings at all in Russia. Giuliani claims that Trump just doesn't remember how long the Trump corporation was in talks with the Russians about a major Moscow real estate deal that Trump had been eager to build for literally decades.\n\nGiuliani's explanation is confusing at best: \"And he says as far as he's concerned, it could be anywhere up to November of 2016. But if you ask him to pinpoint the dates, he'd say to me 2015 and 2016 merged together.\" It's hardly reassuring to think that neither the president nor his attorney can separate one year from another.\n\nGiuliani also apparently isn't clear on the concept of what it means to do business with someone. He said, for example, that Trump wasn't doing business in Moscow by signing a letter of intent about a Trump Tower Moscow because it was an early step in the project.\n\nThe Trump Corporation's ill-fated exploration into Russian real estate came to the fore last November, when former Trump fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's real estate dealings with Russia. Cohen initially told Congress the conversations about the tower stopped in January 2016, but information from Cohen's plea made it clear they lasted until at least June 2016.\n\nOf course, Trump lawyers, including Giuliani, have a long history of being wildly uncertain as to what his client knows, while being completely unafraid to speculate about it to the press.\n\nWhen the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting \u2014 where various Trump associates met with Russians to get dirt about Hillary Clinton \u2014 first came to light, Trump repeatedly declared he didn't know a thing about it. Then Giuliani went on television and said that maybe he and Trump both knew about the meeting in advance, but he couldn't say for sure because \"you could have very, very differing recollections on that because it was right in the heat of the campaign.\"\n\nWhether it is deliberate deception or deep confusion, both Giuliani and Trump are experts at muddying the waters over Trump's connections with Russia, and this is a perfect example.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But ever since Trump shut down the government, he has refused to engage in good-faith negotiations with Democrats, exemplified by his latest tantrum-like behavior.\n\nMoments after the meeting ended, a petulant Trump sent out a childish tweet calling the meeting \"a total waste of time.\" He confirmed Schumer's assessment of the meeting, saying, \"I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy [Pelosi] said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!\"\n\nThe shutdown started while Republicans still controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House. Once Speaker Pelosi took over the House, she immediately led that chamber to passing bills to reopen the government.

    "text": "A new poll shows a majority of Americans correctly identify Trump as the cause of the government shutdown.\n\nThe government shutdown is wreaking havoc on the lives of everyday Americans, and a new poll from Reuters shows a growing number of people know exactly who is to blame: Trump.\n\nThe poll found 51 percent of adults say Trump \"deserves most of the blame\" for the current shutdown. That's an increase of 4 percent from a late December Reuters poll \u2014 which shows that Trump's feeble attempts to shift blame to Democrats are failing, and even backfiring.\n\nThe Trump shutdown started in late December after Trump threw a tantrum demanding Congress fork over $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Even before the shutdown started, a USA Today poll showed Americans would blame Trump for it.\n\nIn a nationally televised White House meeting with Democratic leaders, Trump said he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government if he didn't get his way. He went so far as to promise Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), \"I'm not going to blame you for it.\"\n\nAfter Democrats in Congress refused to pay Trump's ransom, Trump moved forward with his plan to shut down the government, with help from feckless GOP leaders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nAfter House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) shepherded through bills to reopen the government, McConnell refused to even hold a vote on them in the Senate \u2014 a cowardly lack of leadership that was criticized even by McConnell's hometown newspaper.\n\nThe pain Americans are feeling from the Trump shutdown is only growing. An estimated 800,000 federal workers are not receiving paychecks. Airline pilots say the shutdown puts travelers at risk. Thousands of tenants are at risk of eviction due to a lack of funding for housing programs. And pristine national parks, lacking enough staff to keep things in order, are being destroyed.\n\nThe longer Trump insists on continuing the shutdown, the worse the situation will get. Food assistance for millions of low-income families is at risk if there is no funding solution in the coming weeks. As Americans begin filing their taxes, the government might not be able to process billions of dollars in tax refunds until the shutdown ends.\n\nTrump appears to realize he is facing the brunt of the blame for the shutdown. In a desperate attempt to make his case to the public, Trump decided to give a prime-time address from the Oval Office and demand that TV networks air it. But he squandered this opportunity by giving a short, boring anti-immigrant tirade that rehashed the same unconvincing lies he's been telling about the wall for months.\n\nWhile Democrats continue to work to reopen the government, Trump and his congressional lackeys like Mitch McConnell are continuing to stand in the way. And the longer the shutdown goes on, the more the public points a finger at the main culprit: Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "During this critical shutdown time, Trump has a partisan \u2014 with no real experience \u2014 in charge of his budget office.\n\nTrump has been flailing throughout this entire shutdown. He's got no clear strategy of how to get past it, and no understanding of how a shutdown affects people and programs. That's in part due to the fact a partisan operative, Russell Vought, is the one running the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) right now.\n\nVought's experience doesn't include anything related to running a budget office for a nation of 325 million people and a $3.7 trillion yearly budget. Instead, Vought spent 15 years as a belligerent conservative staffer at places like Heritage Action, a wing of the hyper-partisan Heritage Foundation, and as a blogger for right-wing sites like RedState. He's never previously run a government agency of any size. What he has done, however, is virulently hate Muslims, saying they have a \"deficient theology\" and \"don't know God.\"\n\nHe fits right in at the Trump administration, where the science adviser never studied science, where the head of Housing and Urban Development knows nothing about housing policy, and where a reality TV star ran a major communications shop for the White House.\n\nBecause he's just a partisan operative, Vought's solutions to the shutdown are threadbare. He's done things like sending Congress a letter making the same tired demand for a wall. That letter also demanded $800 million for the humanitarian crisis at the border\u2013a crisis of Trump's own making. The letter contained no details as to why the administration needs the extra $5.7 billion or how that money would be spent, given that the amount wouldn't nearly cover construction of the entire wall. Even Trump's own Department of Homeland Security puts the cost at over $21 billion.\n\nInstead of trying to get the government open, Vought is engaging in stunts designed to minimize the effects of the shutdown on Trump's base so that they won't get mad at Trump. He randomly declared that the IRS would issue tax refunds during the shutdown, even though most of the IRS is furloughed and previous interpretations of federal law say that refunds can't be issued during a shutdown. This move also calls back thousands of IRS workers, all of whom have to work, but none of whom will be paid. He's also been part of the administration's flip-flop on funding food stamps.\n\nVought is the perfect avatar for the whole of the Trump administration: wholly inexperienced, belligerently partisan, and utterly unconcerned about consequences. It's going to be awful hard to end a government shutdown when one party lets people like this run the show.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

There's no evidence he ever paid the money back to Fred Trump.\n\nThe government shutdown caused by Trump's demand for a useless and expensive southern border wall is creating a major disruption in the lives over 800,000 federal workers.\n\nThose workers aren't being paid because of Trump's stubborn, childish behavior. Their families are suffering, and so are the businesses where these workers would otherwise spend money. The problem has rippled throughout the entire U.S. economy, and will only get worse.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about this recently, he actually claimed that getting his silly wall is a \"higher purpose than next week's pay\" for federal workers.\n\nBut federal workers help keep the government functioning, and they deserve to be paid for it. The wall will help no one and solve nothing, and would be a waste of taxpayer money.\n\nIn his private business career, Trump repeatedly refused to pay people what he owed them \u2014 so he clearly has no problem denying people a hard-earned paycheck.\n\nFederal workers have been speaking out against Trump's shutdown, and decrying his willingness to give his ego priority over the national interest.\n\nThey, and the vast majority of Americans, cannot go to daddy for a bailout like Trump has his whole life. And Speaker Pelosi isn't afraid to point that out as she pushes for normalcy to return to the government.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But as 800,000 federal workers across the nation face day after day without a paycheck, other GOP senators are slowly, tepidly voicing support for reopening the government even without funding for the wall.\n\n\"We don't need to hold them hostage,\" Sen. John Boozman (R-AR) told CNN, referring to federal workers.\n\nAlaska's Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told CNN she'd \"like to see\" votes on bills to reopen the government. Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) told CNN that the Senate \"should be doing everything we can here to minimize the impact of this partial shutdown. Voting on appropriations bills \u2014 we can do that.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida also said he could \"potentially\" support efforts to reopen the government.\n\nMore and more Senate Republicans seem to be feeling the pressure of Trump's tantrum-fueled shutdown. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Cory Gardner (R-CO), two of the GOP's most vulnerable senators up for re-election in 2020, had already voiced support for reopening the government with or without funding for a border wall, along with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.\n\nOf course, while a growing number of Republican senators are wavering in their support of the Trump shutdown, many remain steadfastly loyal to it.\n\nAfter Trump's boringly racist primetime address meant to bolster support for his position, Iowa's Sen. Joni Ernst reiterated her unwavering commitment to following Trump's lead. Even though Democrats are voting on bills to reopen the government, Ernst launched into a partisan broadside by accusing Democrats of \"playing games\" while praising Trump's wall obsession.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has led the passage of bills through the House that would reopen the government. And this week, she is leading another push to reopen individual departments of the government, like the Treasury and Interior departments, that handle now-languishing services like processing tax returns and managing national parks.\n\nMcConnell is ceding his constitutional authority to the White House by refusing to allow a vote on any bills to reopen the government that Trump doesn't like.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, are steadfast in their commitment to reopen the government. Some are even vowing to grind Senate business to a halt until McConnell allows a vote on bills to end the Trump shutdown.\n\nIn the end, the American people place the blame of the shutdown squarely on the shoulders of Trump and congressional Republicans.

    "text": "The Department of Education has several deregulation proposals, all of which will make it easier for unsavory schools to take money from unsuspecting students.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos has already gone to great lengths to ensure that for-profit colleges can scam students. Now, if DeVos has her way, the Department of Education will deregulate certain types of higher education providers \u2014 and make it easier for students to get ripped off.\n\nGenerally, DeVos doesn't like protecting students. She tried to block loan forgiveness \u2014 the process by which students who attended schools that have since closed were able to get some of their federal loans written off \u2014 and only started to cancel loans after a judge ordered her to re-implement an Obama-era loan forgiveness rule. And she killed investigations into fraud at for-profit schools.\n\nNow DeVos wants to make this kind of fraud easier by deregulating accreditors, the organizations that approve college and university programs. DeVos thinks that accreditation rules suppress innovation. What they actually suppress, though, is the ability of unscrupulous schools to take advantage of students.\n\nOne proposal from the Department of Education would be to allow accredited schools that receive federal education funds to contract with non-accredited providers for over 50 percent of an educational program. In that instance, students may not even know that they're receiving instruction from a non-accredited provider.\n\nDeVos would also like to redefine how schools calculate credit hours. Under Obama, the Department of Education defined a credit hour as an hour of classroom instruction plus at least two hours of homework each week. The deregulation proposal would get rid of that, which could allow schools to artificially inflate credit hours in order to charge students more.\n\nThere's also a move to deregulate how an \"instructor\" is defined in higher education. Accreditors would get to define that, rather than the Department of Education. A college instructor could potentially be anyone under that standard.\n\nThe deregulation proposals also make it easier for unscrupulous agencies to become an accreditor in the first place, by eliminating the requirement for new accrediting agencies to wait two years before being allowed to help administer federal financial aid.\n\nAll of this adds up to a near-foolproof scheme: DeVos makes it easier for unsavory groups to become accrediting agencies. Those agencies look away when schools outsource their educational duties and inflate their credit hour costs. Those schools get federal funds, which means that people attending them can take out federal loans. Those federal loans are then spent on a subpar education at for-profit giants like Corinthian Colleges \u2014 which gave thousands and thousands of students misleading job placement data and raked in cash before imploding in 2015.\n\nUnder DeVos' scheme, the only people who lose are the students \u2014 students who are disproportionately female, African-American, and older, and who have a greater likelihood of being a single parent. Additionally, tuition is often higher at the for-profit institutions that will benefit from this plan, which leaves the students who attend them in even deeper debt.\n\nThese schools often exist to profit off of the people who can least afford it \u2014 and DeVos is working hard to help those schools scam even more people.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

On the issue of drugs entering the country, the Post notes that most imported heroin comes in through legal ports of entry, not via undocumented immigrants crossing the border.

    "text": "Trump thinks building his racist border wall is more important than federal workers getting their paychecks to support their families.\n\nTrump rambled through a long and disjointed press conference Friday, once again taking ownership of the government shutdown he engineered while insisting that the federal workers he refuses to pay are backing his unpopular obsession.\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal workers are slated to miss their upcoming paychecks thanks to Trump's actions. But instead of doing right by them, Trump insisted that the workers are happy to go without their salaries because erecting the wall serves a \"higher purpose.\"\n\n\"So this really does have a higher purpose than next week's pay,\" Trump told reporters. \"And the people that won't get next week's pay, or the following week's pay \u2014 I think if you ever really looked at those people, I think they'd say, Mr. President, keep going. This is far more important.\"\n\nIn fact, federal workers have been vocal about opposing the shutdown and decrying how it has affected their families. They say Trump \"only cares about himself\" and not about the effects of the shutdown on thousands of federal workers, their families, and the billions in business transactions relying on them.\n\nTrump also confirmed that he told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) he is willing to keep the government closed for \"years\" unless he gets his way.\n\nAnd, as he said in December before shutting down the government, Trump said he is \"proud\" to shut down the federal government and reiterated his demand for taxpayers to put up billions of dollars to finance the construction of a useless border wall.\n\nThe shutdown is an unpopular, Trump-created disaster being felt across America. It is unnecessary, cruel, and dangerous \u2014 and his delusional comments about how it could last for years are divorced from reality.\n\nThousands of federal workers \u2014 taxpaying Americans \u2014 are being hurt by his behavior, and not only does he not care, but he's \"proud\" of it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Visitors are irate.\n\nTourists are angry that Trump's shutdown is preventing them from visiting some of the world\u2019s best museums as well as America's national zoo in Washington, D.C. Local businesses are also experiencing financial troubles as the fallout from Trump's temper tantrum continues.\n\nAll the museums of the Smithsonian are shut down, including the Air & Space Museum, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Natural History Museum, the National Museum of American History, and the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nIn an interview with WJLA-TV, Floridian Barbara Shultz called the shutdown \"stupid,\" adding, \"America is great and we\u2019ve shut down all the museums and a premiere attraction. It\u2019s an abortion.\"\n\nTrump threatened in December to shut down the government unless Congress gave him $5 billion to fund his wall on the southern border. Before the shut down, he boasted that he would be \"proud\" to do it and would take full responsibility for it.\n\nNow that he has the shut down he wanted, he has tried to blame others, even though polling shows that Americans largely blame him and his fellow Republicans for this mess.\n\nAfter the Smithsonian announced on Twitter that it would have to shut down until Trump approves funding for continued operations, questions were raised about the welfare of the animals at the National Zoo.\n\nThe Smithsonian reassured concerned Americans that \"essential personnel are on hand to care for the animals at the National Zoo.\"\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the world has been able to watch the Giant Panda Cam, which broadcasts video of pandas Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and Bei Bei.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s shutdown means, among other things, there is no staff to operate the broadcast. So the Panda Cam is now offline.\n\nThanks to Trump's shutdown, businesses that rely on customers visiting some of the nation's top tourist destinations are hurting as well. Yael Krigman, who owns a bakery in Washington, told the TV station, \"When the zoo is closed, they don't come, it's hard for us but I still honor my commitment to pay my staff \u2014 all of my expenses.\"\n\nTrump and the GOP shut down the government on Dec. 22, and 800,000 federal workers are out of work and not being paid. National park facilities across the country have been closed or are not being maintained, creating a major environmental hazard as waste piles up uncollected.\n\nYosemite National Park announced that several campgrounds are \"closed due to human waste issues and lack of staffing.\"\n\nAmericans and travelers from across the globe cannot see many of the country's national treasures. Children cannot see pandas, elephants, or other animals at the zoo in the nation's capital.\n\nAside from a handful of tourists muttering \u201cthis sucks\u201d and \u201cwhat the hell\u201d at the shuttered National Zoo this morning, there was this boy who came back twice, as if he expected the gates to suddenly open again. @WTOP #GovernmentShutdown pic.twitter.com/KyJYRcndy9 \u2014 Alejandro Alvarez (@aletweetsnews) January 2, 2019\n\nThis is all happening because Trump is having an extended temper tantrum about wanting to waste billions of dollars on wall that will serve no national security purpose, but will appease Trump's racist base \u2014 even though Trump had promised that base during his campaign that Mexico, not American taxpayers, would be paying for it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Some of them have told me that we should have done it.\"\n\nBut they didn't. It was just a story Trump invented to bolster support for his wall, which Trump has shut down the federal government for.\n\nIn a statement, President Carter said, \"I have not discussed the border wall with President Trump, and do not support him on the issue.\"\n\nPresident Clinton's spokesman told Politico that Clinton \"did not\" say what Trump claimed and added, \"they've not talked since the inauguration.\"\n\nA spokesman for President Bush said he hasn't discussed the wall with Trump.\n\nPresident Obama hasn't spoken with Trump since the 2017 inauguration, except for a brief exchange at President George H.W. Bush's funeral.\n\nObama has repeatedly slammed Trump's racist and xenophobic obsession with a border wall. In a 2016 speech, Obama said, \"Suggesting that we can build an endless wall along our borders, and blame our challenges on immigrants \u2014 that doesn't just run counter to our history as the world's melting pot, it contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe.\"\n\nTrump is a liar about issues big and small. His own acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, was forced to tell CNN \"I have no idea\" when Mulvaney was asked to explain which president had said what Trump claimed they had told him.\n\nThe American people don't want Trump's wall, and they would prefer to have the government open than waste money on it.\n\nNone of the former presidents spoke to him about the wall and they didn't support him on it.

It went from a paltry 43 percent approval rating in early December to 39 percent later in the month. His disapproval numbers soared to 56 percent.\n\nTrump petulantly insisted he would shut down the government on Dec. 22, 2018, if he did not receive a $5 billion ransom payment to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"I will be the one to shut it down,\" Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in December, adding, \"I'm not going to blame you for it.\" Since then, Trump has predictably tried to blame Democrats for the shutdown.\n\nEven though Democrats were willing to fund the government with $1.6 billion allocated to border security, a proposal that unanimously passed the Senate, one of Paul Ryan's last acts as speaker of the House was to cower before Trump and help bring about the current shutdown.\n\nIn addition to hundreds of thousands of workers who will not get paychecks around the holiday season, Trump's shutdown stinks on many levels.\n\nCalifornia's Joshua Tree National Park is forced to close campgrounds in part due to \"human waste in public areas, driving off-road and other infractions,\" which are causing health and safety concerns, reports CNN. Similar human waste issues are impacting other national parks as well, including Yosemite National Park, due to the lack of staff available to work because of the shutdown.\n\nFrom Michigan to Arizona, Trump's tantrum is also threatening the health care of Native American communities. In some areas, health clinics won't get federal funding. In other areas, roads covered in snow aren't plowed, meaning \"people are now trapped in their homes, unable to make the 20- or 50-mile journey to buy water, groceries and medicine,\" reports the New York Times.\n\nThe incoming Democratic House majority, led by Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi, has a plan to re-open the government, at least through Feb. 8, as the Senate previously agreed to. As soon as new members are sworn in on Jan. 3, Pelosi plans to bring forth legislation to fund the government, but not Trump's \"stupid wall.\"\n\nThis week, Trump and his fellow Republicans will have yet another opportunity to do the the job the American people expect them to do and re-open the government.\n\nUnfortunately, their track record suggests Trump's shutdown will likely continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Stone Jr., another adviser, according to the New York Times. \"We're going to get him to talk about how he's going to build a wall.\"\n\nAccording to Nunberg, the entire idea of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border was never was only meant as a way to remind Trump, \"who hated reading from a script but loved boasting about himself and his talents as a builder,\" to \"remember to talk about getting tough on immigration,\" reports the Times.\n\nBut the more Trump's crowds lapped up the idea of an actual wall along the border, the more Trump became fixated on actually building it. Now his obsession is causing massive problems for the country, worrying even his anti-immigrant allies.\n\nThe most obvious problem of Trump's unhealthy focus on a border wall is the Trump shutdown. More than 800,000 federal workers are not being paid, the safety of airline travelers is at risk, and national parks are becoming health hazards filled with human waste.\n\nTrump has the ability to end the shutdown, but he's thus far refusing to do so unless Democrats in Congress pay a $5 billion ransom for his border wall. But what Trump may give up to build the wall has some of his allies concerned.\n\n\"I've always thought it created a danger that he would trade almost anything in order to get the wall \u2014 I think that's still a potential danger,\" Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), told the Times. (CIS is an anti-immigrant hate group, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.) CIS and other anti-immigrant hate groups are afraid Trump will work with Democratic lawmakers on other immigration issues, such as Dreamers and DACA, in return for funding for a wall.\n\nIn 2015, then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney \u2014 who now serves as Trump's chief of staff \u2014 ridiculed the idea of a wall as the be-all-end-all solution to any immigration decision. \"Just to say 'build the darn fence' and have that be the end of an immigration discussion is absurd and almost childish,\" Mulvaney said at the time.\n\nMulvaney was right back in 2015 \u2014 an obsession with a wall is childish. Yet here we are, in the midst of a shutdown because an obsessed Trump childishly clings to a metaphor.\n\nUnfortunately, until someone talks Trump down from his childish tantrum, what was once nothing more than a racist mnemonic device will continue to wreak havoc upon this country with a years-long government shutdown.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Two high-profile candidates have snubbed Trump as he struggles to replace former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\n\nFor the second time in only two months, Trump is struggling to find someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 willing to take a high-profile position in his train wreck of an administration. Former Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl is the latest person to publicly reject Trump's overtures to become the next secretary of defense, according to Politico.\n\nKyl's rejection comes only months after Kyl was the administration's point person to guide Brett Kavanaugh, an alleged attempted rapist, through his Supreme Court nomination battle. While Kyl enthusiastically embraced a man accused of drunkenly attacking and groping a young woman when in high school, he nonetheless rejected the idea of working for Trump.\n\nThis rejection comes on the heels of Ret. Gen. Jack Keane refusing the same position.\n\n\"The refusals are particularly striking given that the top Pentagon job is historically among the Cabinet's most prestigious and powerful, and coveted by national security veterans,\" notes Politico.\n\nMattis' resignation letter may play a role in Trump's difficulty finding a replacement. In the letter, Mattis made clear Trump is an incompetent bumbling disaster on the global stage who regularly alienates allies and praises adversaries.\n\nIn the aftermath of the resignation letter, an embarrassed Trump pretended he fired Mattis, a bald-faced lie that only worsened the humiliation.\n\nThe struggle to find a new secretary of defense comes after Trump struggle just last month to find a new chief of staff. In a similar situation, Trump's top picks, like Vice President Pence's chief of staff Nick Ayers, publicly snubbed Trump. In the end, Trump was reduced to begging the media to stop saying no one wanted to work for him.\n\nEventually, Trump selected former South Carolina congressman Mick Mulvaney to be chief of staff. Yet even that pick seems troubled, as Mulvaney is reportedly interested in becoming president of the University of South Carolina.\n\nIt is clear from the caliber of Trump's Cabinet that he is not attracting the best people. His standards are so low that billionaire dilettante Betsy DeVos is secretary of Education. The turnover in his administration is unprecedented in the modern era, and shows no era of slowing down.\n\nThe only difference now is that even people like Kyl \u2014 who stoop low enough to put an alleged sexual predator on the highest court of the land \u2014 find working for Trump unpalatable.\n\nAfter two years of lying and disastrous foreign policy, Trump sullied what was once one of the most respected positions on the planet.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Paul Manafort's attorneys accidentally revealed that their client is accused of sharing polling data from the 2016 election with a Russian operative.\n\nLawyers for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort have accidentally revealed information about their client that could provide the strongest evidence yet of direct coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nDue to an apparent filing error, Manafort's lawyers let slip that special counsel Robert Mueller's team has accused Manafort of sharing polling data from the 2016 presidential election with a Russian operative \u2014 while Manafort was working with the Trump campaign \u2014 and later lying to Mueller about it.\n\nManafort's attorneys submitted a new court filing Monday in response to special counsel Robert Mueller's allegation that Manafort broke his September 2018 plea agreement by lying to federal investigators.\n\nThe filing was made public Tuesday, with large portions of the text redacted. It turned out, however, that the redacted text could be revealed simply by copying and pasting it into a new document.\n\nMost of the redacted information pertains to Manafort's communication with Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime ally and business partner of Manafort who is accused by Mueller of being an operative with active ties \"to a Russian intelligence service.\"\n\nAmong other key details, the poorly redacted filing revealed that Mueller's team has alleged that Manafort \"lied about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\"\n\nIn other redacted sections, Manafort\u2019s attorneys write that he \"conceded\" to prosecutors that he discussed a \"Ukraine peace plan\" with Kilimnik \"on more than one occasion,\" and that he traveled to Madrid to meet with Kilimnik.\n\nWhile the date of the meeting in Madrid is not specified in the filing, an unredacted section states that \"these occurrences happened during a period when Mr. Manafort was managing a U.S. presidential campaign.\"\n\nAll of this looks incredibly damning. One of the key questions investigators have been trying to answer is whether Russian operatives had any help from the Trump campaign when deciding where to target the Facebook ads and other social media operations that made up their 2016 influence operation.\n\nIt has previously been reported that Russian Facebook ads specifically targeted battleground states including Wisconsin and Michigan \u2014 two states that were crucial to Trump\u2019s electoral college victory. Trump won both states by less than a 1 percent margin, and Michigan was the closest race in the country, with Trump edging out Hillary Clinton by less than 11,000 votes out of an estimated 4.8 million total ballots cast.\n\n\u201cSome of the Russian ads appeared highly sophisticated in their targeting of key demographic groups in areas of the states that turned out to be pivotal,\u201d CNN reported in October 2017.\n\n\u201cThe ads employed a series of divisive messages aimed at breaking through the clutter of campaign ads online, including promoting anti-Muslim messages\u201d and \u201csome clearly were geared at swaying public opinion in the most heavily contested battlegrounds.\u201d\n\nAt least 25 percent of the Russian-linked Facebook ads released during the 2016 presidential campaign are believed to have been geographically targeted to focus on states with the closest races.\n\nIn addition to Russian-linked content, there are also questions about whether the Trump campaign may have worked with outside actors to boost its own efforts as Election Day drew near.\n\nThe Trump campaign relied heavily on highly targeted Facebook content to reach its desired audience, and it has been reported that the campaign suddenly shifted resources to Rust Belt states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nAnd Manafort may have had an important role in the Trump campaign's decision to start targeting those states. In November 2016, The New York Times' Maggie Haberman reported that Manafort sent at least one memo to Trump telling him to focus on Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nIf the campaign passed this information along to Russian operatives, it would have been possible for the foreign agents to amplify the effectiveness of the Trump campaign's last-minute shift in voter targeting.\n\nAnd if the information that was accidentally revealed on Tuesday is proven to be true, we may now have an answer as to how Russia knew exactly where and when to target their illegal activities \u2014 and that answer would directly implicate the Trump campaign, providing the clearest evidence yet of collusion.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump has pushed the shutdown to retaliate against Democrats in Congress for refusing to waste billions of tax dollars on his racist border wall idea.\n\nNBC's Hallie Jackson asked Pence to explain Trump's latest whopper about the wall: That former presidents had not only urged Trump to push for the wall in private conversations, but that they regretted not building such a wall themselves. All four living former presidents have denied that anything like this ever happened.\n\nSearching for a way to explain Trump's fabrication, Pence stammered and responded, \"I know the president has said that was his impression from previous administrations.\"\n\nThis, too, was a complete fabrication.\n\nWhat Trump in fact said, during a public appearance in the Rose Garden, was this: \"This [building the wall] should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me and they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it.\"\n\nThis was no \"impression,\" as Pence claimed. Trump said he was personally advised on the issue by former presidents, all of whom say they never did so.\n\nCertainly, previous presidents have spoken about border security \u2014 but that is a far cry from the Trump/Pence claim that they ever endorsed Trump's border wall fantasy.\n\nIn fact, Trump's immediate predecessor, President Barack Obama, said that the border wall idea \"contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe.\"\n\nIn another interview on ABC's Good Morning America, Pence also regurgitated the lie that \"4,000 known or suspected terrorists were apprehended attempting to come into the United States through various means in the last year.\"\n\nThat same lie was too much even for Fox when White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeated it in an interview with Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace, who immediately fact-checked Sanders' false claim on the air.\n\nFor one thing, most of the 4,000 apprehensions Pence is referring to were made at airports \u2014 not the southern border. And many of the people detained at airports aren't suspected terrorists at all, but merely share a name with one.\n\nThere simply aren't 4,000 terrorists coming into the United States every year, and certainly not at the southern border.\n\nIn fact, a senior official familiar with data from the Customs and Border Protection service admitted to CNN that only about 12 people on terrorist watch lists \u2014 not 4,000 \u2014 were stopped at the southern border.\n\nLies like this show that despite his considerable efforts to distance himself from the muck of the Trump administration, Pence is up to his eyeballs in it. He is Trump's foot soldier, willingly going out in public with the imprimatur of the presidency to lie to millions of Americans.\n\nTrump is a liar, and so is Mike Pence. They work as a team to mislead and defraud the American people.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Millions of tenants would be at risk of getting kicked out of their homes if the shutdown drags on into February.\n\nAnd that's not the only problem facing vulnerable Americans who rely on HUD for housing assistance.\n\nAccording to NBC News, about 95 percent of HUD employees have been furloughed due to the shutdown. The only employees allowed to work are those needed for emergency situations that pose \"an imminent threat to the safety of human life or the protection of property.\"\n\nAs a result, many routine HUD activities have been put on hold, including mandatory health and safety inspections of HUD-funded properties for low-income Americans, as well as elderly persons and people with disabilities.\n\n\"It\u2019s been devastating \u2014 we have families and kids with asthma living where the mold situation is out of control,\" said Cori Mackey, the executive director of Christian Activities Council, a Connecticut-based social justice group.\n\nJust last week, the floor collapsed at a HUD-funded property in Connecticut that had been waiting for months for an inspection. When the floorboards were lifted for repair, the area underneath was \"covered in black mold,\" Mackey told NBC News.\n\nBut Trump and his administration didn't consider any of these potential consequences when they dove headfirst into a government shutdown. In fact, they didn't even know what consequences they should be considering \u2014 because no one in the administration understood what would actually happen during a shutdown.\n\nAs The Washington Post reported on Friday, White House officials only started to understand \"the breadth of the potential impact\" late last week \u2014 two weeks after the shutdown began.\n\nIt's hard to know which is worse: The Trump administration's cruelty, or its incompetence.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But in servile acquiescence to Trump, McConnell has thus far refused to allow the Senate to vote on those bills.\n\nSince then, seven additional Democrats have expressed their support for the idea, including Sens.

On a normal day, 3.5 percent of workers call out. That has recently risen to 5.5 percent.\n\nOne frequent business traveler told ABC News he's \"never seen the line in LaGuardia that bad and I probably take the shuttle 40 to 50 times each year, 25 round trips.\"\n\nTrump's obsession with his wall isn't just creating havoc across America; airline pilots also say it is making travel unsafe across the world.

This year, however, Trump is holding those refunds hostage unless he gets $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is refusing to let the Senate vote on any bill to reopen the government unless Trump agrees to sign it first. By doing this, McConnell is keeping millions of Americans from getting their hard-earned refunds in a timely manner.\n\nBut now Pelosi and House Democrats have a plan to call McConnell's bluff.\n\nWhen the House reconvenes this week, Democrats will pass individual bills in the House to reopen parts of the government \u2014 starting with the Treasury Department, which houses the IRS \u2014 that have nothing to do with immigration or Trump's border wall, but that are crucial to support working families.\n\nWhat's more, the Senate passed these same bills almost unanimously in August. If McConnell refuses to vote on them again now, he'll have a hard time explaining why.\n\n\"Unless Congress acts, the American people will not receive their tax refunds, families will lose food stamps, homebuyers seeking mortgages will remain in limbo, and our National Parks will continue to accumulate garbage and waste,\" the new chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Nita Lowey (D-NY), said in a statement. \"These bills will stop this chaos, get many federal employees back on the job, and ensure that key parts of the government are working for the American people.\"\n\nBy passing individual funding bills, Democrats are proving that their party is committed to a functioning federal government. They're also forcing Republicans to make a choice: Kowtow to Trump, or give American families the tax refunds they deserve.\n\nThe Trump shutdown is already disastrous for the country.\n\nAn estimated 800,000 federal workers are not receiving their first paycheck following the holiday season. Business and tourists are furious that some of the world's premiere tourist attractions are being forced to shut their doors. And several national parks are becoming health hazards as human waste and garbage litter formerly pristine landscapes.\n\nThe new Democratic majority in the House is trying to reopen the government, but an obstructionist Trump and complicit McConnell refuse to put the interests of the country ahead of their own short-sighted political aims.\n\nAmericans don't even want Trump's wall in the first place, but Trump is so obsessed with it that he insists on hurting American workers in order to get what he wants.\n\nNow that his lackey Paul Ryan is no longer in control of the House, however, Trump has to face at least one branch of Congress that will put the well-being of families and workers above his own petulant whims.\n\nUPDATE: A Trump administration official claimed Monday afternoon that tax refunds will still go out. However, lawyers for the House Ways and Means committee say that might not be legal. To date, the Treasury Department has not commented.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A historic site at the Trump hotel mysteriously stays open while parks and national monuments elsewhere are shut down and federal workers go without pay.\n\nAs the shutdown drags into its 17th day, with no end in sight, many Washington D.C. museums and monuments are closed, and federal workers are cutting back because they don't know when they'll get paid next. But the clock tower at the Trump International Hotel D.C. remains fully staffed and open.\n\nNational Park Service rangers are there to greet people, declaring \"We're open!\" to the rare tourist that wants to see the clock tower instead of all the other things in D.C. that are currently closed, like the Smithsonian.\n\nThe Trump International Hotel D.C. is on the site of the Old Post Office and Clock Tower, which was already on the National Registry of Historic Places. The General Services Administration (GSA), which is of course part of the government, leases the property to a holding company owned by Trump, who is of course part of the government.\n\nThe GSA says this isn't because the clock tower is housed in Trump's hotel, but because there is some law \u2014 which the GSA won't specify \u2014 that requires the site to be kept open, even in a shutdown. Of course, this is the same GSA that said it is just fine that Trump profit from the hotel as long as he does so through an affiliated company rather than directly. It's also the same GSA that, just a few months ago, gave the Trump Organization a $534,000 break on the hotel's yearly rent because the hotel is providing security and janitorial services for the clock tower.\n\nSince its opening in 2016, the hotel has always been a corruption magnet. Although in 2017 its occupancy rate was lower than that of the surrounding area, Trump somehow earned $40 million from it that year. And that isn't honest profit. It's all thanks to things like corrupt premium charges and taxpayer money being spent there.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of tenants covered by a Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program could be evicted soon because the program was allowed to expire on January 1. And Airline pilots are terrified because there are now too few safety inspectors and aircraft manufacture oversight is now reduced.\n\nTrump alternately says he doesn't care about government workers going without pay because they are Democrats, or that furloughed workers want the wall and support his shutdown. He has also said that his shutdown serves a \"higher purpose\" then federal workers getting paid.\n\nNo matter the mechanism by which the clock tower is remaining open, federal employees are working without pay, and other D.C. businesses are suffering, but Trump is continuing to make money in a less-than-savory way.\n\nJust like he always does.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Several departments in Trump's administration want to get rid of policies that require the government to assess the prejudicial effects of regulations.\n\nDonald Trump began his career as a racist landlord who refused to rent to black people. He kicked off his presidential campaign by calling Mexicans rapists. And he called African nations \"shithole countries.\" So, it's no real surprise that he and his administration are interested in making it easier for people to discriminate.\n\nThe Justice Department is now asking its officials to consider how to get rid of what are called \"disparate impact\" regulations, according to the Washington Post. A disparate impact occurs when a regulation is written in a way that's theoretically neutral, but actually discriminatory in application.\n\nOne example of this is Trump's \"travel ban.\" It doesn't, in its text, prohibit Muslims from traveling to the United States. Instead, it named several countries, most of which are majority-Muslim countries. That results in Muslims being barred from the U.S. far more than non-Muslims.\n\nThe Trump administration wants to make it far easier for certain departments \u2014 the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) among them \u2014 to ignore when their regulations disproportionately affect people of color, LGBTQ people, non-Christians, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups.\n\nThe Department of Education has already recommended one course of action in this vein when the Federal Commission on School Safety, convened to look into school shootings after Parkland, issued a recommendation that Obama-era protections against over-disciplining students of color needed to be rolled back.\n\nThe Department of Education officially rolled those protections back a few days later, and in doing so it specifically attacked the concept of disparate impact, saying that the guidance issued by Obama's administration incorrectly relied upon the idea that you can prove discrimination by examining the actual effect of a policy rather than the intent of a policy.\n\nThis sort of thing is already moving forward at HUD as well, where they are explicitly reconsidering the Fair Housing Act's disparate impact standard.\n\nWhich brings us back to Donald Trump \u2014 the man that began his career engaging in a housing practice that explicitly discriminated against minorities. Perhaps it is tougher now to get away with something quite so blatant, but his administration is working to remove the roadblocks to the same sort of discrimination.\n\nAt root, Trump and his cronies want to make it easier for people to discriminate because Trump's a racist and a bully. His administration has already shown a remarkable commitment to letting those in power hurt those who are not, and this is just another way to achieve that goal.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He even kept them there for Thanksgiving, away from their families for no good reason. Now, the administration is at it again. The Department of Homeland Security has just made a request to deploy additional troops to the border to string a bunch of fencing wire.\n\nThe troops aren't even being deployed to build new fences. They're just going to string the wire along 160 miles of existing fencing. But the fact that they're working on existing fencing doesn't mean it's a short-term deployment; it could extend the military's current presence at the border to September, rather than the original end date of January 31.\n\nWorking on existing swaths of fencing doesn't necessarily mean that it is a small deployment either. A senior military official told NPR that it could involve thousands of additional troops besides the 5000 already stationed at the border.\n\nThe troop deployment has to be approved by the acting secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan, who just replaced recently departed General James Mattis. Shanahan, however, isn't likely to put up much resistance. As deputy secretary of defense under Mattis, Shanahan spent a lot of time engaging in questionable behavior, like steering lucrative contracts to Boeing, the company he used to run. There's no real reason to think Shanahan has any interest in standing up to Trump in this instance.\n\nWill Fischer, an Iraq War veteran and the director of government relations for VoteVets, lambasted the demand for additional troops: \"The military isn't Donald Trump's construction crew, and it is unjustifiable and offensive that he's using them to mend fencing. There has already been plenty of money appropriated to fix up border fencing.\"\n\n\"Here's an idea, Mr. President: Rather than trying to organize military working parties, how about you stop holding government workers hostage over your stupid, racist wall and get the government reopened,\" Fischer said.\n\nShutdown or no, troops shouldn't be deployed to the border for yet another performance designed only to appeal to Trump's base.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Lamar Alexander (R-TN) is insisting that Democrats \"bend over backwards\" to fund Trump's racist border wall to end the government shutdown he engineered.\n\nAlexander made the comments Thursday, from the Senate floor, disingenuously suggesting that giving in to Trump's extreme and unpopular demands somehow honors the tradition of bipartisan compromise \u2014 a tradition Alexander's party pointedly did away with under President Obama.\n\n\"Democrats should recognize now as I did that when an elected president, one elected by the people of the United States, whatever you may think of him, has a legitimate objective, you should bend over backwards to try to meet that objective if you want a result,\" the Republican senator said.\n\nAlexander's characterization of Trump's election as some sort of mandate for his agenda doesn't align with the facts. For one, Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, with nearly 3 million more Americans supporting her and her agenda.\n\nSince Trump has occupied the presidency, his wall agenda has continued to lose out. Millions of voters backed Democratic candidates in 2018, supporting a House majority that flatly opposes spending billions of dollars on Trump's vanity wall project.\n\nThe shutdown Trump engineered to extort money for his wall \u2014 money he repeatedly insisted during his campaign would come from Mexico \u2014 certainly does not have the support of the American people.\n\nAlexander stands on even weaker ground when his own record is compared to his rhetoric. While he's now saying, under a Republican president, that Congress should \"bend over backwards\" to accommodate the president's agenda, he sang a different tune when President Obama was in office.\n\nWhen President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, Alexander was part of the block of Republicans who refused to do their constitutional duty and even hold hearings, much less a vote, on Garland's nomination.\n\nAlexander argued in March of 2016 \u2014 eight months before the election \u2014 that the president's nomination should be ignored, and the seat kept empty, until the next president was in office.\n\n\"It's about whether to give the American people a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court justice,\" Alexander said at the time.\n\nNow Alexander claims winning an election, while losing the popular vote, means Congress should do the unpopular thing that Trump demands.\n\nAlexander is in the final phase of his time in the Senate and will not run for re-election. His statement, jam-packed with hypocrisy, marks his legacy in the legislative body, showing ultimate subservience to Trump.\n\nHe has worked as one of Trump's key henchmen in the Senate, trying to dismantle Obamacare and voting for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of attempted rape and other sexual assaults.\n\nNow he is trying to argue that Trump should get his way, even if it's not what the voters want, in the name of deference to the office of the presidency that Alexander himself doesn't believe in and helped destroy.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Roberts is the second Republican senator to announce his retirement in the past month, following Tennessee's Lamar Alexander.\n\nAt this time, no Democratic senators have announced retirement plans.\n\nAs chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Roberts recently shepherded through a massive farm bill, which, despite Republican efforts, did not impose stricter work requirements on people who receive food stamps.\n\nRoberts, 82, will retire after four terms in the Senate. In his 2014 race, Roberts faced a tough primary challenge, and then went on to win his final term by a mere 10 points, the lowest margin of any Kansas senator in 40 years.\n\nWhile Kansas has been a reliably red state \u2014 Democrats haven't won a Senate seat there since 1932 \u2014 the Washington Post notes it \"has undergone a political change in recent months.\"\n\nIn the 2018 election, Democrat Laura Kelly defeated Trump lackey and anti-immigration zealot Kris Kobach in a close contest for governor of the state. Additionally, Democrats picked up a House seat in the Kansas City area.\n\nBut the bad news for Republicans on election night was only the beginning. In the weeks after the election, several Republican state lawmakers switched parties, joining the Democrats.\n\nState Sen. Barbara Bollier left the GOP after four decades, in part because of Trump's rampant vulgarity toward women. She is not alone in seeing the Republican party accelerate its move to the far fringe of the political spectrum.\n\n\"Increasingly, I see the Republican party focusing on issues and approaches that divide our country,\" state Sen. Dinah Sykes said. \"I do not agree with that approach.\"\n\nIn this environment, Roberts \u2014 who voted for the Trump agenda more than 96 percent of the time \u2014 announced his decision to abandon any attempts to run for re-election.\n\nAt the moment, most political handicappers anticipate Republicans will maintain control of the seat. But as 2018 showed, progressive enthusiasm and a powerful rejection of the Trump agenda can prove pundits wrong.\n\nAnd 2020 is a long way away.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Unfortunately, Trump is running the government like one of his many failed businesses.\n\nWhen he was running for office, Trump promised he could \"get rid of\" America's $19 trillion national debt \"fairly quickly.\" In fact, he boasted he could wipe it all out \"over a period of eight years.\"\n\nIn yet another failure, Trump has added $2 trillion to the debt during his first two years, according to new figures released by the Treasury Department. CNN reports that the recent spike in the national deficit is \"particularly unusual in such a strong economy without major new expenditures.\"\n\nPresident Obama left a recovering economy in the hands of Trump and deficit enthusiast Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI). As CNN notes, the first year of Trump's term \"debt began to level off.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Republicans were incapable of a minimal level of fiscal competence. The successes of Obama's presidency were undermined by GOP corporate greed. The main catalyst for the increase in the national debt is the failing and unpopular 2017 GOP tax scam, Trump's lone legislative achievement.\n\nAs soon as Trump and Ryan rammed through the tax scam, the lower tax rates for millionaires and corporations meant lower revenue for the Treasury. The massive deficits incurred mainly benefitted Wall Street banks and billionaires while middle-class families were mainly left out in the cold. The law was so skewed toward the rich that Ryan was reduced to bragging about a secretary who would gain a paltry $1.50 per week.\n\nRepublicans had believed their tax scam would sweep them to electoral victory in 2018. But it was such a failure that Republicans essentially abandoned talking about it at all, instead hoping ugly anti-immigrant policies and blatant racism would save them. That didn't happen, and Democrats picked up 40 House seats.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump couldn't care less about the effect of his economic policies. He has reportedly \"shrugged off\" warnings from his advisers about the growing debt and the future consequences of his policies, saying, \"Yeah, but I won\u2019t be here.\" He is apparently fine letting some future president clean up his mess.\n\nTrump has a long history of failing at business ventures. In the past, his father would bail him out through various legal and ethically dubious means.\n\nBut this time, Trump is on his own. There's no one to bail him out, and he can't hide behind his daddy's money. Trump's failures are burdening generations to come, and he alone owns them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "According to Rudy Giuliani, the years just 'merged together' for Trump.\n\nRudy Giuliani went on Fox News Radio yesterday to say Trump has no idea when his corporation stopped negotiating with Russia over the Trump Tower in Moscow, continuing his tradition of confusing the narrative about Trump's business dealings.\n\nAccording to Giuliani, the talks could have lasted all the way up until November 2016, which flies in the face of Trump's own July 2016 assertion that he had no dealings at all in Russia. Giuliani claims that Trump just doesn't remember how long the Trump corporation was in talks with the Russians about a major Moscow real estate deal that Trump had been eager to build for literally decades.\n\nGiuliani's explanation is confusing at best: \"And he says as far as he's concerned, it could be anywhere up to November of 2016. But if you ask him to pinpoint the dates, he'd say to me 2015 and 2016 merged together.\" It's hardly reassuring to think that neither the president nor his attorney can separate one year from another.\n\nGiuliani also apparently isn't clear on the concept of what it means to do business with someone. He said, for example, that Trump wasn't doing business in Moscow by signing a letter of intent about a Trump Tower Moscow because it was an early step in the project.\n\nThe Trump Corporation's ill-fated exploration into Russian real estate came to the fore last November, when former Trump fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's real estate dealings with Russia. Cohen initially told Congress the conversations about the tower stopped in January 2016, but information from Cohen's plea made it clear they lasted until at least June 2016.\n\nOf course, Trump lawyers, including Giuliani, have a long history of being wildly uncertain as to what his client knows, while being completely unafraid to speculate about it to the press.\n\nWhen the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting \u2014 where various Trump associates met with Russians to get dirt about Hillary Clinton \u2014 first came to light, Trump repeatedly declared he didn't know a thing about it. Then Giuliani went on television and said that maybe he and Trump both knew about the meeting in advance, but he couldn't say for sure because \"you could have very, very differing recollections on that because it was right in the heat of the campaign.\"\n\nWhether it is deliberate deception or deep confusion, both Giuliani and Trump are experts at muddying the waters over Trump's connections with Russia, and this is a perfect example.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Visitors are irate.\n\nTourists are angry that Trump's shutdown is preventing them from visiting some of the world\u2019s best museums as well as America's national zoo in Washington, D.C. Local businesses are also experiencing financial troubles as the fallout from Trump's temper tantrum continues.\n\nAll the museums of the Smithsonian are shut down, including the Air & Space Museum, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Natural History Museum, the National Museum of American History, and the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nIn an interview with WJLA-TV, Floridian Barbara Shultz called the shutdown \"stupid,\" adding, \"America is great and we\u2019ve shut down all the museums and a premiere attraction. It\u2019s an abortion.\"\n\nTrump threatened in December to shut down the government unless Congress gave him $5 billion to fund his wall on the southern border. Before the shut down, he boasted that he would be \"proud\" to do it and would take full responsibility for it.\n\nNow that he has the shut down he wanted, he has tried to blame others, even though polling shows that Americans largely blame him and his fellow Republicans for this mess.\n\nAfter the Smithsonian announced on Twitter that it would have to shut down until Trump approves funding for continued operations, questions were raised about the welfare of the animals at the National Zoo.\n\nThe Smithsonian reassured concerned Americans that \"essential personnel are on hand to care for the animals at the National Zoo.\"\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the world has been able to watch the Giant Panda Cam, which broadcasts video of pandas Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and Bei Bei.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s shutdown means, among other things, there is no staff to operate the broadcast. So the Panda Cam is now offline.\n\nThanks to Trump's shutdown, businesses that rely on customers visiting some of the nation's top tourist destinations are hurting as well. Yael Krigman, who owns a bakery in Washington, told the TV station, \"When the zoo is closed, they don't come, it's hard for us but I still honor my commitment to pay my staff \u2014 all of my expenses.\"\n\nTrump and the GOP shut down the government on Dec. 22, and 800,000 federal workers are out of work and not being paid. National park facilities across the country have been closed or are not being maintained, creating a major environmental hazard as waste piles up uncollected.\n\nYosemite National Park announced that several campgrounds are \"closed due to human waste issues and lack of staffing.\"\n\nAmericans and travelers from across the globe cannot see many of the country's national treasures. Children cannot see pandas, elephants, or other animals at the zoo in the nation's capital.\n\nAside from a handful of tourists muttering \u201cthis sucks\u201d and \u201cwhat the hell\u201d at the shuttered National Zoo this morning, there was this boy who came back twice, as if he expected the gates to suddenly open again. @WTOP #GovernmentShutdown pic.twitter.com/KyJYRcndy9 \u2014 Alejandro Alvarez (@aletweetsnews) January 2, 2019\n\nThis is all happening because Trump is having an extended temper tantrum about wanting to waste billions of dollars on wall that will serve no national security purpose, but will appease Trump's racist base \u2014 even though Trump had promised that base during his campaign that Mexico, not American taxpayers, would be paying for it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Native American tribes are reeling from the shutdown, but Trump's allies are encouraging him to keep the government closed, all for political gain.\n\nThe effects of the shutdown are beginning to be felt in many quarters, but for Native American tribes that receive a substantial portion of operating funds from the federal government, the shutdown is already devastating. Trump and his supporters, however, just don't care.\n\nTribes are facing heightened threats because many essential services are provided via the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The BIA furloughs over 50% of its employees during a shutdown, which all but guarantees that services to reservations and salaries to tribal and federal workers will be affected.\n\nOf course, the Interior Department itself is in disarray, with embattled and scandal-ridden department secretary Ryan Zinke stepping down yesterday. Zinke had set a blatantly anti-Native tone in his tenure at Interior, reassigning over 30% of senior officials with tribal affiliations.\n\nAn excellent example of the staggering effect of the shutdown is the Sault Ste. Marie Chippewa tribe, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. For every day the shutdown lasts, the tribe loses $100,000 \u2014 money intended for food shelves, health clinics, and paychecks for employees. That tribe isn't the only tribe facing severe problems. The Navajo Nation, in rural New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, is covered in snow, but the shutdown means no plowing or road maintenance. In a rural area, that means people are now trapped in their homes and unable to travel to places like grocery stores.\n\nIt is likely that conservatives will dismiss native reliance on federal funds as some sort of welfare. That's not the case, of course, as those federal funds are were negotiated for, and guaranteed in, the treaties between tribes and the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, rather than fretting about how the shutdown is affecting people all across the country, Trump's cronies are encouraging him to keep the government closed because any political hit he suffers will be minimal. It's highly likely Trump is listening to people like Florida Republican Matt Gaetz, who says a lengthier shutdown is just fine because the Democrats will experience \"more pain\" than Republicans. Perhaps the pithiest defense of Trump came from Rick Santorum, who went on CNN to say that Trump is \"not long on empathy.\" That comes as no surprise.\n\nAs the shutdown continues, more people will be hurt. Native Americans, who have been on the leading edge of the losses, will continue to suffer. But, sadly, none of that seems to move Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans might change their nominating rules just to protect an unpopular Trump.\n\nTrump is so universally loathed that one prominent Republican wants to protect Trump from 2020 challenges from within his own party. And to do it, he wants to rig the Republican primary.\n\nOne Republican National Committee (RNC) delegate sent a panicked email to 167 other delegates expressing concern over \"calculated political treachery\" on behalf of some Republicans who are intent on \"destroying our party and denying President Trump re-election.\"\n\nThe delegate, Jevon O.A. Williams from the U.S. Virgin Islands, desperately wants to change the rules Republicans use to nominate their 2020 candidate in order to protect an obviously damaged Trump from other Republicans.\n\nWilliams worries that loopholes in the RNC's rules \"are enabling these so-called Republicans to flirt with the possibility of contested primaries and caucuses,\" according to a copy of his email published by the Daily Mail. What Williams calls \"loopholes\" others may call \"democracy in action.\"\n\nWilliams' panic was ignited by Sen.-elect Mitt Romney's op-ed in the Washington Post. Romney \u2014 who lost the 2012 election to President Barack Obama after gleefully accepting Trump's endorsement \u2014 criticized Trump for failing to unite the country.\n\nWilliams worries that Romney and other so-called critics of Trump, such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), could mount a challenge to Trump in a contested 2020 primary. Such a challenge would be expensive and \"would only help Democrats,\" according to Williams.\n\nSo rather than embrace a fully transparent and democratic nominating process, Williams wants to change the rules to rig the primary for Trump. He wants the RNC to immediately endorse Trump for 2020, before any states have even held primaries where voters' voices can be heard. Williams also wants the RNC to declare Trump the \"presumptive nominee.\"\n\nHe's not the only Republican who fears Trump's weakness in 2020. South Carolina Republicans are thinking about canceling their 2020 primary out of fears the results could embarrass Trump.\n\nRepublicans have a long, sordid history of voter suppression efforts, which are usually aimed at Democratic voters. But now, Republican animosity toward democratic norms is so full-blown that the RNC is considering suppressing their own voters.\n\nThat's not how democracy is supposed to work. Maybe instead of changing the rules, Republicans should stop supporting lying, narcissistic, racist sexual predators for elected office. Seems like a much easier solution than rigging elections.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The tax returns would be posted for public viewing on the website of the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe move is part of \"an effort to build the case to the American people that time is up on President Donald Trump keeping his own tax returns from the public, shutting what could be a window into his personal wealth,\" CNN reports.\n\nPreviously, Democrats had planned to draft a bill that would require presidential nominees to turn over three years of tax returns, but after reviewing precedent, they moved the marker to 10 years.\n\nAs the presumptive GOP nominee for 2020, the new legislation would mandate that Trump release his returns during the presidential campaign.\n\nIn addition to the legislative approach, Democrats are also pursuing other avenues to get Trump to hand over his tax returns.\n\nDemocrats on the House Ways and Means Committee believe they have the power to get Trump's tax returns from the Treasury Department using the IRS code. The incoming chairman of the committee, Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, plans to use that approach to try to obtain the returns when he takes charge of the committee.\n\nTrump has repeatedly refused to hand over the records since he became president despite promising to release his tax returns when he was a candidate. He has justified his refusal by claiming that he is under audit by the IRS, but being under audit doesn't mean he can't release his tax returns.\n\nIn the past, Republicans have shut down efforts to get Trump's tax records, but their ability to do so is limited now that the balance of power has shifted.\n\nWhile obtaining Trump's tax returns is a priority for the new Congress, it's far from the only way they're planning to use their new oversight duty to hold Trump accountable.\n\nJust before the holidays, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the incoming chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent 51 letters to the Trump administration and other entities demanding \"full compliance\" with pre-existing requests for information and documents pertaining to a slew of issues and unanswered questions.\n\nMany of the requests for information stem from previous inquiries from Republicans which the White House ignored, and which the GOP failed to pursue.\n\nNow, as Democrats prepare to take control of the House of the Representatives in just one day, they're already letting Trump know that the jig is up \u2014 and sending a clear message that he should be prepared for what's about to come.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Warren Davidson has proposed a bill that would let Americans 'buy a brick' to help fund Trump's border wall.\n\nGOP Congressman Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) has introduced a bill that would give ordinary Americans the privilege of sending money to the U.S. Treasury to build the wall.\n\nDavidson's bill, called the \"Buy a Brick, Build a Wall Act\" is the latest absurd proposed solution to the wall funding problem. The bill directs the Treasury Department to set up a fund that would allow Trump's most passionate and racist supporters to pay for the wall directly.\n\nDavidson initially introduced his bill back in November. Presuming that the reintroduction is the same as last year's bill, it's a remarkably Spartan affair. It directs Treasury to set up a fund, and says there needs to be a website where people can donate. That's about it. There's no information about how the money would be spent, and no information about what happens to the money if the wall doesn't get build.\n\nTrump made it a signature refrain of his campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall, but it was immediately clear that Trump had no plan to make that happen. Indeed, only a few days after taking office, the administration explained that it would pay for the wall by taxing imports.\n\nTaxing imports, of course, would have meant that Americans paid for the wall, thanks to increased prices on foreign goods. Then there was a plan to have the military build the wall, which still would have involved Americans paying for it. Then the White House just started insisting the wall was funded, even as Trump said it wasn't.\n\nJust before the shutdown, an enterprising conservative fake news creator started a GoFundMe campaign to let private citizens pay to build Trump's border wall. Regardless of how shady it looked, Marco Rubio endorsed it, and the gullible have donated $18 million.\n\nSo far, Davidson's bill didn't go anywhere in a GOP House, and it certainly won't go anywhere now that Nancy Pelosi has the gavel again.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The since-deleted Twitter account AnonymousQ1776 fumed, \"Here is America's favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is.\"\n\nAsked about the video by a reporter from The Hill, the congresswoman explained, \"It is unsurprising to me that Republicans would think having fun should be disqualifying or illegal.\"\n\nThe attempted attack was widely ridiculed, provoked many parody videos, and elicited praise for Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 including from \"Breakfast Club\" star Molly Ringwald.\n\n\"That's it, Alexandria you're in the club! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f,\" the actress wrote. Ally Sheedy, who also starred in the film, hailed the video as well.\n\nOcasio-Cortez responded to the ridiculous right-wing temper tantrum with a video showing her dancing outside of her congressional office.\n\n\"I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous.

But instead of cowering in the face of their rage, she responds with humor \u2014 and the internet loves her for it.\n\nRepublican members of Congress even booed Ocasio-Cortez when she cast her vote Thursday for Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to be speaker of the House. She responded on Twitter by saying, \"Don\u2019t hate me cause you ain\u2019t me, fellas.\"\n\nThe right will undoubtedly continue trying to attack Ocasio-Cortez.

    "text": "Mitch McConnell is enabling Trump's government shutdown \u2014 and is being called out by his fellow senators for doing so.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) recently announced that even if the new incoming Democratic majority in the House passes legislation to reopen the government, he will refuse to bring it up for a vote in the Senate. And now he's getting mocked for being a reliable Trump henchman, enabling the ongoing Trump shutdown of the federal government.\n\nIn a statement on the Senate floor, McConnell said, \"The Senate will not waste its time considering a Democratic bill which cannot pass this chamber and which the president will not sign.\" But just two weeks ago, the Senate passed that same legislation via a voice vote.\n\nMcConnell's change of heart is clearly a ploy to bolster Trump, who is in the middle of a multi-week tantrum over funds for his useless and racist border wall.\n\nDemocratic Senators took to Twitter to ridicule McConnell's pathetic flip-flop.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), wrote, \"Triple checking the CR vote was unanimous in the Senate right?\"\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), replied, \"Yes, Brian, it was.\" He added, \"Further query: does the Constitution still allow the Senate to vote to override a veto (on, for instance, a bill that passed the Senate 100-0) or did that part get edited out when I wasn't looking?\"\n\nSchatz responded to the question: \"One moment please. Ok, yup, constitution still allows for overrides.\"\n\nNew York Times reporter Julie Davis noted McConnell's hypocrisy. \"One of the bills the House will consider tomorrow does exactly what legislation McConnell himself brought up last month (and which passed the Senate *unanimously*) did: devote $1.3B to border security and fund DHS thru Feb. 8,\" she wrote.\n\nPundit Symone Sanders also took notice of McConnell's previous support for legislation he now opposes and wrote, \"Sounds like Senator McConnell is all too willing to aid President Trump in playing games with hardworking American\u2019s paychecks.\"\n\nThe shutdown is unpopular.\n\nThe public clearly blames Trump \u2014 who caused it \u2014 and ordinary Americans have described it as \"stupid.\" Businesses that rely on tourism to government-funded sites that have been shut down are hurting, while national parks and the environment are forced to deal with overflowing garbage and human waste.\n\nDespite all this, McConnell is sticking by Trump by misusing his own power to dictate the Senate agenda.\n\nThe Democratic proposal to reopen the government has enough support in the House and Senate to pass, and had enough support before to even override a possible Trump veto.\n\nBut Mitch McConnell has sided with Trump instead of America and is working to aid his political ally instead of the country. That's why he has become the butt of the joke, just like Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

A statement from the White House says Trump would veto any bills Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to pass in order to fund the government and end the Trump shutdown.\n\nIn the statement, the White House says Trump cannot support bills with \"unnecessary funding for wasteful programs\" unless he gets $5 billion for his pointless border wall. That supposed \"unnecessary funding\" Trump objects to includes support for the United Nations Population Fund, an international program that seeks to prevent violence against women, stop child marriage, and train health workers to \"ensure at least 90 per cent of all childbirths are supervised by skilled attendants.\"\n\nBut according to the Trump administration, that's \"unnecessary\" and \"wasteful.\"\n\nIn addition, the Trump shutdown means the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) has expired. \"VAWA funds and administers numerous programs assisting survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault,\" reports NPR, and payments for those programs cannot be made until Republicans decide to end the shutdown.\n\nOther \"wasteful\" programs called out by the White House include funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and rental assistance programs within the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nIn a heartless gesture, the veto threat does not even acknowledge the estimated 800,000 federal workers who are not receiving a paycheck so soon after the holiday season.\n\nIn December, the Senate unanimously passed a bill to fund the government through early February. But in a servile kowtowing to Trump, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is refusing to even vote on the House bills to re-open the government.\n\nIn her first speech of the new Congress, Pelosi set the tone for the new Democratic House majority, speaking about the need to work together for the good of the American people.\n\nMere hours later, Trump set the tone from his White House, issuing a tantrum-driven veto threat and refusing to work with Democrats. Trump took the mantle of the current government shutdown, and now he is obstructing good-faith efforts by Democrats to reopen the government.\n\nWithin hours of efforts from Democrats to set a more cooperative tone in Washington, Trump once again showed his true colors.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Voters know Trump and Republicans are responsible for the shutdown \u2014 and that's a problem for Republicans facing re-election.\n\nRepublicans gave Trump the government shutdown he demanded in December, but now some senators facing re-election in 2020 are worrying that keeping the government closed indefinitely is a bad look for them.\n\nIn 2018, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) was the GOP's chief point person charged with maintaining a Republican majority in the Senate. More than perhaps any other senator, he is responsible for Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) returning as majority leader.\n\nBut with a tough 2020 re-election race looming, Gardner is suddenly worried about supporting his party's unpopular government shutdown.\n\n\"I think we should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open,\" Gardner told the Hill, even if it means denying Trump his $5 billion ransom for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The House of Representatives, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, passed just such a measure on Thursday, when Democrats resumed control of the House.\n\nGardner's pleas have yet to make any difference to McConnell, who steadfastly refuses to even allow the Senate to vote on such a measure.\n\nGardner's postering is not fooling folks in his home state.\n\n\"It's nice to see how weakened Cory Gardner is after his party took a complete shellacking in Colorado in the 2018 election,\" Ian Silverii, executive director of ProgressNow Colorado, said in a statement to Shareblue Media. \"Gardner caved into to Speaker Pelosi on her very first day in office, but Colorado voters are not stupid, and they will see right through this ploy to pivot for his 2020 re-election.\"\n\nMaine's Sen. Susan Collins, who gleefully backed alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court, is also worried her party's desire to keep pay from 800,000 federal workers could be a mistake.\n\n\"It would be great to have them signed into law because there is not great controversy over them, and at least we'd be getting those workers back to work,\" Collins told the New York Times, referencing the bills the new House Democratic majority passed to reopen the government.\n\nCollins, a faux-moderate who supported Trump's extreme and unqualified nominees like Kavanaugh and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, is one of the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents in 2020. Even though she regularly stands with Trump and McConnell, Collins seems to understand that the Trump shutdown is wildly unpopular with voters. In fact, only 1 in 4 Americans support the idea of shutting the government down over Trump's $5 billion ransom demand for the wall.\n\nIn perhaps the most halfhearted attempt to stand up to Trump and McConnell, Iowa's Sen. Joni Ernst told the Times, \"I would like to see it resolved soon.\" Ernst has been one of Trump's most loyal lackeys, going so far as to defend Trump's decision to make troops spend the holidays shoveling horse manure at the U.S.-Mexico border for a political stunt instead of being their families.\n\nIn the 2018 midterm elections, Iowans ousted two of the state's three Republican congressmen as part of the nationwide rebuke of Trump's policies. Ernst, the first-term senator who is also up in 2020, might be considering her own vulnerability.\n\nEven one Republican in a deep-red state, West Virginia's Sen. Shelly Moore Capito, is expressing concern. \"A shutdown, in my view, is a no-win proposition,\" Capito told the Times. Capito also faces re-election in 2020, joining the growing ranks of Republican senators urging McConnell to end the shutdown.\n\nBut McConnell seems more concerned about politics than doing what is right for the country.\n\n\"After two years of trying to advance Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, Mr. McConnell now sees his primary job as standing in the way of Speaker Nancy Pelosi,\" reports the Times. So even though the Senate unanimously passed a spending package to avoid a Trump shutdown in December, McConnell now calls the same package passed by Pelosi's new Democratic majority \"political posturing.\"\n\nThe extreme McConnell-Trump agenda has even Republican senators running scared, just one week into the new year. That could make it increasingly difficult for McConnell to keep up the unpopular shutdown \u2014 especially if members of his own party turn on him.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "In a desperate attempt to solve an optics problem, Republicans cave, allowing women on the Judiciary Committee for the first time ever.\n\nRepublicans have never, in their entire history, appointed even one woman to the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"It's a lot of work. Maybe they don\u2019t want to do it,\" was the response from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) when asked last summer about the lack of women on the committee he chaired.\n\nBut months after the all-male GOP panel approved the nomination of alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court \u2014 during which Republicans actually hired a woman to ask questions for them, thinking it would help their poor optics \u2014 the GOP has been sufficiently shamed into appointing not one but two women to the committee.\n\n\"The appointments solve a longstanding optics problem for Republicans,\" notes Politico, adding that four of the nine Democrats on the committee last year were women. Of the 11 Republicans on the committee, exactly zero of them were women.\n\nThat 202-year streak of zero Republican women on the committee now comes to an end, but that does not mean there will be any ideological changes from the right side of the aisle. The two new additions to the committee are Tennessee's newly elected Marsha Blackburn and Iowa's Joni Ernst \u2014 two of the most fringe, anti-woman, anti-family Republicans in Congress.\n\nBlackburn spent eight years in the House, repeatedly voting to repeal the health care law that guarantees protections to anyone with a pre-existing condition. But as Politico notes, she \"is perhaps best known for leading a special House panel that investigated since-discredited charges that Planned Parenthood was profiting from the sale of tissue obtained from abortions.\"\n\nBlackburn bragged during her Senate campaign about her role on the committee, which wasted millions of taxpayer dollars investigating a fraudulent video deceptively edited to attack women's access to health care.\n\nErnst has a history of attacks on women's health care and reproductive rights. She too has repeatedly tried to defund Planned Parenthood and even praised a recent draconian abortion ban in Iowa as \"important step forward.\" As a state senator in Iowa, Ernst supported a so-called \"personhood\" bill to ban all abortions and even some types of birth control. During her U.S. Senate campaign in 2014, she said she would support a federal bill to do the same.\n\nErnst also voted to confirm alleged sexual predator Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court for life.\n\nErnst joins the Judiciary Committee as she faces a potentially tough 2020 re-election battle. Called a \"Trump enabler\" by a conservative columnist, Ernst is running in an Iowa that could be turning more blue. In the 2018 midterms, Iowans ousted two of the state's three Republican House members, replacing them with Democrats.\n\nSimply adding women to the Judiciary Committee does little to assuage the concerns of those who care about women and families.\n\n\"Just because a woman serves in a particular role doesn\u2019t mean that person exemplifies values that are going to be best for women and families in this country,\" Adrienne Kimmell, vice president of communications and strategic research at NARAL, told Politico.\n\nBy placing Blackburn and Ernst on this committee, Republicans prove once again that they care more about the optics of the political situation than working toward what is best for women and families.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Congress will be led by a grown-up again.\n\nOn Thursday, the 116th Congress was sworn in and California Democrat Nancy Pelosi once again became speaker of the House.\n\nPelosi became the first woman to hold the position after Democrats took control of the House in 2006. Last November, Pelosi helped lead Democrats to a massive victory once again, picking up 40 seats in the House and ushering in a new era of Democratic control, electing more women, more people of color, more progressives, and \u2014 perhaps most critically \u2014 more actual grownups willing to fulfill their constitutional duty to keep the belligerent and lawless occupant of the Oval Office in check.\n\nUpon accepting the speaker's gavel for the second time in her career, Pelosi noted her place in history and set forth a new agenda for the now Democratically controlled Congress.\n\n\"I am particularly proud to be the woman Speaker of the House of this Congress, which marks 100 years of women winning the right to vote, as we serve with more than 100 women in the House of Representatives \u2014 the highest number in history,\" Pelosi said in her prepared remarks.\n\n\"We enter this new Congress with a sense of great hope and confidence for the future, and deep humility and prayerfulness in the face of the challenges ahead.\"\n\nPelosi reminded her colleagues that the American people sent a clear message in November \"and demanded a new dawn.\"\n\nThat new dawn, she continued, means working for every American and \"advancing progress for every community.\"\n\nShe called on Congress to \"be pioneers of the future\" and detailed the agenda that all members of Congress should support.\n\n\"We must fight for the middle class in a way that is fair and fiscally sound \u2014 protecting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,\" she said. \"We must also face the existential threat of our time: the climate crisis \u2014 a crisis manifested in natural disasters of epic proportions. The American people understand the urgency. The people are ahead of the Congress. The Congress must join them.\"\n\nPelosi also noted that she will immediately move to end Trump's shutdown and re-open the government.\n\n\"Democrats will be offering the Senate Republican appropriations legislation to re-open government later today \u2014 to meet the needs of the American people, to protect our borders, and to respect our workers,\" she said.\n\nShe concluded by reminding her colleagues of the oath they take to uphold the Constitution and serve the people they represent.\n\n\"As we take the oath of office today, we accept responsibility as daunting and demanding as any that previous generations of leadership have faced,\" Pelosi said. \"Guided by the vision and values of our Founders, the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and the aspirations that we have for our children, let us meet that responsibility with courage, wisdom and grace.\"\n\nPelosi's job will not be an easy one. Republicans still control the Senate, and they have made it clear they would rather capitulate to Trump's recklessness and whims than do their job. But they would be foolish to underestimate Pelosi, widely recognized as the most effective House leader in the modern era, even when she represented the minority.\n\nNow Pelosi once again has the power of the speaker's gavel \u2014 and it's clear she intends to use it to serve the American people.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

That's what Nancy Pelosi promised she would do once she became speaker again, and she made good on her promise.\n\nBut instead of resuming government operations, reopening museums and national parks, and paying hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers, McConnell is continuing to appease Trump's racist and unproductive demand for $5 billion to build a border wall that Trump insisted, throughout his 2016 campaign, Mexico would pay for. Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto made it clear immediately after Trump took office that Mexico would do no such thing.\n\n\"The Senate will not take up any proposal that does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature,\" McConnell said in a floor speech Thursday. \"Let\u2019s not waste the time.\"\n\nIt's an absurd claim, since the same bill to reopen the government, without money for Trump's pet wall project, already did pass the chamber just a few weeks ago. In fact, the Senate passed that legislation unanimously on a voice vote.\n\nNow McConnell's insisting that bill is a waste of time. And he has been mocked by Democratic senators for his disingenuous change of tone.\n\nBut the episode shows just how in thrall he and fellow Senate Republicans are to Trump. That same slavish devotion is what led millions of people to show up at the polls in 2018 and hand control of the House to Democrats.\n\nThe blame for the unpopular shutdown has been placed by the public on Republicans and McConnell playing to Trump is unlikely to help their growing image problem.\n\nMcConnell isn't alone in attaching himself to Trump's folly. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) told reporters that he saw no \"quick resolution\" to the funding issue and added, \"We might be in for a long haul here.\" The shutdown, he said, could last for \"months and months.\"\n\nThere's no reason for the shutdown to last another day, let alone months. The votes now exist in the House and Senate to fund the government. Even with Trump threatening to veto any such efforts, Congress could override his veto and fund the government anyway.\n\nBut McConnell would rather give in to Trump's obsession than do the right thing for the American people. So he's blocking the effort to fund the government, siding instead with an unpopular Trump who is utterly incapable of convincing the public he is in the right.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Regardless of the results on Election Day, America will finally be free of the failed 'leadership' of Republican Paul Ryan.\n\nWisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, the self-proclaimed wunderkind policy wonk, is almost done.\n\nRyan once had huge political aspirations. He joined Mitt Romney's train wreck presidential ticket in 2012, ostensibly to lend some of his far-far-right credibility to the tanking campaign. That didn't work.\n\nIn 2015, Ryan reluctantly accepted the role of House speaker, after Ohio Republican John Boehner was run out of town by the nihilist wing of the Republican Party, the uber-conservative House Freedom Caucus \u2014 and House Republicans exhausted their admittedly small list of other options.\n\nCalifornia's Kevin McCarthy was next in line, but his flirtation with getting the gavel was short-lived and ended in a swirl of scandalous rumors and criticism from the far-right.\n\nOh, plus this guy:\n\nGreat, Kevin McCarthy drops out of SPEAKER race. We need a really smart and really tough person to take over this very important job! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2015\n\nRyan's so-called leadership has been a disaster from day one. The far-right extremists in Congress never trusted him, and Ryan learned the hard way that actually getting stuff done was not as easy as former Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 the most effective speaker in the modern era \u2014 made it look.\n\nAnd then Ryan had to contend with Trump. From the very beginning of Trump's presidential campaign, when he called Mexicans rapists, Ryan has tried to pretend Trump simply does not exist. He has dodged questions about Trump's unending stream of racist, sexist, xenophobic bile, absurdly claiming he hasn't seen that tweet, isn't familiar with that quote, not aware of that story.\n\nOccasionally, Ryan would limply insist that there is no room for that kind of talk in the Republican Party \u2014 even though the Republican Party certainly made plenty of room for it by electing Trump.\n\nNot that Ryan cared as long as he could finally accomplish his agenda, with full Republican control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. But even that proved too difficult for the woefully inadequate and ineffective Ryan.\n\nThe one vow every single Republican has made to voters since the Affordable Care Act was passed is that if Republicans were in control they would repeal and replace it.\n\nThat still hasn't happened.\n\nInstead, Ryan's singular \"achievement\" as House speaker is ramming through last year's tax scam. But even that has turned into an embarrassing and catastrophic failure.\n\nIn February, Ryan and his fellow Republicans still foolishly believed they would be able to tout their tax scam as a reason to maintain power in November. But Ryan managed to bury that argument six feet under ground when he infamously boasted that a high school secretary had seen a whopping $1.50 added to her weekly paycheck after the tax scam was enacted. That, according to Ryan, was somehow proof that the trillion dollar giveaway to corporations and millionaires was working for regular Americans.\n\nIt was a far cry from the \"thousands\" of dollars Republicans had promised middle America would be seeing. Ryan's boast was so widely mocked that he deleted the tweet.\n\nThe secretary, Julia Ketchum, called out Ryan for bragging about such a minimal increase while the millionaires and billionaires of America benefitted so greatly from the tax scam.\n\nAnd it didn't take long after that for Republicans to stop talking about their tax bill and revert to the most classic of Republican playbooks: bad old-fashioned racism to rile up the right-wing base.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryan sat back and watched it happen, just as he watched Trump take over his party and infect his toxic brand of in-your-face bigotry. As Trump spent the final weeks of the 2018 campaign turning his racism \u2014 and his lies \u2014 up to 11, Ryan still did nothing.\n\nIt was not until the Sunday before Election Day that Ryan reportedly picked up the phone and suggested that the leader of his party should focus on Ryan's beloved tax cuts instead of screeching hysterically about a non-existent \"invasion\" from the south.\n\nAs has been the case throughout Ryan's short speakership, he failed.\n\nWe don't know what will happen on Election Day. Maybe Democrats will take back the House and put the speaker's gavel back in Pelosi's hands, where it belongs. Or maybe the already-failed-once McCarthy will finally get the gig, and Republicans, including Trump, will pretend they didn't scoff at the idea just three years ago.\n\nBut whatever the result, we will finally be free of Ryan, the utterly failed leader who never once showed the moral courage to stand up to the temper-tantrum-throwing Trump \u2014 and to stand for the American people.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

She lamented to CNN that her \"dreams and hopes for something in life are being fractured and highly possibly shattered.\"\n\nIn mid-December, Trump boasted that he would \"take the mantle\" of shutting down the government unless Congress paid a $5 billion ransom to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. While a feckless Paul Ryan spent his last days as Speaker groveling before Trump, Democrats refused to give in to Trump's tantrums, and Trump shut the government down on Dec. 22.\n\nThe decision by Trump and Republicans to force a shutdown is having real consequences for families across the country.\n\n\"My son made a comment where he said Santa didn't give us as much as he did last year, and that was heartbreaking,\" said one Washington, D.C.-area mother who works at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nLila Johnson, a 71-year-old grandmother raising her two grandsons, was told to use her sick leave and vacation time during the shutdown. Johnson works with a contractor in charge of cleaning the State Department.\n\n\"It's Christmastime,\" Johnson told the Washington Post. \"People need their money. I don't think it's right for us to have to use our sick days.\" Johnson, like most people in this country, had no doubt as to who is to blame: Trump.\n\n\"That man only cares about himself,\" Johnson said.\n\nOne federal employees' union filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing it is illegal to force federal employees to work and not pay them. The lawsuit stems from several hundred thousand employees who are deemed \"essential\" and must work without pay during the shutdown.\n\n\"It's outrageous the government expects them to work without knowing when they'll get their next paycheck,\" lead attorney Heidi Burakiewicz told the Washington Post, referring to Border Patrol agents, law enforcement officers and federal firefighters who must work without pay.\n\nWhile Republicans have proven their inability to govern, a new Democratic majority led by Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi will soon be in control of the House of Representatives. Their first order of business will be to pass legislation to reopen the government.\n\n\"It's time to end the Trump shutdown and the pain it is inflicting on our families,\" American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten said in a statement. The end of the Trump shutdown can not come soon enough for some families.\n\n\"We have about a month in savings and that's it,\" said a heartbroken mother who works at DHS. \"That's a struggle because an appliance can break, a car can need breaks.\"\n\n\"Just like everyone else, we're one or two paychecks from being in serious trouble,\" she added.\n\nThe Trump shutdown has real consequences, and the longer Trump maintains his shutdown, the more pain families will feel.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Rep. Jerry Nadler announced plans to investigate Trump's cruel policies.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized the Trump administration's \"inhuman\" treatment of migrants and said the Trump team was \"apparently willing\" to let children die as a result.\n\nNadler indicated during an appearance on \"CBS This Morning\" that he plans to hold hearings in the Judiciary Committee and subpoena witnesses and documents to find out \"why kids are dying in custody\" of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nNadler also said he would use his powers given to him by the Democratic takeover of the House to investigate the Trump administration's continued detainment of children and their implementation of a cruel family separation policy.\n\n\"This is inhuman, and it's not precedented. It's a deliberate creation of the Trump administration, which is trying to make things as miserable as possible. And if kids die, they're apparently willing to have that,\" he concluded.\n\nTrump has used cruelty to migrants \u2014 particularly those of Latino descent \u2014 to prop up his unpopular administration and feed the bloodlust of the rabid racists within his political base.\n\nChildren were ripped from their families and detained by the government after he put in place the policy of prosecuting all border crossers, a change from previous administrations.\n\nJakelin Caal, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl, died while in U.S. custody. After news of the death surfaced, Trump's Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen quickly blamed the girl's family for her passing. Appearing on Fox News, Nielsen callously said the death occurred because \"this family chose to cross illegally.\"\n\nTrump later blamed Democrats for other child deaths, writing, \"Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally.\"\n\nHe went on to use the deaths of children to justify his unworkable and nonsensical border wall fantasy.\n\nRepublicans in Congress not only gave a rubber stamp to Trump's cruel and dangerous immigration policies, but in many instances they actively enabled the racism for their own personal political gain.\n\nVoters punished the party for their behavior, ushering Democrats like Nadler into positions of power. Rep. Nadler's comments show that he intends to deliver concrete congressional action to give voters the accountability and justice they demanded.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The resistance to Trump scored a critical, much-needed victory. Now the real work of fixing all he has broken, and holding him accountable, begins.\n\nA massive wave of voters marched to the polls and delivered a searing, unambiguous message: It's time to put the speaker's gavel back where it belongs.\n\nRight back in the capable hands of Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMultiple news organizations \u2014 including NBC News, CNN, and CBS \u2014 are projecting that Democrats will gain at least 23 seats in the House of Representatives, enough to wrest control away from complicit Republicans. Democrats are likely to pick up even more seats as Election Day results continue to come in over the next few days and even weeks.\n\nAfter two years of relentless organizing, marching, campaigning, donating, and \u2014 finally \u2014 voting, Democrats sent a stinging rebuke to Trump, who spent the closing days of the election in a hate-filled tizzy of campaign rallies as a desperate attempt to maintain Republican control.\n\nA record number of women, LGBTQ individuals, and people of color ran for office this year on the kind of bold, progressive platform Pelosi has been fighting for: passing common-sense gun safety legislation, fighting for a higher minimum wage, protecting Dreamers by passing the DREAM Act, and expanding access to affordable health care.\n\nAnd their efforts paid off.\n\nWhile Democrats ran on a positive message, one figure still cast a long shadow over the midterms: Trump.\n\nBut Democrats have a plan for him, too.\n\nThe new Democratic majority in the House will restore integrity to a chamber that has been defiled by feckless Trump loyalists who refused to uphold their constitutional duties as a co-equal branch of government.\n\nReclaiming the majority means Democrats will take over as the chairs of powerful committees that set the House's agenda, hold key hearings \u2014 and, yes, issue subpoenas.\n\nFor example, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) will likely take over as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. He will depose Trump sycophant Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), who has spent the past 18 months running a sham investigation into Trump's ties to Russia.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) is in line to take over the Financial Services Committee, and she would have the power to subpoena Trump's tax returns.\n\nTrump's Cabinet, which has been mired in a cesspool of corruption, will have a rude awakening once Democrats start exercising their rightful oversight role.\n\nNone of these changes would be possible without two years of unparalleled activism from progressives across the nation.\n\nShortly after the 2016 election, a couple of distraught congressional staffers created a GoogleDoc to help people resist the Trump agenda. That effort turned into Indivisible, one of the largest grassroots organizing groups in the country, with chapters in every single congressional district.\n\nWomen, angry and determined to push back against Trump's misogyny, organized the largest single-day demonstration in recorded U.S. history. The Women's March, held the day after Trump's sparsely attended inauguration, sparked two years of well-organized, women-led resistance activism across the country.\n\nEMILY's List, a group focused on helping pro-choice Democratic women to run for office, was flooded with tens of thousands of women interested in running for public office, from city council to the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn early 2018, the nation was stunned as 17 people, including 14 students, were murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High by a former student wielding an AR-15 assault rifle. In the aftermath, students who survived that nightmare emerged a leaders of a nationwide gun safety movement, sparking the March for Our Lives and inspiring a surge of young people to vote out NRA-funded lackeys.\n\nAll of these efforts paid off.\n\nAfter kowtowing to Trump for two years, a defeated Paul Ryan is limping away from Congress in abject failure. His integrity long ago sacrificed on the altar of Trump, Ryan's legacy as an inept leader will live on as generations foot the bill for the massive deficits he oversaw \u2014 all to fund tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nRyan was inexplicably hyped as a \"policy wonk,\" but history will remember him as just another far-right, Ayn Rand-worshipping hack.\n\nIn all likelihood, Pelosi will reclaim her speaker's gavel and begin the long, hard job of setting right what Ryan did so wrong.\n\nPelosi \u2014 who shepherded the Affordable Care Act through the House, fought for tougher financial regulations of Wall Street in the Dodd-Frank Act, and helped ensure the discriminatory \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" was repealed \u2014 will once again bring true leadership to the speaker's chair.\n\nWhile flipping the House from red to blue is critical, it is not the only victory Democrats have worked so hard to achieve.\n\nIn the days and weeks to come, stories of triumphant Democrats at the local, state, and congressional level will continue to emerge, helping ensure a progressive agenda at all levels of government.\n\nThe resistance to Trump scored a critical, much-needed victory on Tuesday.\n\nNow the real work of fixing all he has broken, and holding him accountable, begins."

I said NO and the game was over.\" He also described Corker as \"Little Bob Corker.\"\n\nDemocrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, are taking over the House of Representatives. They do not plan to give Trump funding for his wall and will propose legislation to reopen the government.

One of Paul Ryan's final acts as House speaker was \u2014 fittingly \u2014 a spineless capitulation to Trump resulting in the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nOn Wednesday, outgoing Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) released a memo declaring there will be no more votes in the 115th Congress. Ryan was nowhere to be seen on the last day of his tenure as a decidedly failed House speaker overseeing a government he helped bring to a screeching halt before leaving office.\n\nThe responsibility of getting the government back up and running \u2014 after Trump stomped his feet and demanded a government shutdown, and his GOP gave it to him \u2014 will now fall to the 116th Congress, when California's Nancy Pelosi will reclaim her position this week as speaker of the House. Pelosi will lead a Democratic majority that ousted at least 40 Republicans during the 2018 midterm elections. The transition of power will return Democrats to the majority for the first time since 2010.\n\nIn the eight years of House control, Republicans will be most remembered for an almost-decade long fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. They failed. They failed more than 50 times. They failed even when Republicans controlled the House, Senate, and White House.\n\nAside from tilting at that windmill, Republicans did their best to serve their corporate masters on Wall Street. The 2017 tax scam added trillions to the national deficit so that rich corporations could pad the bank accounts of wealthy investors all while leaving middle-class Americans out in the cold.\n\nRyan, a fake deficit hawk turned Trump lackey, took over as speaker in 2015 when the fiscal year ended with a $439 billion deficit. He retires with the deficit at $890 billion, and the federal government shut down by his party\n\nDemocrats come in to the majority with an ambitious agenda, including legislation focused on issues like voting rights and strengthening our democracy. New committee chairs are also ready to hold Trump and his corrupt cabinet accountable for their actions, something Republicans refused to do for the past two years.\n\nBut before Democrats can implement the agenda Americans voted for, Pelosi and her team will spend their first day in power doing the job Republicans failed to accomplish: funding the federal government so it can actually function and cleaning up the mess Ryan and his party have left behind.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is trying to save face after Gen. Mattis humiliated him for all the world to see.\n\nIn December, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis quit on Trump and released a fiery letter shredding Trump's disastrous and reckless policies. It was utterly humiliating for Trump, even if it took him several days to realize it.\n\nBut now he has \u2014 and he's trying to save face by claiming it was his idea to send Mattis packing.\n\n\"As you know, President Obama fired him,\" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, \"and essentially so did I.\"\n\nTrump also complained that Mattis had done a \"not too good\" job in Afghanistan and asked, \"What's he done for me?\"\n\nThat's a far different tune than the one Trump was singing on Dec. 20, when Mattis announced his resignation.\n\n\"General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years,\" Trump tweeted at the time. He added that \"tremendous progress has been made\" and offered his thanks to Mattis for his service.\n\nBut that was before Trump learned \u2014 apparently from watching TV, where he learns everything \u2014 that Mattis' resignation letter was extremely harsh and unflattering. Mattis slammed Trump for disrespecting our allies while bowing to countries like China and Russia, who \"want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.\"\n\nMattis said it is his belief that \"we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours\" \u2014 and made it clear that Trump does not share that belief.\n\n\"Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects,\" Mattis wrote, \"I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\"\n\nIt was clear to everyone but Trump that Mattis had delivered a brutal assessment of Trump. When Trump figured it out, days later, he announced that he would not be keeping Mattis around until February after all, instead replacing him temporarily with Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan as of Jan. 1.\n\nSo, Trump \"essentially fired\" Mattis \u2014 after Mattis very specifically quit.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has belatedly claimed that being abandoned by people who no longer support him was somehow his idea. In August 2017, several of the CEOs who served on Trump's Manufacturing Advisory Council quit in protest after Trump defended rioting white supremacists and Nazis in Charlottesville as \"very fine people.\" Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s primary business advisory group of CEOs, the Strategic and Policy Forum, decided to disband altogether.\n\n\"Given the comments of the last several days,\" one executive said, \"no one could continue to be seen as supporting this kind of divisiveness.\"\n\nSo Trump pretended, days later, that it was his idea to dissolve his advisory boards, slamming the \"grandstanders\" for fleeing him.\n\nIt wasn't believable then, and Trump's words about Mattis aren't believable now. Mattis made a fool out of Trump, and now that Trump has figured it out, he's trying to pretend otherwise.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Racism was the Republican Party's message in 2018. It lost, big.\n\nRepublicans made a major bet in 2018 that tightly embracing racism would pay off for them just as well as it has in the past.\n\nInstead, it helped the GOP lose 40 House seats in the midterm elections and sent them back into the minority.\n\nA stunning 90 percent of the House seats that Republicans held on to will be occupied by white men. Democrats broke new ground for racial and gender diversity in the House \u2014 while House Republicans actually lost 43 percent of the women in their caucus.\n\nAnd when you look back on the year in racism for Republicans in 2018, it's clear that the GOP is determined to be the party that represents white men, and only white men.\n\nTrump's Trickle-Down Racism\n\nThe GOP's refusal to fight racism starts at the top.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about his embrace of racism and nationalism by PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor, who is a black woman, Trump whined that it was \"such a racist question.\"\n\nHe went on to claim that he has strong support \"with African-Americans\" \u2014 but black voters have never backed Trump, and in fact have remained the most opposed to his bigoted presidency.\n\nTrump didn't just push racism in the United States. He also created an international incident by using his Twitter account to promote the same myth about supposed \"white genocide\" that is pushed by white supremacists in South Africa. The South African government publicly rebuked Trump's allegations, and America was once again humiliated on the world stage.\n\nNot wanting to be left out, Vice President Mike Pence backed his boss's racist attacks on NFL players who have taken a knee to protest police brutality. Pence once left an Indianapolis Colts game in a faux huff over kneeling players \u2014 but it was a pre-planned stunt, which was later revealed to have cost taxpayers at least $325,000.\n\nYet despite the one-two racist punch from Trump and Pence, the country continued to support athletes pushing for equality and justice.\n\nQuarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began the kneeling protest, became the front man for sneaker juggernaut Nike's latest iteration of the \"Just Do It\" ad campaign. While Trump fumed that players like Kaepernick just \"shouldn't be in the country,\" Nike saw a surge in sales and a boost in stock value.\n\nRacism in the Midterms\n\nRepublicans quickly realized that their massive tax scam for the rich wasn't going to be a winning campaign message. So, desperate to keep their seats in the midterm elections, they picked racism instead.\n\nThe White House revealed this game plan early in the year when Trump adviser Stephen Miller said the administration would ramp up the fearmongering over immigration \u2014 even though this same racist message had failed months before in Virginia's gubernatorial election.\n\nParty elders would admit later in the year that racism was an electoral loser. But by then it was too late, and the vast majority of the Republican Party had started marching in lockstep with Trump's open hate.\n\nToo Racist for Fox News\n\nFox News has been racist for a long time. To create advertising too racist for Fox News is to blaze a new trail in American politics.\n\nAnd Trump did just that.\n\nAhead of the midterm elections, Trump's campaign ran a racist ad that falsely blamed Democrats for the release of an undocumented immigrant who killed police. The ad was so racist that it drew immediate comparisons to the infamously race-baiting Willie Horton ad from 1988.\n\nThat was over the line even for Fox, which pulled the ad.\n\nThe commercial was also factually wrong. The person responsible for letting the eventual cop-killer back on the streets was actually former Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014 the disgraced ex-law enforcement official from Arizona who received Trump's first pardon.\n\nAnd the crime Arpaio was pardoned for? Contempt of court for refusing to obey a judge's order to stop enforcing his racist policies.\n\nRNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also disgraced herself defending Trump's ad in an appearance on CNN. Anchor Jake Tapper asked her point blank, \"It\u2019s factually inaccurate, and it\u2019s racially incendiary \u2014 you don\u2019t have any issue with that?\"\n\nShe apparently didn't. Instead, McDaniel digressed and returned to harping on Republican complaints about the immigration system.\n\nRepublicans ended the year being too racist for Fox News \u2014 and that's saying something.\n\nRacism Lost\n\nIn Virginia, Republicans picked neo-Confederate candidate Corey Stewart as their nominee for Senate. Endorsed by Trump, Stewart was unabashed in his praise for the pro-slavery losing side of the Civil War.\n\nAlmost as soon as polls closed on election night, the results were clear: Stewart had been blown out by Sen. Tim Kaine (D), who had the strong support of an increasingly diverse Virginia.\n\nRep. Steve Knight (R-CA) featured a man in a campaign ad who turned out to be a virulent racist. The man, David Brayton, was revealed to have quoted Adolf Hitler, shared an illustration calling for the lynching of President Barack Obama, and advocated for shooting journalists.\n\nYet even after learning all of this, Knight still said he was \"proud to have earned\" Brayton's vote. And on election night, voters sent Knight packing with many of his fellow California Republicans.\n\nIn the House, Republicans lost 40 seats as well as their majority. Much of that failure can directly be traced to the racism at top that flowed through the entire movement.\n\nRepublicans are refusing to learn the lesson America is trying to teach them. If anything, they are getting worse under Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Cook Political Report's House editor Dave Wasserman wrote Friday that the final result is likely to be \"closer to 40 than 30,\" which would be the largest gain in Democratic House seats since Watergate.\n\nDemocrats also made huge strides at the state level. According to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, 372 state legislative seats flipped from Republican to Democratic on Tuesday night, though some votes are still being counted. And come January, the majority of state attorneys general will be Democrats, which could prove crucial in future battles over everything from healthcare to voting rights.\n\nOn top of that, Democrats racked up victories in key gubernatorial races across the country, including many in the same states that propelled Trump to victory just two years ago. In Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers defeated incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker, handing Democrats a crucial win in a state that proved critical to Trump's electoral college victory in 2016. Democrats also won the races for governor in Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 two other states that Trump won in 2016 \u2014 and flipped the Illinois governorship to blue.\n\nClearly, Democrats have good reason to celebrate.\n\nBut even more than that, Democrats have good reason to get to work. The midterm elections showed that our democratic process isn't broken, yet they also revealed just how hard Republicans are working to skew the system \u2014 and how much voters want to repair, reform, and improve it.\n\nAmerica's democracy has been in a state of decline for years, with low voter turnout, voter suppression tactics, and gerrymandering hijacking our electoral process. Republicans know their policies aren't favored by the majority of Americans, but instead of changing their policies, they've tried to change the voting process and the composition of the voting populace.\n\nThis is how Trump ended up winning the presidential election despite losing the popular vote by a historic margin.\n\nNow, two years after losing to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes, Trump stumbled into midterm elections as the most unpopular president in modern history. Clearly, Americans don't want what the GOP is offering \u2014 so the GOP has responded by making it harder for those Americans to participate in our democratic process.\n\nAnd in many ways, it's been working: In 2014, voter turnout in the midterm elections hit a 74-year low. Just over one-third of the eligible voting population cast a ballot that year, which is only slightly lower than the average of 40 percent voter turnout during 2002, 2006, and 2010 midterms. As a result, neither the House nor Senate has gone with the popular vote consistently for over a decade. This means that even though most Americans support Democratic candidates, ideas, policies, and platforms at the ballot box, Republicans have often ended up winning elections.\n\nThese undemocratic outcomes are largely the product of intentional efforts to tip the scale in favor of Republicans. Chief among the tactics used by Republicans are gerrymandering and voter suppression, both of which make it harder for voters to participate in the democratic process and effectuate change at the ballot box.\n\nMeanwhile, emerging threats to election security remain largely unaddressed under the Trump administration, leaving the integrity of our democracy in question.\n\nThat's why we need to look ahead now. There are no permanent victories \u2014 or losses \u2014 in politics. If we want to turn our midterm victories into long-term results, we need to address the problems that got us here in the first place.\n\nGerrymandering\n\nGerrymandering is a process involving redrawing electoral boundaries to favor one political party over the other. While it varies somewhat from district to district, gerrymandering tends to favor Republicans more than Democrats.\n\nThe problem was compounded in 2010, when Republicans were in charge of redrawing congressional districts in key battleground states like Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, and Virginia \u2014 all of which turned solid red after they were redrawn.\n\nUltimately, gerrymandering exacerbates the issues that make our representative democracy not-so-representative for much of the country. For example, when it comes to Senate elections, voters in the smallest states in America have approximately 68 times the political power of those in the largest states.\n\nThis produces outcomes like we saw in 2012, when Democratic House candidates won 1.4 million more votes than Republicans did, but Republicans controlled 33 more House seats.\n\nAnd 2012 wasn't a fluke. According to a 2017 analysis conducted by the Associated Press, there are four times as many states with Republican-skewed state House or Assembly districts than Democratic-skewed ones. The AP analysis concluded that even if Democrats voted in larger numbers than Republicans, their chances of substantial legislative gains at the ballot box would still be severely hampered by gerrymandering \u2014 a finding that makes this week's midterm victories all the more impressive.\n\nOther analyses have reached similar conclusions. A 2017 study from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law analyzed the impact of gerrymandering on congressional elections from 2012 to 2016, and found a persistent Republican advantage and \"clear evidence that aggressive gerrymandering is distorting the nation's congressional maps.\"\n\n\"The rise of extreme gerrymandering, enabled by more accurate political data and better map-drawing software, seems poised to continue if left unchecked, allowing parties to manipulate maps to lock in a guaranteed artificial advantage for themselves,\" the report concluded. \"The threat to democracy is both real and alarming.\"\n\nIndeed, it is. And that's why it's critical for Democrats to use the gains achieved this week to reform redistricting at the state level, and to call attention to unfair and undemocratic gerrymandering ahead of the 2021 redrawing of congressional districts. As the Brennan Center report pointed out, new software and statistical methods are making it easier to detect when maps have been distorted, resulting in increased knowledge and awareness of the problem \u2014 and along with it, a new \"opportunity to police and prevent redistricting abuses.\"\n\nWith Democrats now in control of the governorship in a number of key states where gerrymandering skews results in the GOP's favor, 2021 will bring a huge opportunity to start unraveling the built-in advantage that Republicans gave themselves the last time the maps were drawn.\n\nVoter suppression\n\nGerrymandering is not the only way Republicans are corrupting our democratic process and tipping the scales in their favor. Through a variety of voter suppression tactics, Republicans are making it harder for people to register to vote, cast their ballots, and effectuate change with their votes.\n\nRepublican-led voter suppression is rooted in the racist ideology at the core of Trump's GOP. Minority voters, who make up a large part of the Democratic Party's voting bloc, are hit hardest by tactics like strict voter ID laws and limited polling hours. Since they know their policies and ideas can't win over these voters, Republicans have instead resorted to trying to limit their ability to vote and to have their votes counted.\n\nGoing into midterms, more than half of the states in the country (33) didn't allow same day voter registration, while a surge of laws limiting early voting and access to polling places has had a severe impact on minority voter participation in states like Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. Research shows that early voting can increase voter participation by about 2 to 4 percent. On the other hand, eliminating early voting has been found to disproportionately decrease turnout in communities of color.\n\nSince the Supreme Court struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, counties previously monitored under the Voting Rights Act have slashed the number of polling places, resulting in longer drive times (and complications with transportation), longer lines at the polls, and widespread confusion among voters and poll workers.\n\nThanks to these tactics, there were at least 868 fewer polling places open in 2016 than in 2012.\n\nAs the authors of one recent report on poll closures explained, the consequences of such moves are severe and far-reaching:\n\nPolling place closures are a particularly common and pernicious tactic for disenfranchising voters of color. Decisions to shutter or reduce voting locations are often made quietly and at the last minute, making pre-election intervention or litigation virtually impossible. These changes can place an undue burden on minority voters, who may be less likely to have access to public transportation or vehicles, given continuing disparities in socioeconomic resources. Once an election is conducted, there is no judicial remedy for the loss of votes that were never cast because a voter\u2019s usual polling place has disappeared\n\nVoter ID laws are another key voter suppression tactic used by Republicans. At least 34 states have enacted laws requiring voters to show photo ID before they can cast a ballot. Prior to 2006, not a single state required photo ID to vote.\n\nThe proliferation of voter ID laws has resulted in a drop in voter turnout among minorities, especially in racially diverse districts. The drop in minority voter participation cannot be explained by other factors such as partisan competition or county demographics, leading the authors of one recent study to conclude that \"strict voter ID laws do discriminate.\"\n\nAnother study, the first of its kind to analyze certified votes across all states after the enforcement of voter laws in multiple elections, found that \"strict photo identification laws have a differentially negative impact on the turnout of Hispanics, Blacks, and mixed-race Americans in primaries and general elections.\"\n\n\"By instituting strict voter ID laws, states can alter the electorate and shift outcomes toward those on the right. Where these laws are enacted, the influence of Democrats and liberals wanes and the power of Republicans grows. Unsurprisingly, these strict ID laws are passed almost exclusively by Republican legislatures,\" the authors of the study wrote in the Washington Post.\n\nWe saw the election-day impact of voter suppression in states like Kansas, Missouri, Georgia, and Illinois, where voters were met with hours-long waits at their polling places. While we don't know how this influenced election results, previous research indicates that the likely outcomes include lower voter participation, suppression of minority votes, and vote totals skewed toward Republicans.\n\nDemocrats still managed to walk away with impressive wins this week, but that doesn't mean voter suppression is any less of a problem \u2014 and it definitely should not be taken as a reason to stop fighting against voter suppression at every level and in every way it manifests.\n\nIn fact, there's good reason to believe that the GOP will try even harder to suppress the vote after suffering such a huge defeat in the midterms. Look no further than Arizona, Florida, and Georgia, where Republicans are so afraid of losing key races that they're making baseless claims of voter fraud and fighting to make sure every vote is not counted.\n\nThreats to election security\n\nWhile improvements have been made since 2016, there are still significant vulnerabilities leaving our election systems at risk of being hacked or otherwise tampered with.\n\nIt has already been reported that there was a successful cyberattack against Knox County, Tennessee, during the primaries, and DHS recently sent out a report warning of a \"growing\" number of attempted cyberattacks on state and local election systems during the 2018 midterms.\n\nYet under the Trump administration, cybersecurity has largely been neglected, and the White House still has no strategy for combating election influence operations.\n\nAs Politico reported:\n\nFew states have implemented post-election risk-limiting audits to safeguard against tampering, and some still use particularly vulnerable paperless voting machines. Texas and Georgia already have seen voting glitches on such machines, as POLITICO\u2019s Christian Vasquez and Matthew Choi reported Sunda. At least two other states had been using file-sharing software on state election servers that made them vulnerable in other ways, Pro Publica reported late last week.\n\nAccording to Politico, vendor and candidate cybersecurity are among the least addressed \u2014 and thus, most vulnerable \u2014 election security issues.\n\nEven in the absence of cyberattacks, voting infrastructure still poses a threat to the integrity of our elections due to aging election machines, poor ballot design, failure to perform routine maintenance, and lack of paper backups in case of machine failure or discrepancies. During the midterm elections, voting machine problems were reported in Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and several other states.\n\nUntil we can ensure that all votes are cast, counted, reported accurately, and free from foreign and domestic malign influence, the legitimacy of our elections \u2014 and by extension, the integrity of our democracy \u2014 will remain in question.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nDemocracy was on the ballot in 2018 \u2014 in more ways than one.\n\nBy delivering a decisive victory to Democrats, voters made it clear that they want their elected representatives to serve as a check on Trump's power, hold him accountable for his abuses of power, and step up where Republicans have backed down.\n\nBut Tuesday also gave Americans in many states a chance to vote directly for democracy reform initiatives, and the results show that voters are ready for change.\n\nRedistricting reform was on the ballot in four states and it passed in three and holds a narrow edge in the fourth (Utah), where votes are still being counted. In the three states where it already passed, more than 60 percent of voters cast ballots in favor of forming independent redistricting commissions to stop partisan gerrymandering, sending a strong message that citizens are not going to sit back and let politicians keep calling the shots.\n\nFurthermore, ballot initiatives to strengthen voting rights passed by overwhelming margins in all four states that voted on them, while campaign finance reform initiatives passed in another four states.\n\nAnd when candidates promised change, voters lined up to support them. Of the 30 Democratic candidates who flipped House seats to blue, 25 ran on reform platforms.\n\nIf 2018 taught us anything, it's that Americans still have faith that our democracy can be strengthened and brought back to health. Voters want change, and they want Democrats to lead the way in making those changes. And the time to make that happen is right now.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats will have to go before voters again in 2020, and you can be sure Republicans will do everything they can to hijack the system and swing the vote in their favor. With a losing agenda, Republicans are taking deliberate actions to undermine democracy rather than participate in it.\n\nBut as hard as Republicans have tried, they haven't canceled democracy yet. We get to vote again and try to make more gains in just two years' time, which is a privilege and responsibility that people living under the rule of repressive regimes and illberal democracies don't have.\n\nMidterm elections brought a historic surge in voter turnout (made possible by a record number of states offering early voting), and the next two years bring an opportunity to make sure all of those voters \u2014 and more \u2014 show up in 2020 and beyond.\n\nElection Day was never going to solve the long-term problems that got us here in the first place. We knew that before Tuesday, and it remains true today. But midterms showed us that change is possible, and now we have a blueprint to make it happen.\n\nSo let's get to work.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "As a new Congress prepares to take over, here are the Republicans we're happiest to say 'good riddance' to.\n\nVoters flocked to the polls in 2018 to usher in a new Democratic House majority, which also meant kicking dozens of Republicans to the curb.\n\nThere's a lot to look forward to in the new Democratic-led Congress, from bold new reforms to tough new oversight over the Trump administration.\n\nAnother thing to look forward to is that several of the worst Republicans in Congress will finally, finally, be out of office.\n\nAs preparations continue for the new Congress, we wanted to wish an especially un-fond farewell to these six terrible Republican lawmakers:\n\nPaul Ryan\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan's tenure as leader of the Republican Party is likely one of the most colossal failures in congressional history. The far-right Freedom Caucus fringe ran roughshod over Ryan, who repeatedly proved himself too weak a leader to corral his caucus around significant pieces of legislation.\n\nWhile the House passed a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, it never made it out of the Senate \u2014 and ultimately helped doom the re-election chances of dozens of House Republicans who were swept out of office in the midterms.\n\nVoters were furious that the GOP even tried to push a bill that would have left more than 20 million people without access to health insurance, and that would have decimated protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n\nRyan did manage to pass a deficit-busting tax scam, which handed Wall Street banks record profits but did almost nothing for regular families. Ryan made himself a laughingstock for weeks after he tried to brag about a secretary who would receive a measly extra $1.50 per week.\n\nThrough it all, Ryan never had the backbone to stand up to Trump's childish antics or blatant racism. When Pelosi takes back over as Speaker, Ryan's disastrous congressional career will finally, thankfully, be over.\n\nDarrell Issa\n\nBefore coming to Congress, Issa faced allegations that he was involved in an arson plot related to his California business.\n\nSomehow, his time in Congress was worse.\n\nIssa rose to prominence as head of the House Oversight Committee during President Obama's tenure \u2014 and wasted millions of taxpayer dollars using this powerful position to chase phony scandals, including false allegations that the IRS targeted conservative groups.\n\nHis antics and irresponsible bloviating were too much even for his own party, which proceeded to set up a separate committee to look into the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi \u2014 which took jurisdiction on the issue away from Issa, and which Issa was not happy about.\n\nFor much of 2017, protesters gathered regularly outside Issa's local California office to call attention to his terrible votes on issues like health care. Rather than meet with his own constituents, Issa once actually fled to the roof of the building.\n\nAnd rather than face an electorate likely to fire him, Issa opted to announce his retirement in January 2018. And his seat was one of the seven that Republicans lost in California \u2014 a fitting end to his embarrassing congressional career.\n\nDana Rohrabacher\n\nIn 30 years in Congress, Rohrabacher managed to get a total of three pieces of legislation passed into law.\n\nHe was useless to his constituents \u2014 but he did manage to earn himself the nickname of \"Putin's favorite congressman\" because he was so overly friendly to Russia.\n\nRohrabacher relentlessly defended Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, even if it meant calling the men and women who work for U.S. intelligence agencies liars.\n\nRohrabacher also embraced Trump and parroted Trump's anti-immigrant racism. He even advocated discrimination against LGBTQ individuals during his last election.\n\nIncapable of losing with class, Rohrabacher blamed his loss to Democrat Harley Rouda on \"bolshevik billionaires.\"\n\nRohrabacher's fellow California Republican and soon-to-be Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy once said he thought two U.S. politicians were on Putin's payroll: Rohrabacher and Trump.\n\nMaybe Putin can save a few rubles now that Rohrabacher isn't returning to Congress.\n\nTrey Gowdy\n\nThere are bad people, and there are bad members of Congress. Trey Gowdy is both.\n\nGowdy has been one of the most feckless and ineffective members of Congress this country has ever seen. He was a waste of space even by his own admission, telling Vice, \"I don't have a lot to show for the last seven years.\"\n\nGowdy's time as chair of the House Oversight Committee was a series of missteps and bungled hearings.\n\nHis one claim to fame is wasting more than two years and $8 million in taxpayer funds on a failed quest to blame Hillary Clinton for the tragic deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nThe fiasco concluded soon after Clinton's epic 11-hour testimony, during which she made Gowdy and other Republicans on the panel look like fools.\n\nGowdy, who says he is retiring to go back to being an attorney, is an embarrassment to his home state of South Carolina, and Congress will be a better place the further he is from it.\n\nJeff Flake\n\nFew people are leaving Congress with less of their integrity intact than Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona.\n\nFlake was widely mocked as the leader of the Furrowed Brow Caucus: Republicans in Congress who feign concern over Trump's reprehensible words and deeds, but still wholeheartedly back the Trump agenda. Even after Flake decided not to run for re-election, he never took meaningful action to stop Trump or Trumpism.\n\nFlake's most infamous flake came when Trump nominated alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nFlake, who claimed to be moved by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's story of being assaulted by Kavanaugh in high school and by the stories of other survivors, hemmed and hawed over Kavanaugh's nomination. He even tried to make it look like he was doing something by demanding an extremely limited FBI \"investigation\" into the matter.\n\nBut in the end, Flake shrugged off survivors and gave his full support to Kavanaugh \u2014 helping Republicans put their second accused sexual predator on the Supreme Court, 27 years after Clarence Thomas.\n\nDean Heller\n\nSen. Dean Heller was relentlessly mocked over the course of the 2018 campaign as a spineless Trump lackey \u2014 mostly because he was, in fact, a spineless Trump lackey.\n\nHeller viciously betrayed Nevadans on health care, and they punished him for that betrayal in November by replacing him with Democrat Jacky Rosen.\n\nAt first, Heller publicly opposed the GOP scheme to rip health care away from millions of families and jack up health care costs for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n\nBut Heller eventually kowtowed to the will of Trump, turning his back on voters and supporting the GOP's awful plan.\n\nHeller hasn't announced his post-election plans. His moral flexibility should open plenty of unsavory doors for him \u2014 but hopefully his next job won't include the power to make life-or-death decisions for millions of Americans.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Don't be fooled by his North Korea summit. Trump is still bringing the world closer to a nuclear crisis.\n\nTwelve months ago, Donald Trump rang in the new year by reminding the world that he could, at any moment, start a nuclear war just as easily as he sends a misguided tweet. It was only the second day of 2018 when Trump bragged about the size and power of his \u201cnuclear button\u201d compared to Kim Jong Un\u2019s, raising the specter of an apocalyptic war.\n\nSince then, Donald Trump\u2019s personal relationship with the North Korean dictator has been transformed \u2014 but the threat of nuclear conflict has only grown, thanks to the failed foreign policy adventures of Trump and his war hawk advisers Mike Pompeo and John Bolton.\n\nTrump's dangerous bromance with Kim Jong Un\n\nIn 2018, Trump abandoned his earlier threats of \u201cfire and fury\u201d against the North Korean regime for handshakes and photo ops. Trump started blindly trusting Kim, even declaring, \u201cThere is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea,\u201d after his meeting with Kim in June.\n\nWhile Trump did a victory lap, however, Kim\u2019s government ramped up its production of nuclear weapons. Intelligence agencies believe North Korea is hiding at least 16 ballistic missile bases which could be used to launch ICBMs carrying nuclear bombs across the Pacific Ocean to hit targets virtually anywhere in the United States.\n\nThere has been no progress toward the disarmament Trump claims to have negotiated.\n\nYet Trump advisers like his new North Korean envoy, Stephen Biegun, keep repeating Trump\u2019s lie (or delusion) that Kim promised to give up his nukes \u2014 even though the actual text of the agreement between the two men says no such thing.\n\nTrump\u2019s newfound bromance with Kim might seem less terrifying than his previous threats to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea, but it could actually worsen the threat of a future war.\n\nTrump cannot fake disarmament forever, and North Korea has now begun threatening to resume testing nuclear weapons if it does not get sanctions relief from the U.S.\n\nIf and when Trump\u2019s diplomatic efforts with North Korea collapse, Trump may see war with his nuclear-armed opponent as the only alternative.\n\nTrump is unlikely to be dissuaded from such a dangerous conflict by his radical new national security adviser, John Bolton, who joined the administration this spring. Bolton has argued that an American first strike against North Korea would be \u201cperfectly legitimate.\u201d\n\nWalking away from a good deal in Iran\n\nSince joining the White House, John Bolton also helped Donald Trump raise the odds of a nuclear conflict in the Middle East by trashing the Iranian Nuclear Deal.\n\nBefore the deal, Iran appeared to be on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons it could use to threaten, or even attack, Israel or American forces in the Middle East.\n\nUnlike Trump\u2019s fake nuclear deal with North Korea, this one was actually working. Trump walked away from it anyway.\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan called Trump's decision both \u201cfoolish\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nNot only does killing the deal raise the possibility that Iran will restart its quest for nuclear weapons, it also undermines the administration\u2019s efforts to cut a real nuclear deal of its own with North Korea.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolton and Trump have spent the second half of 2018 threatening Iran, further increasing the odds the Iranian regime will try to secure nuclear weapons to defend itself.\n\nCourting disaster in Russia and beyond\n\nFrighteningly, the Iranian Nuclear Deal is not even the only nuclear deal Trump and Bolton managed to tear up in 2018.\n\nAt Bolton\u2019s direction, Trump also announced the United States would exit the landmark Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). The decades-old treaty, which banned nuclear missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, was designed to decrease the odds of a nuclear war breaking out in Europe.\n\nBy walking away from the INF, Trump has recklessly introduced the chance that both Russia and the U.S. could redeploy these weapons across Europe in 2019 and beyond.\n\nAnd if all of that is not enough to keep you up way past midnight this New Year's Eve, consider this: This year, the Trump administration quietly announced its intent to make it even easier for Donald Trump, possibly the most impulsive and unstable president in American history, to use nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s 2018 Nuclear Posture Review recommends the U.S. create a new class of \u201clow-yield\u201d nuclear weapons. The smaller nuclear weapons it proposes could be used in a wider range of conflicts than the current arsenal.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon's 2018 report, our existing nuclear bombs are too big and destructive to be used in a conflict against Russia or China without immediately triggering global nuclear war.\n\nBut that's been the whole point of U.S. nuclear policy before Trump: Making the consequences of using nuclear weapons so terrible that no country would dare to use them in a first strike, or ever. It's not actually a good thing to make it easier for a president to decide to use the most destructive weapons ever created.\n\nNobody actually knows how Russia or China would react to a \"small\" nuke landing at their doorstep. But it's really not worth finding out.\n\nTaken together, Trump\u2019s 2018 foreign policy looks like it could kick off the type of destructive worldwide conflict that was unthinkable prior to his presidency.\n\nThat\u2019s the bad news, but there is a silver lining: Democrats in the House are ready to put the brakes on Trump\u2019s out-of-control nuclear policy when they take control next month. They plan to block funding for Trump's so-called mini-nukes, and could even introduce reforms that would block any president from using nuclear weapons without congressional authorization.\n\nDonald Trump spent 2018 making the world a more dangerous place. In 2019, Democrats have the chance to make it safe again.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "These three new members of Congress, and two returning ones, will push for a progressive legislative agenda while holding Trump and his cronies accountable.\n\nCongress is going to look very different in 2019, starting when Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi regains control of the House of Representatives. While most eyes will be on her, several other members of Congress \u2014 both new and returning \u2014 will step up and become leaders in their own right. Here are five we are keeping an eye on.\n\nLucy McBath\n\nA newly elected congresswoman from Georgia, Lucy McBath ran on a progressive platform centered on tackling the issue of gun safety. Six years ago, McBath lost her son due to gun violence. Using his death as a catalyst to run for office, she ousted an NRA-backed Trump lackey to win her seat, becoming only the third Black woman to represent Georgia in Congress.\n\nDemocrats have pledged to fight for better gun safety legislation, and you can bet that McBath will be front and center during those debates, working to ensure no other mothers face the same kind of tragedy she was forced to endure.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nA 29-year-old former bartender, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rocked the political world when she defeated Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in a June primary. She then cruised to victory in a safe blue seat and has used her new-found celebrity status to make deep blue waves in D.C.\n\nHer savvy and witty use of social media is a breath of fresh air and authenticity in a town filled with wordy press releases. In addition to hammering conservatives online, Ocasio-Cortez has spent her time building a coalition around a Green New Deal focused on the intersection of the environment and the economy. Already a proven leader, and someone often identified by only her initials, AOC will be a name to watch.\n\nKatie Hill\n\nKatie Hill ran as an unabashed millennial in a district just north of Los Angeles, ousting loyal Trump cheerleader Rep. Steve Knight. Hill gained national recognition by allowing HBO's \"Vice News\" to film her campaign, and quickly became one of the Democrats' top fundraisers of the cycle. In the last quarterly filing of the campaign, Hill \u2014 who had never run for public office \u2014 raised an eye-popping $3.8 million.\n\nA rising star, Hill was tapped to deliver the Democratic weekly address even before becoming sworn-in as a new member. Hill was also elected to a leadership position by the Democratic freshman class, becoming one of two freshman caucus representatives. She is one of seven California Democrats who ousted a Republican, and she is definitely a name to watch.\n\nElijah Cummings\n\nMaryland's Rep. Elijah Cummings is set to regain his position atop the powerful Oversight Committee next Congress, which should keep Trump and all his cronies up at night. Wielding significant subpoena power, Cummings will lead a number of investigations into wrongdoing by the Trump administration. The Washington Post names but a few: \"hush money paid to a porn star on Trump\u2019s behalf, citizenship questions on the census, security clearances revoked from the president's critics, and dozens of other oh-yeah-remember-thats that slipped out of the churning news cycle unanswered.\"\n\nCummings has publicly stated his desire to \"do anything and everything in my power\" to ensure special counsel Robert Mueller's findings are made public.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post soon after the 2018 midterms, Cummings said \"President Trump has not been held accountable. We want to figure out if the president is acting in the interests of the American people or in his own financial interest.\"\n\n\"I would consider it legislative malpractice not to do it,\" he added.\n\nAdam Schiff\n\nCalifornia's Rep. Adam Schiff is preparing to take over as chair of the Intelligence Committee, replacing Trump stooge Rep. Devin Nunes. While Trump's ties to Russia will be high on Schiff's agenda, it will not be the only thing. Vox notes that issues surrounding Saudi Arabia and North Korea are also a topic of interest for Schiff.\n\nOn Saudi Arabia, information around the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi will be a pressing issue, as well as the real reasons Trump refuses to lay blame at the feet of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nWithout a lapdog leading the committee, Trump and his administration should be prepared to face tough, fair investigations by Schiff, who will not be kowtowed by Trump's juvenile name-calling.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "As the DOJ's Russia probe ramped up in 2018, Trump's authoritarian impulses reached alarming new levels \u2014 and the GOP was there to help every step of the way.\n\nTrump has been at war with our democratic institutions since the day he took office. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has borne the brunt of many of his most vicious attacks, in large part because the department is in charge of overseeing the Russia probe that he so desperately wants to end.\n\nAs the investigation picked up steam in 2018, Trump's assault on the rule of law reached alarming new levels, imperiling the independence of the DOJ and eroding the very principles upon which our democracy rests.\n\nOf course, Trump didn't do this alone \u2014 he had plenty of help from his Republican allies, who were more than happy to assist him as he tore at the fabric of one of our most critical democratic institutions.\n\nWith 2018 coming to an end, here's a look back at 13 of the most egregious ways Trump and his GOP accomplices weaponized the DOJ for political purposes.\n\n1. When Trump ordered the White House counsel to intervene and stop Sessions' recusal\n\nIn the first week of 2018, it was revealed that Trump had ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to stop then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself in the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nMcGahn carried out Trump's orders and attempted, unsuccessfully, to convince Sessions not to recuse himself from the probe. When McGahn's efforts failed, Trump was so furious that he \"erupted in anger in front of numerous White House officials, saying he needed his attorney general to protect him,\" according to the New York Times, which first reported on the incident.\n\nSessions' recusal from the probe resulted in the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is now leading the Russia investigation. Trump had reportedly expected Sessions to \"safeguard him\" \u2014 raising the question of what he felt he needed to be protected from. After all, if Trump's claims of no wrongdoing are true, then why would he need Sessions to protect him?\n\nTrump's attempt to stop Sessions from recusing himself is one of several previously unreported incidents that special counsel Mueller is looking at as he investigates whether Trump engaged in obstruction of justice.\n\n2. When the DOJ was used to investigate Trump's pet conspiracy theory\n\nAt the behest of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the DOJ announced in September that it would use taxpayer dollars to investigate Trump's disproven conspiracy theory alleging that conservatives are being censored by social media companies.\n\nTrump adopted this conspiracy from the rantings of his supporter, ally, and favorite conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, along with other unreliable sources in the conservative media. Among other things, Trump has claimed Twitter is \"shadowbanning\" individuals on the right. They aren't. He also alleged that Google is skewing its results to hurt Trump. They aren't either.\n\nAt the time of the announcement, Trump had been raging against Sessions, so the move was seen by many as a way for Sessions to use the DOJ to get back in the good graces of Trump.\n\n3. When Trump demanded that the DOJ investigate the Obama administration\n\nIn May, coinciding with the anniversary of the appointment of special counsel Mueller, Trump launched a new attack against the Russia investigation, ordering the DOJ to investigate the Obama administration based on a disproven conspiracy theory alleging that Obama-era officials had spied on the Trump campaign.\n\n\"I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes \u2013 and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!\" Trump wrote in a Twitter rant.\n\nTrump's chilling demand came after he threatened several weeks earlier to use \"the powers of the presidency\" to \"get involved\" with the DOJ's investigations \u2014 a clear abuse of power that eroded the boundary between the White House and the supposedly independent DOJ.\n\n4. When Trump forced the DOJ to show the evidence they have against him\n\nAlso in May, Trump ordered officials from the White House to set up a meeting with the DOJ, the FBI, and top intelligence officials to review highly classified information gathered as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian interference and coordination with the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump is among those being investigated, as are many of his campaign aides and advisers. Clearly, forcing the DOJ to show its hand during an ongoing investigation is a wholly inappropriate abuse of power. However, those who would hold Trump accountable \u2014 namely, the GOP-led Congress \u2014 haven't shown any interest in doing so.\n\nTrump's demand that the DOJ show classified intelligence to White House officials came as part of his deranged order to investigate the conspiracy theory he called \"Spygate.\" This was used as a pretense to allow the White House to have access to the very evidence that might be used against him or others on his team.\n\n5. When Trump and his GOP allies tried to convene a classified briefing for Republicans only\n\nIn May, Trump allies Trey Gowdy and Devin Nunes were scheduled to attend a classified briefing with DOJ officials that was described as \"unprecedented\" due to the explicitly partisan nature of the meeting. When the briefing was first arranged at the request of the White House, only Republicans were invited to attend, a move that broke with established precedent and prompted outcry from both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe partisan nature of the briefing was even more glaring given that Republicans claimed they needed to see classified intelligence from the Russia probe to carry out their oversight duty, despite failing to provide oversight for the entirety of Trump's presidency. In reality, Trump's GOP allies were demanding to see the sensitive documents to gather information that they could use to help Trump muddy the waters, cast doubt on the Russia probe, and build momentum for his \"Spygate\" conspiracy theory.\n\nThe attempt to hold a Republican-only briefing ultimately failed due to widespread outcry, but the incident demonstrated just how far Trump's accomplices were willing to go in their efforts to provide cover for him.\n\n6. When Trump's personal lawyer got caught attending a classified DOJ briefing\n\nWhen the DOJ held its classified briefing to present evidence from the Russia investigation to lawmakers in May, Trump's personal lawyer Emmet Flood \u2014 who is representing Trump in the Russia probe \u2014 was caught on camera in the hallway leaving the meeting alongside Trump's congressional allies Devin Nunes, Trey Gowdy, and Paul Ryan, as well as chief of staff John Kelly.\n\nNo one could explain why Trump's personal lawyer was in attendance at a briefing where the DOJ showed lawmakers evidence from the Russia investigation, including evidence against Trump, nor could anyone explain why a White House official was at the briefing despite assurances earlier in the week that no one from the White House would be present.\n\nAs Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro said at the time, Trump used the classified briefing to \"find out what goods the DOJ/Mueller have on him.\" In other words, Trump's lawyer got a backstage pass to a briefing in which the DOJ presented evidence it has collected on his client.\n\n7. When Trump weaponized classified intelligence from the Russia investigation\n\nIn a move described as \"stunning,\" \"unprecedented,\" and \"corrupt,\" the White House announced in September that Trump had ordered the declassification of highly sensitive materials from the Russia probe so they could be weaponized and used in the ongoing effort by Trump and his allies to undermine a national security investigation for political purposes.\n\nThe White House said in a statement that Trump had directed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Justice, and the FBI to release selective portions of the classified Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application that allowed the FBI to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. He also ordered \"all FBI reports\" prepared in connection with the FISA warrant application to be declassified and released.\n\nIn his order, Trump cherry-picked specific information to release while opting to keep much of it hidden \u2014 not out of concern for national security, but out of concern that releasing all of the information would prove that the FBI was, in fact, acting entirely appropriately when it sought a surveillance warrant on Page.\n\nIn other words, Trump used his power to demand that federal officials only release information that could be spun to prop up the false narrative he and his allies have been peddling for well over a year, while refusing to release any information that might reveal the truth.\n\n8. When Trump threatened to weaponize more Russia documents to shield himself\n\nIn November, not long after Democrats won back the majority in the House of Representatives, Trump threatened to weaponize more sensitive Russia-related documents in an attempt to shield himself from the investigations that the new Democratic-led House committees have promised to launch.\n\nTrump quite obviously fears what these investigations may uncover \u2014 so he responded by threatening to declassify sensitive intelligence and wield it as a weapon against the new Democratic majority in a last-ditch effort to protect himself.\n\nIn case there were any doubts about his motivation, Trump admitted that he is waiting to declassify certain documents related to the Russia investigation so he can use them as leverage against Democrats at a time of his choosing.\n\n\"It's much more powerful if I do it then, because if we had done it already, it would already be yesterday's news,\" Trump said, referring to applications for surveillance warrants and other sensitive documents related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. \"I'm a counter-puncher and I will hit them so hard they'd never been hit like that.\"\n\nHis threat to put national security at risk to protect himself came just weeks after he pledged to take a \"warlike posture\" if Democrats tried to carry out their constitutional oversight duty by investigating him or his administration.\n\n9. When Trump ousted Sessions and appointed a loyalist as acting attorney general\n\nAlso in November, just days after Democrats scored sweeping victories in the House of Representatives and local elections across the country, Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appointed loyalist Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nTypically, the deputy attorney general would fill that position \u2014 but Trump bypassed Rod Rosenstein and tapped Whitaker for the spot instead. In doing so, Trump installed someone to lead the Russia investigation who had already made it clear that he is hostile to the Russia investigation.\n\nAmong other things, Whitaker has said he believes Mueller crossed a red line when he started looking at Trump's financial history and business dealings. He has also advocated for defunding the probe or placing severe limits on Mueller's authority to stop him from conducting a thorough investigation.\n\nNaturally, these comments made Whitaker a perfect candidate in Trump's eyes. Unfortunately for Trump, ousting his attorney general and putting a loyalist in his place to undermine the Russia probe may have actually strengthened the obstruction case against him.\n\n10. When a GOP senator said Trump 'has the right' to threaten DOJ officials\n\nIn April, Trump apologist Orrin Hatch actually said that Trump \"has the right\" to threaten and intimidate DOJ officials who are investigating him.\n\nHatch's comments came in response to a reporter's questions about why Republicans were refusing to pass legislation to protect special counsel Mueller's job. Asked if he supports such legislation, Hatch said he didn't think it was necessary. The reporter followed up by asking if Hatch thought it was \"appropriate for the president to threaten or intimidate officials\u2026 at the Department of Justice?\"\n\n\"I think he has the right to if he wants to,\" Hatch replied.\n\nThe notion that Trump has the right to threaten officials who are investigating him would be absurd under any circumstances, but is even more outlandish given that Trump has shown he is willing to act on those threats in an effort to obstruct the Russia investigation. Among other things, he has committed multiple firings, and has even tried to fire Mueller on at least two separate occasions, all to protect himself.\n\nRepublicans like Hatch are supposed to be a check on Trump's power, but instead they have consistently enabled his many abuses of power.\n\n11. When Trump ordered the FBI to reveal the identity of a confidential informant\n\nIn May, Trump and his Republican allies in Congress issued a reckless demand for the FBI to expose the identity of a confidential informant who reportedly aided the FBI as it began its Russia investigation and continued to assist investigators after the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller in May 2017.\n\nTrump and his allies apparently believed that outing the source could help them in their quest to undermine the Russia probe and ultimately lay the groundwork for firing special counsel Mueller. But senior intelligence officials, including Trump's own handpicked FBI director, warned that exposing the identity of a confidential informant would not only imperil that person and the people around them, but also the American public.\n\nThe move was so dangerous that the FBI was forced to take the extraordinary step of putting in place emergency security measures to protect the safety of the informant and their associates in case their identity became known. But to Trump, the safety of FBI sources and the American public take a backseat to his own need for protection \u2014 from the rule of law.\n\n12. When Trump tried to get the DOJ to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey\n\nIn November, a bombshell report came out describing how Trump had tried to get the DOJ to prosecute two of his rivals, Hillary Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nTrump reportedly told White House counsel Don McGahn earlier in the year that he wanted to order the DOJ to pursue charges against both Comey and Clinton. It's not clear what he wanted to prosecute them for, but McGahn and other White House lawyers were so alarmed that they wrote a memo outlining Trump\u2019s authorities as president and warning him that such a move could lead to impeachment.\n\nUpon hearing news of Trump's attempt to weaponize the DOJ against his political enemies, Nixon-era White House counsel John Dean warned, \"This is what an autocrat does.\"\n\n13. When Trump tried to force the DOJ to investigate editorials he doesn't like\n\nIn September, just after an official from the Trump administration published an anonymous editorial in The New York Times accusing Trump of acting \"in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic,\" Trump responded by trying to force the DOJ to open up an investigation to determine the identity of the anonymous author.\n\nTrump said The New York Times' decision to publish the op-ed from a supposed senior White House official was \"virtually, you know, you could call it treason.\" He added that he was looking at taking legal action and said he wanted then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the identity of the person \"because I really believe it is national security.\"\n\nTrump's ridiculous plot to get the DOJ to investigate editorials he doesn't like came after press secretary Sarah Sanders' call for Trump supporters to dial up the Times and demand \"to know who this gutless loser is\" failed to yield any results.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Secretary Jim Mattis will leave the administration at the end of February 2019.\n\nAnother one of Trump's Cabinet secretaries is leaving, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' letter of resignation makes clear he has little respect for Trump's bungling of world affairs.\n\nTrump's abrupt announcement this week that he is withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria may have been the final straw for Mattis. Trump ignored Mattis' advice on the subject, according to current and former U.S. officials who spoke to the Washington Post. Mattis was in favor of continuing America's presence in the region, but Trump ultimately made a decision that instead pleased Russia.\n\nMattis wrote to Trump saying Trump needed someone \"whose views are better aligned with yours\" on a wide variety of key issues.\n\nThe letter of resignation was a study in contrasts.\n\n\"One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,\" Mattis wrote. \"While the U.S. remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.\"\n\nContrary to Mattis' view, Trump has spent the past two years insulting America's traditional allies at every turn. Trump spurned allies at the G7 conference and regularly threatens America's longstanding NATO agreements.\n\nCiting China and Russia as examples of countries that \"want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model,\" Mattis wrote, \"I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.\"\n\nNot Trump, though. When Russian dictator Vladimir Putin attacks the very fabric of democracy, Trump is too servile to stand up to him. And when Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman murders a Washington Post journalist, Trump is too busy helping the regime cover it up rather than seek justice.\n\nThen Mattis went for the gut punch.\n\nMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign acts and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances. Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\n\nMattis seems to have had enough of Trump's incessant alienation of allies and coddling of dictators. Trump's impulsive decision to abandon allies in Syria without warning looks to be the final insult, leading Mattis to be yet one more high-ranking official to leave Trump's disaster of an administration.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump used 'charity' money to purchase portraits of himself. Now he has to sell them for thousands less.\n\nTrump will have to get rid of two paintings of himself that were acquired using money from his corrupt foundation \u2014 at a loss of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe sale is part of the fallout from the ongoing lawsuit against the Trump Foundation by New York's Attorney General for misuse of \"charity\" funds. The agreement with the attorney general's office says that Trump must sell two large portraits of himself that he spent $30,000 of foundation money on. The paintings are now valued at thousands of dollars less than what he paid for them.\n\nOne painting was a six-foot-tall portrait of Trump, a \"speed painting\" by artist Michael Israel painted in under six minutes during an event at Mar-a-Lago. The other painting is a four-foot-tall portrait of Trump's face that the Washington Post described as a \"a younger-looking, mid-'90s Trump, painted in acrylic on top of an old architectural drawing.\"\n\nTrump also spent $12,000 of money ostensibly donated for charity on a Denver Broncos helmet signed by former quarterback Tim Tebow.\n\nTake together, all three items have been valued at $975 on a recent IRS filing, a drop in value of $41,025.\n\nTrump is being forced to shut down the Trump Foundation, which New York Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood described as being part of \"a shocking pattern of illegality.\" Underwood said Trump and his foundation engaged in \"unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more.\"\n\nThe foundation, she said, was \"little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump\u2019s business and political interests.\"\n\nAlong with Trump, his three eldest children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump \u2014 are also defendants in the ongoing lawsuit.\n\nExpenditures uncovered by the Washington Post reporters show that Trump may have even used the charity to pay the $7 fee to enroll his son in Boy Scouts.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, as Trump and his allies at Fox News were attacking the Clinton Foundation \u2014 a real charity that is still operating \u2014 President Barack Obama mocked Trump's vainglorious painting.\n\n\"You want to debate foundations and charities?\" Obama said, \"One candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world. The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself.\"\n\nDuring the final presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said, \"I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six-foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing.\"\n\nThe agreement with the attorney general's office shows just how accurate those assessments were at the time they were made.\n\nTrump being forced to sell the paintings of himself that he purchased via duplicitous financing is just a microcosm of his corrupt approach to business and politics.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's racist border stunt means military families will be separated for Thanksgiving.\n\nTrump's desire to separate families continues, this time forcing members of the military to miss Thanksgiving with their families in order to shovel horse manure miles away from the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBefore the 2018 midterm election, Trump repeatedly attacked a group of refugees slowly making their way through Mexico, many of whom aim to seek asylum in the U.S. when they eventually arrive at the border.\n\nTrump did everything he could to give the impression that this group was a threat, seemingly lacking faith in America's ability to deal with impoverished refugees in a compassionate and strong manner. He even decided to spend hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to send thousands of troops to the border.\n\nThose troops, sent away from their families, are now shoveling horse manure and performing menial tasks, far away from the actual border.\n\n\"In reality, the hundreds of troops deployed in southern Arizona are keeping up the rear, so to speak; in one assignment, soldiers are actually feeding and shoveling out manure from the stalls of the Border Patrol's horses,\" reports Politico.\n\nThe Trump administration is \"on track\" to send thousands of soldiers to the border, and keep them there through Dec. 15, according to the Hill.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) lamented that these members of the military will now miss Thanksgiving dinner with their families, thanks to Trump.\n\n\"Deploying troops to our own border for no national security reason is one of the biggest scandals of this Presidency,\" Schatz said. \"These dedicated, skilled, highly trained men and women will likely miss Thanksgiving w family, are near American cities but eating MREs. Let them go home.\"\n\nSchatz is not alone in his outrage.\n\n\"This is a stunt, and we know it is a stunt because no one is talking about it, post election,\" said Will Fischer, director of government relations for Vote Vets, said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, for our troops, they have to pay the price because the administration wanted to gin up election fears.\"\n\nFischer continued, \"Senator Schatz is right. It is a disgrace, and we ought to stop blowing millions of dollars, and keeping these troops away from their families for no good reason.\"\n\nTrump is no stranger to keeping families separated for political reasons. Over the summer, he ripped thousands of immigrant children away from their families in a cruel ploy to deter immigration and gin up his base. The Trump administration was willing to use the pain and suffering of thousands of families as a political bargaining chip to build a wall... a wall Trump once claimed Mexico would pay for.\n\nIt seems Trump doesn't care who he hurts in his quest for personal political gain, whether it's innocent children or troops forced to spend Thanksgiving without the comforts of home, friends and family.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump and Trumpism seem to hold a particular appeal for men who secretly worry that they aren't manly enough.\n\nOne of Trump's most consistent qualities is his boorish machismo. He always needs to prove that he's the biggest, the toughest, the best \u2014 in other words, the manliest. He's not at all subtle about it, either; this is the guy who once literally bragged about his penis size on a presidential debate stage.\n\nUnsurprisingly, however, men who try this hard to be manly are often the least secure in their manhood \u2014 and new research suggests that these ultra-insecure men are exactly the ones most drawn to Trump and Trumpism.\n\nTwo researchers at New York University, social psychologist Eric Knowles and psychology doctoral student Sarah DiMuccio, wrote for the Washington Post about the data they gathered showing that \"fragile masculinity\" correlates with support for Trump.\n\nFragile masculinity, they explain, is what happens when \"an unforgiving standard of maleness makes some men worry that they're falling short.\" These men worry so much about losing their status as \"real men\" in society that they overcompensate with stereotypically masculine behavior and attitudes, and shun anything even remotely feminine.\n\nMeasuring how many men actually feel this way is a bit tricky. Since fragile masculinity is all about putting on a show for the world and refusing to admit your own vulnerabilities, the researchers couldn't exactly get this information by asking men about it in a questionnaire and expecting them to be truthful.\n\nSo they turned to the one place where people can be most honest about their deepest fears and desires: Google search results.\n\nThe researchers came up with a list of search topics related to insecurity about living up to the ideals of manhood \u2014 the phrase \"how to get girls,\" and search terms related to erectile dysfunction, hair loss, penis enlargement, penis size, steroids, testosterone, and Viagra.\n\nHaving searched for these things doesn't necessarily mean you're insecure about your manhood, and being insecure about your manhood doesn't necessarily mean you're all about MAGA.\n\nNonetheless, these search terms came up more frequently in areas where Trump won in 2016, even when the researchers controlled for other demographic factors.\n\nFragile masculinity was also higher in areas where Republican House candidates defeated Democrats in the 2018 midterms.\n\nBut interestingly, this is a recent development. Fragile masculinity wasn't correlated with support for Mitt Romney in 2012 or John McCain in 2008, and it didn't affect voting patterns in congressional races in either 2014 or 2016.\n\nSo fragile masculinity isn't inherently a Republican thing; it's a Trump thing. But Trump has now so completely dominated the Republican Party that it has become a Republican thing.\n\nThis data also tracks with other research we have on the effects of masculinity and sexism on politics.\n\nSupport for Trump, in particular, was also found to be connected to \"hostile sexism.\" Hostile sexism is exactly what it sounds like: a type of sexism that is overtly hostile to women, or at least to women who don't conform to the gender norms you expect. (Hostile sexism is the bad cop to the good cop of \"benevolent sexism\" \u2014 putting women on a pedestal, as long as they conform to the gender norms you expect.)\n\nBoth fragile masculinity and hostile sexism involve being so obsessed with traditional gender norms that it becomes harmful \u2014 to yourself, to others, or to both yourself and others.\n\nAnd it's just one of many reasons that Trumpism is so toxic and destructive.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Footage shows children being herded into a vacant building with no kitchen and only a few toilets, outfitted with dark windows, new security cameras, and extra locks on the doors.\n\nA U.S. defense contractor has been quietly detaining immigrant children in an unlicensed, vacant office building in Arizona, despite claiming publicly that it does not operate any housing facilities for minors.\n\nIn video footage shot by a neighbor and obtained by the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR), children can be seen being led out of vans and into the facility located in Phoenix, Arizona. One child was so young she was carried into the building.\n\nThe footage is from early June, just a few weeks after White House chief of staff John Kelly said that children separated from their parents and taken into government custody as part of Trump's \"zero tolerance\" approach to prosecuting unauthorized border crossings would be \"put into foster care or whatever.\"\n\nThe empty building, which has no kitchen and only a few toilets, apparently falls into the category of \"whatever.\"\n\nAccording to the CIR, the building is not licensed under Arizona state law to hold children. It is also not listed among shelters operated through the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), nor on the state child care licensing website. Operating a child care facility without a license is a misdemeanor in Arizona.\n\nThe vacant office building was leased in March by MVM Inc., a private defense contractor that has received government contracts worth nearly $250 million to transport immigrant children since 2014, the CIR reported.\n\nWhen reporters questioned MVM about the facility, the contractor responded at first by referring them to a statement on its website saying that it does not \"operate shelters or any other type of housing for minors.\"\n\nBut after learning about the video footage, a spokesperson for MVM said the building \"is not a shelter or a child care facility. \u2026 It\u2019s a temporary holding place\" where children wait to be transported to detention centers in other locations.\n\nThe spokesperson said the facility is meant to hold children for only a few hours, but could not say how long the kids actually ended up staying there.\n\nReporters who gained access to the building last week found inflatable mattresses, bottles of baby shampoo, and medication schedules \u2014 indicating that children who were brought to the facility \"could have been held there for an extended period,\" according to the CIR.\n\nNeighbors also reported seeing pallets of food and water delivered to the building, which was equipped with new security cameras, extra locks on the doors, and a paper shredder bin right outside one of the doors.\n\nLianna Dunlap, who lives next door to the building, said she became uneasy after seeing \"vanloads of dark-haired kids speaking Spanish being ushered out of van\" for the second day in a row.\n\n\"I was like, 'OK, they\u2019re definitely doing something they shouldn\u2019t be doing,'\" Dunlap told the CIR. \"It looked very secretive.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s been times where I drive by and I just start crying because, you know, it\u2019s right behind my house,\" Dunlap said. \"I don\u2019t know and I think that\u2019s the worst part \u2014 not knowing what\u2019s actually going on in there and just hoping that they\u2019re OK.\"\n\nDunlap said she didn't see any children leave the building until nearly three weeks after she watched them arrive. When she tried to record footage of the kids leaving, workers reportedly blocked her view with vehicles. Another neighbor said she hadn't seen any children being brought outside to play after they entered the facility.\n\nWhen neighbors tried to ask questions of the workers, they were met with silence or perfunctory answers.\n\nA statement on MVM's website says the company has \"tremendous empathy for the families and children\" who have been forcibly separated under the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy.\n\nIt also has a monetary interest in them.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the Daily Beast, MVM was awarded an $8 million five-year contract in September 2017 to \"provide assistance\" in detention centers for unaccompanied children. The company also has contracts with other government agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThis latest revelation is just one in a series of disturbing reports detailing the inhumane treatment of immigrant children by the Trump administration.\n\nIn one recent investigation, the CIR uncovered evidence that the government is sending children to facilities with histories of neglect and child abuse, including physical and sexual assault. According to the report, nearly half of the $3.4 billion the U.S. government has paid to facilities to house and supervise immigrant children in the last four years went to homes with serious allegations of mistreating children.\n\nAnother CIR investigation found that at least one facility contracted by the government to house immigrant children had engaged in a practice of forcibly injecting children with powerful psychiatric drugs in an effort to subdue them.\n\nThe Trump administration's policy of tearing families apart has drawn sharp criticism from international bodies like the United Nations, which warned last month that the practice of detaining children \"may amount to torture.\"\n\nMost Americans are similarly appalled by what they're seeing \u2014 and as this new report suggests, there may be even more reason to be concerned about what we're not seeing.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Baby jails, Brett Kavanaugh, and chemical-weapon attacks on toddlers were some of the lowest points in modern U.S. history \u2014 all brought to us by Trump in 2018.\n\nIn his first inaugural address, President Abraham Lincoln appealed to the \"better angels of our nature\" in hopes of healing a divided country.\n\nIn 2018, Trump made clear that \"better angels\" would have no influence over his administration, opting instead for cruelty, bigotry, and reveling in the most lowly, base, and repulsive instincts humanity has to offer. The following five events horrified the nation, cementing Trump's legacy as one of the worst to hold his office in U.S. history.\n\nBaby jails\n\nTrump's antipathy toward immigrants was made clear during the unconscionable \"zero tolerance\" family separation policy brought to attention during the spring and summer of 2018. The revelation that the Trump administration was forced to construct \"tender age facilities,\" better known as baby jails, led to national and international condemnation.\n\nIn total, the Trump administration ripped more than 2,600 children away from their families. Some children were so young they were still breastfeeding, and at least one toddler died shortly after being released from federal custody.\n\nDifferent reasons were given for the policy, including using the pain of families as a deterrent, or using it as leverage to negotiate funding for Trump's border wall. In the end, it has created one of the darkest periods in American history, and Trump is looking for ways to continue implementing it.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh nomination\n\nWhen Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy resigned, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the position. After he was nominated, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford came forward, explaining how a drunk Kavanaugh attempted to rape her at a high school party in the 1980s. The credible allegation culminated in a widely watched hearing, where Ford detailed her experience, followed by an unhinged, belligerent Kavanaugh who ranted and screamed throughout his testimony.\n\nDespite the grotesquely unprofessional behavior exhibited by Kavanaugh, as well as the fact that other women came forward with accusations, Trump steadfastly remained supportive of Kavanaugh's nomination, refusing to let allegations of attempted rape impede his choice for the Supreme Court.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate, including a spineless, sniveling Jeff Flake, voted in favor of Kavanaugh, sending a second accused sexual predator to sit on the highest court in the land. After the vote, Trump stooped lower yet again, repeatedly mocking Ford in front of his rallies.\n\nCover-up of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nTrump's animosity toward journalists and the free press is encapsulated in his callous, cowardly response to the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As the world was reeling from the murder \u2014 ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to U.S. intelligence \u2014 Trump was celebrating violence against reporters.\n\nAt a rally for Montana Republicans, Trump took great pleasure in acting out Rep. Greg Gianforte's infamous \"body slam\" attack on Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs. Trump praised Gianforte for his violent assault, calling him a \"great guy\" and a \"tough cookie.\" Trump even re-enacted the body slam on stage and told the cheering crowd, \"Any guy that can do a body slam, he\u2019s my kind of \u2026 he\u2019s my guy.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Trump endorsed violence against reporters, but it was particularly disgraceful in the context of the recent murder of a journalist. Meanwhile, Trump attempted to sow doubt about who was responsible for Khashoggi's murder and to carry water for the Saudi regime.\n\nIn a true low point, Trump put his desire for cheap oil above the most basic human rights of people.\n\nTrump appeases Putin at press conference\n\nIn what former former CIA Director John Brennan described as \"nothing short of treasonous,\" Trump shocked the world with his reckless appeasement of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin at a July 2018 press conference. On foreign soil and in front of the entire world, Trump repeatedly praised Russia while trashing U.S. intelligence agencies investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\"I have great confidence in my intelligence people. But I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,\" Trump said while standing beside Putin.\n\nRussia attacked the very fabric of American democracy, and Trump was too servile and spineless to confront a foreign adversary. In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton warned that Trump would be Putin's puppet. In 2018, Trump betrayed U.S. intelligence agencies and proved her right.\n\nGassing toddlers\n\nIn what might be a new low, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement condemning Trump's use of chemical weapons against \"infants and toddlers in diapers.\"\n\nThe incident happened on the U.S.-Mexico border, where U.S. border patrol agents fired tear gas at immigrants \u2014 including families with small children \u2014 on the Mexico side of the border. The incident, met with gleeful cheers within the Trump administration, highlighted the blithe cruelty toward immigrants, beginning with Trump and trickling down throughout his entire administration.\n\nEvery time America thinks that Trump cannot possibly go any lower, he relentlessly shows us that there is no dark depth to which he will not sink. The 2018 midterms showed voters are tired of complicit Republicans aiding and abetting Trump's worst impulses, and a new Democratic majority in the House will seek to both reign in the damage and begin to repair the pillars of democracy left crumbling by Republicans.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Many questions remain unanswered, and investigators are reportedly still looking at a number of potential crimes involving Trump, his associates, and Russian officials. These areas of inquiry include, but are not at all limited to:\n\nRoger Stone: Mueller's team has interviewed many close associates of longtime trump ally Roger Stone, with a particular focus on his communications with Guccifer 2.0 (a Russian intelligence officer) and Julian Assange/WikiLeaks. The July 2018 indictment handed down by the Department of Justice actually cited Stone's messages to Guccifer 2.0, though it doesn't specifically name Stone.

Some of the actions being investigated include any attempts by Trump to pressure Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, his decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 as well as potential efforts to pressure Comey into backing off the investigation, his involvement in crafting a misleading public statement about the Trump Tower meeting, and even his tweets.\n\nBy all indications, Mueller and his team have slowly and methodically worked through the evidence. While the investigation has already led to multiple indictments, plea deals, and cooperating witnesses, no one but Mueller knows what 2019 may bring.\n\nThis article is an update to an Aug. 24 article written by Caroline Orr.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump doesn't like free speech, especially speech and reporting that expose him for what he is. So he attacked it.\n\nEven before he won the election in 2016, Trump had fantasized for years about attacking the free press and using power to limit the First Amendment.\n\nIn his second year in the White House, he indulged those impulses and attempted to bully the press as they continued to uncover the corruption, bigotry, and incompetence of his administration.\n\nAfter Trump described countries like Haiti with large black populations as \"shitholes\" in January 2018, he said he instead wanted immigrants from majority white nations like Norway. CNN reporter Jim Acosta asked Trump if this meant he only wanted white immigrants \u2014 a perfectly legitimate question after his comments. Instead of defending himself, Trump had Acosta kicked out of the Oval Office.\n\nAppearing alongside leaders of several Baltic states in April, Trump advised them to avoid calling on American reporters. Instead he said, \"Pick a reporter, please. You can pick a reporter \u2014 a Baltic reporter, ideally. Real news, not fake news.\" Instead of championing American journalism on the world stage, he chose to denigrate it.\n\nUnder orders from Trump administration, the National Park Service submitted a proposal in October that would close off nearly 80 percent of the area directly in front of the White House from peaceful protests. The area has been the site of many protests against Trump's abuses since he took over, and would eliminate much of a venue that has been used to expose him.\n\nCNN reporter Abby Phillips was directly attacked by Trump in November, when he bellowed at the woman that she \"asks a lot of stupid questions.\" Phillips was asking an honest question about Trump's decision to put in place an attorney general that could obstruct special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of his campaign's ties to Russia.\n\nTrump's opposition to CNN's reporters went all the way to court in November, when he banned Jim Acosta from the White House and revoked his press pass. Often flustered by Acosta's aggressive questioning, the Trump team made up an allegation that Acosta had physically assaulted an aide. Video showed the claim to be false. A judge appointed by Trump gave him a loss in court in the first round of negotiations, ordering that Acosta have his pass returned.\n\nThe hostile attitude against journalists permeates the Trump orbit, and like their leader, Trump's underlings have attacked the press too. Radio One reporter April Ryan was described as \"Miss Piggy\" by Lynne Patton, an official who was installed at the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Department by Trump. Ryan, who is black, has been repeatedly attacked by Trump underlings for legitimate questions and also came under fire by Fox News. The Fox attack helped to provoke death threats against Ryan.\n\nTrump can't handle reporters telling the world about what he has said, done, and plans to do. When they cover him aggressively, he whines and calls it \"fake news.\" He is an authoritarian who identifies more with a dictatorial approach than a traditionally American democratic stance on free speech and a free press.\n\nBut, as with many of his plans, Trump has failed, and must continue to do his job answering to the free press.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Throughout 2018, Trump bumbled about the global stage, never missing a chance to embarrass himself and the United States.\n\nAs Trump tramped around the globe in 2018, the world watched in both amusement and alarm at his childlike tantrums, flat-out lies, and general ineptitude. In the end, global opinion of America plummeted, which is what you would expect with the laughing stock who occupies the Oval Office.\n\nThe year began on a low note, with 11 countries coming to a trade agreement without the United States. Rather than try to influence the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trump isolated himself and the United States, withdrawing from all negotiations. In the end, Australia, Japan, Canada, and several others forged ahead, leaving America behind.\n\nOver the summer, Trump's humiliations came fast and furious. World leaders ridiculed Trump's child-like tantrum at the end of the G-7 Summit in Canada after Trump withdrew from the group's agreement via Twitter. One senior official called Trump \"a pathetic little man-child.\"\n\nImmediately after the G-7, Trump flew to Singapore for his much-ballyhooed meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un. While there, Trump saluted a North Korean general, a severe breach of protocol.\n\n\"It was an inappropriate thing for him to do from a protocol perspective, but now he\u2019s played right into the North's propaganda about their legitimacy on the world stage,\" said retired Rear Admiral John Kirby, a military analyst with CNN.\n\nDespite Trump's boasts of success, North Korea humiliated him by continuing to produce fuel needed for its nuclear weapon arsenal. In November, satellite images also revealed 16 hidden ballistic missile bases, including one within 80 miles of U.S. soldiers stationed in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nFrom one dictator to another, Trump scraped and bowed before Russian leader Vladimir Putin during an embarrassing July press conference. In front of the entire world, Trump insulted the U.S. investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, saying he believed Putin's denial over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nThe press conference was so bad that former CIA Director John Brennan called it \"treasonous\" and said Trump's entire national security team should resign in protest. Even Fox News slammed Trump for refusing to stand up to Putin.\n\nA few months later, diplomats from around the globe broke out in laughter at Trump's speech before the United Nations General Assembly. The laughter came as Trump began bragging about accomplishing \"more than almost any administration in the history of our country,\" during his first two years. Even diplomats could not hold it together, laughing right in Trump's face.\n\nTrump not only embarrassed himself with his missteps and bungling of foreign policy, but he diminished America's standing on the global stage. An October Pew survey of global opinions showed 43 percent of those surveyed said they have an unfavorable view of the U.S., while 50 percent have a favorable view. America never had such low numbers during President Obama's tenure.\n\nFor Trump, 2018 brought a string of embarrassments \u2014 and 2019 is not looking like it will be any better.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Fox News loves Trump, constantly promoting his agenda and excusing his bad behavior. But sometimes even Fox just can't handle him.\n\nFox News is a right-wing propaganda network dedicated to propping up Trump and his fellow Republicans while attacking and smearing Democrats.\n\nBut sometimes the shills at Fox News have seen behavior and actions from Trump that are so far beyond the pale that the network is forced to admit he's gone over the line.\n\n1. In March, Trump gave a speech that was supposed to be about infrastructure. But, as so often happens, the speech devolved into a 50-minute long, garbled mess \u2014 including yet another rant about the 2016 election. So the cable news networks cut away from the train wreck. Even Fox.\n\n2. Trump has repeatedly attacked Amazon, whose founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, which has published extensive reporting on Trump's seemingly endless corruption. When Trump lied and claimed that Amazon was taking advantage of the Postal Service \u2014 and somehow taxpayers were footing the bill \u2014 Fox anchor Shepard Smith had to explain all the ways Trump was wrong.\n\n\"It is somewhat hard to imagine that the president doesn\u2019t realize that tax dollars do not go to the post office,\" Smith said.\n\n\"It\u2019s not like someone has said \u2018We\u2019re losing tax dollars,'\" he continued. \"No one\u2019s ever said this. That\u2019s not a thing.\u201d\n\n3. Trump became increasingly agitated and ugly during the confirmation hearing of his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the fall. When Dr. Christine Blasey Ford came forward with credible allegations that Kavanaugh had tried to rape her when they were both in high school, Trump used one of his rallies to viciously mock her heartbreaking testimony. The mockery was so distasteful that the hosts of \"Fox & Friends\" \u2014 Trump's favorite show, which he regularly praises \u2014 called out his behavior and questioned the \"wisdom\" of going after an assault victim.\n\n4. Before the midterm elections, Trump's team put together a racist ad blaming undocumented immigrants for a tragic murder and alleging that Democrats were at fault for allowing a killer into the country. While promoting racist propaganda against undocumented immigrants is a regular feature for Fox News, the ad was so egregious that Fox followed the lead of other outlets and decided to pull the ad out of rotation. For perhaps the first time ever, something was too racist for Fox News.\n\n5. At a campaign rally in Montana, Trump praised the state's Republican Rep. Greg Gianforte for his assault on a reporter the year before, calling Gianforte \"my kind of guy.\" He even re-enacted the incident. A panel of guests on Fox's media criticism show \"Media Buzz\" then took Trump to task. Mildly.\n\n6. Trump regularly calls the free press \"the enemy of the people,\" something even Trump's cheerleaders on \"Fox & Friends\" don't approve of.\n\n\"The press isn't the enemy of the people,\" host Brian Kilmeade said in October after yet another Trump rant.\n\n\"I don't think so either,\" his co-host Steve Doocy added.\n\n7. Fox has repeatedly bashed other networks for reporting the unflattering truth about Republicans and conservatives. But when the White House revoked the press pass of CNN reporter Jim Acosta for his aggressive questioning, Fox sided with CNN. Fox News President Jay Wallace said in a statement that Fox would file an amicus brief with the court and that \"Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized.\"\n\n8. At a Trump rally in July, Trump delivered an unhinged and baseless rant about why we should have stricter voter ID laws.\n\n\"If you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card,\" Trump said. \u201cYou need ID. You go out and you want to buy anything, you need ID. And you need your picture.\" The lie was so absurd that Fox News reporter John Roberts laughed on air the next day while reporting it.\n\n\"Just a personal observation here,\" Roberts said. \"When I\u2019ve been to the grocery store and bought beer or wine, they ask me for my ID. But certainly not when I buy eggs, milk, butter or anything else.\"\n\n9. Fox also had to laugh at Trump's demand for a military parade as the network took note of \"a collective eye roll from military leaders\" at the Pentagon in response to the childish request.\n\n\"Most thought it was a joke at first,\" Fox's national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin said.\n\n10. Over the summer, Trump held a disastrous press conference, standing beside Russian dictator Vladimir Putin as he and sided with the Russian leader and against U.S. law enforcement, which determined that Russia tried to influence the 2016 election. The gang at \"Fox & Friends\" had to drop their kneejerk support for Trump and grudgingly admit \"he fell short\" at the appearance.\n\n11. Fox host Neil Cavuto also weighed in on what he called Trump's \"disgusting\" pro-Putin display.\n\n\"A U.S. president on foreign soil, talking to our biggest enemy or adversary or competitor \u2014 I don\u2019t know how we define them these days \u2014 is essentially letting the guy get away with this, and not even offering a mild criticism,\u201d Cavuto said. \"That sets us back a lot.\"\n\n12. Trump has repeatedly called special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of his campaign's interactions with Russian influence operations a \"hoax.\" But in February, when the first indictments of Trump insiders started coming, Fox host Shepard Smith explained to his audience just how wrong Trump was.\n\n\"The Russians infiltrated our system, manipulated us on behalf of Vladimir Putin \u2014 and they did it online and in person on our soil. If there was ever any question, even a single question, there is no more,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\"Russians, thought to be Americans, working with Trump supporters or allies to do politics together,\u201d he continued. \"The Russia investigation is the opposite of a hoax.\"\n\n13. Repeatedly plagued by talk of impeachment, thanks to his corrupt behavior, Trump said if he was ever impeached \"the market would crash\" and \"everybody would be poor.\" Fox host Neil Cavuto called out that dangerous rhetoric.\n\n\"You don't prevent a constitutional crisis by threatening a financial one,\" he said.\n\n14. Trump has repeatedly complained about the Justice Department, which was led by Jeff Sessions until Trump finally fired him. In one particularly awkward and embarrassing phoned-in interview with \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump attacked the DOJ for its investigation into his campaign's possible collusion with Russia. But attacking his own DOJ became too much even for host Steve Doocy.\n\n\"It\u2019s your Department of Justice!\" Doocy stressed. \u201cMr President, you\u2019re the Republican in charge \u2014 you\u2019ve got a Republican running it!\u201d\n\n15. Trump has repeatedly embarrassed himself and the country with over-the-top praise of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and claims that North Korea is making concessions it isn't actually making. In August, \"Fox & Friends\" host Brian Kilmeade couldn't take it anymore and felt compelled to fact-check Trump's ridiculous tweeted lies, pointing out the brutal regime was actually not cooperating with the U.S.\n\nThe vast majority of the time, Fox News will justify and amplify Trump's ridiculous and dangerous behavior, marching in lockstep with the Republican Party.\n\nSometimes, however, Trump goes so far off the rails that even Fox \u2014 its reporters, hosts, and even president \u2014 feel compelled to point out where he's gone wrong. For an outlet that traffics in smears, lies, and shameless propaganda, that's really saying something.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Americans who want gun safety can rejoice: The NRA had a really horrific year.\n\nThe NRA had a terrible 2018.\n\nThis year was full of setbacks for the most prominent alliance of gun extremists in the country. Even with a staunch ally like Trump boosting them from the White House, the NRA faced a crisis in public support, electoral strength, and financial resources.\n\nThe Parkland shooting started a movement for gun safety\n\nThe spiral began in February, as millions mourned the victims of the mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida. Instead of bowing to the NRA's demands that victims and everyone else stay silent about the role gun availability played in the massacre, the teen survivors of the shooting started a grassroots uprising.\n\nThat put the NRA's attack dogs on defense for a change. The lobbying group was being easily bested in the court of public opinion by an ad-hoc alliance of teenagers. The NRA cried victim and lashed out while the teens got busy putting together the historic March for Our Lives.\n\nAmericans listened to the voices of the Parkland students, and got fed up with the NRA's toxic influence.\n\nSoon, corporate supporters and sponsors ended their affiliations with the NRA. Walmart made it harder for young people to purchase guns there, while Dick's Sporting Goods dropped assault rifles altogether. The NRA angrily called the backlash \"shameful\" and an example of \"cowardice.\"\n\nFor the first time in 18 years of polling, the NRA is now viewed more negatively than positively.\n\nAnd the hits kept coming.\n\nThe NRA lost a lot of money\n\nThe NRA has been experiencing major cash shortages due to falling membership dues; its receipts in 2017 were down $55 million from the year before. The group was so strapped for cash that it even cut off free coffee and watercoolers for employees at its Fairfax, Virginia headquarters.\n\nThe cash-strapped NRA cut back on investing in Republican campaigns by a significant amount. By October, the NRA had pledged only about $1.6 million to GOP candidates in the midterms \u2014 compared to the $16 million they spent on GOP campaign efforts in the last midterm election in 2014.\n\nSoon there were layoffs at NRA TV, the organization's propaganda arm.\n\nThe NRA faced the perfect storm in November, as its chosen Republican candidates lost big at the ballot box to candidates who championed the mainstream American call for more gun safety legislation.\n\nThe group's reputation just got worse and worse\n\nReeling from its midterm losses, the NRA made the foolish decision to attack doctors \u2014 one of the most respected professions.\n\nResponding to recommendations from the American College of Physicians on how to help gun safety, the NRA tweeted, \"Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane.\"\n\nFrom that insult sprung the hashtag #ThisIsMyLane, where thousands of doctors, elected officials, and ordinary citizens made it crystal-clear to the NRA that gun safety matters to mainstream Americans.\n\nThe NRA's public image was also shaken by revelations that Russian entities invested in the NRA as a way to assert influence over the Republican Party.\n\nBy the end of 2018, an admitted Russian spy had pleaded guilty in open court to working for Vladimir Putin's government through the NRA to manipulate American politics.\n\nThe NRA has been on the wrong side of history for a long time, but has always managed to bully and intimidate its way into keeping political power.\n\nBut 2018 was the year Americans finally decided they wouldn't be bullied anymore \u2014 and made the NRA pay for its dangerous behavior.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump spent the year insulting and ignoring those who fought for our most fundamental rights.\n\nMost politicians love this country enough to refrain from insulting or ignoring the Americans signed up to serve in the armed forces. But Donald Trump is not most politicians.\n\nThroughout 2018, Trump demeaned, ignored, and insulted veterans. From outsourcing veteran medical care to unqualified members of Mar-a-Lago, to being too lazy to attend a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington Cemetery, Trump left no doubt in anyone's mind that he has no respect for those who serve. Here are five times Trump insulted veterans in 2018.\n\nIn March, Trump fired the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs over Twitter. The coward who was made famous for playing a hard-nosed businessman on television could not even muster the courage to personally oust Secretary David Shulkin.\n\nTo add yet another insult to veterans, Trump picked an unqualified novice, Dr. Ronny Jackson, to run the country's second-largest Cabinet department. After Jackson withdrew from the nomination, Trump dithered for weeks to find an adequate replacement, leaving the department in chaos.\n\nWhile Trump left the department without formal leadership, his rich buddies from Mar-a-Lago took on an outsized influence over the department. A shocking investigation showed three members of Trump's Florida resort held \"sweeping influence\" over the VA, despite having no qualifications, Senate confirmation, or any other accountability. The influence was so pervasive that the three men \"reviewed a confidential draft of a $10 billion government contract for the electronic-records project, even though they lack any relevant expertise,\" according to ProPublica.\n\nTrump's insults to veterans aren't limited to to his actions in the United States. He took his dismissive attitude overseas in November, when a light drizzle caused Trump to skip a major ceremony celebrating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in France. Then, when Trump returned to the White House, he skipped a Veterans Day ceremony, refusing to travel two short miles to Arlington Cemetery to lay a wreath upon the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, insulting veterans from every war.\n\nTo end the year, Trump couldn't even be bothered to acknowledge the day which lives in infamy, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, until he raged against special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. In an all-too-common multi-tweet tirade, Trump spent the morning attacking Mueller's investigation for hours before finally acknowledging the anniversary of the attack on Hawaii.\n\nTime and time again, Trump has shown that he is only interested in helping himself. If he can use troops or veterans as props to advance his personal agenda, he will.\n\nOtherwise, he will ignore or insult those who fought and dies for our freedoms.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Mike Pence cemented his position of being a ridiculous joke in service of Trump for nearly all of 2018.\n\nMike Pence's subservient role within the Trump administration saw him making a fool of himself, loud and proud, in front of the world.\n\nPence spent the year demonstrating how incompetent the Trump team is by attacking Trump's perceived enemies, making excuses for Trump, and humiliating himself and his position. All for Trump.\n\nTrump's incompetence poster boy\n\nSent to South Korea as America's official representative, Pence showed up late to the VIP reception and had to awkwardly walk around from table to table for a meet and greet. He ended up avoiding key interactions with UN and Olympic officials that a normal delegation would have participated in.\n\nPence looked silly in an interview where he defended Trump's desire to hold a vain military parade in America, then seconds later attacked Kim Jong Un's regime in North Korea for having the same sort of events.\n\nTrump's attack poodle\n\nInstead of standing by the Constitution, Pence gushed about Trump's free speech attacks, telling a reporter, \"he's a fighter!\"\n\nInstead of supporting the First Amendment, Pence told a reporter that a White House ban on a CNN reporter was part of \"maintaining the decorum,\" and would not entertain an open exchange between journalists and Trump.\n\nIt was revealed that Pence's stunt to prop up Trump's racist attacks on NFL players cost taxpayers at least $325,000 to shuttle Pence all over the country, merely to engage in phony moralizing.\n\nPence looks like a fool for Trump\n\nPence initially declared the details of Trump's hush money payoffs to porn star Stormy Daniels as \"baseless allegations,\" but when details of how Trump arranged the payments emerged, Pence merely went quiet.\n\nTrump's excuse man\n\nWhen the public became aware of the existence of a domestic abuser in the White House team and those in the administration who defended him, Pence brushed off concerns and described the incident as a \"staffing matter.\"\n\nTrump has enabled rampant corruption in the presidency, and in response to news that Trump's personal lawyer was selling off access to corporations, Pence told a reporter the corruption was merely a \"private matter.\"\n\nPublicly humiliated for Trump\n\nPence hosted a fake rabbi at an event just says after a mass shooting at a synagogue and was widely condemned for the action.\n\nTrump attacked celebrities like Oprah Winfrey for campaigning for Democratic candidates in Georgia and said, \"This ain't Hollywood. This is Georgia!\" But Georgia is one of the biggest sites for film production, an industry that pumps billions into the state's economy.\n\nAt a political rally for a pro-Trump PAC, Pence was showered with protests of \"shame on you!\" by protesters calling out Trump's decision to separate children from their families at the border.\n\nDespite his longtime identification with conservative Christians, Pence was vocally opposed by attendees at the Southern Baptist Convention. They were concerned with the Trump administration's anti-immigrant stance and supported a measure to replace his speech slot with prayer.\n\nTrump was called out for his racist actions during a speech on Martin Luther King Jr. Day by Pastor Dr. Maurice Watson at a church in Baltimore while Pence was in attendance as part of the administration's lip service to minority communities. Pence had to take in an earful of admonition over his racist political partner, and a local news station reported that Pence was \"red-faced\" during the speech.\n\nPence said he \"really would hope not\" when asked if a member of his inner circle wrote an anonymous New York Times op-ed exposing Trump. Then he quickly realized his response meant it was a possibility. So he then asked the reporter to turn the camera back on so he could record a new, stronger answer.\n\nAppearing before the NRA at their annual meeting, Pence told the gun extremist group he was their \"friend.\" Two weeks later, while expressing supposed sympathy for the victims of a school shooting not far from the same site in Texas, Pence told victims \"we're with you.\" But you can't have it both ways.\n\nPence appeared at an event with conspiracy theorist and racist former Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Instead of giving him the cold shoulder, Pence loudly praised the fringe figure as a \"champion\" of the \"rule of law.\"\n\nLying for Trump\n\nTo bolster a completely invented racist Trump claim that dangerous Middle Easterners were a part of the migrant \"caravan\" headed north, Pence, using bizarre logic, said that if a migrant wasn't Honduran, they could be Middle Eastern.\n\nTrump did not act to defend military pay during the government shutdown, which President Barack Obama did in 2013. Speaking in front of soldiers, Pence simply lied and said Trump was defending them during the political infighting.\n\nPence claimed with a straight face that a story about Trump aides having to pilfer a document from the Oval Office to prevent a disastrous Trump action on trade never happened. But there was evidence given to reporters, and even Fox News had to make it clear to Pence that \"it did happen.\"\n\nOver the last 12 months, if Pence was in the public eye, there were good odds that he was doing something completely embarrassing and often beyond the pale of good taste and acceptable behavior.\n\nIn addition to having a serial case of foot-in-mouth disease, Pence added to his reputation of being a blatant liar and provocateur. He long ago abandoned being a serious figure, but he continues to be a key performer in Trump's large clown show.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Looking back at the year in science denialism, pseudoscience, and evidence suppression.\n\nTrump has made no secret of his hostility toward science and basic facts, and he's filled his administration with people all too eager to carry out his anti-science agenda.\n\nHe chose a 31-year-old politics major with no background in science as his top science adviser in the White House. The Environmental Protection Agency under Trump has been mired in scandal after scandal, covering up damning reports that don't fit with Trump's anti-science agenda.\n\nHe even attacked a report on climate change from his own administration.\n\nAs 2018 comes to a close, here's a look at some of the most ridiculous anti-science moments from Trump and his administration this year.\n\n1. Trump's anti-science agenda fuels mass exodus at the EPA\n\nThanks to the hostile work environment created by the Trump administration, more than 1,500 employees fled the Environmental Protection Agency during the first 18 months of Trump's presidency. The mass exodus reduced the EPA\u2019s workforce \"to levels not seen since the Reagan administration,\" according to The Washington Post.\n\nMany of those who left the EPA were serving in positions that are critical to carrying out the agency\u2019s core missions including 260 scientists, 106 engineers, and 185 environmental protection specialists. In the EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), 15.7 percent of employees \u2014 nearly one in six \u2014 departed during the first 18 months of Trump\u2019s presidency and were not replaced.\n\nSome of the former EPA employees spoke with the Post and voiced their frustration with the Trump administration\u2019s anti-science agenda, saying it was what drove them to leave.\n\n\"I did not want to any longer be any part of this administration\u2019s nonsense,\" said former EPA scientist Ann Williamson.\n\n2. The EPA buried a major study showing hazardous levels of toxic chemicals in U.S. drinking water\n\nInternal emails released in May showed that the White House and top officials at the EPA had worked together earlier in the year to suppress a federal health study that revealed new evidence about hazardous levels of toxic chemicals in the U.S. water supply.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, found that a certain class of chemicals can pose a serious risk to human health at much lower levels than previously thought. These chemicals, which have been linked to cancer, thyroid diseases, pregnancy complications, and other serious health problems, are present at dangerously high levels in water supplies near chemical plants, military bases, and other sites in multiple states, the study found.\n\nResearch of this nature would usually be made public as quickly as possible so that it could be used to set new safety standards and inform new policies to protect the health of the American public. But according to internal email exchanges, the Trump White House feared that revealing the findings would cause a PR disaster and put too much pressure on the EPA.\n\nSo, instead of releasing the report, the White House and the EPA devised a scheme to suppress the findings to keep the nationwide public health threat a secret \u2014 and to avoid doing anything about it.\n\n3. The EPA schemed with climate change deniers to discredit climate science\n\nIn June, emails released as part of a lawsuit revealed that the EPA had been coordinating with the conservative Heartland Institute, a fossil fuel-funded think tank that has spent years manufacturing an alternative body of pseudoscientific research meant to call into question mainstream climate science.\n\nWhile it was already known that the EPA was taking cues from conservative groups and promoting dubious \"experts\" to cast doubt on mainstream climate science, the emails released in June revealed the extent to which the Trump administration has embraced the right-wing think tank and used the pseudoscience it produces to inform government policies.\n\nAmong other things, the exchanges showed top EPA officials working directly with the Heartland Institute to \"rally like-minded people for public hearings on science and global warming, counter negative news coverage and tout Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s stewardship of the agency,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\n4. The EPA told employees to lie about climate change\n\nAn internal memo leaked in March revealed that the EPA had sent employees a list of eight approved talking points directing them to cast doubt on the scientific consensus about climate change.\n\nThe talking points instructed employees to highlight scientific uncertainty and lack of evidence linking human activity to climate change \u2014 statements that are contradicted by the 2017 federal climate assessment, which concluded that \u201cit is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\u201d\n\nOne of the talking points in the memo encourages EPA staffers to question whether fossil fuel emissions directly contribute to climate change, stating incorrectly that \u201cclear gaps remain including our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it.\u201d\n\nThe memo also casts doubt on the scientific consensus surrounding climate change, claiming that the \u201cdegree and extent\u201d of human impact on climate change \u201care subject to continuing debate and dialogue.\u201d In reality, 97 percent of actively publishing climate scientists agree that the warming trends observed over the past century \u201care extremely likely due to human activities.\u201d\n\n5. Trump didn't believe the climate change report released by his own administration\n\nIn November, scientists from 13 federal agencies released the National Climate Assessment \u2014 a comprehensive, 1,600-page report on the devastation that climate change has already brought to the United States, and how much worse it will get if nothing changes.\n\nWhile much of the report focused on the environmental impacts, another section outlined the massive economic cost of climate change. According to the report, the U.S. economy could suffer hundreds of billions of dollars in losses.\n\nBut when a reporter asked Trump about the \"devastating\" economic impacts forecasted by the report, Trump said he didn't believe the projections made by scientists in his own administration.\n\n6. Trump team blamed President Obama for inconvenient climate science\n\nWhen the government released a devastating report on climate change in November, acting EPA Administrator and former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler wasn't happy that the evidence showed coal is (still) bad for the environment.\n\nBut rather than accept the scientific findings, Wheeler decided to unleash a conspiracy theory blaming the Obama administration for making coal look bad and not putting enough emphasis on the supposed promise of coal energy. This is despite the fact that most of the work on the report was done during the Trump administration.\n\nAs part of his conspiracy theory, Wheeler accused the Obama administration of telling scientists to only look \"at the worst case scenario for this report.\" He then said he wanted to \u201ctake a look at the modeling that\u2019s used for the next assessment\u201d \u2014 strongly suggesting that he wants to meddle with the methodology of the next climate report so he can produce the results he desires.\n\n7. The Trump administration covered up the child health risks associated with climate change\n\nIn October, while reviewing the proposed language for a new EPA rule, the White House scrubbed key passages that made it clear children face particularly severe health-related risks stemming from climate change.\n\nBefore the review, the draft of the rule contained text acknowledging that the dangers of climate change are especially acute for vulnerable populations.\n\n\u201cCertain populations and life stages, including children, the elderly and the poor, are most vulnerable to climate-related health effects,\u201d the draft text stated. \u201cImpacts to children are expected from heat waves, air pollution, infectious and waterborne illnesses, and mental health effects resulting from extreme weather events.\u201d\n\nAfter the White House review, the language describing the health-related risks for vulnerable populations was removed.\n\n8. The EPA gutted restrictions on the use of asbestos\n\nThe Trump administration has dismantled environmental protection rules across the board, but even the most cynical observers were taken aback when the EPA gutted restrictions on asbestos \u2014 one of the most dangerous carcinogens ever used in construction \u2014 and made it legal again for new uses in U.S. manufacturing.\n\nAsbestos was once widely used in building materials until it was directly linked to lung cancer and mesothelioma. Every year, asbestos still kills 12,000 to 15,000 people in the United States. The U.S. is one of very few countries worldwide that haven\u2019t yet banned asbestos completely. Its use is, instead, heavily restricted in the U.S. But now the Trump administration is dramatically loosening those restrictions.\n\nThe dangerous move by the Trump administration is especially eyebrow raising given Trump\u2019s apparent fondness for the asbestos industry \u2014 an industry that is still prominent in Russia.\n\n9. The EPA cited a retracted study to justify lowering pollution standards\n\nWhen Scott Pruitt, then-administrator of the EPA, wanted to roll back an Obama-era ban on heavily polluting trucks, he ignored his own agency\u2019s research on emissions, and turned instead to an industry-funded study that was so flawed, even the university that produced it disavowed the findings.\n\nPruitt cited the study to justify his proposal to repeal air emissions standards for glider trucks, a type of truck that is advertised and sold as new, but is still equipped with an old diesel engine. The trucks produce between 40 and 50 times as much harmful air pollution as trucks with more modern engines, and if left unregulated, could lead to an estimated 1,600 premature deaths annually and thousands of additional cases of heart disease, lung cancer, asthma, and related health conditions.\n\nAs it turns out, the study Pruitt cited was not only deeply flawed, but also plagued by financial conflicts of interest. Tennessee Tech, the university that sponsored the research, denounced the findings as \u201cfar-fetched\u201d and \u201cscientifically implausible,\" and even sent a letter to Pruitt asking him not to rely on the results of the study, and the faculty senate passed a resolution demanding that the university withdraw the study and launch an investigation.\n\nUltimately, the university disavowed the study, saying there were serious concerns about \u201cthe methodology and accuracy\u201d of the research, and that the EPA should not use it to inform new emissions guidance. The study is currently the subject of an official university investigation into research misconduct for failing to adhere to basic scientific standards.\n\nBut for Pruitt, the research was still good enough to justify lowering pollution standards.\n\n10. Trump's top science adviser didn't study science\n\nThe top science adviser for the White House is a position that has traditionally been held by prominent scientists with extensive education and experience. But since Trump failed to nominate anyone to fill the spot, the job fell into the lap of a 31-year-old politics major whose most recent job was as chief of staff for Trump ally and venture capitalist Peter Thiel.\n\nMichael Kratsios \u2014 who holds a degree in Political Science with a concentration in Hellenic (Greek) studies \u2014 is tasked with advising the White House on decisions about matters ranging from disease outbreaks to natural disasters. He was initially brought into the White House to advise Trump on tech-related issues.\n\nTrump\u2019s failure to appoint a top science adviser leaves the nation vulnerable during times of crisis, when it\u2019s critical to have a point person who can offer objective advice informed by science.\n\n11. The Trump administration blamed wildfires on environmental laws and \"radical environmentalists\"\n\nAs deadly wildfires ravaged the state of California this summer and fall, the Trump administration was determined to stick to its practice of denying and downplaying climate change, which meant refusing to acknowledge that the blazes were being fueled by rising temperatures and drier conditions.\n\nSince they weren't willing to talk about the role of climate change, Trump and his allies needed something else to blame the fires on. Naturally, a steady stream of lies followed.\n\nFirst, Trump blamed the wildfires on California\u2019s own environmental protection policies. He then suggested that there may just not be enough water in California to fight the deadly fires. A short time later, Interior Secretary Zinke pinned the blame on \"radical environmentalists,\" claiming they would \"rather see forests and communities burn than see a logger in the woods.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But on Presidents Day, he finally won something fair and square: the title of worst president ever.\n\nAccording to the \"Presidential Greatness Survey\" published Monday by the American Political Science Association, Trump is ranked 44th out of 44 presidents. The survey counts President Grover Cleveland's non-consecutive administrations as a single presidency, thus sparing Trump from being ranked one spot lower.\n\nThe survey also ranked President Obama 8th overall, making him the the greatest living president, one spot ahead of Ronald Reagan.\n\nBut even among Republican respondents to the survey, Trump could only manage a ranking of 40th out of 44, edging out James Buchanan, Franklin Pierce, William Henry Harrison \u2014 who died in office just one month into his first term \u2014 and Andrew Johnson.\n\nBy contrast, President Obama's first appearance in this survey in 2014 placed him at 18th, and a group of 238 presidential historians ranked Obama 15th after his first year in office.\n\nTrump's first year in office has been marked by historically low approval numbers, an embarrassing trend that was continued by a five-point drop in his weekly approval rating from Gallup.\n\nIf there is any consolation for Trump, it's that he can't possibly drop any lower in this ranking during whatever time he has left in office.\n\nFor the rest of the nation, it's the prospect that that time will be brief."

    "text": "School shootings are disproportionately committed by white students, but Betsy DeVos' commission claims the incidents could be decreased if schools over-discipline students of color.\n\nAfter the tragic mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, where a white student killed 17 people, the federal government convened a Federal Commission on School Safety, to be headed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. That commission was charged with finding \"meaningful and actionable recommendations to keep students safe at school.\"\n\nNow, the Commission has issued its report, and one of its key recommendations is to roll back Obama-era protections against students of color being unfairly disciplined. None of the major recommendations of the Commission deal with making guns less available generally, even though every bit of evidence shows that countries with stricter gun control laws see far fewer mass shootings. Instead, the report provided guidelines for arming school personnel and contains a perverse insistence that schools are made safer when they return to an era where students of color disproportionately disciplined.\n\nUnder Obama, the Department of Education found that students of color were disciplined at a far higher rate than their white peers, often for minor infractions. It starts in preschool, where black preschoolers were found to be suspended at over three times the rate of white pre-school students. And it continues in K-12 education, where black students were nearly four times as likely to be suspended as their white peers.\n\nThe Obama-era guidelines beefed up data collection to help identify those types of disparities, and it also recommended schools treat suspension and expulsion as a last resort rather than the first action.\n\nBut DeVos wants to get rid of the rules. In theory, it is because the Parkland school shooter had committed a number of infractions before the shooting yet still managed to carry out the shooting. The unspoken implication is that the Stoneman Douglas school felt so restricted by the Obama guidelines that they didn't take appropriate action against a student who became a school shooter. This ignores the fact that the gunman, Nicolas Cruz, had been expelled from the school. It also ignores the fact that the Cruz was white. Finally, the recommendations ignore that, although data is difficult to track, it appears that the majority of mass shootings are committed by white men.\n\nThe report's conclusion is a transparent \u2014 and terrible \u2014 way for DeVos to pander to conservatives who demanded, as early as fall 2017, that the Obama disciplinary policies be thrown out.\n\nThe Trump administration and DeVos aren't genuinely interested in making schools safer. They're interested in propping up the power of the NRA, a major player in getting Trump elected, and in rolling back Obama-era civil rights protections for many groups, including victims of campus sexual assault and trans students. This report is yet another cynical way for the administration to enshrine discrimination into law.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He's a Messianic \"Jew,\" which means he accepts Christian theology.\n\nThat's also why Pence's decision to tap a Messianic \"rabbi\" to lead a prayer for 11 murdered Jews who were gunned down in their neighborhood synagogue was so widely condemned Monday night.\n\nPeople saw the move as a deliberate attempt to \"erase the Jewishness of the massacre,\" and more broadly, \"to eliminate [Jews] ... Even when we're mourning.\"\n\nOthers commented on the undercurrents of white supremacy, saying the decision not to invite a Jewish rabbi for such a significant moment was symbolic of an effort \"to keep this nation white and Christian,\" and a message that Trump, Pence, and the Republican Party \"want America to be a White, Christian fascist theocracy.\"\n\nPence's move is part of a larger trend of anti-Semitism in the Trump administration. Last year, the White House failed to mention the Holocaust on Holocaust Remembrance Day, and then engaged in some disturbing Holocaust denial during a White House press conference. In the Republican Party more broadly, Holocaust deniers have been welcomed into the fold, and anti-Semitism runs rampant.\n\nEven after 11 people were gunned down in a synagogue, Trump had to be persuaded to condemn anti-Semitism, just like he had to be forced to condemn the violent neo-Nazis who killed Heather Heyer. And still, he couldn't stop himself from blaming the Jews for not being armed and stopping the gunman.\n\nThen, to add insult to injury, Pence refused to have a Jewish rabbi at his rally to pray for the victims \u2014 and instead, he chose to invite a member of a group that is widely perceived as a movement aimed at destroying Judaism from within.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Newly released emails show EPA officials working with a right-wing think tank in a coordinated effort to undermine climate science.\n\nOfficials at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have been quietly working with climate change deniers at a conservative think tank to discredit climate science, according to a slew of newly released emails.\n\nThe emails, which were unveiled as part of a lawsuit filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) and Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), reveal a new level of coordination between Scott Pruitt's EPA and the Heartland Institute, a fossil fuel-funded think tank that has spent years manufacturing an alternative body of pseudoscientific research meant to call into question mainstream climate science.\n\nBacked by funding from the Koch brothers and the Mercer family, the Heartland Institute has engaged in an aggressive, years-long disinformation campaign aimed at undermining peer-reviewed science showing that human-caused climate change is a real and pressing matter.\n\nWhile it was already known that the EPA was taking cues from conservative groups and promoting dubious \"experts\" to cast doubt on mainstream climate science, these latest emails reveal the extent to which the Trump administration has embraced the right-wing think tank and used the pseudoscience it produces to inform government policies.\n\nAmong other things, the exchanges show top EPA officials working directly with the Heartland Institute to \"rally like-minded people for public hearings on science and global warming, counter negative news coverage and tout Administrator Scott Pruitt's stewardship of the agency,\" the Associated Press reports.\n\nIn one email, John Konkus, the deputy associate administrator for public affairs at the EPA, asked then-president of the Heartland Institute Joseph Bast to provide a list of suggested scientists and economists who the EPA could invite to an annual public hearing on the agency's science standards.\n\n\"If you send a list, we will make sure an invitation is sent,\" Konkus told Bast, showing that the EPA actively invited the Heartland Institute to handpick who advises the agency's climate-related policies.\n\nThe emails also show EPA officials reaching out to the Heartland Institute to rally activists to publicly support the Trump administration's rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, a set of evidence-based regulations to reduce greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe Heartland Institute rejects decades of scientific research showing that fossil fuel emissions are driving climate change, and claims on its website that cutting back on the use of coal and petroleum would \"squander one of America's greatest comparative advantages among the world's nations.\"\n\nIn its effort to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change, the Heartland Institute has mailed tens of thousands of books attacking climate science to public school science teachers, apparently in the hopes of shaping school science curricula.\n\nThe right-wing group has also attacked Pope Francis for speaking about climate change and, in 2012, put up a billboard comparing scientists and others who say that climate change is real to the Unabomber.\n\nThese are the viewpoints that are now informing federal environmental policies.\n\nThe emails also suggest that the Heartland Institute likely played a role in shaping internal EPA policies, as well. For example, in March, a leaked EPA memo revealed that the agency had provided employees with a list of talking points instructing them to cast doubt on the scientific consensus about climate change.\n\nThe internal memo directed employees to highlight scientific uncertainty and lack of evidence linking human activity to climate change \u2014 statements that are flatly contradicted by years of research, including the 2017 federal climate assessment, which concluded that \"it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\"\n\nOne of the talking points in the memo encouraged EPA staffers to question whether fossil fuel emissions directly contribute to climate change, stating incorrectly that \"clear gaps remain including our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it.\"\n\nThe memo also cast doubt on the scientific consensus surrounding climate change, claiming that the \"degree and extent\" of human impact on climate change \"are subject to continuing debate and dialogue.\"\n\nThe false assertions in the memo are closely aligned with the pseudoscience manufactured by the Heartland Institute, which has quite obviously found an ally in Pruitt's EPA.\n\nWhile Pruitt claims that he believes in climate change, he denies the science linking it to human activity. Under his direction, the EPA has worked to roll back critical environmental regulations that experts warn will speed up the rate of climate change.\n\nAt the same time, Pruitt's EPA has also taken steps to censor scientific information that might reveal the harmful impact of the Trump administration\u2019s environmental policies. This started shortly after Pruitt\u2019s confirmation as head of the EPA, when he he personally approved the removal of references to climate change and climate-related government programs from the EPA\u2019s website.\n\nWith the release of these new emails, we now also know that Pruitt and other top EPA officials have been working directly with a fossil fuel-funded group to undermine legitimate scientific research and replace it with pseudoscience and dubious \"expert\" opinions.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, the EPA has invited this group to help the agency manufacture the appearance of support for policies that will harm Americans \u2014 all in the name of \"making America great.\""

    "text": "Fox News attacked reporter April Ryan because she questioned Donald Trump's racist comments. Now she is getting death threats.\n\nReporter April Ryan revealed that after she was singled out by Fox News for asking Donald Trump tough questions, she began receiving death threats.\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks. She is a black woman who has been particularly singled out and targeted by Trump's press operation, behavior that has been emulated by his preferred right-wing propaganda network, Fox.\n\nAppearing at a \"Journalism in the Trump Era\" panel put on by the Committee to Protect Journalists, Ryan spoke openly about what she has experienced.\n\n\"Unfortunately I'm the poster child on some networks now for asking questions,\" she noted. \"I've been getting death threats just for asking a question.\"\n\nThe latest round of attacks against Ryan came after she asked Trump during an event on Martin Luther King Jr. Day if he is a racist.\n\nThe question had to be asked, after Trump referred to countries with large nonwhite populations as \"shithole\" countries and said their residents should not be allowed to emigrate to the United States. Instead, he cited out a majority-white country like Norway as the sort of place from which America should welcome people.\n\nTime and again, Trump has said horribly racist things, and he needed to be asked about it. For that, his own White House and his core supporters have gone after a black reporter.\n\nHis administration and his political allies at outlets like Fox are doing his racial dirty work, and putting innocent people in harm's way for exercising their constitutional right to free speech and inquiry."

According to a new report by the Washington Post, the EPA lost nearly 1,600 employees during the first 18 months of Trump's presidency.\n\nAt the same time, fewer than 400 new employees were hired, and many of them were pro-industry political appointees, not scientists.\n\nThis mass exodus has reduced the EPA's workforce \"to levels not seen since the Reagan administration,\" the Post reports.\n\nMany of those who left the EPA were serving in positions that are critical to carrying out the agency's core missions. Included among those who've exited are 260 scientists, 106 engineers, and 185 environmental protection specialists.\n\nIn the EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), 15.7 percent of employees \u2014 nearly one in six \u2014 departed during the first 18 months of Trump's presidency and were not replaced.\n\nAs the former head of the office told the Post, those vacancies will have real world consequences.\n\n\"If you don\u2019t have people to enforce the regulations, you\u2019re not going to get enforcement, and you\u2019re not going to get compliance,\" said Granta Nakayama, former OECA director.\n\nSome of the former EPA employees spoke with the Post and voiced their frustration with the Trump administration's anti-science agenda, saying it was what drove them to leave.\n\n\"I did not want to any longer be any part of this administration\u2019s nonsense,\" said former EPA scientist Ann Williamson.\n\nThe Trump administration's hostility toward environmental regulations created a work environment that seems designed to drive out committed career employees and draw in politically motivated industry insiders.\n\nUnder the leadership of former Director Scott Pruitt, the EPA worked to roll back critical environmental regulations that experts warn will speed up the rate of climate change.\n\nIn addition to unraveling climate-related regulations, Pruitt also moved to dismantle fundamental clean air and water mandates. According to Inside Climate News, during the first year of the Trump administration, the EPA took \"at least 15 major actions on air pollution\u2014all to delay, weaken or repeal protections, and all opposed by the American Lung Association and other health groups.\"\n\nDuring Pruitt's scandal plagued tenure, the agency was also caught telling employees to lie about climate science, covering up the results of a major water pollution study, and scheming with big money donors to disseminate disinformation about climate change, among other things.\n\nPerhaps worst of all is what happened when those employees left.\n\nAs revealed in a newly released cache of documents, Trump's EPA orchestrated a disinformation campaign to smear the reputations of former employees who spoke out about the destruction of the agency.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, the sheer number of dedicated workers who've fled the agency makes a cover-up all but impossible.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Karen Handel, a Trump loyalist who launched virulent attacks on women's health and rights, has conceded defeat after serving less than one full term in Congress.\n\nMcBath is part of a group known as the Mothers of the Movement, a group of black women who have lost children to gun violence perpetrated by police officers and vigilantes. She will be the first person of color to represent Georgia's 6th District, and just the third African-American woman to represent Georgia in the U.S. House.\n\nMcBath told Buzzfeed that the murder of her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was a catalyst for running for office. Davis was shot and killed by a white man who thought Davis was playing music too loudly outside a Florida gas station.\n\nMcBath, who is also a breast cancer survivor, campaigned on a platform calling for more gun safety legislation and protecting access to affordable health care.\n\nHandel, on the other hand, was bankrolled by the NRA, and used her brief stint in Congress to rubber-stamp the Trump agenda.\n\nAnd before that, Handel had a long track record of attacking women's access to health care.\n\nHandel pushed a radical anti-Planned Parenthood agenda that nearly destroyed the breast cancer foundation Susan G. Komen for the Cure, where she served as the vice president for public policy.\n\nHandle pushed the Komen Foundation to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood's breast cancer screening program, a decision that severely damaged the organization's reputation.\n\nThe Komen Foundation reversed the decision and forced Handel to resign.\n\nHandel ran for Congress in a 2017 special election, narrowly defeating Democrat Jon Ossoff. The race captivated the attention of the nation because Democrats came very close to taking a very red seat.\n\nWhile Ossoff's defeat was heartbreaking for Democrats, it didn't stop the progressive energy that was palpable at the time \u2014 and that momentum only continued to build after the special election.\n\nThanks to the hard work of Lucy McBath, Stacey Abrams, and Democrats, progress is on the march in this author's home state of Georgia.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Seeking asylum is a human right protected by international and national law \u2014 but the Trump administration wants to make people pay to apply.\n\nThe Trump administration is considering a proposal that would make asylum seekers pay a mandatory fee in order to submit their application for refuge in the U.S., according to a new report.\n\nThe proposed policy has not yet been finalized, but if implemented, it would require applicants within the U.S. to pay $50 to apply for asylum, Buzzfeed News reports. The fee would not be waived for asylum seekers who can't afford the cost.\n\nThe move comes just two weeks after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration's attempt to turn away all asylum seekers who cross the border into the U.S. illegally.\n\nThat ruling, issued November 20, struck down a policy announced 11 days earlier in a proclamation made by Trump, stating that anyone who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border would be ineligible for future asylum claims.\n\nNow, it appears that the Trump administration is trying to achieve the same outcome of reducing asylum applications by implementing a mandatory fee that would affect huge numbers of asylum seekers who have already crossed the border.\n\nAccording to figures compiled by Buzzfeed, more than 300,000 such applications are currently being processed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Last year, an estimated 100,000 people applied for asylum after crossing into the U.S. seeking safe harbor.\n\nAdvocates say the proposed change is inhumane and possibly even illegal, given that asylum-seeking is protected under both national and international law.\n\nAccording to the American Immigration Council, that protection is guaranteed \"to foreign nationals already in the United States or at the border who meet the international law definition of a 'refugee.'\"\n\nThe right to seek asylum in other countries is also enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n\"The reason we don't charge for asylum applications is intuitive,\" immigration attorney Juan Camilo Mendez Guzman told Buzzfeed. \"Even if it keeps one person from being able to apply, is that what we are about? We are going to put a dollar amount on not getting sent back to a place of persecution? It's crazy.\"\n\nThe proposal to charge desperate asylum seekers a fee to apply for safe refuge is the latest front in the Trump administration's ongoing war on refugees and immigrants.\n\nAlmost immediately after taking office, Trump slammed the door on refugees with his first \"travel ban,\" which prohibited persons from certain Middle Eastern countries from seeking refuge in the U.S., including those fleeing war-torn countries like Syria.\n\nDespite being put on hold and restricted by the courts, the ban still had its intended effect, as refugee admissions from the affected countries plummeted by as much as 99%.\n\nSince then, the Trump administration has made it harder for people fleeing domestic and gang violence to obtain asylum status, while also going after funding for refugee assistance programs and organizations like UNICEF, and even condemning other countries for taking in too many asylum seekers.\n\nTrump has tried to justify these cruel policies by invoking national security concerns and engaging in racist fear-mongering to demonize asylum seekers. However, even the Pentagon has admitted that Trump's refugee policies are actually creating a national security crisis, not solving one.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Marco Rubio thinks it's a great idea.\n\nBrian Kolfage created the \"We The People Will Fund The Wall\" page, with the stated goal of raising $1 billion.\n\n\"If the 63 million people who voted for Trump each pledge $80, we can build the wall,\" Kolfage promises. So far, he has raised $11.6 million. He's also soliciting checks on a separate website to be sent directly to him.\n\nOn Friday, Rubio used his platform as a sitting senator \u2014 he has 3.6 million followers on Twitter \u2014 to promote the dubious crusade. He hailed Kolfage as a \"true American hero\" and praised him for taking \"the initiative on the border wall.\" In Rubio's view, Kolfage \"shames those who for political reasons irrationally oppose making America safer.\"\n\nThe tweet came in the midst of a series of tweets from Rubio supporting Trump and his plot to shut down the federal government unless he gets $5 billion to fund his needless wall.\n\nBut in promoting Kolfage, Rubio is exposing millions to a campaign put together by an individual with a troubled past.\n\nAn Iraq War veteran, Kolfage ran a Facebook page called Right Wing News as part of what NBC News called \"a ring of affiliate sites that frequently trafficked in conspiracy theories.\"\n\nRight Wing News was pulled down by Facebook in a part of a crackdown on fake news. Kolfage's page was one of many described by Facebook as \"using fake accounts \u2026 to drive traffic to their websites\" or \"were ad farms using Facebook to mislead people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.\"\n\nAfter Facebook pulled his page, Kolfage created a group called Fight4FreeSpeech and began soliciting online donations for it.\n\nKolfage doesn't mention any of his questionable past in his GoFundMe solicitation to \"fund the wall.\" Instead, he promises donors that their money will go \"to the right place\" because he has \"contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all the funds will go upon completion\" and claims to have \"very high level contacts already helping.\"\n\nHe also assures his donors that \"this is not a scam\" and offers, as proof, the fact that he is using his real name and has appeared repeatedly on Fox.\n\nAnd Fox has been boosting the bizarre campaign, giving him air time on both Fox News and Fox Business.\n\nNow his operation is getting free advertising from his own senator. The amplification could lead to millions more being thrown into Kolfage's coffers, despite his troublesome past.\n\nThere's no reason to think that Kolfage's latest project is any more credible than his past ventures. And if the people who are sending him their money end up getting scammed, Rubio can take some credit for promoting the ill-conceived effort.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A federal judge permanently enjoined the federal government from enforcing policies that essentially barred domestic and gang violence victims from seeking asylum.\n\nBack in June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued one of the cruelest pronouncements of his cruel tenure in the Trump administration: that victims of domestic violence or gang violence would generally not be eligible for asylum.\n\nThankfully, the ACLU just won a major court victory forcing the administration to stop enforcing these policies. And the plaintiffs in the case, a dozen adults and children who had been denied asylum and given deportation orders, were ordered to be allowed to try again to seek asylum \u2014 and to be returned to the U.S. if they'd already been deported.\n\nThe plaintiffs suffered horrific violence in their home countries. One woman named Grace was raped and beaten by her partner of 20 years, in large part because she had indigenous heritage. Another woman named Mina was beaten by gang members until she couldn't walk, after she had seen her father-in-law murdered by the same gang because he'd helped a family friend to escape it.\n\nJudge Emmet Sullivan held that Sessions' policy, a blanket rule that essentially barred most asylum claims from people like Grace and Mina who suffered at the hands of domestic abusers or gang members, flew in the face of the proper understanding of refugee law.\n\nSullivan \u2014 incidentally, the same judge who just told Michael Flynn he sold his country out \u2014 also rapped the Trump administration's knuckles for setting up a policy that was \"neither adequately explained nor supported by agency precedent.\"\n\nPut another way, Sullivan called the DOJ out for creating a harmful policy out of thin air for no good reason.\n\nBy implementing this policy, the Trump administration defeated the basic purpose of seeking asylum: That when you are unsafe in your home country and face violence or the persistent threat of violence, you should be able to leave and seek refuge in another country.\n\nWhen asylum-seekers arrive at the U.S. border, they're entitled to an interview to determine whether they had a \"credible fear\" of persecution in their home country. A credible fear determination doesn't automatically grant asylum; it just means there is a significant possibility that a person is eligible for it.\n\nIn other words, it's a very early stage in the asylum process. But Sessions, and Trump, wanted to make sure that victims of domestic and gang violence couldn't even get that far.\n\nSullivan also wasn't happy with the Trump administration for more or less telling federal judges that their decisions don't matter. Sessions' policy memorandum essentially ordered asylum officers to ignore federal court decisions and instead apply only the policy Sessions had announced.\n\nIn the end, Sullivan struck down almost the entirety of the administration's policy, saying that there was no legal basis for the new rules. Sullivan also enjoined the government, permanently, from enforcing these policies.\n\nAnd finally, Sullivan ruled that the plaintiffs who had already been deported back to their home countries have to be brought back to the United States and given a chance to proceed through the normal asylum process, with no unnecessary barriers for victims of domestic and gang violence.\n\nIt's a massive victory for human rights, and yet another reminder that the policies of the Trump administration are both morally and legally indefensible.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

That will do much to put out the flame... of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony. Fake News Must End!\"\n\nIncapable of showing empathy and compassion during a time of national crisis, Trump is continuing to demonstrate that his hatred of the press far outweighs any anger he has at right-wing domestic terrorists who have unleashed their violence over the last week.\n\nThe message, even by Trump's non-existent standards, is stunning \u2014 \"peace and harmony\" in this country is only possible when the press changes how it covers Trump.\n\nThe dangerous message comes two days after an anti-Semitic radical, incensed by the caravan of refugees that Trump has been hyping relentlessly, killed 11 victims, and injured several others, inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh \u2014 reportedly shouting, \"All Jews must die.\"\n\nIt was the deadliest anti-Jewish killing in U.S. history.\n\nThe gun massacre followed last week's pipe bomb plot, where a fanatical Trump follower send bombs through to the U.S. mail to 13 high-profile targets of Trump's hate, as well as a deadly shooting in Kentucky, where two black senior citizens were murdered in a grocery store by an apparent white supremacist.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump immediately blamed the Pittsburgh victims, telling reporters that if the synagogue had \"protection,\" perhaps not so many people would have died.\n\nSince then, Trump has moved onto to blaming the press, suggesting news organizations are responsible for creating political unrest.\n\nWhether delusional Trump actually believes it, or is just spreading the hateful rhetoric for political purposes, his message for the last week has been clear: The press is to blame for the pipe bomb threats sent to people Trump has attacked, for the synagogue massacre, and for any other instances of political violence.\n\nIt's classic projection, considering Trump himself bears so much responsibility for the rising body count in this country, just a week before Americans go to the polls.\n\nIt's Trump who has drowned his supporters with dangerous rhetoric about America under siege from liberal forces. It's Trump who maniacally turns journalists into targets with his unhinged attacks, using the phrase \"enemy of the people\" to describe the free press.\n\nAnd it's Trump's Republican Party that has been pushing anti-Semitic campaign messages this season.\n\nPerhaps even more dangerous is Trump's threat that the violence will continue unless the news media alter their coverage of him. He made the same explicit threat amid last week's attempted bombings.\n\nIt's increasingly clear that Trump welcomes the threat of violence in American politics.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But states whose unemployment rates are at least 20 percent higher than the national rate can apply to waive the work requirement, so that families can keep putting food on the table even during a localized economic downturn.\n\nBut Trump wants to change all that.\n\n\"The USDA is now proposing that states could waive the requirement only in areas where unemployment is above 7 percent,\" the Post reports. That's a huge increase from about 4.5 percent under the current rule and the current national unemployment rate.\n\nMore than 750,000 people who receive food assistance live in areas that would lose the waivers. Those people will have to jump through unnecessary bureaucratic hoops in order to feed their families, and could even risk losing their benefits.\n\nWhat's more, Trump is trying to use his executive power to subvert the will of Congress.\n\nTrump begged Congress to pass the harsher food stamp work requirements using the farm bill, and Republicans like failed retiring Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) tried to do Trump's bidding.\n\nIn the end, however, Democrats stood united against this cruelty, and Ryan didn't have enough GOP votes to make them budge. The final farm bill was a victory for compassion and a defeat for Republicans.\n\nBut what Congress failed to do through proper legislative channels, Trump is now trying to do on his own.\n\nThat's not how executive rulemaking is supposed to work, said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), the lead Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n\n\"Congress writes laws, and the administration is required to write rules based on the law,\" Stabenow told the Post. \"Administrative changes should not be driven by ideology. I do not support unilateral and unjustified changes that would take food away from families.\"\n\nThe cruel food stamp proposal is far from the first attempt by Trump and Republicans to attack the poorest members of our society.\n\nThe GOP spent months crafting a disastrous health care bill that would have kicked millions of families off their health insurance.\n\nAfter that effort failed, Ryan rallied Republicans behind an unpopular tax scam that showered even more wealth upon the richest one percent while leaving most families out in the cold.\n\nIn the Charles Dickens classic, \"A Christmas Carol,\" a person approaches the wealthy Ebeneezer Scrooge seeking a donation to help those in need. \"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time,\" the man pleads.\n\nScrooge scoffs that the poor should hurry up and die and \"decrease the surplus population.\"\n\nThe Republican Party, and especially Trump, seem to favor Scrooge's approach to Americans who are struggling.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Cummings also wants to know about email exchanges within the Department of Defense about \"mass graves\" relating to hurricanes.\n\nThe White House was not compliant with requests for information on Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner's use of private email accounts in their capacity as members of the administration. Cummings is demanding the public be given access to the relevant details and the possible violations of federal law.\n\nDemocrats want to know more details about how and why the Trump administration decided to rip immigrant families apart and jail young children in detention facilities.\n\nDetails on payments from foreign governments to the Trump Organization, which would personally benefit Trump and may even violate the Constitution, are also being requested in the inquiry.\n\nTrump's decision to grant security clearance to insiders who could not otherwise pass the existing process, like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, is another concern.\n\nTrump's cabinet secretaries are being asked to provide the details of the luxury travel accommodations they took at taxpayer expense.\n\nCummings wants to know more about how former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt misused his office for personal gain.\n\nThe letters also request additional information on the Flint water crisis, noncompliance with the Federal Records Act, and issues with protecting whistleblowers.\n\nDemocrats have made it clear that unlike Republicans, they will not give Trump a pass on corruption or evasiveness.\n\nTrump is now on notice that once Democrats retake control of the House, the government will be doing its job again \u2014 and keeping a close eye on him.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump peddled his phony claims about a War on Christmas while addressing American troops overseas.\n\nWith a barren display case of accomplishments this year, Donald Trump has turned to his supposed victory in the imaginary war on Christmas and touts it as perhaps his greatest cultural accomplishment from the Oval Office.\n\nPerhaps it makes sense that a guy who skipped the Vietnam War with a sore foot would consider his leadership in the so-called War on Christmas to be among his most important victories to date.\n\nTrump even bragged about the yuletide victory while addressing U.S. troops stationed around the world.\n\n\"I just want to wish everybody a very, very Merry Christmas. We say Merry Christmas, again, very, very proudly,\" Trump announced during a teleconference from his Mar-a-Lago manner in Florida on Christmas Eve. \"We're going to have a great year, an incredible year.\"\n\nA group of American veterans quickly called Trump out and condemned him for trying to politicize a universal day of thanks giving.\n\nPoliticizing a religious holiday for personal gain. Are you really trying to divide our military on Christmas? https://t.co/2otIIbnyYL \u2014 VoteVets (@votevets) December 25, 2017\n\nThe idea that Trump would use a chance to speak with American troops at Christmastime to peddle a phony claim about the nation's predominant religion being under attack in the United States indicates just how little respect he has for the military.\n\nThe whole Fox News-sponsored War on Christmas is yet another cultural tug-of-war that Trump and conservative ideologues are clearly losing. From Newsweek:\n\nIn 2012, the number of Americans who demanded shopkeepers and store staff greet them with \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d and those who did not care either way, were neck and neck, 43 percent to 45 percent, respectively. According to the latest survey, 52 percent no longer cared about the season\u2019s greetings in shops, while only 32 percent clung to the \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d proclamation.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent Pew Poll indicates that Christmas itself is seen increasingly as more of a cultural holiday in the United States, and less of a religious one. In fact, just half of Americans planned on attending church on Christmas this year.\n\nYet in a creepy, Orwellian turn last week, a pro-Trump campaign group released a video of Americans thanking Trump, and one of them was a little girl thanking Trump for \"letting us say Merry Christmas again.\"\n\nNo president has ever tried to stop Americans from saying \"Merry Christmas.\" But only Trump has tried to score cheap political points off the feel-good greeting."

    "text": "Trump is staffing up the government for an effort to strip citizenship from naturalized immigrants.\n\nThe Trump administration is working to ramp up an immigration policy, similar to actions taken during the Red Scare of the 1950s, to strip citizenship from naturalized Americans.\n\nUnder the guise of purportedly unearthing people who lied on their citizenship applications, the Trump team is hiring several dozen lawyers and immigration officers for the new effort at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\nUSCIS head Director L. Francis Cissna told the Associated Press that \"potentially a few thousand cases\" would be targeted.\n\nColumbia University professor Mae Ngai explained to NPR that \"the last time the federal government tried to denaturalize citizens was during the McCarthy period,\" noting, \"they went after people who they were accusing of being Communists who were naturalized citizens.\"\n\nIn the 1950s, the smear campaign engineered by Sen. Joe McCarthy (R-WI) alleged Communist infiltration throughout the American government. He hounded people, and in some cases destroyed their careers and personal lives.\n\nMcCarthy was eventually censured by the Senate and condemned for conduct \"contrary to senatorial traditions.\"\n\nPutting it lightly, Ngai told the outlet \"most people\" would agree the Red Scare \"was not the nation's proudest moment.\"\n\nThe professor also told NPR that the violations Trump is ramping up to pursue are \"rare,\" and \"compared to the numbers of people who are naturalized every year, it is a relatively small number.\"\n\nThe Trump administration lacks credibility in narrowing the scope of immigration enforcement. It recently enacted a \"zero tolerance\" policy for border crossers that led to thousands of children being separated from their parents.\n\nSenior Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who has been the architect behind many of the administration's immigration initiatives, has expressed zealotry on the topic.\n\nMiller has publicly argued that the famous Emma Lazarus poem affixed to the Statue of Liberty welcoming immigrants to America was unrelated to the statue itself.\n\nConsidering Trump and his party's broad attack on immigrants, the argument that a new operation seeking to strip citizenship from people who have gone through the process will be limited in scope lacks credibility.\n\nInstead it is another front in Trump's assault on immigrants, making people who have sworn loyalty and allegiance to the United States look over their shoulders in fear, worrying that they will be next on Trump's hit list.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Ryan avoided discussing the reality of his tax scam and the record-breaking deficit.\n\nRetiring Speaker Paul Ryan presided over a massive increase to the federal deficit, an attempt to kick more than 20 million people off of their health insurance, and a failed tax scam that was so unpopular it helped cost his Republican Party the House majority in the 2018 midterms.\n\nSo naturally, an oblivious, self-important Ryan used his farewell speech at the Library of Congress to pat himself on the back. Maybe he figured no one else would.\n\nSpeaking about the tax scam, Ryan said it was \"something I worked on my entire adult life, and it is something that will help to improve people's lives for a long time to come.\" If by \"people\" Ryan means \"Wall Street bankers,\" then yes, he is correct.\n\nSince the tax scam passed Congress nearly a year ago, Wall Street banks have seen record profits, thanks to massive tax breaks championed by Ryan and his Republican colleagues (the bill passed with zero support from Democrats).\n\nBut American families have not seen much improvement. Wages have been stagnant or barely increasing after adjusting for inflation. And most of the tax breaks Ryan rammed through go to help the richest 1 percent of families. In a few short years, millions of low- and middle-income families will end up paying higher taxes because of the new law.\n\nIf Ryan was really concerned about \"people's lives for a long time to come,\" he probably would have stuck to his original promise of keeping the tax scam revenue-neutral. But instead, he financed the congressional kickbacks to wealthy corporations by adding nearly $2 trillion to the deficit, something that will certainly not improve anyone's life in the years to come.\n\nFurther, Ryan bragged about improving the economy over his time as House speaker.\n\n\"Three years ago, when we last gathered in this hall, we began a great journey,\" Ryan said. \"To set our nation on a better path. To move our economy from stagnation to growth.\"\n\nBut as CNN notes, job growth has slowed during the first two years of the Trump administration compared to the last few years of President Obama's. Yet another Ryan failure to add to the growing pile.\n\nIn perhaps the most cowardly portion of his speech, Ryan bemoaned the current level of coarse discourse that dominates politics.\n\nThis kind of politics starts from a place of outrage, and seeks to tear us down from there. So \u2026 how do we get back to aspiration and inclusion, where we start with humility, and seek to build on that? I don\u2019t know the answer to that.\n\nBut Ryan spent eight years during the Obama administration stoking outrage and coddling the the most racist elements of the tea party. With the rise of Trump, Ryan fully emerged from his cocoon of cowardice into a sad, limp, spineless sycophant who regularly refused to speak forcefully against him.\n\nIn place of any attempts to \"get back to aspiration and inclusion,\" Ryan was silently complicit in all of Trump's most divisive outbursts, so long as he could get support for tax cuts for Wall Street billionaires.\n\nIn the end, \"failure\" is too kind a moniker to attach to Ryan's congressional career. As one of his longtime friends anonymously told the Washington Post, \"Paul doesn't want to believe it's all as bad as it is.\"\n\nIt is, Paul. It's that bad and worse.\n\nThankfully, Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi is on her way to clean up the mess he left behind. Farewell, and good riddance to Ryan's congressional career.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Wisconsin has seen the number of licensed dairies drop by about 1,200 since 2016.\n\nIn a desperate ploy to offset the financial pain he had caused farmers, Trump pledged billions of dollars in bailout money.\n\nFarmers blasted the idea initially. And since then, the pathetically slow rollout of funds has been described as \"too little, too late.\"\n\nFarmers aren't the only ones suffering. Manufacturing is also taking a hit as companies like Harley-Davidson and GM close factories across the country.\n\nTrump once boasted that trade wars are easy to win, but his blustering incompetence is bankrupting families and hurting the American economy.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The NRA is hurting financially \u2014 and may be forced to shut down NRA TV, its propaganda network \u2014 thanks to a wave of activism led by the Parkland shooting survivors.\n\nThe NRA admitted in a recent court filing that it's hurting financially thanks to activism by the teenage survivors of the Parkland school massacre. And the financial blow is severe enough that the gun extremist group's propaganda outlet, NRA TV, might be forced to shut down.\n\nThe NRA is currently suing New York governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York Department of Financial Services. The NRA alleges that a recent order by Cuomo, inspired by campaigning by Parkland survivors, has hurt the NRA's bottom line and may even make it legally impossible for the group to operate as usual.\n\nCuomo's April order directed the Financial Services department to urge New York insurance and financial companies to evaluate any relationships they have with the NRA, and to \"consider whether such ties harm their corporate reputations and jeopardize public safety.\"\n\n\"New York may have the strongest gun laws in the country, but we must push further to ensure that gun safety is a top priority for every individual, company, and organization that does business across the state,\" Cuomo said at the time.\n\nIn its legal filing, the NRA complains that Cuomo's actions have made it impossible for the group to renew its media liability insurance. Without that policy in hand, the NRA now says that it may be forced to shut down NRA TV or its print publications.\n\nThe NRA also says that without the insurance, it \"cannot maintain\" its physical premises or \"convene off-site meetings and events.\"\n\nThe teenage shooting survivors, working together as part of the March for Our Lives movement, pushed for changes like the one Cuomo implemented. The Trace notes, \"Cuomo\u2019s order came in the midst of a wave of activism following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.\"\n\nNew York also handed out $8 million in fines against Chubb and Lockton Affinity, insurance companies that soon stopped doing business with the NRA. The companies previously underwrote the NRA \"Carry Guard\" program, which was supposed to cover legal fees and liabilities stemming from self-defense shootings.\n\nThe NRA was reportedly relying on the money from the insurance program to help make up for revenue it would no longer be able to bring in with Trump in the White House as its ally.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, the NRA used fearmongering about gun confiscation and legislation that was never proposed, let alone implemented, to get flush with cash from donations made by its fearful members.\n\nThe news about NRA TV is the latest in an ongoing sequence of negative stories for the gun extremists.\n\nMaria Butina, an NRA member and gun activist, was recently charged with spying on behalf of Russia while trying to infiltrate American politics.\n\nAt the same time, the connection between the NRA and Russian money, donated to influence the 2016 election in the hopes of helping Trump win, is being investigated.\n\nThe NRA even attempted to hurt retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods, which decided to stop selling military-style assault rifles \u2014 but that effort backfired. Instead of the losses the NRA predicted, Dick's actually beat earnings estimates.\n\nEnabling mass shootings by opposing gun safety legislation isn't working out so well for the NRA.\n\nActivists, led by the Florida teenagers, are making it toxic to do business with the NRA \u2014 and that's having a real effect on the group's bottom line.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Times.\n\nThe increase of more than a quarter million uninsured children is unsettling according to report author Joan Alker.\n\n\"With an improving economy and low unemployment rate, the fact that our nation is going backwards on children's health coverage is very troubling,\" Akler writes about the new findings.\n\nThe reason for the increase is not hard to find: Trump and Republicans have made repeated attempts to undermine the country's health care system.\n\n\"2017 was a year of constant news about the President and Congress wanting to take coverage away \u2014 first with the attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and make drastic cuts to Medicaid,\" writes Alker.\n\nIn addition, the Republican-led Congress allowed funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) lapse in late 2017.\n\nAround the same time, \"the Trump Administration began efforts to sabotage the ACA's Marketplace including cuts to advertising, outreach and enrollment funding for navigators \u2014 who were playing an important role connecting families with public coverage, with the repeal efforts raising insurer uncertainty and driving up premiums,\" writes Akler.\n\nRepublican efforts to undermine America's health care system were a major campaign issue in the 2018 midterms. While Trump sought to use bigotry and anti-immigrant racism to turn out the Republican base, Democrats across the country focused on protecting health care.\n\nIn the end, voters overwhelmingly backed Democrats, in hopes of stopping any further damage inflicted by two years of complete Republican control.\n\nRepublican sabotage already led to roughly 270,000 more uninsured children. Democrats will work to ensure Republicans can't hurt any more children, and will take steps to try to fix the damage.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And during the inaugural planning process, ProPublica reports, she was involved in negotiating the price that the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., charged the inaugural committee to rent spaces out for events.\n\nThat price was apparently much too high. One top inaugural planner emailed Ivanka and other officials at the Trump Organization to express \"concern\" that the hotel was overcharging \u2014 and that it could be a problem \"when this is audited.\"\n\n\"If the Trump hotel charged more than the going rate for the venues, it could violate tax law,\" ProPublica noted.\n\nMarcus Owens, former head of the IRS division overseeing nonprofits, told ProPublica, \"The fact that the inaugural committee did business with the Trump Organization raises huge ethical questions about the potential for undue enrichment.\"\n\nTrump's inauguration is already under criminal investigation. The Wall Street Journal reports that the U.S. attorney in Manhattan is investigating whether \"top donors gave money in exchange for access to the incoming Trump administration, policy concessions or to influence official administration positions.\"\n\nThe Trump inauguration committee raised nearly $107 million from corporate donors and conservative supporters. That is nearly twice the money raised by President Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009, which had far more people in attendance.\n\n\"How the inaugural committee managed to spend all the money it raised remains a mystery, nearly two years after the event,\" ProPublica noted.\n\nIf Ivanka was running a grifting operation to make her family richer, that would help explain the mystery.\n\nAnd this wouldn't be the first time Ivanka has helped with her father's scams.\n\nAnother investigation by ProPublica and WNYC found that Ivanka and other Trump family members routinely misled buyers and investors on Trump Organization real estate projects. In order to attract more money and outside investment, the Trumps overstated how many units had been sold and lied about how much stake the Trump family had in the projects.\n\nDonald Trump has profited from his presidency in many ways since refusing to divest from his holdings in the Trump Organization.\n\nTrump personally benefits when entities like his own presidential campaign, the Republican National Committee (RNC), super PACs, or other campaigns or party committees do business with the Trump Organization.\n\nTrump's D.C. hotel has been charging a premium over other similarly situated hotels since Trump took office. It has also been one of the primary conduits for those seeking influence with Trump to funnel money to him.\n\nTrump's family, including his children, also benefit from this corruption.\n\nAnd corruption \u2014 including the kind of fraudulent overcharging Ivanka allegedly directed \u2014 has long been a feature of how the Trump family does business.\n\nWhen Donald Trump and his siblings co-owned a company that paid vendors working for his father, Fred Trump, they used that same company to bill their father an inflated price for those same services. This was a vehicle for Fred Trump to give his children money, tax-free.\n\nThe Trump family corruption racket didn't stop when they transitioned to politics. And the new revelations about the inaugural committee show that the full truth about this corruption \u2014 including potential illegal activity \u2014 has yet to be revealed to the American people.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Bush in 1988 \u2014 except this new ad was approved by Trump himself.\n\nIt's not quite clear why Fox News is suddenly shying away from airing odious and hateful commentary. Rupert Murdoch's fear-mongering outlet has led the effort to demonize and dehumanize a group of migrants and refugees who are slowly traveling to the U.S. border \u2014 many or most of whom won't end up completing the journey.\n\nFox host Sean Hannity has tried to terrify viewers by baselessly claiming that the traveling migrants were \"planning to firebomb anybody that gets in their way,\" while Fox's Jeanine Pirror ramped up the reckless hysteria by suggesting the refugees were \"pedophiles,\" \"career criminals,\" and \"people who think they can beat their wives.\"\n\nOutside of the Fox News hate bubble, however, Trump's ad was widely and swiftly condemned \u2014 even by mainstream outlets that are typically reluctant to label something \"racist.\"\n\n\"The Trump campaign ad is the latest example of the President's willingness to lie and fear-monger in order to tear at racial and societal divides; to embrace demagoguery to bolster his own political power and the cause of the Republican midterm campaign,\" CNN reported last week under the headline, \"Trump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms.\"\n\nCNN has refused to air the ad as a paid commercial.\n\nNBC, however, did air the ad Sunday night. After coming under intense criticism for that, NBC announced Monday that the company recognizes \u201cthe insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThere's no word yet on how much money NBC pocketed from Republicans for the ad buy \u2014 which ran during NBC's highly-rated \"Sunday Night Football,\" seen by more than 20 million people this week.\n\nFacebook also announced Monday that it was yanking the ad from its site.\n\nThe good news is that major television news outlets are refusing to run the odious ad. The bad news is that some of them gave the commercial lots of free TV time last week in reporting on it as news.\n\n\"In the two days since the president posted the ad, CNN aired the clip with its audio at least 19 different times, totaling more than seven minutes of free airtime for the video between the network\u2019s normal programming and reruns,\" the Daily Beast reports.\n\nMedia outlets need to be more vigilant than ever to make sure they don't help Trump traffic in hate.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "More and more children are at risk of unauthorized drugging, hunger, dehydration and physical assault in shelters and detention centers, thanks to Trump's cruel border policies.\n\nChildren being held in immigration detention have been subject to drugging without parental consent, a dangerous practice more children are likely to encounter thanks to Trump.\n\nThe decision to prosecute all border crossers and rip families apart as a result means more children have been sent to detention facilities. In some of these facilities, reports indicate drugging children to control their behavior without parental consent.\n\nProPublica reports that since children in the shelters are alone and unaware where their parents are, staffers at facilities have acted \"unilaterally, imposing psychotropic drugs on children who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re taking or what its effects may be.\"\n\nDr. Amy Cohen, a psychiatrist, told the outlet the medications are a danger to children \"with growing brains and growing bodies,\" and highlighted the danger parental absence can have on well-being.\n\nFive immigrants under 18 who said they were drugged have sued Alex Azar, the current head of the Department of Health and Human Services. (Azar has taken the lead in publicly spinning the administration's attempt to hold on to abducted children.)\n\nThe danger of unauthorized drugging is just one of many issues that are the subject of legal action.\n\nA new court filing details horrifying allegations about how migrant children are being treated at detention centers. Hunger, dehydration, sleeplessness and \"routine\" physical assault are among the conditions children are allegedly being exposed to.\n\nPeter Schey, director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, said reports from children in the centers paint a picture of \"enforced hunger, enforced dehydration, enforced sleeplessness, coupled with insults and fairly routine physical assaults.\"\n\nSchey added, \"It all amounts to treatment that\u2019s probably in violation of domestic and international law.\"\n\nThe Trump administration decided to break with previous Republican and Democratic administrations to implement a 'zero tolerance' policy that included mandatory family separations. It's meant that thousands of people \u2014 including young children \u2014 have been forced into detention centers.\n\nThe Texas Observer reports that the families detail disgusting conditions in the facilities: \"overflowing toilets, chronic sleep deprivation, lack of basic hygiene products, and air conditioning cranked so high that children shiver constantly, their clothes sometimes still wet from crossing the Rio Grande.\"\n\nA mother of two said the water they were expected to drink at the facility smelled badly: \"I had to plug my nose to be able to drink it.\"\n\nA 10-year-old Honduran girl testified that in the facility she was held in there were \"large numbers of girls, some of whom had to sleep on concrete and sitting up.\" She was given a \"frozen ham sandwich,\" but \"the ham was black.\" She took a bite but was unable to eat the rest.\n\nA 17-year-old Honduran boy said Border Patrol officers at the facility treated teenage migrants \"worse than dogs.\"\n\nAnother lawsuit, filed in federal court in Miami, alleges that an 11-year-old in an immigration center for minors was kept in a room with a bully who cracked his head open.\n\nGeremy Asig-Putul was separated from his mother, Otilia Asig-Putul, at the border in May.\n\nWhen he was bullied, the lawsuit alleges that staff at the facility told him \"stop complaining.\"\n\nAfter a 14-year-old bully tripped Geremy, causing him to hit his head on a metal bed frame and bleed, his mother was not told. Instead he was stitched up and put back in the room with his assailant.\n\nOtilia Asig-Putul said of her son's treatment, \"A little bit more and they would have given my son back to me in a small wooden box.\"\n\nThe immigration detention system has had problems and deficiencies for some time, but now that Trump has flooded the system with families, hundreds more are in for suffering, indignity, and possibly worse.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A House committee started a bipartisan inquiry into Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner's private email accounts. Republicans dropped it before the truth could be discovered.\n\nRepublicans in Congress were alerted to Ivanka Trump's improper use of private email for government business over a year ago \u2014 but they failed to conduct a proper investigation or subpoena the White House over it.\n\nA bombshell Washington Post report revealed Monday that Ivanka Trump has used a private email account to send hundreds of messages to government officials since December of 2016. The practice may be in violation of the Presidential Records Act, which requires government business to be conducted over official accounts so the information can be preserved.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Post reported, the Trump White House knew about this behavior \u2014 and tried to shield Ivanka Trump from scrutiny by attributing the account to her husband, Jared Kushner, to avoid the scandal of Trump\u2019s daughter doing the same thing that Trump spent his entire campaign demonizing Hillary Clinton for.\n\nBut White House officials weren\u2019t the only ones covering for Ivanka Trump.\n\nOver a year ago, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, pushed for the couple to come clean about their email misuse.\n\nYet Republicans, who led the committee, refused to do their constitutionally mandated duty of providing oversight of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThis actually started as a bipartisan investigation last year that the Republicans subsequently dropped,\u201d a senior Democratic staff member on the Oversight Committee told Shareblue Media. \u201cWe plan to continue our investigation of the Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act, and we want to know if Ivanka complied with the law.\u201d\n\nWhile the extent of Ivanka Trump's use of the account was unknown at the time, it was known that both she and Kushner were using a private domain belonging to the Kushner family.\n\nIn a September 2017 letter, Cummings directed Kushner to preserve the communications he and his wife had sent using the private server.\n\nYet after the letter was sent, the couple reportedly tried to throw critics off their trail by rerouting their personal email accounts through a server operated by the Trump Organization.\n\nCummings once again publicly called them out for this. He told the couple, along with the Trump Organization, to preserve their emails and contacts, and asked the FBI to conduct a security review of their private email use.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) was the chairman of the House Oversight Committee during this back and forth, and he was intimately aware of what Cummings was asking for.\n\nIn fact, Gowdy and Cummings sent a joint letter to the White House asking for documents on Ivanka and Jared\u2019s use of private email accounts.\n\nBut Republicans completely failed to follow up on the investigation.\n\nThe White House orchestrated a briefing for the committee on the emails, but did not disclose the extent of Jared and Ivanka's email usage.\n\nInstead of using his power to seek the truth, however, Gowdy accepted the White House's whitewash and claimed the administration was in \"full compliance\" with the joint records request.\n\nCummings blasted the committee\u2019s Republicans for their inaction in a letter to Gowdy.\n\n\"If you decide to follow-through on your proposed course of action, the committee essentially will be abdicating its oversight responsibilities under the Constitution by walling off the White House from serious congressional scrutiny,\" Cummings wrote.\n\nHe added that the GOP's actions were part of a \"troubling pattern of the Oversight Committee capitulating to the Trump White House rather than exercising its independent authority to conduct oversight of the executive branch.\"\n\nCummings once again called out Republicans for their inaction in March of this year. He pushed Gowdy to subpoena the White House and force it to produce documents it had been withholding.\n\nThe new report from the Post reveals that Cummings was right to be concerned about a cover-up, and confirms that Republican leaders in Congress failed to do their jobs.\n\nGowdy also led the House GOP\u2019s \u201cinvestigation\u201d into the Benghazi attack, which wasted two and a half years and nearly $8 million trying and failing to pin blame for the attack on Hillary Clinton.\n\nYet when it came to investigating the Trump administration, Gowdy simply stood down.\n\nWith Benghazi, Republicans believed they had a potent line of attack against Clinton and used the investigation to that end, even though they had no good evidence to back up their attacks.\n\nBut since they apparently see no political upside to holding Trump accountable, Republicans have been willing to avoid evidence implicating Trump\u2019s daughter in a potential scandal.\n\nVoters got fed up with Republicans\u2019 refusal to do even rudimentary oversight of Trump, and that frustration helped fuel the blue wave that gave Democrats control of the House\u2019s investigative powers.\n\nNow Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, along with the rest of the Trump administration, will have to deal with congressional leaders who aren't likely to give them a free pass on corruption like Republicans did.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Thanks to Trump's trade war, thousands of auto workers may get pink slips in their stockings this year.\n\nAfter Trump's ill-advised trade war cost GM $1 billion, the auto manufacturer is announcing that it will cut thousands of jobs and may close several factories.\n\n\"General Motors will lay off 14,700 factory and white-collar workers in North America and put five plants up for possible closure,\" the Associated Press reports.\n\nThese plans are not final, the AP notes, as GM is still in talks with the United Auto Workers union.\n\nBut the shocking announcement comes at the start of the holiday season, just as these workers may be preparing to celebrate with their families.\n\nGM's move also comes after Trump's tariffs on imported steel reportedly cost the company $1 billion.\n\nOne of the factories up for possible closure is a plant in Warren, Michigan \u2014 the same city where Trump held a 2016 campaign rally and promised that if he was elected, \"You won't lose one plant.\"\n\nOther factories that could be closed or severely impacted are in Detroit, Baltimore, and Lordstown, Ohio.\n\nInstead of the prosperity he promised, Trump's policies are leading to pink slips.\n\nGM isn't the only iconic American company that has been hurt by Trump's failed trade war.\n\nEarlier this year, Harley-Davidson announced that because Trump's reckless tariffs would have cost the company around $100 million annually, the motorcycle giant was moving some of its manufacturing overseas.\n\nAs he usually does when someone dares to criticize him, Trump threw a tantrum and lashed out at Harley-Davidson.\n\nTrump's trade war is also wreaking havoc on American farmers, whose access to overseas markets has been crippled by Trump's policies. As a result, some farmers are plowing under their crops instead of harvesting them.\n\nTrump promised billions to bail out these farmers, but only a tiny percentage of the money has actually been distributed. And even if the funds were fully distributed, many farmers say it's not a real solution to the problem.\n\nIn Grinch-like fashion, Trump is ruining the holidays for thousands of families.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was grilled for hours about the horrible and harmful treatment of families she has allowed.\n\nSecretary Kirstjen Nielsen was called to appear before the House Judiciary Committee Thursday, and she got an earful from Democrats who wanted her to answer for the multiple abuses she has enabled in her department.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) started off by criticizing the Trump administration's policy of separating families at the border.\n\n\"On what planet can a humane, democratic country deport parents without giving them the opportunity to have their children with them? And without maintaining records so you could identify them afterwards?\" Nadler asked.\n\n\"The fact that this was handled so poorly,\" he continued, \"that some separated children have yet to be reunited with their parents, is unacceptable. Mass kidnapping by the federal government is criminal.\"\n\nNielsen is the most senior official under Trump, responsible for the execution of the racist and cruel family separation policy.\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) told Nielsen the way she has gone about her job \"makes it seem like you agree\" with Tucker Carlson, the conservative Fox News host under fire for pushing hateful white supremacist messages. Carlson has said immigrants make America \"poorer, and dirtier, and more divided.\"\n\nGutierrez called out Nielsen for lying in July when she tweeted, \"We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.\"\n\nThe congressman awarded Nielsen \"the all-time record for lying\" for that false statement. He described the callous policy as \"repugnant.\"\n\n\"Thank God there wasn't a wall that stopped [Jesus] from seeking refuge in Egypt,\" noting Christmas is just days away. \"Thank God there wasn't an administration there like this, or he too would have perished.\"\n\nHe concluded, \"Shame on us for wearing our badge of Christianity during Christmas and allow the secretary to come here and lie.\"\n\nAngrily, Nielsen said \"calling me a liar are [sic] fighting words\" and whined, \"I'm not a liar.\" As she continued to once again lie about her statement, Gutierrez walked out of the hearing room in disgust.\n\nAs the hearing drew to a close, Nielsen's inability to report to Congress on basic data about her job came into question.\n\nRep. David Cicilline (D-RI) incredulously asked Nielsen, \"As you sit here today, you do not know how many human beings have died while in the custody of the department that you lead? And in preparation for today's hearing you didn't ascertain that number? You don't know it today?\"\n\n\"I don't have an exact figure for you,\" Nielsen responded.\n\n\"I'm talking about people that have died in your custody,\" Cicilline emphasized. Nielsen merely promised to get back to him at a later date.\n\nAfter Nielsen's incompetence and cruelty had been thoroughly exposed over the course of two and a half hours, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), the committee's chairman who is retiring from Congress, lauded her as a \"great secretary of Homeland Security.\"\n\nThe praise was a fitting end to the year, as it highlighted the GOP's failure to provide serious oversight of the Trump administration, even on matters that should be nonpartisan, like the kidnapping and death of children.\n\nBut Republicans failed to fulfill that constitutional duty, and voters punished them for it, allowing Democrats to pick up 40 House seats and putting Republicans back in the minority.\n\nIn January, when Democrats take control of the House, Nadler will become chair of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "After Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned, another former defense secretary said Trump has betrayed American interests.\n\nHours after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis submitted his scathing resignation letter to Trump Thursday, a man who once held the same position called out Trump's lack of fitness for the Oval Office.\n\nWilliam Cohen, a Republican who represented Maine in the House and Senate and served as secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton, went on CNN to talk about the Mattis resignation. He was asked a blunt question: \"Is the president fit to be commander in chief, in your view?\"\n\nCohen answered simply, \"In my judgement, no.\"\n\nCohen went on, elaborating on how Trump has betrayed the interests of the United States of America.\n\n\"When it comes to the national security and the way he is dealing with our allies and the way he is betraying our interests, then I say no.\"\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mattis laid out stark differences in his own worldview and that of Trump. Whereas Mattis believes \"our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,\" Trump has spent two years alienating America's traditional allies.\n\n\"From the start, Trump and Mattis displayed starkly different attitudes toward long-standing American alliances,\" reports the Washington Post. \"Trump threw Starburst candies on the table in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and berated British Prime Minister Theresa May; Mattis flew around the world thanking such allies for their contributions to American security.\"\n\nWhereas Mattis knows \"we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours,\" such as Russia, Trump scrapes and bows before dictators like Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe final straw for Mattis appears to be Trump's abrupt withdrawal of American troops from Syria. Trump made the decision without going through a thorough process to weigh the risks and outcomes, and over Mattis' objections, according to the Post. Mattis and many others feared the withdrawal would be seen as a victory for Russia and Iran.\n\nEven Fox News was forced to admit that Trump's impulsive decision on Syria is a big win for Russia.\n\nTrump's reckless behavior is driving away one of the few respected members of his Cabinet, and leading even more people to conclude that he truly is unfit for office.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Everyone except Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who praised \"Donald\" for making \"the right decision.\"\n\nTrump's decision to hand Russia a win on the world stage was so egregious that even the right-wing pro-Trump Fox News was appalled.\n\nOn Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on \"Fox & Friends\" to try to spin the administration's bumbling foreign policy. But co-host Brian Kilmeade wasn't buying it.\n\n\"Sarah, he's giving Russia a big win. Vladimir Putin praised him,\" Kilmeade said, clearly disappointed. \"He's also doing exactly what he criticized President Obama for doing. He said President Obama was the founder of ISIS. He just refounded ISIS.\"\n\nTrump \"is really on the griddle with this,\" Kilmeade concluded.\n\nEven as Sanders pushed back, insisting that Trump was in the right, Kilmeade shook his head and shot her down.\n\n\"The word on the ground is different from what you just said.\"\n\nSanders obviously didn't expect to face this sort of questioning from the usually Trump-friendly outlet. She has largely avoided the press in the last two months, holding only two press briefing. Her most recent briefing on Tuesday \u2014 apparently the last one she intends to hold in 2018 \u2014 was a mere 15 minutes long, and consisted largely of her attacking American law enforcement.\n\nRather than engage with real reporters, Sanders took the White House spin to the safe space of Fox \u2014 but that proved less safe than she expected, thanks to the latest Trump-created chaos.\n\nTrump is out of his depth, and Americans are less safe because of it. Americans know it, Democrats know it, his secretary of defense \u2014 who resigned Thursday with a blistering letter condemning Trump's reckless approach to the world \u2014 knows it, and now, even Fox News is saying it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "'This is a cowardly way to govern.'\n\nAfter yet another Trump tantrum, House Republicans caved to his demands Thursday and brought forward a government funding bill that included more than $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nRepublicans passed the bill by a vote of 217-185, with zero support from any Democratic members.\n\nFunding for much of the federal government ends at midnight on Dec. 21. The Senate had unanimously passed a bill the night before to fund the government at current levels through Feb. 7. But after Trump threatened \u2014 again \u2014 to shut down the government if he didn't get funding for a wall, failed House Speaker Ryan gave in to his demands and scheduled the new vote.\n\nRyan should be \"ashamed\" of his kowtowing to Trump's demands, said his former colleague, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). \"Why not allow a vote on a bipartisan Senate bill and let democracy work in the House?\" Van Hollen asked.\n\n\"This is a cowardly way to govern,\" he added.\n\nIn the event of a shutdown, which now seems much more likely, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, which favors funding Trump's wall, shrugged off concerns about federal employees not being paid so close to the holiday season.\n\n\"It's actually part of what you do when you sign up for any public service position,\" said Meadows, who will continue to be paid in the event of a shutdown.\n\nLast week, Trump met with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. In a televised humiliation of Trump, both Pelosi and Schumer insisted there was no congressional support for $5 billion to pay for a border wall. During that meeting, Trump bragged that he would be \"proud\" to own a government shutdown over the issue.\n\nA recent poll shows Americans don't support him on this and will blame Trump and the Republican Party if the government is shut down mere days before Christmas.\n\nMost senators had already left town before the House voted Thursday.\n\n\"In their view, they've done their job and now it's up to the House and the president to work something out,\" reports Politico, noting senators could fly back on short notice if another vote is necessary.\n\nThat's exactly what happened to Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz. After he flew all the way back to his home state of Hawaii, he spent only 17 minutes with his family and then hopped on a plane back to Washington, D.C. When he landed, Schatz tweeted, \"Wheels down IAD [Dulles airport] ready to vote no on this stupid wall.\"\n\nThere is virtually no chance the House bill will pass in the Senate. If Trump and his complicit Republican cronies refuse to do their job and fund the government, the Trump Shutdown starts at midnight Friday.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Funding for much of the federal government expires at midnight on Friday, Dec. 21.\n\nIn yet one more act of capitulation, failed Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) abandoned plans to support a clean continuation of funding that the Senate unanimously passed on Wednesday night.

    "text": "Trump is taking the government hostage for money to build a wall Americans don't even want.\n\nOn Friday, Trump woke up and resumed furiously and hysterically tweeting his demand for $5 billion to build a wall most Americans don't want.\n\n\"If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time,\" Trump tweeted early Friday morning, one of 14 tweets he sent in the span of just 24 hours on the subject. It doesn't matter to him that the majority of Americans don't consider Trump's vanity project on the border a priority.\n\nIt doesn't matter to him that his own party would rather pass a bill to keep the government funded and functioning without giving him $5 billion \u2014 and that members of his own party say he is making a catastrophic mess by threatening to shut down the government over his pet issue.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter to him that the bill can't get through the Senate. He has an idea for that too.\n\n\"Mitch, use the Nuclear Option and get it done! Our Country is counting on you!\" he tweeted Friday, demanding Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell deploy the \"nuclear option\" \u2014 ending the filibuster entirely \u2014 just to give Trump $5 billion.\n\nThe government is on the verge of a shutdown, despite both the House and Senate willing to pass a funding bill to avoid such a disaster. The only thing standing in the way is Trump and his dangerously fragile ego.\n\nLast week, Trump thought he would outsmart Democratic leaders by bullying them \u2014 on camera \u2014 into giving him $5 billion. It didn't work. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer fact-checked his ridiculous lies to his face, flatly refused to give in to his petulant demands, and even got him to accept full responsibility if the government does shut down.\n\n\"If we don\u2019t get what we want, one way or the other, whether it\u2019s through you, through a military, anything you want to call \u2014 I will shut down the government,\" Trump declared. \"And I am proud \u2014 and I\u2019ll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.\"\n\nTrump isn't getting what he wants. And if he doesn't agree to sign the short-term funding bill that both parties have already agreed to, he will shut down the government just days before Christmas.\n\nIt will be his fault and his responsibility. He's already admitted that himself. And ultimately, it will be up to him to give in because Democrats certainly are not going to betray the voters \u2014 who, again, do not support shutting down the government just to give Trump $5 billion.\n\nTrump thinks he is the world's greatest negotiator and deal-maker. But he's not. So now he's taking the government hostage in yet another sign of just how weak he actually is.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Earlier this year, Bill Barr sent a lengthy memo to the DOJ explaining why Trump shouldn't be investigated for obstruction. That alone should disqualify him from serving as attorney general.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last night that William Barr, Trump's pick for Attorney General, sent an unsolicited 20-page memo criticizing the Russia investigation to the Department of Justice back in June. It's a startling case of overreach and one that should disqualify him from becoming attorney general.\n\nThe memo itself is unsurprising, given the source. Barr doesn't believe Trump can be investigated for obstruction; he thinks the president should have full authority to fire whoever he wants for whatever he wants. Further, Barr argues, unless collusion can be proved first, Trump can't be on the hook for obstruction. From a purely legal standpoint, Barr is just pushing a theory he's pushed for 30 years: that the President should largely be able to do whatever he wants.\n\nWhat's startling here is that Barr thought it appropriate, as a past attorney general, to send a letter leaning on Rod Rosenstein, who considers Barr a role model, to try to get him to kill a duly-authorized investigation. The memo is also surreal because Barr begins by freely admitting that he doesn't know all the facts but then proceeds to opine about the law anyway.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer pointed out that Barr's views are \"deeply misguided\" and constituted an \"unproved attack.\" With that, says Schumer, Barr is \"unquestionably disqualifie[d]\" to serve as attorney general. At the very least, the matter should be robustly addressed during Barr's confirmation hearings, as the existence of the memo should worry both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nIt's unclear whether Barr shared this memo directly with Trump, giving Trump a potential strategy to follow, and serving as a sort of audition for the job. Barr had already spent a portion of 2017 writing op-eds calling for the investigation of Hillary Clinton instead of Trump. Trump definitely took notice, offering Barr a job as his personal attorney in the Russia probe.\n\nIn any normal setting, all of this would result in Barr's nomination being withdrawn, but these are not normal times.\n\nIt will probably take a couple months for Barr to get confirmed, which means that Matthew Whitaker remains acting attorney general. There was a question as to whether it was appropriate for Whitaker to oversee the Russia investigation, given his assertions that the investigation is a witch hunt. But Whitaker didn't bother to get a formal ruling about whether it would be a conflict. A senior DOJ ethics official did tell Whitaker that he should recuse, but senior appointed officials then told him he didn't need to do so. While Whitaker is on his way out the door, there's still enough time for him to kill the investigation or starve it of vital resources and personnel.\n\nTrump's acting attorney general and incoming attorney general seem to exist for one key purpose: protecting Trump from an investigation into the depths of his collusion and obstruction. And with a GOP-majority Senate, there's no reason to think Barr won't be confirmed and he get to work dismantling all that Mueller has carefully built.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "If the election were held today, Colorado's Sen. Cory Gardner would lose to a Democratic candidate.\n\nAfter Democrats took back the House in the 2018 election, some Democrats already have their eye on taking back the Senate in 2020. And one of the Republicans most vulnerable incumbents, Colorado's Sen. Cory Gardner, is already showing signs of weakness.\n\nA new poll from Change Research shows half of Colorado voters have unfavorable feelings toward Gardner, compared to only 38 percent with favorable feelings. Further, the poll shows that if the election were held today, Gardner would lose to a Democratic candidate by six points, 47 percent to 41 percent.\n\n\"Cory Gardner is in politically toxic territory,\" said Ian Silverii, executive director of ProgressNow Colorado, the group that commissioned the poll. \"Coloradans have had four years of experience with Cory Gardner as their Senator, and they don't like what they see,\" he added.\n\nGardner certainly faces a tough road ahead in an increasingly blue Colorado. In the 2018 midterms, Democrats won every major statewide race, kept control of the state House, and flipped control of the state Senate from red to blue. Additionally, Republican Rep. Mike Coffman's seat was one of more than 40 that Republicans lost as Democrats re-took control of the House of Representatives. Republicans did not flip any House seats from red to blue.\n\nDemocrats are so eager to oust Gardner that he already has one announced challenger, and more are sure to join the fray.\n\nIn the meantime, Gardner is showing no signs of distancing himself from Trump, even after the 2018 election results show a more progressive Colorado. As Trump lashes out against special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, Gardner still refuses to support bipartisan legislation to protect the investigation. And despite claiming to support the investigation, Gardner belittled the attempt by Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) as \"playing politics.\"\n\nImmediately after the 2018 midterms, the Denver Post reported that Republican operatives were worried Gardner was in trouble \"unless the party can develop a new message that appeals to both the Trump loyalists and the independent voters who dislike the president.\"\n\nOf course, this is only one poll, and the election is 23 months away. Even so, it looks like Gardner has an uphill battle in front of him.\n\n\"The results of the 2018 elections and this new poll send a clear message that Cory Gardner's time is running out,\" says Silverii.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans are already working on ways to make Trump look stronger than he is ahead of the 2020 election campaign.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican Party is considering a plan that would cancel their 2020 primary out of the apparent fear that a challenger for the party's presidential nomination would embarrass Trump.\n\nChairman Drew McKissick told the conservative Washington Examiner, \"Considering the fact that the entire party supports the president, we'll end up doing what\u2019s in the president's best interest.\"\n\nThe Examiner noted, \"incumbent presidents who faced primaries are in greater peril in the general election, a fact not lost on the Trump campaign and the GOP more broadly.\"\n\nIn 1992, the Iowa Republican Party chose not to have a presidential ballot as a maneuver to protect President George H.W. Bush. Despite that, he was challenged by Pat Buchanan in the New Hampshire primary, and Buchanan received 40 percent of the vote. The New York Times described the result as a \"less-than-impressive victory\" for Bush and was a \"roar of anger\" from the party.\n\nBush went on to win the nomination, but he was defeated by Bill Clinton and ended up being a one-term president.\n\nTrump clearly wants to avoid the same fate, and the concern from party bosses could reflect Republican fears of just that.\n\nWhile Trump might easily coast to a nomination win in 2020, a strong showing from a primary challenger could indicate serious vulnerability in the 2020 general election.\n\nAnd Trump is already extremely unpopular.\n\nHeading into the 1992 race, Bush had an approval rating in the low-40s. Trump's average approval right now is 42.4 percent and has never been above 46 percent.\n\nTrump also just presided over a 40-seat loss in the House and saw his party lose control over the legislature. Democrats outvoted Republicans by over 8.8 million votes \u2014a record \u2014 and Trump was not even officially on the ballot.\n\nIt is not a good sign for Trump and his prospects for re-election that Republicans are already discussing how to make 2020 easier for him.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Matt Bevin is deeply unpopular as he prepares for a tough 2019 election in Kentucky.\n\nWhile most Americans have to wait until 2020 to kick even more Republicans out of office, the people of Kentucky will have that opportunity in 2019, when Republican Gov. Matt Bevin is up for re-election.\n\nAnd judging by the latest poll, Bevin should be very worried.\n\nEleven months before the election, more than half of Kentuckians (53 percent) disapprove of Bevin's job performance, with a mere 38 percent approving, according to a Mason-Dixon poll.\n\nEven more worrying for Bevin, he trails by eight points, 40 to 48 percent, in a head-to-head match-up with one of the Democratic front-runners, Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear.\n\nBevin's tenure has been rocked by his reprehensible mishandling of massive teacher strikes in the state.\n\nKentucky teachers went on strike to fight for more education funding in April 2018, following Bevin's refusal to spend more in a state that ranks 35th in preparing high school graduates for college.\n\n\"I don't want to be out of my classroom,\" Stephanie Ikanovic, a teacher for 21 years, told the Associated Press at the time. \"I want to be in my classroom instructing future citizens, but I'm afraid that spending at the state level is getting worse and worse, and we need those dollars for a 21st century education.\"\n\nInstead of taking these concerns seriously, Bevin lashed out and bizarrely claimed the strike would lead to children getting molested.\n\n\"I guarantee you somewhere in Kentucky today a child was sexually assaulted that was left at home because there was nobody there to watch them,\" Bevin told a local TV station.\n\nBevin was roundly condemned for this smear. His remarks were called \"inappropriate and perverse\" by Mary Nishimuta, the executive director of the Kentucky Democratic Party, and \"disgusting\" by a state senator in Bevin's own party.\n\nWhile the Mason-Dixon pollsters say it's \"far from over\" for Bevin at this point, he'll need a lot of luck to win re-election \u2014 especially if he ends up facing a \"formidable opponent\" like Beshear.\n\n\"Bevin will need a boost out of the upcoming legislative session, hope that the national Democratic trend coming out of the 2018 mid-term ebbs and that Beshear makes some mistakes,\" the pollsters wrote.\n\nMore and more offices in deep-red states are no longer sure bets for Republicans to keep.\n\nIn 2017, Democrats won a Senate seat in Alabama. In 2018, Democrats won a governor's race in Kansas, and House seats in both Kansas and Utah.\n\nIn 2019, Kentucky could be the next nominally red state to contend with an energized progressive base of people who are tired of Trump acolytes like Matt Bevin.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Michigan Republicans have spent the lame duck session defying the will of the voters, but trying to strip power from the incoming secretary of state was so bad, even they realized it.\n\nThe Michigan GOP has had quite the lame duck session, gaining national attention for just how poorly the Republicans have behaved. As the session nears its end, at least one measure \u2014 one that would limit the power of incoming Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson \u2014 seems to be dead.\n\nBenson said in a statement that the \"hyper-partisan\" bill Republicans were pushing \"would have effectively ended the enforcement of Michigan's campaign finance law.\" She added that she is \"pleased the House Republicans appear to agree\" and decided to drop it.\n\nThat's not to say that the GOP hasn't already done serious damage in the session. They severely weakened the paid sick leave and minimum wage laws even though voters overwhelmingly supported the existing laws.\n\nAnd after a year where several progressive actions were taken via ballot initiative, the Michigan House just passed a bill that would make those initiatives much more difficult. Both legislative chambers passed a measure that drastically limits the ability of the state's new Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, to oversee the flow of dark money and shut down fraudulent charities.\n\nPerhaps, after being called out by local papers and having some Republicans going so far as to say they looked like sore losers, the GOP finally realized stripping power from the secretary of state was a bridge too far. But they only came to that realization after the Senate had already passed the bill.\n\nWhat the GOP had proposed to do was to remove campaign finance oversight authority from the secretary of state and transfer that authority to a bipartisan commission.\n\nIn theory, that doesn't sound bad at all \u2014 who would object to a bipartisan commission providing oversight? But the commission would have had six members, three from each party, virtually guaranteeing a deadlock on all campaign finance issues. And if the commission deadlocked, no action can be taken.\n\nThough this particular bill is dead, the GOP is still trying to use the lame duck session to ram through a different campaign finance provision. There's still a plan to push forward a bill that creates a five-year statute of limitations for campaign finance violations.\n\nThat bill is sponsored by Republican state Sen. Dave Robertson. Robertson has reason to be concerned, as his campaign treasurer is a suspect in an ongoing criminal embezzlement investigation.\n\nThe lame duck session ends Thursday, Dec. 20, and outgoing Gov. Rick Snyder has 10 more days to sign the flurry of bills. There's no real chance he'll stand up to his party and refuse to sign anything, but at least the damage of the lame duck session will be over.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is obsessed with shutting down the government.\n\nTrump told congressional Republicans that he will not sign a short-term bill to keep the government funded, throwing yet another tantrum because Democrats refuse to pay $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nComing out of a meeting with Trump at the White House, outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and soon-to-be Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told reporters that Trump will not sign the clean continuing resolution passed by the Senate this week, which would fund the government through early February 2019.\n\nThe Senate passed the bill by unanimous voice vote, but Ryan, a Trump toady until the very end, indicated that he will not even bring the bill up for a vote in the House of Representatives. Funding for much of the government runs out at midnight on Dec. 21.\n\nParroting Trump, Ryan said he \"has very serious concerns about securing our border.\"\n\nIn a humiliating White House meeting, Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer told Trump to his face that Democrats would not support a waste of $5 billion for a border wall. At the time, Trump bragged that he would be proud to shut down the government if he did not get his way.\n\nIn a rare instance of keeping his word, Trump's tantrum over the Senate spending bill could very well lead to a Trump shutdown mere days before Christmas.\n\n\"Republicans are in a state of disarray,\" Pelosi told reporters in the morning, amid news of Ryan and Republicans desperately trying to figure out how to do their job of keeping the government funded.\n\nSeveral Republicans expressed frustration in explicit terms to reporters amidst the GOP-led chaos.\n\nAn NBC News reporter said some Republicans want Trump to tweet his support before they are willing to vote on a funding bill. \"That's what the fuck serving in Congress has come to,\" one member said.\n\nAnother Republican member placed the blame on the far-right House Freedom Caucus (HFC), telling a Bloomberg reporter, \"I think they thought the president would fall in line, so they were thinking like senators, and not factoring in the thirsty desire of HFC to fuck things up.\" Freedom Caucus members have said they will fight on Trump's side for wall funding.\n\nUntil January 3, Republicans are in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, leaving no doubt who is responsible for a shutdown, should one occur. Recent polling shows Americans understand the dynamic, with a large majority prepared to lay blame at the feet of Trump and the Republicans.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump repeated ad nauseam that Mexico would pay for the wall. Barely two years later, he is melting down because Democrats refuse to allow U.S. taxpayer funds to be used for the wall.\n\nAnd through it all, Ryan is showing the incompetence as the leader of the House. He is unable to corral his caucus and too spineless to stand up to Trump's latest tantrum.\n\nThe chaos and tumult on Capitol Hill, like the looming shutdown, is owned fully by the Republican party.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Fox News' Tucker Carlson has gone full white supremacist. Now he's losing advertisers and the network is hurting.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson is losing advertisers who no longer want to be associated with his program's racist content.\n\nImmigration, Carlson said on his show, \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" makes America \"poorer and dirtier.\" The comments were in line with months and months of racist, xenophobic rhetoric on his show, reflecting the overall attitude of Fox News.\n\nAt least 16 advertisers have dropped the show, with many of them singling out Carlson's attacks on immigrants as their justification. These include companies like IHOP, TD Ameritrade, Jaguar Land Rover, Ancestry.com, Voya Financial, and Pacific Life Insurance.\n\nPacific Life was the first to quit, saying in a statement, \"As a company, we strongly disagree with Mr. Carlson's statements. Our customer base and our workforce reflect the diversity of our great nation, something we take great pride in. We will not be advertising on Mr. Carlson's show in the coming weeks as we reevaluate our relationship with his program.\"\n\nIHOP told the Hollywood Reporter, \"At our core, we stand for welcoming folks from all backgrounds and beliefs into our restaurants and continually evaluate ad placements to ensure they align with our values. In this case, we will no longer be advertising on this show.\"\n\nThere are fewer ads appearing on Carlson's show now, and ad slots are also being taken up by advertising for other Fox programming\u2014 meaning the network likely makes no money for those time slots.\n\nBut Fox News is standing behind their host and his racist content. In a statement, the right-wing propaganda network went on the attack: \"We cannot and will not allow voices like Tucker Carlson to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts from the likes of Moveon.org, Media Matters and Sleeping Giants.\"\n\nWhat those activists have done is shine a light on Carlson and his program's repeated use of the same language as white supremacists. Carlson has aligned himself with Trump and his supporters by demonizing immigrants and denigrating nonwhites.\n\nBut major companies understand that aligning their brands with hate is bad for business. A similar backlash happened to Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who saw advertisers run away from her program after she attacked the teenage survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High mass shooting.\n\nLike Carlson, Ingraham is a Trump supporter. The network helped to launch Trump as a political figure and has been a nonstop source of pro-Trump propaganda for years. Promoting racism is a key component in their work to bolster Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nFox News isn't naive or innocent. They understand what racism is. Earlier in the year they pulled a Trump ad because its content was overtly racist. But now they are standing by Carlson and attacking progressives because racism is core to their brand, their message, and their entire existence.\n\nAs part of the pro-Trump movement within conservatism, Carlson has gone all-in for racism and bigotry of the worst kind. Thanks to activists shining a light on his tactics, the network is suffering, again.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But Vladimir Putin praised it loudly.\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, Trump announced that America would be withdrawing the 2,000 troops in Syria. The major foreign policy initiative came as a surprise to both the Department of Defense and the State Department, the two departments who would be tasked with executing Trump's whims.\n\nDefending his latest amateurish blunder on foreign policy, Trump tweeted, \"Russia, Iran, Syria & many others are not happy about the U.S. leaving, despite what the Fake News says.\"\n\nBut Putin does like it. A lot. Speaking to reporters, the Russian leader said Trump had made \"the right decision,\" and went on to slam the actions of American soldiers on the ground in the region.\n\nThe episode once again has put Trump and Putin together, with Americans on the other side. Putin's efforts to manipulate the outcome of the 2016 election by pushing for Trump's victory continue to pay dividends for the autocratic Russian.\n\nGovernment officials, on the other hand, was blindsided by the announcement.\n\nWhen a Vox reporter asked the State Department for details on the announcement, they were directed to ask the White House and Pentagon. But a White House official directed them to the Pentagon. The outlet concluded, \"The president made a decision involving America's troops and the parts of his administration most closely involved in executing that decision have no earthly idea what to do about it.\"\n\nTrump didn't tell congressional leaders about the major foreign policy shift either.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-TN), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee said, \"I have no idea what's going on.\" Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), chairman of the Armed Services committee said, \"I did not know and I think I should have been [notified].\"\n\nSen. Jack Reed (D-RI), the ranking member on Armed Services, said, \"I don't think it is the culmination of a careful policy review, in fact I think many of our foreign policy officials might have been taken by surprise.\"\n\nTrump's leading congressional apologist and golfing buddy Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) admitted, \"this is chaos.\"\n\nEven the right-wing propagandists at Fox News, who regularly cheerlead Trump, seemed taken aback. Host Brian Kilmeade called the decision \"stunning and irresponsible,\" and said Trump has \"blindsided his secretary of defense, his national security adviser, people on the outside who have been advising him, including Gen. Jack Keane, as well as his State Department.\"\n\nThe advice of his own Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis, appeared to have been disregarded. Mattis wanted a continued U.S. presence in the region, according to current and former U.S. officials who spoke to the Washington Post.\n\n\"President Trump's decision to abruptly withdraw troops from Syria is a clear rebuke to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the last remaining member of a retinue of military men Trump once fondly called 'my generals,'\" the paper noted.\n\nTrump hasn't demonstrated any interest or concern about the details of foreign policy, even though his decisions affect the safety of millions of Americans, especially those in the military on the front lines.\n\nHis chaotic decisions play right into the desires of his political benefactor, Putin, while America is left to deal with the negative \u2014 and possibly deadly \u2014 fallout.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins ... for starters.\n\nNot one, but two House Republicans who won reelection were also arrested last year and are currently out on bail awaiting trial. To try to deal with its new criminal caucus, the GOP will kick off the next Congress with new rules to keep indicted Republicans off of committees.\n\nReps. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) and Chris Collins (R-NY) face prosecution in the near future, and the party was at an impasse as to what to do about their committee assignments. Committees hold a lot of power, and letting potential felons have that extra power could be a problem.\n\nAfter Hunter was arrested last year, he initially refused to voluntarily give up his committee assignments. At the time, the San Diego Union-Tribune noted, \"there were no House or party rules that gave Republican leadership authority to strip indicted rank-and-file members of assignments to standing committees.\"\n\nWhat's a party with multiple members under indictment to do?\n\nIn the end, the House GOP passed a new rule requiring any member to \"promptly\" resign from all committees if that member is indicted \"for a felony for which a sentence of two or more years imprisonment may be imposed.\"\n\nThe rule would apply to both Hunter and Collins, barring them from serving on any committees as they await their respective trials. The two would still be able to speak on the House floor and propose legislation.\n\nHunter and his wife were arrested for misusing a quarter of a million dollars of campaign funds for personal pet projects. The charges allege they used the funds for family vacations, to go to the theater, and even to pay for a visit to the dentist.\n\nCollins was arrested for insider trading. His indictment alleges he passed along information to his son, who used the information to make stock trades.\n\nHunter and Collins were the first two members of Congress to endorse Trump's candidacy for president. Trump himself remains under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller for both his ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign and allegations of obstruction of justice.\n\nAs written, the rule would not apply to violent criminals who have already paid their debt to society. That's good news for Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-MT), who pled guilty to assaulting a reporter in 2017. Gianforte, despite his history of violence, remains a member of good standing in the Republican Party.\n\nAlso still a member of good standing is Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), who has been accused of turning a blind eye to the sexual abuse of students when Jordan was a college wrestling coach. While Jordan denies any wrongdoing, several former wrestlers have come forward to accuse him of being aware of the abuse.\n\nJordan has been named in lawsuits against his old college, but thus far faces no criminal charges. He, too, still gets to keep his committee assignments \u2014 at least for now.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, no Democratic members of Congress are currently under indictment.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Today's Republican Party has gone too far for these women lawmakers.\n\nThe Republican Party's problem with women is getting worse, and some Republican women have finally had enough. Three GOP women lawmakers in Kansas, two state senators and one state representative, have ditched the Republican Party entirely in the span of just a week.\n\nEach of these women has her own reasons, but their departures share a common theme: Today's Republican Party has moved so far to the right that it is no longer recognizable to most decent Americans.\n\nThe first to abandon the party was state Sen. Barbara Bollier, who is leaving the GOP after four decades as a Republican. She's leaving in part because of Trump's vulgarity towards women. She told the Washington Post that after leaving the GOP, \"now I can sleep better \u2014 it was a huge moral thing.\"\n\nWhen Bollier made her announcement, Republican state Rep. Stephanie said she was \"happy for and proud of my friend and mentor.\"\n\nA week later, Clayton announced she, too, was leaving the Republican Party.\n\n\"I can't put my name on a party that is actively seek to destroy public education,\" the newly-minted Democrat said. \"It's affecting my children. It's affecting my neighbors' children. The abandoning of the support of public education is something I couldn't stand for.\"\n\nAnd now state Sen. Dinah Sykes is the latest to join Bollier and Clayton in ditching the party of Trump.\n\nSykes said she wants to focus on solutions to problems her constituents face in their everyday life. \"Increasingly, I see the Republican party focusing on issues and approaches that divide our country,\" Sykes said. \"I do not agree with that approach.\"\n\nKansas probably isn't turning blue anytime soon. It's true that in 2018, the normally deep-red state rejected fringe conspiracy theorist and Trump loyalist Kris Kobach's bid for governor, electing Democrat Laura Kelly instead. However, Democrats did not gain any seats in either chamber of the GOP-dominated Kansas legislature in the November midterms.\n\nStill, December's defections send a powerful signal to Republicans at the state and national level.\n\nAnd it's not just happening in Kansas. In California, the chief justice of the state Supreme Court ditched the Republican party after the U.S. Senate's embarrassing confirmation hearing of alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThese women are joining other women across the country in rejecting the politics of division and misogyny embodied by today's Trump-led Republican party.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Dozens of complaints against Justice Brett Kavanaugh were dismissed yesterday because the judicial ethics rules don't apply to Supreme Court justices.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh has again escaped any consequences for his behavior. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which was tasked with investigating 83 misconduct claims against Kavanaugh, just dismissed all those complaints without taking any action.\n\nEarlier this year, Kavanaugh had a complete meltdown in front of the Senate when he was asked to address Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her when they were in high school. After additional women came forward, Kavanaugh was the subject of an investigation so nominal as to be laughable. Now, thanks to Chief Justice John Roberts going out of his way to protect him, Kavanaugh will never face any discipline or sanctions.\n\nDuring Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing and the investigation that followed the hearing, dozens of people filed complaints under the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act. Among other things, they alleged that Kavanaugh had lied to the Senate during confirmation proceedings in 2004, 2006, and 2018, that he treated members of the Senate Judiciary Committee disrespectfully, and that he made partisan statements that demonstrated bias.\n\nThere's no question Kavanaugh was disrespectful and partisan during his confirmation hearings. He accused women who came forward with allegations of exacting revenge on behalf of the Clintons. He snapped at Sen. Amy Klobuchar for asking him about his drinking. His poor behavior during the hearing was visible to the entire world.\n\nNone of that matters now, thanks to Roberts' sleight-of-hand. Complaints about Kavanaugh were filed in late September, at which point Brett Kavanaugh was still a federal judge rather than a Supreme Court justice. Roberts didn't do anything about those complaints, however, until after Kavanaugh was confirmed, at which point he transmitted the complaints to the 10th Circuit for it to address.\n\nThere's just one catch: Supreme Court justices aren't subject to the rules for judicial conduct. So, because Kavanaugh is now seated on the Supreme Court, the 10th Circuit ruled that although the allegations are serious, it doesn't have the authority to investigate any of the complaints. This is both in spite of the fact that the complaints were filed at a time when Kavanaugh was still subject to the rules, and in spite of the fact that Chief Justice Roberts deliberately withheld those complaints until Kavanaugh was no longer subject to those rules.\n\nA few weeks ago, Roberts received accolades for a very mild rebuke of a Trump statement about \"Obama judges,\" stating that the judiciary was an independent body. But Roberts' behavior here shows that he is more than willing to compromise the integrity of the judiciary in order to achieve partisan goals: Kavanaugh got seated, the complaints got buried, and Roberts got a Supreme Court with one more ultra-conservative justice.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Now he's giving in and getting nothing.\n\nTrump has once again lost the argument to Democrats in Congress and will be signing a bill to fund the government that won't include the $5 billion he demanded to build his border wall.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) confirmed to CNN that Trump will \"sign a clean [continuing resolution].\"\n\nThe resolution offered by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-TN) will fund the government through Feb. 8. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have both said Democrats will support the short-term bill to keep the government open.\n\nPelosi but called the short-term bill \"a missed opportunity to pass full-year funding bills now. However, Democrats will be ready to fully, responsibly fund our government in January, and we will support this continuing resolution.\"\n\nBy the time the new bill expires, Trump and his fellow Republicans will have even less power. Pelosi will once again be speaker of the House, thanks to Democrats picking up 40 seats in the midterm elections, and she's made it clear her party will not give Trump $5 billion to build a wall.\n\nMeanwhile, extremist Republicans in the House are furious at losing this fight yet again. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, noting that there's no chance of wall funding with Pelosi as speaker, wrote, \"Give me a break.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows said the continuing resolution \"not only gives Democrats a Christmas present, it offers them a Valentine\u2019s Day gift.\" He added, \"Democrats will win, the wall will not be built.\"\n\nJust last week, Trump hosted Pelosi and Schumer in a disastrous White House meeting where he attempted to bully the two Democratic leaders into supporting funding for his wall obsession. Trump mistakenly thought allowing reporters to witness and record his attempted negotiation would somehow benefit him.\n\nInstead, both Democrats openly rebuked Trump, fact-checked his lies to his face, and made clear that they would not waste tax dollars on the useless enterprise.\n\nPelosi bluntly told Trump \"there are no votes\" for his wall, as he continued to fume and bluster in full view of the cameras he had assembled for his ambush.\n\nFrustrated and outsmarted, Trump threw a tantrum for all the world to see.\n\n\"If we don't get what we want,\" he said, \"I will shut down the government.\" He even said he would be \"proud\" to do it.\n\nA mere eight days later, Trump has conceded, faced with Republicans wary of facing the heat of yet another shutdown and the resulting political fallout for the party.\n\nTrump keeps demanding money for the wall he insisted Mexico would pay for. Democrats, backed by the American people, keep telling him no. And Trump and the Republicans keep losing. Sad!\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

After emerging she attacked the FBI to defend Trump's criminality.\n\nSarah Sanders emerged from hiding and used an extremely brief press briefing to attack the FBI and to promote absurd conspiracy theories about the prosecution of Trump's criminal former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.\n\nThe White House press operation has been in hiding since November 27, the date of the last briefing \u2014 nearly a month ago. In total the Trump administration has only held four such briefings since September.\n\nThey have avoided questions on the growing evidence that Trump stands at the center of a criminal enterprise, directing the commission of federal crimes and covering them up.\n\nSanders spent only about 15 minutes with reporters before she quickly ended the event and ran off.\n\nIn that time, she managed to attack the FBI and promote a defensive conspiracy theory meant to further cover for Trump.\n\nJust before the briefing, Flynn attended his sentencing hearing where he admitted before a judge that he was guilty of lying to the FBI, a federal crime.\n\nDespite this admission from the man who was an integral part of the Trump campaign and Trump's choice for national security adviser, Sanders aimed her ire at America's premier law enforcement agency, falsely claiming the FBI \"broke standard protocol in the way that they ambushed General Flynn and in the way that they questioned him and in the way that they encouraged him not to have White House counsel's office present.\"\n\nSanders also lied when she said former FBI director James Comey claimed the agency entrapped Flynn \"because it was the Trump administration and they thought they could get away with it.\"\n\nJust minutes before Sanders said this, Flynn was asked in federal court by Judge Emmet Sullivan if he wanted to challenge the circumstances under which he was questioned by the FBI. He replied, \"No, your honor.\"\n\nThe exchange debunked the argument that has often been forwarded by Fox News in service of Trump and by Trump himself. Nevertheless, Sanders decided to invoke it at the briefing anyway.\n\nBefore the 2016 election Sanders infamously exposed the hollowness of her current position, writing, \"When you're attacking FBI agents because you're under criminal investigation, you're losing.\"\n\nSanders, acting on behalf of Trump, used her position to spread lies and misinformation while severely limiting the time in which journalists can hold the administration accountable.\n\nUnfortunately for Sanders and Trump, polls show America sees through the lies and are not interested in allowing Sanders' sad attempt at disinformation to succeed.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republican Mark Harris is implicated in widespread election fraud in North Carolina, but the state party thinks he should be rewarded with a seat in Congress anyway.\n\nRight now, the FBI is investigating whether Republicans engaged in election fraud to try to win a House seat for Mark Harris in North Carolina. At the same time, state and local investigators are examining whether Harris personally had a hand in the fraud.\n\nIn spite of all this, both North Carolina's statewide GOP and the 9th Congressional District GOP just called on the state elections board to immediately certify the current election results, where Harris has a very slender lead. The GOP also demanded that Harris is seated when the new Congress convenes early next year.\n\nThe behavior of the state GOP party has been indefensible throughout this entire process. When it was clear that Democratic candidate Dan McCready was gaining during the vote count, Robin Hayes, GOP state chair, accused Democrats of trying to steal the election.\n\nThen, evidence emerged that Harris likely personally directed the hiring of Leslie McCrae Dowless, a campaign worker linked to previous election fraud. Dowless, in turn, directed a scheme where he allegedly collected ballots that were incomplete and unsealed and then illegally discarded ballots.\n\nFor a brief moment, the GOP came to its senses and admitted a new election was likely necessary given the scale of the fraud and the narrowness of the margin separating Harris and McCready \u2014 a mere 905 votes. Trying to thread a difficult needle, Hayes is now saying he supports an investigation but that unless the state election board can \"immediately\" provide \"significant public evidence\" of that fraud, Harris should be seated.\n\nThis demand willfully ignores that an investigation of this scope can take time, as evinced by the fact that the elections board has already delayed a meeting over the investigation. That delay occurred because the attorneys representing people subpoenaed in the investigation have all said they need more time to produce relevant documents.\n\nFurther, it isn't as if this is an investigation that had gone quiet for some time. There's been a near-constant stream of news as more dimensions of the fraud have been uncovered.\n\nThe North Carolina GOP faces a problem entirely of its own making. The alleged fraud is attributed to both the GOP candidate, Mark Harris, and people working directly for the candidate. That behavior shouldn't be rewarded with a certified election and a seat in Congress. While the investigation continues, while the very real prospect of a new election looms, Harris should not be seated.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump measures himself by the stock market, which is on pace for the worst December since the Great Depression.\n\nEven though the stock market is not a good proxy for the overall health of the U.S. economy, Trump has spent two years using it as a proxy for his own success. He's tweeted about \"stocks\" or the \"stock market\" more than 70 times, usually giving himself outsized credit for any positive news at all. In just one month, October 2017, Trump bragged about the stock market nine times.\n\nBut now Trump's favorite indicator of his own success is on pace for the worst December since the Great Depression.\n\nTwo major stock indexes, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500, are \"on pace for their worst December performance since 1931, when stocks were battered during the Great Depression,\" according to CNBC.\n\nThe stock market is tanking despite promises from Trump and Republicans that their scam to cut taxes for the rich would have the exact opposite effect.\n\nIn November 2017, Trump tweeted, \"Great numbers on Stocks and the Economy. If we get Tax Cuts and Reform, we'll really see some great results!\"\n\nA month later, the tax scam was signed into law. Since then, the S&P 500 is down just over 1 percent.\n\nFormer Fed chairman Alan Greenspan recently told an audience that the stock market boom Trump used to brag about is coming to an end, and investors should \"run for cover.\"\n\nAgain, how well the stock market is doing doesn't tell you much about how ordinary Americans are doing. Fewer than half of Americans actually own stocks, and 80 percent of the stock market's wealth is owned by the richest 10 percent.\n\nBut when even the stock market isn't doing well, it tells you just how badly Republicans screwed up when they tucked billions of dollars in corporate kickbacks into the tax scam. Those kickbacks didn't create wealth for anyone else \u2014 they just lined the pockets of already-wealthy executives and Wall Street bankers.\n\nWhile Trump and Republicans focused on Wall Street, families throughout America were left behind. So few of the tax scam's benefits went to ordinary Americans that failed Speaker Paul Ryan tried to brag about a secretary getting an extra $1.50 per week as a result of the bill.\n\nRepublicans also promised that companies would shower their workers with raises and bonuses as a result of the tax scam. But after accounting for inflation, wages have been either stagnant or barely growing at all.\n\n2018 also saw a spike in Midwest farmers filing for bankruptcy, and GM recently announced the shuttering of several North American auto plants.\n\nWhile most families continue to struggle, Wall Street banks are seeing record profits \u2014 which shows exactly where the GOP's priorities are.\n\nNow even the stock market \u2014 which already benefits the wealthy, and which used to be the only thing Trump could use to bolster his false claims that the tax scam is \"working\" \u2014 is also in trouble.\n\nIn January 2018, as Trump was once again bragging about the stock market, CNBC warned he \"may end up regretting his decision to latch onto such a fickle indicator.\"\n\nTrump, of course, never publicly admits regret. But now that news outlets are starting to compare the stock market to the Great Depression, Trump might suddenly stop bragging so much about it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He is yet another member of Trump's campaign and inner circle now facing consequences as a result of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Judge Emmet Sullivan did not hold back his fury about Flynn's crimes.\n\n\"I'm not hiding my disgust, my distain for this criminal offense,\" Sullivan said.\n\n\"You were an unregistered agent of a foreign country while serving as the national security adviser to the president,\" the judge continued. \"Arguably, this undermines everything this flag over here stands for! Arguably, you sold your country out.\"\n\nLater in the hearing, Sullivan backtracked, noting Flynn's time as an unregistered foreign agent ended in mid-November 2016, before he became national security adviser. However, Sullivan did note that Flynn lied to the FBI on White House grounds, as a senior member of the administration.\n\nIn the lead-up to Flynn's sentencing, several right-wing outlets latched on to a theory that the FBI tricked Flynn into lying, entrapped him into committing a crime. One Fox News anchor went so far as to say Sullivan may toss out Flynn's guilty plea, calling Sullivan \"a man who does not tolerate injustice or abuse of power.\"\n\nIn order to ensure the utmost clarity, Sullivan began the sentencing hearing by asking Flynn multiple times if he is guilty of lying to the FBI, and if he wanted to continue with the plea deal. Numerous times, Flynn admitted that he is, in fact, guilty.\n\nAt one point, Sullivan asked the prosecutors if they contemplated charging Flynn with treason, showing just how seriously he takes the crimes Flynn committed.\n\nIn the end, Sullivan offered Flynn a chance to delay the hearing, as Flynn is still cooperating with ongoing investigations. As part of the plea deal, Flynn cooperated with multiple investigations, including Mueller's.\n\nIt is not clear what Flynn has already shared with Mueller's team. Flynn was a frequent companion of Trump's on the campaign trail.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention where Trump was officially crowned as the Republican nominee, Flynn led the crowd in a chant of \"Lock her up!\" in reference to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nFlynn's sentencing has been delayed until March 13, 2019, at which point we should learn if, and for how long, he will be locked up.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Kyle, and now McSally, will finish out the late Sen. John McCain's term.\n\nMcSally is a radical, far-right fringe candidate who voters rejected at the ballot box on Nov. 6, opting instead for Democrat Krysten Sinema.\n\nMcSally campaigned on a sting of lies about her health care voting record. While in the House, McSally voted with Trump and the Republicans to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions. According to Politifact, the bill McSally supported would have allowed insurance companies to \"charge people significantly more if they had a pre-existing condition like heart disease, cancer, diabetes or arthritis \u2013 possibly requiring people to pay thousands of dollars extra every year to remain insured.\"\n\nYet on the campaign trail, McSally had no qualms lying to voters, insisting that her vote didn't do what independent experts said it would do.\n\nIn fact, she was so excited to rip health care away from more than 20 million people that she reportedly told her colleagues, \"Let's get this f\u2013king thing done!\"\n\nMcSally will replace McCain, a man she insulted on the campaign trail. In an effort to suck up to Trump, McSally defended his regular snubs and insults of McCain. Her cowardly stance led Arizona Republican columnist Laura Roberts to write, \"That's something I wouldn't have expected from a former combat pilot, who once upon a time must have had a backbone.\"\n\nLike Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan, Ducey doesn't care that voters had a choice to put McSally in the Senate just last month. It is yet another instance of Republicans thinking they know better than the people of their respective state.\n\nAnd now, Arizona residents are stuck with a losing Senate nominee as their Senator ... at least until 2020, when voters will once again be able to reject McSally at the polls.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Indeed, hundreds of thousands of voters signed petitions to get those measures on the ballot.\n\nThe GOP took that choice away from voters, however, by passing the measures in the Legislature just to kill them later. The outgoing Republican governor, Rick Snyder, recently signed two bills that substantially weaken both laws.\n\nThroughout the lame-duck session, Michigan Republicans have made clear they don't care what Michigan voters want. And now, new polling confirms just how out of touch these Republican lawmakers are with their own constituents.\n\nA huge majority of Michigan voters, including Republicans, support expansive paid sick leave and a meaningful minimum wage increase.\n\n84 percent of Michigan voters \u2014 and 80 percent of Republicans \u2014 support the sick leave policy passed back in September, which required one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, with a lower amount for small businesses.\n\nBut the GOP scrapped that proposal in favor of a much weaker law that exempts over 160,000 businesses and 1 million employees.\n\nThe same decisive support is seen for the minimum wage law. 77 percent of all voters support the original law that would have increased the minimum wage to $12 per hour by 2022. As with paid sick leave, this initiative also enjoyed substantial support from Republicans, 58 percent of whom favored it.\n\nThe message couldn't be clearer from GOP lawmakers in Michigan: They don't care what their own constituents want. They only care about pushing the Republican Party's anti-worker agenda.\n\nAnd they're willing to push that radical, unpopular agenda even when their own supporters \u2014 the Republican voters keeping them in office \u2014 don't agree.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump said dirty trickster Roger Stone should be trusted for standing by him, but Stone just admitted in court to being a huge liar.\n\nTrump insists that Roger Stone, his ally and long-time informal political advisor, is a man of great integrity who would never tell \"lies\" about Trump or turn against him in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation \u2014 unlike, say, former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen.\n\n\"'I will never testify against Trump.' This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about 'President Trump,'\" Trump wrote in the wake of reports that Cohen had struck a plea deal to reveal his secrets to Mueller. \"Nice to know that some people still have 'guts!'\"\n\nBut it turns out that even as Trump was praising his friend's \"guts,\" Stone was in negotiations to settle another lawsuit by admitting that he told some huge lies. And this admission won't make Stone, or Trump, look good when it comes to the Mueller investigation.\n\nStone is a long-time Republican dirty trickster and conservative activist whose work to help Trump during the 2016 election has come under scrutiny by Mueller. And one of Stone's dirty tricks on a separate issue has backfired on him in the form of a defamation lawsuit seeking $100 million in damages.\n\nIn order to settle that lawsuit, Stone publicly admitted Monday to promoting blatant lies about Chinese businessman Guo Wengui on Infowars, the outlet run by conspiracy theorist and Trump booster Alex Jones.\n\nGuo had sued Stone for falsely claiming that Guo was convicted of financial crimes, and falsely claiming that he broke U.S. election law by donating to political campaigns, including Hillary Clinton's, despite being a foreign national.\n\nAt first, Stone dismissed Guo's lawsuit as \"political\" and \"meritless.\" But in the end, Stone was forced to admit not only that the lawsuit had merit, but that Stone had been \"irresponsible\" to spread these lies about Guo without vetting them first. As part of the settlement, Stone will also have to run ads in national newspapers and on social media retracting his false statements.\n\nIn other words, Stone only came clean about lying once he was backed into a corner and threatened with financial ruin. Before that, he insisted he had done nothing wrong.\n\nThat will give Mueller even more reason to be skeptical of Stone's claims that he didn't collude with Russia, or help Trump do so, in order to improperly influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nStone is already on Mueller's radar thanks to a series of phone calls between Stone and Trump at the height of the election.\n\nAround that same time, Stone was also in contact with WikiLeaks as the organization released stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, which had been hacked by Russian intelligence and released at a time when they would cause maximum damage to Clinton's campaign.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Mueller's team is looking into what Trump may have learned from Stone about this email dump.\n\nStone has made a career out of lying about Democrats, particularly Clinton. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Stone pushed lies and conspiracy theories meant to hurt Clinton's campaign and boost Trump, much in the same way he has now admitted to doing with Guo.\n\nStone helped make Trump who he is today. He has advised Trump on politics for decades and formed a presidential exploratory committee for him in 2000. He also tried to get Trump to run in 2012 against President Barack Obama, and placed Paul Manafort \u2014 who has since been convicted of federal crimes \u2014 as Trump's campaign chairman in 2016.\n\nStone's latest admission further illustrates the grotesque and goonish caliber of people in Trump's inner circle.\n\nThat Trump would offer a serial liar and conspiracy theorist as his character witness as the walls close in speaks volumes about Trump's own character.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Lamar Alexander (R-TN) announced he will not seek re-election in 2020.\n\nRepublican Lamar Alexander, the senior senator from Tennessee, announced he will not seek re-election after finishing out his third term \u2014 an early sign of weakness for Senate Republicans in 2020.\n\nAlexander is the first Republican senator up for re-election in 2020 to make such an announcement. Two Republican House members have already announced they will not seek re-election in 2020.\n\nAlexander's announcement comes just weeks after Democrats won resounding midterm election victories that spell trouble for Trump and Republicans.\n\nRepublicans had to fight hard to hold the other Tennessee Senate seat after Sen. Bob Corker decided not to seek another term. With Alexander leaving in 2020, and Trump back on the ballot, Republicans will face yet another uphill battle to retain control of the seat \u2014 especially if the far-right Club for Growth gets its wish for Rep.-elect Mark Green, an anti-science bigot, to fill Alexander's seat.\n\nBut despite Alexander's reputation as a bipartisan dealmaker, he is no moderate himself. In fact, Alexander has supported Trump's toxic, unpopular agenda more than 93 percent of the time.\n\nA loyal partisan in an increasingly polarized Congress, Alexander backed all of Trump's most controversial positions and nominees.\n\nThat included voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite multiple serious allegations of sexual misconduct, and despite a flood of objections from law professors who said Kavanaugh lacked the judicial temperament to serve on the highest court in the land. With Alexander's help, Kavanaugh joined Clarence Thomas as the second GOP-nominated Supreme Court justice to be confirmed despite being an alleged sexual predator.\n\nAs head of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, Alexander played a key role in Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nHe repeatedly voted for Republican efforts to eliminate protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions, despite knowing it would likely increase health care costs for millions.\n\nIn light of a Texas judge's recent ruling that the entire ACA is unconstitutional, Alexander's role at the head of HELP comes even more acutely into focus. For the next two years, any conversation about the future of the American health care system will likely involve his committee.\n\nIn addition, Alexander voted for the GOP tax scam, which handed out billions of dollars to Wall Street CEOs while leaving families and regular Americans out in the cold.\n\nThe 2020 election is still two years away. And, unfortunately, Alexander is likely to spend those two years continuing to be a lapdog to the Trump agenda and refusing to be an independent voice for the people of Tennessee.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The behavior of the Michigan GOP throughout this lame-duck session has been reprehensible and anti-democratic \u2014 and they know it.\n\nLast week, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed two bills gutting the state's new paid sick leave and minimum wage laws. It was the culmination of a long-term strategy by the GOP to subvert the will of voters on both of these issues.\n\nBut the strategy is so blatantly undemocratic that even some Republicans fear it might backfire.\n\n\"We look like sore losers,\" fretted J.R. Roth, chairman of the Grand Traverse County GOP. Roth went on to note that the GOP's bad behavior may only strengthen Democrats in the 2020 election.\n\nEarlier this year, signatures were gathered from hundreds of thousands of Michigan voters to put a new paid sick leave law and a minimum wage increase on the 2018 ballot.\n\nRepublicans didn't like these laws, but knew they'd be popular with voters. So in order to keep the issues off the ballot, the GOP-controlled legislature passed its own paid sick leave and minimum wage laws \u2014 while freely admitting that those laws would be weakened right after the election.\n\nIndeed, the versions of the laws Snyder signed will do much less than they would have if voters had gotten their say.\n\nFirst, the paid sick leave law now contains so many exceptions that 160,000 small businesses do not have to provide their collective 1 million employees with any paid sick leave at all.\n\nMichigan voters wanted to raise the minimum wage to $12 per hour by 2022. But the GOP's watered-down law won't raise the wage to that level until 2030.\n\nAnd it's not just these laws that make the GOP look like \"sore losers,\" as Roth put it. Republicans are also using the lame-duck session to try to limit the power of incoming Democratic lawmakers, like newly elected Democratic attorney general Dana Nessel.\n\nThe legislature has advanced a bill allowing it to intervene directly in lawsuits that involve the state. This minimizes the ability of the attorney general to determine which state laws should be defended if challenged in court.\n\nThe GOP representative chairing a key committee as that bill advanced, Lee Chatfield, shut down discussions over the bill when Democratic protesters applauded a Democratic committee member's speech.\n\nBut while Chatfield claimed the bill would give the legislature a stronger voice in the process, he was also forced to acknowledge in a floor speech that the timing of the bill did not make his party look good. Chatfield tried to claim that his \"biggest issue with this bill is that it was not introduced 18 months ago,\" when the attorney general was a Republican.\n\nEven if only a few of them will admit it, the GOP is fully aware that its work during the lame-duck session is designed to strip power from Democrats and to undercut the will of the people.\n\nIt's a monumentally indefensible way of governing.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republican women are sounding the alarm.\n\nIn what should come as a shock to no one, the Republican Party \u2014 which fully embraced an accused sexual predator for president, an accused child molester for U.S. Senate, and an alleged attempted rapist for the Supreme Court \u2014 is having trouble winning the support of women voters.\n\nIt's getting bad enough, the Washington Post reports, that some prominent Republican women are calling for their party to make serious changes, and others are leaving the GOP altogether.\n\nYet the party doesn't seem willing to do much about it.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), one of the few Republican women left in Congress after the 2018 midterms, argues that the GOP is now at a \"crisis level\" when it comes to representing women.\n\nRepublicans were on the wrong side of a massive gender gap in the 2018 midterms. For one thing, women voters heavily favored Democrats. For another, the Democratic Party got a record-breaking number of women elected to Congress \u2014 even as the number of women Republicans in the House plummeted by nearly half, from 23 to just 13.\n\nThere are many obvious reasons women might be abandoning the GOP. The party's nasty habit of supporting sexual predators like Trump and Brett Kavanaugh is just one example of the GOP's systematic opposition to women's rights and gender equality.\n\nYet Stefanik's solution to what she calls a \"crisis\" isn't, say, changing the GOP's position on sexual predators from \"support\" to \"oppose.\" Instead, she's more narrowly focused on trying to get the Republican Party to support more women candidates in the primaries.\n\nBut even this minor change is too much for the new head of the Republican campaign arm, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), who called Stefanik's suggested approach a \"mistake.\"\n\nEmmer, one of 187 Republican men in next year's GOP House minority, has a plan for Republicans in 2020 that looks a lot like 2018, including a tight embrace of Trump and the Trump agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, the party's deep misogyny is driving many Republican women to abandon the GOP entirely.\n\nThe chief justice of the California Supreme Court, Tani Cantil-Sakauye, recently left the Republican Party over the Senate's disgraceful confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh.\n\nIn Kansas, state Sen. Barbara Bollier ditched the Republican Party after four decades, in part because of Trump's vulgarity toward women. She told the Post, \"Now I can sleep better \u2014 it was a huge moral thing.\"\n\nChristine Todd Whitman, the Republican former governor of New Jersey, told the Post that Republicans are not just ignoring women \u2014 they're \"aggressively looking the other way.\"\n\nWhitman predicted that if the GOP continues on this path, it will \"largely become irrelevant.\"\n\nAnd it won't be a moment too soon for women.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The indictment says Kian \"conspired covertly and unlawfully to influence U.S. politicians and public opinion.\"\n\nKian was part of the Trump transition team, specifically the national security transition team alongside Michael Flynn.

But where corruption has been allowed to flourish under Trump, Pence has been nearby, and the Kian case once again shows his involvement.\n\nThe revelations of Kian's conduct show that along with Flynn, unsavory characters with ties to foreign powers were given influence over sensitive national security staffing and issues.\n\nKian ran a lobbying firm with Michael Flynn, who was part of Trump's campaign and later served as his national security adviser.

    "text": "With a decision that even conservatives acknowledge is poorly reasoned, an activist judge in Texas invalidated the entire ACA.\n\nLate last Friday, only one day before the end of its open enrollment period, Judge Reed O'Connor, a conservative federal district court judge in Texas, struck down the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nIt's precisely the sort of activist judicial overreach that conservatives decry, but this time they're quite happy with it. Trump tweeted praise for the ruling, asserting that overruling an existing law that protects people with pre-existing conditions somehow will lead to a great law that protects people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nJudge O'Connor is a huge conservative favorite, and it's no secret as to why the attorneys general that brought this lawsuit wanted him to be the one to rule on it. Back in 2016, O'Connor ruled that the Obama administration couldn't enforce rules protecting transgender students. And even though the lawsuit was in Texas, the injunction he issued was nationwide. Conservatives have taken to filing their most controversial lawsuits in his jurisdiction, having relative certainty he'll rule in their favor.\n\nJudge O'Connor certainly came through this time. He issued a sweeping ruling declaring all of Obamacare unconstitutional. O'Connor ruled that the entire law needed to be thrown out because in 2017 Congress repealed the tax penalty that underpinned the individual mandate. In other words, because one provision got knocked out, the whole of the law had to go, even though Congress had a chance to do just that and chose not to do so.\n\nHe also waited until after the election to issue this ruling. This meant that many conservatives who campaigned on saying they cared about protecting pre-existing conditions didn't have to address the fact that conservatives had brought a lawsuit trying to undercut the law.\n\nHowever, even conservative scholars acknowledge that his ruling has serious flaws. A lawyer from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which is anti-ACA, said the decision was \"embarrassingly bad\" because the judge was twisting himself into knots to get to his desired result.\n\nConservatives howl when judges appointed by Clinton or Obama rule against any conservative laws, calling them activist judges who don't reflect the will of the people. O'Connor, though, is the one that is a perfect example of an activist judge. He flouted the intent of the law and issued a decision that makes no sense legally.\n\nThere's a genuine chance that this ruling won't stand. Legal scholars pointed out that the higher courts generally don't like to overturn laws that have millions of people relying on them, as is the case here. The blue states that intervened in the lawsuit, like California, have the right to appeal the lawsuit, and the law remains in effect during those appeals.\n\nEven though this particular ruling may not result in Obamacare being overturned at this time, it still has the effect of throwing everything into disarray, leading to uncertainty and despair for the millions that rely on the ACA for their health care coverage. And that's exactly what conservatives want.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Many other groups \u2014 Latinos, Muslims, Christians, gay men and women, liberals, Southerners, veterans \u2014 got at least some attention from Russians operating thousands of social media accounts.\n\nThe Times goes into more detail on Russia's particular focus on dissuading African-Americans from showing up at the polls.\n\nAccording to the Times, \"The voter suppression effort was focused particularly on Sanders supporters and African-Americans, urging them to shun Mrs. Clinton in the general election and either vote for Ms. Stein or stay home.\"\n\nThe reports mirror the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told reporters last week, adding that one would have to be \"willfully blind\" not to see that.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-TN) went so far as to say that if MBS was in front of a jury, \"he would have a unanimous verdict in about 30 minutes.\"\n\n\"Guilty, \"Corker added. \"A guilty verdict.\"\n\nSadly, Trump and Kushner are content to work in the shadows rather than address the reality of this heinous crime, even if everyone else knows the truth.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "State Sen. Rick Jones wants people to believe getting rid of paid sick leave is the best way to help the Michigan workforce.\n\nThe Michigan GOP has been using the lame-duck session to undercut the will of the voters comprehensively. They moved to weaken a voting rights initiative and to minimize the power of the incoming Democratic attorney general. They also engaged in a complicated political maneuver that allowed them to seriously damage the state's newly passed paid sick-leave law.\n\nNow, one of the GOP senators behind the effort to strip sick leave from the workers of Michigan has offered an incredible explanation for why they did it:\n\n\"What we had was a ballot initiative and we're responsible for looking at it and we can within 40 days take it up and vote on it,\" said Republican Senator Rick Jones. \"Well we did that. Then that allows us to change it a little bit if we need to and we felt we needed to keep people working.\"\n\nJones went on to say that it was necessary to drastically minimize the reach of the sick leave law to stop employers from making job cuts or increasing automation.\n\nJones has a near-perfect rating from the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, a big business lobby group that fought the sick leave initiative all along, calling it the \"most punitive and aggressive [paid sick leave] proposal to be pursued in any state to date.\"\n\nWhat the Chamber of Commerce, Jones, and his fellow Republicans all willfully ignore is that paid sick leave makes for a healthier and more prosperous populace. Workforces are more stable and productive, the risk of illness being passed from employee to employee or the public is significantly decreased, and overall health care costs are lower. Paid sick leave also allows people to more fully participate in the lives of their families, caring for sick relatives and attending crucial events like school conferences.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, Michiganders overwhelmingly voted for progressive policies, but the GOP has made clear it doesn't care. Now, supporters of the paid sick leave initiative are phone banking to demand outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Snyder veto the legislation. They want Snyder to do the right thing, even if the rest of his party won't.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The state board of elections has a hearing scheduled for Dec. 21 to discuss the investigation, and it has the power to call for a new election.\n\nAs the Post reports:\n\nWitnesses in interviews and affidavits say Dowless's allegedly fraudulent operation on Harris\u2019s behalf this year involved collecting incomplete and unsealed ballots, an illegal practice. Investigators are also examining whether Dowless or those working for him illegally discarded ballots.\n\nA source told the Post that Dowless \"spoke often of talking to Harris by telephone\" during the 2018 campaign.\n\nThe criminal activity Republicans allegedly engaged in is so serious that federal investigators are involved.\n\nYet Trump, Pence, and other top Republicans \u2014 who spent years spreading lies about virtually non-existent voter fraud \u2014 remain silent as a nominee they endorsed and campaigned for faces a criminal investigation for election fraud.\n\nFor example, Trump made absurd allegations that voters can vote twice by voting, walk out to their car and putting on a disguise, and then returning to vote again. But that's not how voting works; no matter how you're dressed, registrars have to confirm that your name and address are in the system and that you haven't voted yet.\n\nIn-person voter fraud like this almost never happens, but it's the only kind Republicans talk about \u2014 and they use these lies to engage in massive voter suppression efforts that make it harder for certain populations (usually minorities and college students) to participate in democracy's most foundational right: voting.\n\nIn the Republican imagination, voters are the criminals when election results are fraudulent. But in the reality of North Carolina, the voters were the victims of election fraud.\n\nIn this case, Republicans are accused of destroying or altering ballots, seeking to erase the voices of voters who overcame the other hurdles Republicans already erected to silence them.\n\nThis fraud is yet another form of voter suppression \u2014 perpetuated by Republicans \u2014 and a disgraceful attempt to undermine democracy.\n\nAnd now it seems that the rot goes all the way to the top, with a strong possibility that Mark Harris was personally involved in a plot to steal his own election.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Catil-Sakauye, appointed to chief justice by former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, is the first Filipina-American woman, and the second woman ever, to be chief justice in California.\n\nCatil-Sakauye had been thinking of leaving the GOP \"for some time,\" she said, but the Kavanaugh confirmation process was the final straw. Republicans vociferously defended Kavanaugh, despite multiple allegations of sexual assault \u2014 including testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh tried to rape her when the two were in high school. Kavanaugh responded with anger and belligerence, especially toward Democratic women on the committee.\n\nCatil-Sakauye's decision to leave the party \"reflects the diminished support for the GOP among women,\" notes CALmatters. The diminished support played a huge role in GOP losses up and down the ballot not only in California, but across the country in the 2018 midterms.\n\nIn California, Democrats won every statewide office and increased their super-majorities in both legislative chambers. In addition, Democrats ousted seven Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives, cutting in half the GOP congressional delegation.\n\nCatil-Sakauye's rejection of the GOP goes beyond Kavanaugh and the party's disdain toward women. She recently criticized Trump for his attacks on federal judges and the entire justice system in the United States.\n\n\"I don't believe the attacks are going to stop,\" Catil-Sakauye said earlier this week. \"I do not believe the undermining and marginalizing of the branch will ever stop.\"\n\nFrom embracing alleged sexual predators to undermining the rule of law, Catil-Sakauye said she believes the Republican Party left her behind.\n\nShe's not wrong.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is desperately trying to cover up for the felonies he allegedly committed with his former lawyer.\n\nFederal prosecutors now believe that Trump committed felonies when he and his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, tried to influence the 2016 election by paying hush money to Trump's former mistresses.\n\nAnd on Thursday, a seemingly panicked Trump told at least six different lies about his alleged crimes and his relationship with Cohen in less than two minutes of an interview on Fox News.\n\nEven in the face of friendly questioning on a network that functions as his de facto propaganda arm, Trump still chose to mislead viewers with a rapid-fire series of far-fetched and contradictory claims about the man who was his fixer and personal lawyer.\n\nHere are the six lies Trump told:\n\n1) Trump said Cohen did \"very low-level work\" within his organization, which is a clearly untruthful way to describe the man who worked as his attack dog and enforcer for over a decade. If Cohen was such a low-level employee, why would Trump have trusted him with making very sensitive and secretive payoffs to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her from telling the world that she slept with Trump?\n\n2) Trump claimed that Cohen \"did more public relations than he did law.\" While Cohen did make embarrassing appearances on TV on Trump's behalf, he also definitely acted as Trump's lawyer \u2014 and even once intimidated a reporter with legal threats for reporting negatively on Trump. Cohen did enough legal work for Trump that the FBI raided his offices to seize years' worth of documents. And again: Why would Trump have let a PR guy handle a sensitive legal matter like paying off mistresses?\n\n3) Trump further tried to distance himself from Cohen by insisting that he only hired Cohen as thanks for a \"favor\" done to Trump years ago. That favor? Advocating for Trump on a condo board. Again, why would Trump trust a guy who ... you get the idea.\n\n4) Trump claimed that the criminal activity Cohen confessed to in court \"was all unrelated to me, except for the two campaign finance charges that are not criminal.\" But Cohen was just sentenced to three years in prison for those acts that Trump says were \"not criminal.\"\n\n5) Trump insisted that federal prosecutors added the supposedly bogus campaign finance charges to Cohen's case just to \"embarrass\" Trump. The idea that federal prosecutors would defraud the criminal justice system by filing false charges just to \"embarrass\" a U.S. president, and that Cohen would accept jail time for the same reason, is beyond nuts.\n\n6) Trump suggested that President Barack Obama had similar troubles with campaign finance law to Trump's. That's not even close to true.\n\nTrump's lies are complicated, but the truth is simple.\n\nCohen committed crimes to defend Trump. He admitted this in court to get a reduced jail sentence because he knew he couldn't get away with it, and because he was tired of performing \"dirty deeds\" on behalf of his former boss.\n\nMultiple legal proceedings over the last week have made it clear to the American people that Trump was deeply involved in breaking federal laws.\n\nEven members of Trump's own party are finally beginning to admit that there's a good reason Trump is under the microscope of federal investigators.\n\nTrump's response to this truth, as usual, is to tell lies on top of lies to avoid it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

In Trump's case, his terrified lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, tried to downplay the severity of Trump's crimes to the Daily Beast.\n\n\"Nobody got killed, nobody got robbed\u2026 This was not a big crime,\" Giuliani said.\n\nEven Giuliani admitting it is a crime at all is a big deal. His admission directly contradicts Trump's unhinged tweets claiming he did nothing wrong and certainly not anything criminal. But now his lawyer is admitting Trump is a criminal, but desperately trying to downplay the importance of his crimes.\n\nGiuliani and Trump are referring to the attempts of Trump, Cohen, and others to pay hush money to at least two of Trump's mistresses so that they would not speak to the media during the close 2016 election. As Cohen admitted in court, the purpose of the illegal campaign contribution was to influence the election and steal the White House.\n\nThese are not minor infractions or mere paperwork errors. In fact, the the federal judge in Cohen's sentencing hearing said \"each of these crimes is a serious offense against the United States.\"\n\nEven the Trump-appointed federal prosecutors think Trump committed multiple felonies, crimes that ultimately helped land Cohen in prison for three years.\n\nGiuliani isn't the only Trump ally to begin to crack. Some Republican Senators are beginning to lose faith in Trump's innocence.\n\n\"Am I concerned that the president might be involved in a crime? Of course,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) told reporters recently.\n\nTrump's denials are getting louder and more insistent as more and more allies are forced to admit Trump's growing criminal activity. In an interview with \"Good Morning America,\" Cohen spoke plainly about the crimes and Trump's denials.\n\n\"He knows the truth. I know the truth. Others know the truth,\" Cohen said. \"And here is the truth: People of the United States of America, people of the world, don't believe what he is saying.\"\n\nTrump's former lawyer, Cohen, is saying Trump is a criminal and a liar. And now even his current lawyer, Giuliani, is saying Trump is a criminal.\n\nIt seems pretty clear that Trump is, in fact, a criminal.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

In the 2018 midterms, NRA-backed candidates lost all over the country, signalling Americans are tired of the gun violence the group helps perpetuate. The organization is in such dire straits that it can't even afford to provide coffee for employees anymore.\n\nWhile only 30, Butina ran in circles with several high-level conservatives. House Democrats, soon to be in the majority, are concerned about Butina's interaction with Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton. In 2013, both Bolton and Butina spoke at a pro-gun roundtable discussion, leaving Democrats wondering how much interaction an alleged Russian agent had with Trump's top national security aide. (Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian agents, and is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.)\n\nButina also had interactions with at least one member of Congress. On more than one occasion, she dined with outgoing Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), often referred to as \"Putin's favorite congressman\" for his unsavory ties to Russia. Rohrabacher, who embraces far-right fringe conspiracy theories and has called U.S. intelligence agencies liars when defending Mother Russia, denies any wrongdoing. Rohrabacher lost his re-election efforts in the 2018 midterms as part of the decimation of the Republican Party in California.\n\nIf Butina is cooperating with federal prosecutors, there could be real consequences for the NRA and the untold numbers of conservative activists she worked with.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

So naturally, the GOP freshman class elected him to be their leader.\n\nGreen, who won the House seat vacated by Marsha Blackburn when she ran for Senate, was elected unanimously by 30 freshman Republicans to be their class president.\n\nHis ignorant and bigoted views make him the perfect poster-child for Republicans in the Trump era.\n\nGreen, a medical doctor, recently embraced the debunked fringe theory that vaccines may cause autism. At a meeting with constituents after he was elected to the House, Green claimed that \"there is some concern that the rise in autism is the result of the preservatives that are in our vaccines.\"\n\nIt's completely irresponsible for a doctor to say this. There is no link between vaccines and autism, and the idea that there is comes from fraudulent research.\n\nWhen asked to clarify his statements later, Green doubled down. \"There appears to be some evidence that as vaccine numbers increase, rates of autism increase,\" he said. \"We need better research, and we need it fast.\"\n\nPediatricians \"expressed dismay\" at his comments, according to NBC News.\n\n\"[A]ny physician who espouses overt anti-vaccine views is contributing to our national decline in child public health, and could be considered in violation\" of their Hippocratic oath, Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatrician and dean of the school of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told NBC News.\n\nGovernment agencies like the CDC have been working to dispel harmful myths like the ones Green is perpetuating.\n\nAnd even though Green peddled these myths, his spokesperson told NBC that Green's own children are vaccinated.\n\nIn addition to his anti-science remarks, the new leader of freshman Republicans has also trafficked in bigotry.\n\nIn 2017, Green was nominated to be Trump's Secretary of the Army. Soon thereafter, his hateful rhetoric on a variety of topics came out, causing even Republican senators to question his fitness for the job.\n\n\"There's a lot of controversy concerning his nomination,\" the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) said at the time, according to the Washington Post.\n\nGreen said it was a \"great question\" when someone at a 2016 tea party rally asked him about people who \"don't belong here, like Muslims in the United States.\"\n\nAt the same rally, Green adamantly told attendees he would not stand for children to learn anything about Islam in school. \"When you start teaching the pillars of Islam ... we will not tolerate that in this state,\" Green said.\n\nGreen also attacked members of the LGBTQ community, claiming that psychiatrists say \"transgender is a disease.\" Green's anti-trans statement are not backed up by facts, as neither the American Medical Association nor the American Psychiatric Association say that being transgender is a mental disorder.\n\nGreen's \"dangerous views and hateful comments are disqualifying for any public servant,\" Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in 2017.\n\nWhen it came time to elect a class president, 30 new House Republicans rallied behind Green. His ideas \u2014 full of ignorance and disdain for fellow Americans \u2014 are apparently the best Republicans have to offer in the Trump era.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Although Florida voters voted to immediately restore the voting rights of felons who have served their time, governor-elect Ron DeSantis is trying to slow-walk it.\n\nLast month, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a measure that would restore voting rights to felons once they're done serving their time, without making them wait five years to go through the complicated, and usually unsuccessful, process of applying to have their rights restored.\n\nNevertheless, governor-elect Ron DeSantis, who will take office next month, is trying to stall that process \u2014 and it could keep a lot of Floridians from voting in an upcoming mayoral election.\n\nThe ACLU has pointed out that the language of Amendment 4, which enshrined voter re-enfranchisement in Florida's constitution, is essentially self-implementing, meaning it could go into effect right away.\n\nAt root, it's a very simple measure: Once someone has served their sentence, they should be able to register to vote.\n\nDeSantis, though, says he is going to wait until the 60-day Florida legislative session begins on March 5 so that the legislature can pass implementing language.\n\nEven if the legislature were to pass the measure immediately, this foot-dragging will have the effect of preventing many people from voting in the Tampa mayoral race, which takes place on March 5.\n\nDeSantis is perfectly willing to move quickly on things he likes, such as installing conservative justices on the Florida Supreme Court. But when it comes to strengthening democracy, he'd prefer to drag his feet.\n\nPerhaps it is no surprise that the man who wrote a book excusing slavery and hurled racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric during his campaign would also be the person who is unwilling to restore voting rights in an expedient way.\n\nBlack people are disproportionately arrested and incarcerated, and nearly 20 percent of potential black voters in Florida have been unable to vote due to a prior conviction.\n\nDeSantis won by less than 25,000 votes in a state where 1.5 million people were permanently disenfranchised from voting despite having served their sentences.\n\nAnd DeSantis isn't the only Republican who is pretending to be confused about how this measure works.\n\nGOP Senator Dennis Baxley said he still has questions such as whether individuals will have \"complete[d]\" their debt to society\" and whether they have to meet probation.\n\nQuestions like that fly in the face of the simplicity of the ballot measure, which states that voting rights will be restored to all felons, save those convicted of sexual assault or murder, \"after they complete all terms of their sentence including parole or probation.\"\n\nThe Florida legislature refused to deal with felon re-enfranchisement for decades, which is how this matter ended up on the ballot instead. Voters took measures into their own hands and emphatically declared that they wanted this to happen.\n\nNeither DeSantis nor the rest of the Florida GOP has the right to thwart the will of the voters.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is in trouble now that even loyal senators like Bill Cassidy of Louisiana are questioning his innocence.\n\nAs evidence piles up that Trump may have committed multiple felonies, even Trump's stalwart Republican allies are beginning to question his innocence.\n\n\"Am I concerned that the president might be involved in a crime? Of course,\" Republican Bill Cassidy, the senior senator from Louisiana, told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nNBC News reports that comments like this show \"cracks in what has been a solid wall of support for Trump\" after Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime personal lawyer, pleaded guilty to two felonies and testified that Trump directed him to arrange illegal hush money payments to women Trump had had affairs with.\n\nCassidy also said he thinks the only question is \"whether or not this so-called hush money is a crime.\"\n\nThe payments would indeed be a crime if they were intended to help Trump's campaign without being disclosed as a campaign expense.\n\nMultiple former Trump allies, including Cohen, say this is exactly what happened \u2014 that the payments were a deliberate effort to keep the women from going public with damaging stories about Trump that could hurt his chances in the election.\n\nCohen's testimony on this point is now corroborated by executives at AMI, the company that owns the National Enquirer. AMI struck a deal to avoid prosecution in exchange for admitting that it participated in Trump's illegal scheme to influence the 2016 election.\n\nA federal judge described the actions of Cohen and Trump as \"an insidious crime to our democratic institutions.\"\n\nWhile many Republicans have sought to downplay the severity of these alleged crimes, NBC News reports Cassidy isn't alone in questioning Trump.\n\nAfter months of overwhelming evidence showing Trump was engaged in nefarious activity, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) was also forced to tepidly admit Trump could face consequences for committing crimes.\n\n\"If someone has violated the law, the application of the law should be applied to them like it would to any other citizen in this country, and obviously if you're in a position of great authority like the presidency that would be the case,\" Rubio said over the weekend.\n\nStill, while the damning evidence against Trump is belatedly forcing some Republicans to weakly reckon with the truth, most of the Republican Party continues to stand by Trump and even defend his likely criminal activity.\n\nUtah's retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch actually came out and said, \"I don't care\" that Trump broke the law.\n\nComplicit Republicans, like outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan, have spent the entirety of Trump's tenure in the White House covering up for his crimes.\n\nThat's one reason the American people, sick of a Congress without a backbone, ousted the Republican House majority in favor of a new Democratic majority led by Nancy Pelosi.\n\nAnd unlike Republicans, that new Democratic majority in the House isn't going to ignore evidence that Trump broke the law and cheated in order to win the 2016 election.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A 7-year-old girl died in custody of the U.S. government. Kirstjen Nielsen made it her priority to blame the child's family.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen blamed a migrant family for the death of a 7-year-old girl who was being held in custody by the U.S. Border Patrol. The Guatemalan child died of dehydration and shock after the Border Patrol took her and her family into custody.\n\nNielsen, using a casual tone, told Fox News the child's death happened because \"this family chose to cross illegally.\"\n\nWith a slight laugh, Nielsen said \"it took our border patrol a couple times\" to detain all the people the young girl's family had been traveling with. She refused to discuss the Trump administration's role in the death, stating, \"I cannot stress how dangerous this journey is when migrants choose to come here illegally.\"\n\nA statement from the Department of Homeland Security also completely, and cruelly, bucked blame, echoing Nielsen's response of the migrant family: \"Once again, we are begging parents to not put themselves or their children at risk attempting to enter illegally. Please present yourselves at a port of entry and seek to enter legally and safely.\"\n\nThe ACLU slammed the Trump-led agency after the death. In a statement, Cynthia Pompa, advocacy manager for the ACLU Border Rights Center, slammed the \"lack of accountability, and a culture of cruelty\" within the Border Patrol agency. \"This tragedy represents the worst possible outcome when people, including children, are held in inhumane conditions.\"\n\n\"When the Trump administration pushes for the militarization of the border, including more border wall construction, they are driving people fleeing violence into the deadliest desert regions.\"\n\nShe added, \"The fact that it took a week for this to come to light shows the need for transparency for CBP. We call for a rigorous investigation into how this tragedy happened and serious reforms to prevent future deaths.\"\n\n\"We can and must do better as a nation,\" Rep. Joaquin Castro, chairman elect of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said in a statement. \"This is a humanitarian crisis and we have a moral obligation to ensure these vulnerable families can safely seek asylum, which is legal under immigration and international law, at our borders.\"\n\nRecords from the agency said she was taken into custody at 10 p.m. on December 6 and started having seizures 8 hours later. Emergency responders stated that she had a body temperature of 105.7 degrees. In a statement, the Border Patrol said she \"reportedly had not eaten or consumed water for several days.\"\n\nShe was flown to Providence Children's Hospital in El Paso, Texas, where she went into cardiac arrest and died.\n\nThe Washington Post noted, \"Food and water are typically provided to migrants in Border Patrol custody, and it wasn't immediately clear Thursday if the girl received provisions and a medical exam before the onset of seizures.\"\n\nTrump has enshrined cruelty to migrants as American border policy. He has ordered the separation of families at the border and detention at facilities with track records of abuse and cruelty, and has overseen the tear-gassing of young children at the border.\n\nHis hand-picked henchman, Secretary Nielsen, has wholeheartedly embraced Trump's racist approach to the border to keep herself safe in her job. This now includes blaming families for the deaths of their children and inappropriately laughing about it with Trump's cheerleaders on Fox News.\n\nA child died in American custody. It happened in a climate of cruelty put in place by Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Mueller is closing in, and the panic from Trump and Rudy Giuliani is palpable.\n\nAn unhinged Rudy Giuliani gave an \"unprompted\" interview to Yahoo News just hours after Trump's longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for a myriad of crimes, including some felonies involving Trump. The panic from Giuliani mirrors the frenetic tweeting from Trump, as both are clearly terrified of what Mueller's investigation will turn up.\n\nGiuliani, Trump's attorney, was practically begging Mueller's team to wrap up their investigation. \"If he doesn't have anything, you know, write your report, tell us what you have, and we\u2019ll deal with it,\" Giuliani whined. \"All he can do is write a report about him, so write the goddamned thing and get it over with now,\" he added.\n\nTrump is so frazzled that he has resorted to simple, two-word tweets, such as \"WITCH HUNT!\" His Twitter feed is littered with diatribes spouting unfounded conspiracy theories about former FBI director James Comey, the FBI in general, and both Mueller and Mueller's team. Earlier in December, Trump unleashed a tirade of tweets against Cohen, demanding a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nThe terror is understandable, since the longer Mueller's investigation goes on, the more damning evidence mounts against both Trump and his campaign. Five high-ranking campaign officials or close confidants of Trump have already pleaded guilty to a variety of criminal charges and agreed to cooperate with Mueller's probe in some form.\n\nPart of Cohen's recent jail sentence centered on an illegal plot, directed by Trump, to pay hush money to two of Trump's mistresses to keep them from talking to the media before the 2016 election. \"Mr. Cohen's crimes implicate a far more insidious crime to our democratic institutions,\" the judge told the courtroom during Cohen's sentencing.\n\nIn May, Giuliani described Cohen as \"an honest, honorable lawyer.\" In fact, when asked if he was worried Cohen was going to cooperate with prosecutors, Giuliani said, \"I expect that he is going to cooperate with them. I don't think they'll be happy with it because he doesn't have any incriminating evidence about the president or himself.\"\n\nAfter Cohen did cooperate with prosecutors, as Giuliani had hoped, Giuliani described Cohen slightly differently.\n\n\"Cohen is a completely dishonorable person,\" Giuliani told Yahoo.\n\nEven though the Trump-directed crimes committed by Cohen were prosecuted by a Trump-appointed prosecutor in New York, Giuliani nonetheless raged against Mueller's team some more.\n\n\"How do they all of a sudden become campaign finance prosecutors? You need a special prosecutor for campaign finance? I mean, they started with collusion. \u2026 After two years and two investigations \u2026 they have nothing on collusion,\" Giuliani said. And he went on.\n\n\"Then, they started squeaking about obstruction. They've got nothing on obstruction,\" Giuliani said, but without providing any evidence as to what the Mueller team has or doesn't have.\n\nIn the end, Giuliani's demand for the Mueller report is a dangerous request. After all, this is the same Rudy Giuliani who was happy to see Cohen cooperate with prosecutors. Giuliani might want to be a little more careful what he wishes for.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans have to soothe Trump's ego after his humiliating encounter with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer by wasting billions on a useless wall.\n\nRepublicans are responding to Trump's public humiliation at the hands of Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer by mounting a full-press effort to waste at least $5 billion in tax dollars on a useless wall.\n\nThe Democrats bluntly explained to Trump that he does not have the votes in Congress to fund the wall and continuing to fume about it while threatening to shut down the government is useless and counterproductive.\n\nThe party apparently believes that a big show of support for Trump's pipe dream project is needed to stop the political bleeding.\n\nPolitico reports that House Republican leaders like Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) are \"discussing several hard-line spending tactics that would assert support for Trump\u2019s $5 billion wall request.\" Ryan is reportedly even considering a plan that would give Trump his wall money and freeze federal spending into the new year.\n\nRep. Mike Coffman (R-CO) told Politico, \"When Nancy Pelosi challenged the president by saying, 'You don't have the votes,' that put us in a situation to at least demonstrate from a negotiating standpoint that we do have the votes.\"\n\nRep. John Culberson (R-TX) also said, \"I think we all need to get behind it and illustrate to the president that we've got the support for it.\"\n\nBut Ryan's scheming would not be supported by Democrats and more failed wall legislation would further embarrass Trump.\n\nPolitico noted, \"Failing to secure the votes would be the ultimate humiliation for GOP leaders.\"\n\nTrump has threatened to shut down the federal government and shoulder the blame for the unnecessary disruption to the lives of millions of Americans, all to raise funding for the wall idea.\n\nPelosi and Schumer made it clear to Trump in their meeting that they oppose the racist idea, as they have since Trump took office two years ago.\n\nTrump promised during the presidential campaign that Mexico would pay for the project, but their government repeatedly has said no such thing will happen.\n\nIn fact, while his allies in Congress are strategizing to spend billions on a wall, Trump is still claiming that Mexico will pay for it.\n\nHe tweeted, \"Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!\"\n\nThe argument is nonsensical but even if taken at face value it doesn't explain why GOP lawmakers are still pushing forward with a plan to spend on the wall, other than as a sad attempt to bolster Trump's sagging ego.\n\nIn response to his newest posturing, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) wrote, \"Since you found a 'way' to 'pay' for your boondoggle wall I assume you\u2019ll stop threatening to shut down the government next week if American taxpayers don\u2019t fork over $5 billion? Let us know when the check is in the mail.\"\n\nTrump's wall isn't happening, and he was embarrassed when Democratic leaders made it clear directly to his face that he doesn't have support for it. Republicans are scrambling to make it happen before he has another embarrassing public tantrum.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Elise Stefanik (R-NY) told Politico, \"we are at a crisis level for GOP women,\" and said the recent election \"should be a wake-up call to Republicans that we need to do better.\" Stefanik admitted that the party has been \"suppressing\" women's voices.\n\nThe congresswoman has faced opposition in her attempts to recruit women to run for office under the party's banner. When she called for devoting resources to support women running as Republicans, the new chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), said that would be a \"mistake.\"\n\n\"I am tired of having this issue within our conference.\" Stefanik said.\n\nWhile the Democratic victory in the midterm election was powered by women voters and candidates, Republicans have been on the losing end as they embraced misogyny.\n\nRep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) told Politico, \"I have seen no sign\" of reflection by party leaders about the problems with the women's vote despite the electoral drubbing they received. Wagner told the outlet that female candidates face sexism from the male-dominated network of donors in Republican circles.\n\nRep. Diane Black (R-TN) said the fact that 90 percent of the 103 women in the House will be Democrats while Republican numbers dwindle is \"so disappointing I could just scream.\"\n\nRepublican women are now exposing their party's bigotry in the hopes of improving their overall political fortunes. Speaking at the Women Rules event held by Politico, other Republican women called out the party's sexist attitudes.\n\nSarah Chamberlain, president and CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership, said she met several Republican women who complained to her about Trump's tweets attacking porn star Stormy Daniels as a \"horseface.\"\n\nTrump has often attacked women in that manner, with little outcry or condemnation from his fellow Republican lawmakers, making him the most obvious symbol of the right's anti-woman stance. He is also an admitted sexual assaulter and has used his position to attack and demean women. But the problem extends far beyond him and his presidency.\n\nRep. Mia Love (R-UT) lost her race against Democrat Ben McAdams and was mocked by Trump for not marching in lockstep with his misogynist administration. \"Mia Love gave me no love and she lost,\" he said.\n\nAt the event, Love responded to Trump, \"My job is not to walk in lockstep with somebody just because they\u2019re sitting in the White House.\"\n\nThe comment appeared to not just rebuke Trump, but to call out the Republicans, like outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), who have remained quiet as the party echoed and emulated Trump's hostility to women.\n\nRepublicans have attacked women's health and rights as part of the war on women, extending to Congress and statehouses, and their behavior is helping put the party on the losing end of elections. Now, even Republican women are speaking up in hopes of correcting the party's disastrous path.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the men in control will listen, or care.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

According to the Journal, some of the evidence that led to an investigation came from Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime personal lawyer, who this week was sentenced to three years in prison, in part because he colluded with Trump to commit felonies during the 2016 campaign. As part of Cohen's two plea deals, he is cooperating with multiple investigations into Trump and Trump's campaign.\n\nDuring an FBI raid of Cohen's office, the FBI found a recording of Cohen and a colleague discussing the inaugural committee, which is part of the evidence that led to opening a criminal investigation.\n\nTrump's former deputy campaign manager, Richard Gates, served as the inaugural committee's deputy chairman. Gates pleaded guilty to a variety of crimes in February 2018, and has also been a cooperating witness in multiple investigations led by both special counsel Robert Mueller and the Department of Justice.\n\nA lawyer close to the inaugural committee had no knowledge of any criminal investigation, according to the Journal.\n\nWith this latest investigation, it seems Trump's culture of corruption extends far and wide, and no one yet knows the limits.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Ballot measures let voters have a say, and Republicans in Michigan don't like that.\n\nThroughout 2018, Michigan voters used the power of ballot initiatives to back progressive goals. More than 380,000 people signed a petition to get a paid sick leave measure on the ballot. And more than 370,000 people signed a separate petition to get a measure on the ballot that would raise Michigan's minimum wage.\n\nBut the Michigan GOP made sure those measures didn't get on the ballot, passing their own versions of the laws only so they could water them down later during the lame-duck session.\n\nThree more progressive initiatives \u2014 one legalizing marijuana, one creating an independent redistricting commission, and one strengthening voting rights \u2014 did appear on the 2018 ballot. In spite of that, or perhaps because of it, the Michigan GOP wants to make ballot initiatives much harder.\n\nJames Lower, a GOP representative, introduced a bill with three key provisions. First, it would require people circulating ballot petitions to say if they are being paid to collect signatures. Next, it would invalidate any signatures from a petition circulator if that person misled people about the proposal. Finally, it would cap signatures by district so that no more than 10% of the initiative's signatures could come from any one of the state's congressional districts.\n\nOstensibly, said Lower, this will strengthen grassroots lawmaking by increasing transparency. It's unclear how grassroots lawmaking is strengthened by making it harder for grassroots initiatives to make it on the ballot. Additionally, there's no evidence that there was any lack of transparency or misleading communication about any of the ballot proposals.\n\nWhile the insinuation that special interests are lying to Michigan voters about ballot proposals is bad enough, it's the signature-cap provision that is the most damaging. By capping signatures per congressional district, the bill is targeted at minimizing the influence of residents of Michigan's largest city, Detroit. Also, Michigan is heavily gerrymandered, which means that progressive voters are packed into a few districts. This bill would ensure that even if several hundred thousand people were in favor of a measure getting on the ballot, it wouldn't matter unless those people were distributed evenly throughout the state.\n\nAt root, this is nothing but another cynical move by the Michigan GOP to thwart the will of the voters. Voters passed measures that the GOP doesn't like, so they're going to take away the ability of voters ever to do so again.\n\nRepublicans have already used the lame-duck session to try to gut sick leave, undercut the authority of incoming Democratic officials, and weaken already-passed ballot measures. It was inevitable that their next step would be to impair the ability of Michigan voters to band together to seek change.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The president is literally claiming responsibility.\"\n\nSenate Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), publicly breaking ranks with Trump, warned against shutting down the government.\n\nWhen asked about Trump's tantrum-like threat to shut down the government , McConnell said, \"I hope that's not where we end up.\"\n\n\"One thing I think is pretty clear no matter who precipitates the government shutdown is the American people don't like it,\" McConnell added about a looming Trump shutdown.\n\nWhile McConnell publicly broke ranks with Trump's desire to shut down the government a few days before Christmas, another Republican seemed to claim that Trump was just out of his league and fell into a trap, despite Trump's apparent enthusiasm toward taking credit for a shutdown.\n\nSen. Jerry Moran (R-KS) told CNN correspondent Manu Raju, \"I think Sen. Schumer was very shrewd in his efforts to make sure whatever blame exists with the shutdown doesn't rest with the Democrats.\"\n\nWhile Republicans struggle to figure out how to handle Trump's latest meltdown, Pelosi was busy adding insult to injury. Referring to Trump's obsession with building a wall, Pelosi told colleagues, \"It's like a manhood thing for him. As if manhood could ever be associated with him.\"\n\nPelosi has no plans to cower in front of Trump. She'll stand up to him \u2014 and in doing so, stand up for Americans who are sick and tired of Trump's childish antics.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Virulent homophobia and misogyny have become totally normal in today's Republican party.\n\nA Republican congressional committee canceled a hearing on the minimum wage after one of the GOP's key witnesses was exposed for writing ragingly homophobic and misogynistic columns \u2014 including a call to \"tax and regulate homosexual acts.\"\n\nSan Diego State University economist Joseph Sabia was supposed to testify on behalf of Republicans at the hearing, entitled \"Mandating a $15 Minimum Wage: Consequences for Workers and Small Businesses,\" to support the GOP's ongoing attacks on the idea of raising the minimum wage.\n\nSabia is the author of \"Minimum Wages: A Poor Way to Reduce Poverty,\" a research paper that was also published by the conservative Cato Institute as part of its Tax & Budget Bulletin.\n\nBut Sabia also wrote bigoted columns for the Cornell Review, a publication of conservative Cornell University Students, which he also published on his personal website.\n\nIn his August 2002 column titled \"Tax Gay Sex,\" Sabia argued that conservatives should offer legislation that would \"tax and regulate homosexual acts.\"\n\n\"Homosexual activity has been responsible for devastating health outcomes \u2014 deadly HIV, hepatitis B, and various other sexually transmitted diseases,\" Sabia wrote. \"In gay sex, we have an activity that is clearly leading to disastrous health consequences. What rational person would engage in this sort of activity? There is only one solution \u2014 let's tax it.\"\n\nHe argued that conservatives should \"mount the assault on Big Gay (no, I am not talking about Rosie O'Donnell),\" and proposed to \"tax gay nightclubs, websites, personal ads, sexual paraphernalia.\"\n\nSabia promoted misogyny as well as homophobia. He even identified himself as a \"bitter, cranky, rapidly-aging misogynist\" in a March 2002 column, entitled \"College Girls: Unpaid Whores,\" that attacked feminism and women's studies programs at universities.\n\n\"Feminist thought has taught young women that equality is achieved by acting like promiscuous sluts,\" Sabia wrote. \"Today\u2019s college girl looks to Ally McBeal, the trollops of Sex in the City, and the floozies on Friends to set their moral compasses.\"\n\nHe went on to argue that \"women actually lose power by becoming tramps,\" and claimed that \"the behavior of young heterosexuals has begun to resemble that of gay men because young women are imitating men in their sexual promiscuity.\"\n\nSabia later responded to criticism of his misogynistic column by doubling down on his bigotry. He accused detractors of \"reacting like hysterical women (I know, that\u2019s redundant).\"\n\nThe revelations about Sabia, and the consequent cancellation of the hearing, are a sad statement on the priorities and ideology of the outgoing Republican majority.\n\nMisogyny and homophobia are not limited to Trump at the head of the party. These hateful attitudes permeate much of what the Republican Party does, including \"economic\" issues. Keeping down the minimum wage also specifically hurts marginalized groups like women and LGBTQ people.\n\nThe hearing was scheduled by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which is chaired by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC). The subcommittee that was slated to host Sabia, the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, is chaired by Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL).\n\nBoth Foxx and Byrne have ratings of 0 out of a possible 100 from the Human Rights Campaign for their votes attacking LGBTQ Americans in the current Congress.\n\nThat ideological background might help explain how and why Sabia was chosen to testify before the committee.\n\nReps. Foxx and Byrne tried to use their committee to launch one last assault on working families in America \u2014 but they were foiled when their hatred became too obvious.\n\nBoth members easily won re-election this November. But thanks to the 40 seats lost by Republicans overall, the House will no longer be led by the kind of party that would send bigoted \"experts\" to attack the minimum wage.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "There's no conspiracy behind Rep. Jeff Denham's loss. It's just voters ousting a Trump loyalist from office.\n\nRep. Jeff Denham (R-CA) is one of seven California Republicans ousted by voters in the 2018 midterm. But rather than face defeat with any bit of dignity or grace, Denham joined the GOP bandwagon of claiming some sort of nefarious \"fraud\" is to blame.\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC's Kasie Hunt, Denham did all he could to deny the legitimacy of his 4-point loss to Democrat Josh Harder and insult the majority of voters, who preferred the other candidate, first by blaming \"ballot harvesting\" for his loss. (\"Ballot harvesting is a term used to describe how citizens can have another person physically deliver their completed ballot for them. This is helpful for many citizens, including those who are elderly or dealing with a debilitating sickness.)\n\n\"Ballot harvesting is legal now in California as of this last election,\" Denham said. \"When you can find 250,000 ballots after Election Day, you can move a lot of different seats.\"\n\nIn California, ballots that are mailed on Election Day are collected and counted, much to Denham's dismay. So election officials did not \"find\" more ballots \u2014 voters cast those ballots.\n\n\"The Republican argument is built on the keen observation that they could have won more races if only California election officials would abandon their annoying insistence on counting all the votes,\" chides the San Francisco Chronicle about GOP complaints.\n\nWhen Hunt asked him about Trump being a contributing factor for his loss, Denham decided to act like Trump and just make things up, inventing poll numbers to bolster his case for his imaginary conspiracy theory.\n\n\"If you look at polling numbers, the president was polling almost even right before my election,\" Denham huffed. \"We were up by 8 points,\" he added.\n\nThat's just not true, according to publicly available polls. The last public poll before the election, by Sienna College, showed Denham down by 2 points, nowhere near the 8-point advantage he claims. Further, it showed Trump's approval rating in the district underwater, with only 45 percent approving and 49 percent disapproving of him. In fact, FiveThirtyEight doesn't show a single poll with Denham leading.\n\nDenham joins a growing cadre of Republicans who are hostile to the idea of democracy. Fellow California Republican Rep. Mimi Walters accused her opponent, congresswoman-elect Katie Porter, of \"stealing\" the election because election officials were counting all the votes.\n\nOutgoing Speaker Paul Ryan similarly complained to the media about a \"bizarre\" system where all votes are counted.\n\nWhere Republicans like Denham, Walters, and Ryan will make up conspiracies about election fraud where none exist, Republicans are quiet as can be when it comes to the real election fraud happening in North Carolina.\n\nIn a House race in western North Carolina, Republican Mark Harris thought he won by about 900 votes. But an investigation has turned up massive election fraud by the Republican campaign where ballots were illegally harvested and thousands may have been destroyed rather than turned in. There are sworn affidavits from voters who claim Republican operatives took their unsealed, and possibly blank, ballots, telling the voters that the harvester would take care of it. (In North Carolina, it is illegal for a third-party to collect ballots.)\n\nDenham's display was a pathetic combination of conspiracy-peddling and shameful lying. But as much as it may hurt Denham's fragile ego, there's no grand conspiracy; it's just voters in a democracy deciding Denham is no longer fit to represent them in Congress. Rather than just look in the mirror and admit he failed, Denham joined a dangerous trend of Republicans seeking to undermine confidence in our election system.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump threw a childish tantrum, while Democratic leaders in Congress showed that they\u2019re the real adults in the room.\n\nTrump probably thought he was being clever on Tuesday when he insisted on inviting the press into what was supposed to be a closed-door negotiating session over government spending with House Minority Leader (and likely soon House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nInstead, Trump made a complete fool of himself on camera.\n\nHe whined and yelled. He interrupted and made dumb, snide remarks. He told the same blatant lies about how the wall is already being built and is already effective that have already been repeatedly fact-checked \u2014 the kinds of Trump lies that are so persistent, the Washington Post's fact-checker had to invent a whole new category of \"Pinocchios\" to describe them.\n\nPelosi and Schumer actually tried, gently at first, to steer Trump away from publicly humiliating himself by urging him to have this discussion off-camera.\n\nBut when he refused, they also stood firm against his bullying, called out his nonsense, and made him look exactly like the petulant child he is.\n\nIt's worth watching the whole exchange, which pool reporters later described as \"nuts\" and \"unbelievable even by the standards\" of this White House.\n\nTrump started getting very testy when Pelosi pointed out that he doesn't even have the votes in the Republican-dominated House for the full $5 billion of border wall funding that he wants.\n\nHe insisted that he could \"easily\" get the votes in the House if he wanted to, but claimed there was no point because it wouldn't get through the Senate.\n\nPelosi patiently explained that in the process of legislating \u2014 which, she reminded Trump, \"is what we do\" \u2014 you start by making your case with bills and votes.\n\n\"That's what the House Republicans would do, if they had the votes,\" she said. \"But there are no votes.\"\n\nThen Trump kept repeating the phrase \"border security\" like it was a magic word, insisted that you can't have border security without having the wall, and claimed that the wall is already partially built and is already working.\n\nBut Schumer systematically explained why all of that was nonsense.\n\n\"The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built,\" Schumer told Trump. He pointed out that according to experts, the wall is \"wasteful and doesn't solve the problem\" of border security.\n\nAnd if Trump is bragging about the current state of border security, Schumer asked, then what's wrong with just giving him the same deal he got last year \u2014 money for border security, but not specifically a wall? (What's more, as Schumer later pointed out to reporters, most of last year's $1.6 billion appropriated for border security hasn't even been spent yet.)\n\nThings started getting really bad when Pelosi reminded Trump that voters decisively rejected his agenda in November by putting Democrats back in charge of the House.\n\n\"We've gained in the Senate!\" Trump objected petulantly. He repeated, interrupting Pelosi: \"Nancy, we've gained in the Senate. Excuse me, did we win the Senate?\"\n\n\"When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble,\" Schumer quipped.\n\n\"I did!\" Trump whined. \"We did win!\"\n\nAnd in a moment almost too self-sabotaging to be believed, Trump actually declared that he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government if he doesn't get his way on the wall.\n\nTrump really, really, wants his wall. He wants it like a toddler wants a new toy he just saw on TV, and he will quite literally throw a tantrum until he gets it.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, he has to negotiate with grown-ups. And the grown-up Democratic leaders in Congress just proved that they're perfectly willing to just let Trump cry it out until he gives up.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Collin Peterson of Minnesota, the head Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, told Politico he has received standing ovations in Democratic caucus meetings because he \"stared [Republicans] down\" on this issue.\n\nUnder the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, Democrats unanimously opposed the House version of the farm bill over the summer, leading to its initial defeat \u2014 and one of Ryan's many embarrassments as Speaker. A subsequent version eventually passed by just two votes.\n\nBut this time around, Peterson told Politico he expected most Democrats to support the compromise version because Ryan's agenda was so thoroughly crushed.\n\nThat turned out to be true, and Pelosi turned out to be much better at keeping her caucus unified than Ryan did.\n\nIn the end, the bill passed 369-47, with only three of the \"no\" votes coming from Democrats. The remaining 44 came from Ryan's Republican caucus.\n\nIn one of his final acts as Speaker, Ryan tried to use pathetic lies to corral members of his own party. And even that didn't work too well.\n\nIn the end, Ryan was forced to rely on Pelosi, Peterson, and almost every House Democrat to pass a key piece of legislation \u2014 and he was forced to give up on his yearslong dream of making life worse for people who need help with their grocery bills.\n\nIt's a fitting way to cement Ryan's embarrassingly ineffective legacy as Speaker.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Michael Cohen.\n\nThere's never a self-made problem so big that Trump can't find someone else to blame it on.\n\nNow that's it's been revealed Trump likely committed felonies to influence the 2016 election, Trump claims he didn't commit any crimes, but if he did, it was most definitely not his fault.\n\nWhen asked by Reuters about directing his former personal attorney Michael Cohen to set up a shell company in order to funnel hush money to a mistress, Trump first said that it wasn't even a crime.\n\n\"Number one: it wasn't a campaign contribution,\" he said, which is obviously a lie, since the payment was made for the express purpose of helping Trump's campaign.\n\nBut then Trump pivoted, admitting that it was, in fact, related to the campaign. \"If it were, it's only civil. And even if it's only civil, there was no violation based on what we did.\"\n\nTrump does not have any formal legal training. Obviously.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege Cohen, at the direction of Trump, set up a secret shell corporation to pay Trump's mistress $130,000 so she would not speak about her affair with Trump in the final weeks of a closely watched national election. Then Trump and Cohen repeatedly lied about the arrangement and hid the payments from the authorities.\n\nFar from \"only civil,\" prosecutors say the crimes \"sought to influence the election from the shadows.\" Further, the \"brazen violations of election laws,\" breed cynicism \"when individuals like Cohen act as if the political process belongs to the rich and powerful.\"\n\nSo if the crime Trump claims he didn't commit is actually a crime (and the Trump-appointed prosecutors in the Southern District of New York say it's a crime), Trump is pretending he can escape culpability by whining that Cohen didn't stop him from committing said crimes.\n\n\"Michael Cohen IS a lawyer. He's supposed to know what to do. That's what you rely on people for. That's what you pay lawyers for,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Cohen should have known what he was doing. I hope he did,\" Trump added. Even with his poor track record of hiring lawyers, Trump nonetheless went on to add, \"My lawyers say frankly that everything he did was fine.\"\n\nThe crimes Cohen and Trump committed aren't minor paperwork snafus. They are sophisticated attempts to deceive the public, criminal actions intended to impact the outcome of democracy's most foundational tool: free and fair elections.\n\nIn a further attempt to escape any consequences for his actions, Trump pretends it would be ridiculous for the new Democratic House majority to try to impeach him.\n\n\"I'm not concerned, no,\" he tell Reuters when asked about the possibility. Then he adds, \"I think that the people would revolt if that happened.\"\n\nIf Trump were impeached, there might be people marching in the streets. But much to Trump's dismay, the crowd would have a much more celebratory atmosphere.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Scott Walker is defending the GOP power grab.\n\nSore loser Scott Walker is giving every indication that he will sign GOP-led legislation to strip powers from Wisconsin's incoming governor and attorney general, both of whom are Democrats.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Walker defends the legislation as increasing \"transparency\" and \"accountability.\" Yet Walker never once called for diminishing his own power while he was governor; it's only now, when a Democrat is about to take over, that Walker's \"concern\" is suddenly piqued. And he's lamely defending his position by saying the incoming governor will still have \"some of the strongest powers of any governor in the nation.\"\n\nWhile Walker's post claims to \"set the record straight\" on the controversial legislation, Politico notes that Walker did not address the most controversial parts of the legislation. Walker doesn't address how preventing the governor and AG from withdrawing from a lawsuit without the permission of the legislature is related to transparency or accountability.\n\nIn fact, Gov.-elect Tony Evers and AG-elect Josh Kaul ran on a platform of withdrawing Wisconsin from a lawsuit seeking to rip away protections guaranteed in the Affordable Care Act. The best way to be accountable to voters is to listen to and respect their voices, not engage in a lame-duck power grab to thwart their will.\n\nWalker doesn't make any mention of how reducing the time period for early voting is good for Wisconsinites, either, probably because it just isn't. If Walker and the GOP-led legislature truly respected the voices of the people of Wisconsin, they should want to make voting easier, not harder. Yet in a message about \"transparency,\" Walker is too weak and cowardly to even bring the issue up.\n\nEven former Republican Gov. Scott McCallum said the legislation looked like a \"power grab,\" according to Politico. He lamented Walker's cowardice in refusing to veto the measures, saying, \"Every once in a while you have opportunities to start to change things \u2014 in this case, change it for the better with the tone. It's a missed opportunity from that perspective.\"\n\nEven in setting the record straight, Scott Walker refused to be transparent with the people of Wisconsin.

But now he's singing a different tune.\n\nWith his party soon to be out of power, soon-to-be House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) wants Congress to continue to abdicate its constitutional oversight duties.\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News, McCarthy had the audacity to warn Democrats against investigating Trump when they assume the majority in January.\n\n\"It looks like what they're going to focus on is more investigations,\" McCarthy said, adding, \"I think America is too great a nation to have such a small agenda.\"\n\nThis position is quite the flip-flop for McCarthy. Before the 2016 election, McCarthy was ecstatic about the GOP-led sham investigation into the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi.\n\nOf course, McCarthy did not care about any facts coming out of the investigation; he only wanted to waste taxpayer money to score cheap political points against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He even admitted as much, telling Sean Hannity in 2015, \"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.\"\n\nIn 2016, McCarthy was caught on tape accusing Trump of being on Putin's payroll. \"There's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,\" McCarthy said in 2016. (Rohrabacher is less to worry about now, since he lost his midterm election to Democrat Harley Rouda.)\n\nIf McCarthy was serious about his allegation \u2014 on the tape, McCarthy emphasized his conviction by adding \"Swear to God\" \u2014 you'd think he would welcome a full and thorough investigation, not the laughably shoddy work of Trump lackey Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA). Nunes' investigation, as head of the Intelligence Committee, was so lame that even other Republicans were embarrassed.\n\nUnfortunately for McCarthy and Republicans, voters flooded the polls during the 2018 midterms to put Nancy Pelosi and Democrats back in control of the House.\n\nSpeaker-to-be Pelosi has already outlined a voting rights and pro-democracy agenda for HR1, the symbolically important first piece of legislation introduced by the majority party. New House Intel Chair Adam Schiff (R-CA) has set his sights on Trump's \"compromised\" relationship with Russia. And incoming Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler (D-NY) told reporters that Trump \"was at the center of a massive fraud against the American people,\" and vowed to look into such allegations.\n\nMcCarthy better get used to it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Proving that Trump paid women off to influence the election is essential to proving that he committed felonies by violating campaign finance laws.\n\nProsecutors already have similar testimony from Trump's longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, who just received a 3-year prison sentence for this and other crimes that he said Trump directed him to commit.\n\nCohen admitted he helped arrange the payment to the Enquirer, as well as a separate payment to another woman Trump had an affair with.\n\nIt's one thing if paying that hush money was purely for personal reasons, which Trump still claims was the case. But if it was paid off the books to help Trump's campaign by keeping damaging information under wraps, that's a serious and deliberate violation of the law.\n\nIn August, the Wall Street Journal reported that David Pecker \u2014 the CEO of AMI, the company that publishes the National Enquirer \u2014 had been granted immunity and was cooperating with investigators looking into Trump's possible crimes.\n\nAt the time, it was reported that Pecker told investigators about Trump's knowledge of hush money paid to silence the two women, model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe news about AMI's deal adds to a mounting pile of evidence that Trump was personally involved in crimes that helped him win the presidential election in 2016.\n\nIn Cohen's original plea deal with the Trump-appointed Southern District of New York (SDNY) prosecutor, he admitted to breaking the law at Trump's direction. Since that time, legal analysts point out, the office of the SDNY itself has concluded Trump broke the law and committed multiple felonies.\n\nMeanwhile, special counsel Robert Mueller continues to investigate the Trump campaign's highly suspect interactions with Russia, as well as Trump's possible obstruction of justice.\n\nTo add to Trump's woes, a new Democratic majority in the House is gearing up to launch real investigations into these and many other scandals.\n\nTrump's culture of corruption has gone on long enough. Now that Republicans in Congress have lost the power to cover for him, it looks like Trump will be exposed as the two-bit criminal he really is.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Pauley said at the sentencing hearing.\n\nThe judge rejected Cohen's plea for a lighter sentence of no jail time, saying that the nature of Cohen's crimes call for jail time and to send a signal about general deterrence.\n\n\"Mr. Cohen's crimes implicate a far more insidious crime to our democratic institutions especially in view of his subsequent plea to making false statements to Congress,\" Judge Pauley said.\n\nIn addition to tax fraud, Cohen pleaded guilty to working with Trump in a scheme to secretly pay hush money to two of Trump's mistresses. The goal of the payoff was to influence the 2016 election, fearing Trump's multiple affairs, including an affair immediately after his wife gave birth to their child, could impact Trump's chances in the election.\n\nThe payoffs amounted to illegal campaign contributions, which both Cohen and Trump repeatedly lied about.\n\nIn addition, the judge sentenced Cohen to two months in prison for lying to Congress, which he will serve concurrently with his 3-year sentence.\n\nIn addition to jail time, Cohen must forfeit $500,000 in assets, pay $1.4 million in restitution, and pay a fine of $50,000, according to Bloomberg.\n\nEven though Trump himself is implicated in the crimes, many Republican lawmakers spent the last few days downplaying the importance of such criminal activities. The judge in the case obviously took the felonies much more seriously.\n\nIn a now-deleted 2015 Tweet, Cohen mocked Hillary Clinton, saying, \"when you go to prison for defrauding American and perjury, your room and board will be free!\"\n\nCohen reports for his prison sentence on March 6, 2019.\n\nHillary Clinton will spend that day doing whatever she wants, as she is not a criminal.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Even more Americans (69 percent) don't think the wall should be an immediate priority for Congress in the first place.\n\nTrump probably knows deep down that he's not going to get what he wants, and he's not happy about it.\n\nSo before meeting with Democratic leaders on Tuesday to discuss funding (or lack thereof) for the wall, Trump threw a tantrum on Twitter.\n\nTrump whined that Democrats \"want Open Borders for anyone to come in\" and claimed that this will bring \"large scale crime and disease.\"\n\nHe said Democrats would fight against a wall \"at all cost,\" and claimed incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) opposed the massive waste of dollars just because \"Nancy must get votes for Speaker.\"\n\nThen he lied and said that \"much of the Wall\" has \"already been built.\"\n\nTrump concluded his childish rant with a threat: \"If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall.\"\n\nTrump has been pushing the wall for years as a racist and xenophobic response to immigrants seeking refuge in the United States.\n\nHe originally claimed during the campaign that Mexico would pay for it, an absurd idea that was completely rejected by the Mexican government after Trump took over the presidency.\n\nSince then, Trump has repeatedly and loudly argued for billions in U.S. tax dollars to be spent constructing the wall, even though it would be useless as a deterrent to border crossings.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have rejected his ridiculous requests.\n\nPelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) made this point clear in a statement: \"Our country cannot afford a Trump Shutdown, especially at this time of economic uncertainty.

Since the G-20 meeting that ended on December 1, Trump has not made any foreign trips or otherwise been involved in events that would precipitate cancelling a briefing.\n\nUsually the White House doesn't hold briefings on days when Trump will be appearing publicly for a speech, rally, or signing ceremony. But on December 3, the schedule said Trump had his intelligence briefing and had a meeting with the HUD Secretary \u2014 but there was no press briefing.

    "text": "GOP congressman-elect Ross Spano disguised several large campaign contributions from two major donors, and then gave one of those donors influence over who gets hired and fired.\n\nHouse GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday that if Trump could be impeached for his campaign finance violations, a lot of members of Congress would have to leave.\n\nHe may be right.\n\nLawyers for Ross Spano, a newly elected Republican member of Congress from Florida, admitted to the Federal Election Commission last week that Spano \"may have\" violated the Federal Campaign Finance Act.\n\nSpano's violation, though he tries to paint it as an honest oversight, isn't some simple paperwork error. He appears to have spent \"personal loans\" on his campaign, which allowed two rich donors to give his campaign a whole lot more than the personal contribution limit of $2,700 per election cycle.\n\nAnd then Spano then let one of those donors have influence over his staff hiring.\n\nDuring the primary and general election season, Spano received a series of what he called personal loans from two people he said were long-time friends: a total of $70,000 from Karen Hunt and $110,000 from Cary Carreno.\n\nDuring that same time, Spano loaned his campaign around $174,000 \u2014 a number very close to that $180,000 he received from his friends. Spano said the loans were from his personal funds.\n\nIt looks like Spano used this scheme to hide the too-large sums of money he got from two major donors. The scheme worked \u2014 at least long enough for Spano to get elected \u2014 because it is permissible for candidates to lend their own campaigns unlimited amounts of money.\n\nBut Spano likely didn't have that money to loan. He's had banks take him to court over unpaid debts, and he faced foreclosure. In July 2016, he only had around $24,000 in his bank and retirement accounts.\n\nAt least one of Spano's two donors, Carreno, seems to have leveraged those loans into influence over employment decisions in Spano's office.\n\nCarreno fired the campaign's treasurer, perhaps in an attempt to make it look like the campaign was cleaning house after the loan scandal \u2014 except it also may not be legal to let one of your campaign contributors fire your treasurer.\n\nAll of this looks similar to the corrupt way Trump deals with his personal finances, his campaign finances, and his administration.\n\nTrump's past is littered with bankruptcies and tax scams. It's now a matter of court record that he used Michael Cohen to illegally hide campaign donations.\n\nAnd being a big Trump donor can definitely buy you \"unofficial\" influence over hiring and policy \u2014 just look at Trump's Veterans' Administration cronies, who have wielded enormous and unaccountable power.\n\nIt's no wonder that GOP politicians don't want to condemn Trump's behavior. They're just like him. They see nothing wrong with hiding donations and gaming the system \u2014 anything in service of winning.\n\nBut Spano may also face a very Trumpian consequence for his behavior. Both his Republican opponent in the primary and his Democratic opponent in the general have asked the FBI to investigate, and many of his soon-to-be House colleagues have called for a congressional ethics investigation. Local columnists are calling on him to resign before even taking office.\n\nNot an auspicious start for a new congressman.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "New House GOP campaign chair Tom Emmer won't blame Trump for 2018 losses and refuses to acknowledge that suburban areas are abandoning the Republican Party.\n\nRep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) isn't looking to change much about the GOP's disastrous 2018 strategy as he takes over as chair of their 2020 House efforts. But this is the same man who thinks it's a mistake to try to increase the number of women in the Republican House caucus, which will number only 13 in 2019.\n\nIn an interview with the National Journal, Emmer won't to assign any blame to Trump, touted the GOP's economic message (which was a failed, massively unpopular tax scam), and stuck his head in the sand when confronted with Republican losses in suburban areas.\n\nWhen confronted with Trump's massive unpopularity, Emmer \"disputed attempts to fault the president specifically and pushed back on assumptions that Trump would be a liability in 2020,\" wrote the Journal. \"You're definitely impacted, but you don't rise or fall based on the executive,\" Emmer said.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the data doesn't back up Emmer's claim. According to a post-election analysis by Vox, \"The GOP's problem in 2018 wasn't just that Democrats came out motivated and in bigger numbers than in 2014. Their problem was that a small percentage of Republicans who don't like Trump didn't stay home \u2014 instead, they showed up, and they voted for Democrats.\"\n\n\"The GOP may not want to acknowledge it. But if they want to win in 2020, they should,\" Vox added, as if anticipating the disingenuous spin from Republicans like Emmer.\n\nOn the message of the campaign, Emmer reluctantly admitted Trump's racist, anti-immigrant drumbeat in the final two years of the 2018 campaign, and especially in the last few weeks, may have been harmful. But his solution?\n\nEmmer lamented the GOP's \"failing to win over independent voters with a cohesive message on the booming economy,\" writes the Journal. But when Republicans tried to run on an economic message, it failed spectacularly. Their singular achievement \u2014 a $2 trillion, deficit-financed tax scam to give billions to Wall Street corporations \u2014 flopped with voters so badly that Republicans stopped running ads about it.\n\nFinally, Emmer simply won't acknowledge the massive shift among suburban voters away from Republicans and in favor of Democrats.\n\n\"There's a narrative that people are trying to build out there that somehow there's been this shift, this political realignment in the suburbs,\" Emmer told the Journal. \"That's not true. It isn't there,\" he added, refusing to see the evidence so plainly visible to anyone who wants to look.\n\n\"Today Democrats are benefiting from both the changing nature of the suburbs and the changing preferences of white college-educated voters there who are repelled by the president,\" says a New York Time post-election analysis. In fact, the analysis shows that an overwhelming majority of the seats Democrats flipped are in suburban districts.\n\nIn California alone, the Republicans lost seven suburban districts, wiping out half of the state's GOP congressional delegation.\n\nLooking forward to 2020, one pollster told the National Journal that it is unlikely Trump or these voters change much in just two years.\n\nEmmer did outline some tweaks to the 2020 GOP strategy. He wants to run a more decentralized campaign, focus more on fundraising, and seek to spend their money more wisely.\n\n\"On calls to drum up support for the chairmanship, Emmer said he was inundated with complaints about the $5 million spent on TV ads to help Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock in Virginia,\" the Journal notes. \"It was the committee's largest expenditure in any district, and Comstock lost by 12 points.\" Comstock's district is in the Washington, D.C., suburbs.\n\nIn a nutshell, Emmer plans to run again on a failed 2018 strategy, which includes an embrace of Trump, a failed economic platform, and a resistance to the idea that suburban voters don't like either.\n\nSounds like a winning strategy. For Democrats.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And Trump's top pick to replace him, Nick Ayers, publicly turned down the job over the weekend.\n\nOnce again, the White House is in chaos due to Trump's own short-sightedness and instability. And once again, Trump is avoiding responsibility by whining at the media for accurately reporting on that chaos.\n\n\"Fake News has it purposely wrong,\" Trump says. \"Many, over ten, are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff position. Why wouldn't someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington. Please report news correctly. Thank you!\"\n\nBut if \"over ten\" people are really clamoring for this job, nobody is admitting to it publicly.\n\nThe New York Times notes that the \"shortlist of last-ditch possibilities\" for the chief of staff job includes both Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative.\n\nHowever, only one person has actually come forward to express interest: Mark Meadows, a far-right fringe congressman from North Carolina.\n\nTrump's legal troubles \u2014 his own Justice Department recently implicated him in multiple felonies \u2014 should worry anyone thinking about taking this job, Chris Whipple, who wrote a book about White House chiefs of staff, told the Times.\n\n\"Why would anybody want to be Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff unless you want to steal the office supplies before they shut the place down?\" Whipple asked. \"If you're coming into that job, you've got to lawyer up.\"\n\nDespite Trump's desperate attempt to paint a rosy picture, the facts show that this White House has an astronomically high turnover rate.\n\nThe Times reports that finding a new chief of staff \"is in many ways just the latest staffing snare in a White House that has struggled to fill even low-ranking jobs. Staff turnover for senior aides, according to the Brookings Institution, sits at 62 percent.\"\n\nFor comparison, President Obama's turnover rate during the first two years was 24 percent, and even George W. Bush's was only 33 percent.\n\nTrump promised to hire only the best people. But it turns out that if you are an unstable narcissistic habitual liar up to your eyeballs in criminal liability, the best people don't want to work for you.\n\nBut Trump's massive ego can't handle the rejection. Instead, he is begging the media to stop reporting on it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Trump was hoping to poach Pence's own chief of staff, Nick Ayers \u2014 but Ayers turned him down, and Trump had no Plan B.\n\nThanks to Trump's disastrous management style, the chief of staff position has gone from one of the most prestigious jobs in Washington to a laughingstock.\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway tried to spin Kelly's new lame-duck tenure as a way to ensure \"a very peaceful and pragmatic transition.\"\n\nBut most normal presidents do not need to worry about ensuring a peaceful transfer of power from one chief of staff to the next.\n\nAnyone who agrees to work for Trump has to deal with an unusually volatile situation. The next chief of staff will not only have to manage an unhinged Trump, but will also have to answer for Trump's criminality once an incoming Democratic majority finally provides oversight of his presidency.\n\nTrump is clearly embarrassed that nobody wants to be his chief of staff, which led him to brag without evidence on Twitter that \"over ten\" people are actually \"vying for\" the position.\n\nBut Kelly's departure did give Trump a handy excuse to avoid visiting communities of people who strongly oppose his racist agenda.\n\nThe White House canceled a planned visit to a church in a predominantly black neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, claiming that the schedule could no longer work thanks to the disruption from Kelly's departure.\n\nBut Trump is still holding the summit on urban development he planned to spend his time on in Baltimore, and since the church is only about 40 miles from the White House, the excuse about scheduling sounded flimsy to begin with. And now that we know for sure that Kelly is staying on anyway, the excuse sounds more like a lie.\n\nIt seems much more likely that Trump just wants to avoid criticism and protests from a community he has repeatedly denigrated.\n\nAnd if Trump was a competent enough president to be able to recruit a competent chief of staff, he could easily avoid this sort of public controversy.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The recommendation went to a political appointee named Eric Blankenstein, the former private-sector lawyer who once described the bureau as \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in legal papers. Blankenstein ordered the staff to abandon some of their initial complaints and pushed to slash the fine, which was eventually lowered to $5 million. The company agreed to pay the penalty.\n\nAnd it got worse from there.\n\nIn another case, career government lawyers tried to force a settlement with National Credit Adjusters that would have refunded $60 million to consumers. But one of Mulvaney's political lackeys got involved, nixed the whole plan to refund consumers, and brought the total fines against the company down to a mere $800,000.\n\nOne of his final actions as director was one of his most egregious. After State Farm Bank was accused of giving credit agencies the wrong information about consumers and thereby hurting their credit scores, Mulvaney settled the case for zero fines and a promise the bank would not do it again.\n\nThe CFPB was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers against being taken advantage of by financial institutions.\n\nPresident Obama's administration embraced the agency, which the Post notes \"aggressively pursued lenders and other financial firms, returning more than $12 billion to more than 29 million consumers and imposing nearly $600 million in civil penalties.\"\n\nRepublicans, always willing to do the bidding of their corporate donor overlords, tried and failed to weaken or defund the agency using legislation. So Trump did the next best thing by appointing a leader willing to sabotage the agency's work from within.\n\nFormer Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), never one to mince words, is in no way pleased with the actions of Mulvaney and the Trump administration.\n\n\"It's a blatant dishonesty,\" Frank told the Post. \"He's accomplishing administratively what he couldn't do legislatively.\"\n\nMulvaney's shady practices led one of the agency's top student loan officers to resign in protest, accusing Mulvaney of using the bureau \"to serve the wishes of the most powerful financial companies in America\u201d instead of helping American families.\n\nAnd it's very possible that Kraninger, who previously worked in the Trump White House, will try to continue Mulvaney's legacy of kowtowing to big business interests.\n\nBut this time, a new Democratic majority in the House will be able to hold her accountable.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Barr shares many of Trump's delusions about the Russia investigation, like the idea that Hillary Clinton should be investigated instead of Trump, or that Robert Mueller hired too many Democrats for the special counsel team.\n\nBut it gets worse. Barr got on Trump's radar because of his sycophantic comments in the press \u2014 and Trump liked what he heard so much that he tried to hire Barr as private counsel to lead his defense in the Mueller case.\n\nIt's no secret that no one of note wanted to represent Trump in the Russia investigation. Four of the highest-profile law firms out there declined the honor in 2017, and at least a dozen big-name lawyers had said no by April of 2018.\n\nOne of the people that the White House reached out to back in 2017 was none other than William Barr. Barr and Trump had a meeting, and Trump offered him the job, Yahoo News reports.\n\nBarr didn't quite say no, but said he'd need to think about it and that he had other obligations.\n\nThe White House later tried again to get Barr on board after John Dowd, Trump's lead attorney for the Russia matter, left in May of this year because Trump wouldn't listen to any of his advice.\n\nRudy Giuliani ended up getting that job instead. It's not clear if Barr actually said no, or if Giuliani was picked instead because he was so eager to become Trump's new attack dog and perennial defender.\n\nBarr playing hard to get seems to have paid off \u2014 for both him and Trump. Barr gets to be the next attorney general, if the Senate confirms him, and Trump gets to appoint a Justice Department chief who has already made it very clear that he's more interested in protecting Trump than pursuing justice.\n\nIt's exactly what is to be expected of this administration. It's also exactly what everyone should keep in mind when pundits inevitably claim that Barr will be a noble and upstanding public servant.\n\nBarr was asked to take this job because he'll provide the sort of cover Jeff Sessions wouldn't.

With John Kelly departing at the end of the year, Trump is reportedly having a difficult time filling the position because no one wants to work for a criminal buffoon who Cabinet officials describe as a \"moron.\"\n\nEven Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers, would rather leave DC altogether rather than take the gig. Trump had reportedly decided on Ayers, and the White House had even drafted the announcement naming him, according to the New York Times. But Ayers announced Sunday night that he may have political aspirations in his home state of Georgia, so he will not be taking over and will be leaving the White House altogether.\n\n\"A job that was once a ticket to Washington royalty has recently become a laughing stock,\" writes Politico. \"Trump\u2019s first two top aides, Kelly and Reince Priebus before him, have left as diminished and arguably humiliated figures, unable to control the wild chaos of this president\u2019s White House.\"\n\nKelly and Priebus were most definitely humiliated in their departure. Priebus was famously shunned on an airport tarmac after Trump announced Kelly would take over. And Kelly reportedly had a deal with Trump to announce his own departure, but Trump (unsurprisingly) went back on his word and announced it himself.\n\nIncreasingly shunned and isolated, pundits wonder who is willing to debase themselves as Trump's top aide. Politico reporters called around to gauge interest in the chief of staff position. They \"heard the same thing over and over again: No one wants it this time.\"\n\nThe reasons are plentiful. \"Whoever takes over right now would likely be at Trump's side when special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report drops, when Democrats on Capitol Hill start hammering him and as the market continues to slump,\" Politico adds.\n\nMueller's investigation has already led to convictions and guilty pleas among several top Trump campaign aides and confidants. In a recent court filing from a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor, Trump himself is implicated in multiple felonies related to influencing the 2016 election. His longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, and several top campaign aides are cooperating with Mueller on multiple investigations.\n\nAnd with a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, Trump will no longer have complicit Republican lapdogs willing to help cover up his crimes.\n\nOf course no one wants to jump on a sinking ship helmed by this corrupt, unhinged narcissist.\n\nConservative pundit and never-Trumper Rick Wilson often says that everything Trump touches dies. Two years into his administration, anyone remotely qualified to be Trump's chief of staff knows this to be true, leaving Trump with just political dregs to choose from.\n\nWhen he looks around, Trump only has himself to blame.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) told the New York Times. \u201cOne was collusion with the Russians. One was obstruction of justice and all that entails. And now you have a third \u2014 that the president was at the center of a massive fraud against the American people.\u201d\n\nThe allegations of this fraud are serious, and come from federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York (SDNY).\n\nIn a memo outlining sentencing recommendations for Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, prosecutors also alleged that Trump personally orchestrated an illegal scheme to influence the 2016 election.\n\nIn part based on Cohen's testimony, prosecutors say Trump ordered Cohen to pay hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about having an affair with Trump.\n\nThe way the payoffs were orchestrated would constitute a serious violation of campaign finance law. They would count as a felony because they were a deliberate effort to avoid reporting a campaign expense in order to hide information that might have altered the outcome of the election.\n\nA criminal case based on similar actions was brought against former Sen. John Edwards in 2012.\n\nWhen Democrats take over the House of Representatives in the new year, Nadler will lead the Judiciary Committee.\n\nHe has made clear that in his tenure, he will end the \"nonsense\" investigations by House Republicans that have been a \"waste of time.\"\n\nInstead of engaging in oversight of Trump and the possible crimes he has committed \u2014 including collusion, obstruction of justice, and fraud \u2014 Republicans have used taxpayer resources to conduct endless, pointless investigations of Hillary Clinton and her emails.\n\nBut now that Democrats are in charge, Trump's corrupt presidency will soon get the scrutiny it deserves in Congress.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "To Orrin Hatch, it's OK to commit felonies if you're a Republican.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, the retiring Republican from Utah who will be replaced by failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, really doesn't have a problem with fellow Republicans who commit crimes.\n\nAsked to respond to recent court filings that directly implicate Trump in a felony, Hatch first tried to deflect by suggesting Democrats had somehow made the whole thing up.\n\n\"The Democrats will do anything to hurt this president,\" Hatch said.\n\nBut this very serious and very credible allegation against Trump comes from federal prosecutors, not Democrats. Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York laid out the case in a sentencing memo for Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer.\n\nAfter this was pointed out to Hatch, however, he kept shrugging it off.\n\n\"OK, but I don't care,\" was Hatch's answer. \"All I can say is he's doing a good job as president.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Hatch has made clear he doesn't care about the law \u2014 so long as it's a Republican who's breaking it.\n\nDuring the disgraceful confirmation hearing of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Hatch said he didn't care if Kavanaugh had in fact attempted to rape a girl, as he was credibly accused of doing.\n\n\"If that was true,\" Hatch said in September \u2014 \"that\" being the allegation by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh pinned her down, covered her mouth, and tried to rape her when they were both in high school \u2014 \"I think it would be hard for senators to not consider who the judge is today. That\u2019s the issue. Is this judge a really good man? And he is. And by any measure he is.\"\n\nHatch, like the rest of his fellow Republicans in the Senate, went on to vote for Kavanaugh to receive a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land.\n\nThe Republicans voting for Kavanaugh claimed on the one hand that they did not believe the serious charges against him \u2014 but on the other hand, they didn't care if the charges were true anyway. Being an attempted rapist was not disqualifying, according to Hatch and other Republicans, because they wanted Kavanaugh on the court. And nothing, not even attempted rape, would stop them from voting for him.\n\nNow Hatch is making the same case for Trump and the felony in which he is implicated. It's probably not true, Hatch argues \u2014 but even if it is, so what? Why should we care whether the president of the United States directed criminal acts for the explicit purpose of trying to win an election?\n\n\"I don\u2019t think he was involved in crimes,\" Hatch added without giving evidence of Trump's supposed innocence, \"but even then, you know, you can make anything a crime under the current laws; if you want to you can blow it way out of proportion, you can do a lot of things.\"\n\nTo be clear, the court papers filed last Friday implicate Trump in a serious felony; we're not talking about simply running a red light here.\n\nAs Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, put it, the latest documents suggest that Trump \"was at the center of a massive fraud against the American people.\"\n\nThat's far more serious than Hatch is acknowledging. But Hatch, as he said, doesn't care. Hatch thinks Trump is doing a \"good job,\" and that's all that matters to him \u2014 even though most Americans would beg to differ.\n\nIt's no wonder Hatch's own local paper, the Salt Lake Tribune, famously ripped him to shreds in an op-ed last year for his blind fealty to Trump. The editors slammed him for his \"utter lack of integrity that rises from his unquenchable thirst for power\" and for shamelessly \"sucking up\" to Trump.\n\nHatch has certainly done plenty of that. Last year, he even said that Trump's presidency might be the greatest \"we've seen not only in generations but maybe ever\" \u2014 an absurd and demonstrably false claim.\n\nNow, as Hatch's time in the Senate comes to an end, he's apparently trying to use his last days to make sure he is remembered for his embarrassing fawning and excuse-making \u2014 and, as his hometown paper put it, for his utter lack of integrity.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

A presidential campaign made multiple contacts with a hostile foreign power that several U.S. intelligence agencies have now said was working to disrupt the election.\n\nAnd if those contacts were as innocent as McCarthy claimed, it's hard to imagine why Trump and his advisers would repeatedly deny that they ever happened.\n\nThis is simply not normal in U.S. politics. And by pretending it is, McCarthy proves that he is just as detached from reality as Trump \u2014 who still calls special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation a \"witch hunt\" even after it has led to dozens of indictments and numerous guilty pleas.\n\nMcCarthy is just one of many Republicans in Congress who actively defend Trump despite substantial evidence of wrongdoing, and who have failed to provide any meaningful oversight over his administration.\n\nThat failure led to a massive backlash against House Republicans, and a mandate from voters who demanded accountability by putting Democrats in charge.\n\nRepublicans are in the minority now because they aided and abetted Trump. But by continuing to make excuses for Trump on the right's preferred propaganda outlet, McCarthy shows that the GOP still hasn't learned its lesson.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Rick Jones wants people to believe getting rid of paid sick leave is the best way to help the Michigan workforce.\n\nThe Michigan GOP has been using the lame-duck session to undercut the will of the voters comprehensively. They moved to weaken a voting rights initiative and to minimize the power of the incoming Democratic attorney general. They also engaged in a complicated political maneuver that allowed them to seriously damage the state's newly passed paid sick-leave law.\n\nNow, one of the GOP senators behind the effort to strip sick leave from the workers of Michigan has offered an incredible explanation for why they did it:\n\n\"What we had was a ballot initiative and we're responsible for looking at it and we can within 40 days take it up and vote on it,\" said Republican Senator Rick Jones. \"Well we did that. Then that allows us to change it a little bit if we need to and we felt we needed to keep people working.\"\n\nJones went on to say that it was necessary to drastically minimize the reach of the sick leave law to stop employers from making job cuts or increasing automation.\n\nJones has a near-perfect rating from the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, a big business lobby group that fought the sick leave initiative all along, calling it the \"most punitive and aggressive [paid sick leave] proposal to be pursued in any state to date.\"\n\nWhat the Chamber of Commerce, Jones, and his fellow Republicans all willfully ignore is that paid sick leave makes for a healthier and more prosperous populace. Workforces are more stable and productive, the risk of illness being passed from employee to employee or the public is significantly decreased, and overall health care costs are lower. Paid sick leave also allows people to more fully participate in the lives of their families, caring for sick relatives and attending crucial events like school conferences.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, Michiganders overwhelmingly voted for progressive policies, but the GOP has made clear it doesn't care. Now, supporters of the paid sick leave initiative are phone banking to demand outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Snyder veto the legislation. They want Snyder to do the right thing, even if the rest of his party won't.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump goes to great lengths to avoid visiting places where he's unpopular.\n\nShortly after publicly committing to visit a majority-black church in Baltimore, the Trump White House suddenly canceled the event.\n\nAnd the White House's excuse for the cancellation \u2014 chief of staff John Kelly's pending departure \u2014 looks like a very flimsy one.\n\nThe White House first announced on Friday that Trump would visit Baltimore for a Dec. 12 \"roundtable with local leaders and mayors\" to discuss plans for urban revitalization.\n\nTrump was invited to visit by Rev. Donte L. Hickman, pastor of Southern Baptist Church in the Broadway East neighborhood, to discuss how Baltimore could serve as a model for government initiatives to boost urban reinvestment.\n\nIt was to be Trump's first visit as president to Baltimore, where 64 percent of the population is black \u2014 even though the city is only about 50 miles from the White House.\n\nBut the visit was abruptly canceled on Monday, the Baltimore Sun reported.\n\nThe White House claimed that scheduling issues came up after Trump announced Saturday that his chief of staff, John Kelly, will be leaving his post at the end of the year.\n\nHowever, Vanity Fair reports that Trump had already fired Kelly on Friday afternoon. On Saturday, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh was still telling the Baltimore Sun that she had been informed of Trump's visit, but that the White House hadn't given them an agenda yet.\n\nSince Kelly hasn't left yet, it seems unlikely that the White House's schedule would be so badly thrown off as to keep Trump from traveling to a nearby city on a Wednesday.\n\nAfter all, the summit on urban development is still going to take place Wednesday. It will just take place at the White House, not in Baltimore.\n\nHickman had told the Baltimore Sun he hoped a presidential visit would help attract outside investment, and draw national attention to Baltimore's potential to become \"a leader and model to urban centers across the country.\"\n\nNow Hickman says he's disappointed by Trump's decision to bail.\n\nHickman also said White House officials want to reschedule Trump's visit to Baltimore in the new year. But as American troops serving overseas can tell you, Trump promises to make plenty of visits that he somehow never gets around to.\n\nThe Baltimore snub underscores just how little respect Trump has for the parts of America that didn't vote for him, especially minority communities.\n\nTrump has held plenty of rallies in Republican-friendly areas all over the country. But he tends to steer clear of places where he is less popular, and especially places where he might face protests.\n\nIn Maryland, Trump got crushed by Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump received just 10.5 percent of the vote, compared to Clinton's whopping 84.7 percent.\n\nAnd perhaps Trump worried that Baltimore would protest him again \u2014 like it did when Trump attended the Army-Navy game two years ago, before he was sworn in as president.\n\nTrump also has a long history of racism and animosity towards black Americans in general. He continually promoted the debunked \"birther\" conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama, the first black president, was not a U.S. citizen\n\nInstead of visiting one of America's major cities, just a stone's throw from the White House, Trump has once again retreated to his safe space.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Already, the Trump campaign has spent at least $1.1 million of donors' money at companies Trump owns, making him that much richer.\n\nThe expenditures, detailed in the most recent round of campaign finance disclosures, show a continued pattern of Trump using his campaign to enrich himself. In the 2016 electoral cycle, for example, for every $10 donated to the campaign, Trump pocketed $1 for himself.\n\nForbes reports that Trump Tower Commercial LLC, which is wholly owned by Trump, has charged his re-election campaign $665,000 to date. Additionally, there was a joint expenditure by his campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) to spend $225,000 at Trump Tower.\n\nThat spending represents the payment of $6,300 in monthly rent for every person officially listed on the campaign payroll. By comparison, the 2016 campaign paid $2,700 per person to Trump Tower.\n\nThat is an increase of 133 percent. Occupying the presidency is proving to be good for Trump's personal bottom line.\n\nThe campaign also has paid $42,000 to Trump Plaza LLC for a mysterious rental at the Trump Plaza complex. Forbes went to the property and found \"no signs of campaign activity\" at the location despite the expenditure.\n\nThe outlet also staked out two brownstone buildings owned by Trump Plaza LLC for 14 hours and couldn\u2019t find any evidence of a campaign.\n\nA Forbes reporter spoke to a man at the front desk of Trump Plaza, who said there was no campaign office at that location.\n\n\"If there was any kind of office rented out for campaigning or whatever, I would know about it,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the payments for phantom campaign space, the rent being paid is also suspiciously high.\n\nTrump Plaza LLC received an average of $4,200 a month from the Trump campaign, but online listings for the same building show rent closer to the $3,700-3850 per month range.\n\nIt isn't just rent and real estate.\n\nThe Trump Corporation received a payment from the campaign for $90,000 that was described as \"legal consulting.\" The payment came a month after Robert Mueller was named special counsel to investigate the relationship between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump hotels are in on the action as well. The Trump hotel in Washington, D.C., which has benefitted greatly from Trump's corruption in the last two years, received $120,000 from the campaign. Trump's Las Vegas hotel has received another $15,000.\n\nAll of this means Trump and his family stand to make millions of dollars from his re-election efforts.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "As the North Carolina absentee-ballot scandal worsens, the state GOP is melting down, while the national GOP is completely quiet.\n\nIt's becoming more apparent that there was significant absentee ballot fraud in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. As the scandal refuses to fade from public view, the state GOP is in deep disarray and the national GOP is in deep denial.\n\nBy now, we know that the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, who currently holds a very narrow lead, employed a consultant, Leslie McRae Dowless, who had already served a felony prison term for insurance fraud. Dowless, in turn, paid \"repeat witnesses\" like Ginger Eason to pick up absentee ballots.\n\nRather than giving them to the state elections board, Eason gave them to Dowless, and now Dowless isn't saying where those ballots are. It's undisputed, though, that a shocking and disproportionate amount of the ballots from just two counties \u2014 Bladen and Robeson \u2014 were never returned.\n\nAfter days of insisting that Harris be certified as the winner immediately, things finally looked bad enough for the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, Dallas Woodhouse, to support calls for a new election in the district.\n\nWoodhouse may have yielded to calls for a new election because reports surfaced that it was possible Harris engineered this same sort of fraud when he defeated GOP incumbent Robert Pittenger back in the GOP primary. Perhaps it's one thing to defraud a Democrat out of a seat, but another thing entirely to weaponize absentee ballots against a fellow Republican.\n\nIn the middle of all this, former GOP Gov. Pat McCrory, who as recently as two weeks ago was blaming college students for voter fraud, popped up to say that this should all be solved by banning absentee voting for all but members of the military. Such a stance ignores the fact that there are plenty of people that simply can't get to the polls, and that isn't solved just by offering early voting.\n\nAt the legislature, the GOP is addressing this by sending a voter ID law to the governor to sign. The law is very similar to the same law that was struck down as unconstitutional back in 2016 and focuses on the near-nonexistent problem of voter impersonation at the polls. Worse, it wouldn't do much at all to stop the sort of absentee ballot fraud that the state is currently grappling with.\n\nMeanwhile, at the national level, it's evident that the GOP wants this to just disappear. Trump, previously very concerned about voter fraud, hasn't said anything, and is instead complaining about his approval rating. Paul Ryan is quiet, the National Republican Congressional Committee is quiet, and the Republican National Committee doesn't have anything to say either.\n\nThe North Carolina GOP finally got an election fraud scandal \u2014 something they've seemed to long for. They just didn't expect it would trip up one of their own, and now they don't know what to do.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Since fewer people are buying products, fewer laborers are employed, and there are other ripple effects too. When accounting for the broader economic impacts, the Nebraska Farm Bureau estimates the pain Trump is inflicting to the entire state of Nebraska increases to between $859 million and $1.2 billion.\n\nCorn, soybeans and pork are the commodities that have taken the brunt of the damage, according to Rempe.\n\nFarmers in the upper midwest are seeing spikes in bankruptcies, thanks in large part to Trump's trade war.\n\nFamilies and communities are suffering, but the response from the Trump administration has been callous at best, bordering on outright cruel.\n\nTrump suggested that farmers just suck it up and take one for the country. \"I'll tell you, our farmers are great patriots,\" Trump said in April. \"These are great patriots. They understand that they're doing this for the country,\" he added.\n\nAs the trade war lingered into summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue compared the income loss to dieting. \"It's a little bit like weight loss,\" Perdue said in July. However, $1 billion in losses does not sound like a \"little bit.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the midterm elections, Trump sought to buy off farmers with by pledging a $12 billion bailout plan. (The Nebraska Farm Bureau's report did not incorporate this bailout in their analysis.)\n\nFarmers saw straight through it.\n\n\"This is an election ploy,\" Michael Slattery, a soybean, corn, wheat and alfalfa farmer in Wisconsin, lamented. \"And we as farmers are playing the dupes again in this whole process.\"\n\nSlattery was right, as the bailout has been hampered by red tape and slow to dole out the relief to farmers. Just another of Trump's failures.\n\nTrump once claimed trade wars are easy to win. Not only is this clearly not true, but the collateral damage left in Trump's wake are families and neighbors in Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, and across the country.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's threat to declassify sensitive intelligence puts the U.S. national security at risk \u2014 but apparently that's a price he's willing to pay to protect himself.\n\nTrump threatened Wednesday to jeopardize national security to protect himself, saying that if Democrats \"want to play tough\" by investigating him, he will strike back by declassifying documents he claims will be \"devastating\" to them.\n\n\"If they want to play tough, I will do it,\" Trump told the New York Post. \"They will see how devastating those pages are.\"\n\nAfter winning a majority in the House of Representatives during the midterm elections, Democrats have made it clear they're planning to fulfill their constitutional oversight duty by launching a series of investigations into Trump and his scandal-plagued administration.\n\nTrump quite obviously fears what these investigations may uncover \u2014 so he's threatening to declassify sensitive intelligence and wield it as a weapon against the new Democratic majority in a last-ditch effort to protect himself.\n\nSpeaking to the Post on Wednesday, Trump said he is waiting to declassify certain documents related to the Russia investigation so he can use them as leverage against Democrats at a time of his choosing.\n\n\"It's much more powerful if I do it then, because if we had done it already, it would already be yesterday's news,\" Trump said, referring to applications for surveillance warrants and other sensitive documents related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"I'm a counter-puncher and I will hit them so hard they'd never been hit like that,\" Trump told the Post.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump threatened to declassify documents and communications related to the Russia investigation and certain government officials he has targeted over the past many months. However, he appeared to back away from this threat temporarily, saying the Justice Department had asked for more time to review the national security concerns involved with declassifying such information.\n\nBut based on what he told the Post, it appears that he was also advised by White House lawyer Emmet Flood to hold off on declassifying the documents so they could be weaponized and used for political purposes.\n\n\"He didn't want me to do it yet, because I can save it,\" Trump said.\n\nHis comments to the Post come just weeks after he threatened to take a \"warlike posture\" if Democrats try to investigate him or his administration.\n\nWith control of the House committees, Democrats are expected to investigate a range of issues that Republicans have ignored for two years.\n\nThis includes issues related to Russian election interference and potential coordination with the Trump campaign, as well as Trump's shady finances and conflicts of interest, the corrupt Cabinet he assembled, and his self-dealing family members.\n\nDemocrats have also indicated that they will open up a probe to look at whether Trump's ongoing efforts to undermine the Russia investigation constitute obstruction of justice, and whether his financial ties to Saudi Arabia are guiding his administration's decision-making in the aftermath of the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the behest of the Saudi crown prince.\n\nTrump has so many scandals to investigate that that officials in his administration are reportedly worried that the White House doesn't have enough lawyers to deal with it all.\n\nAnd now, he's threatening to create an entirely new scandal \u2014 one that threatens national security by compromising highly sensitive sources and methods \u2014 in a desperate attempt to hide from the inevitable fallout of his scandal-ridden presidency.\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time Trump has weaponized our nation's most sensitive secrets to save his own skin. With the help of his complicit Republican allies, Trump has overseen the selective declassification of a slew of intelligence and, as a result, endangered the lives of crucial informants and forced sources in Russia to go dark due to fears of being outed.\n\nIf Trump chooses to declassify intelligence from the Russia investigation for political purposes, the move could have severe repercussions for national security that may last years or even decades \u2014 but apparently that's a price he's willing to pay to protect himself.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "With hate crimes surging nationwide, not a single Republican will sign on as a co-sponsor to a bill to address the problem.\n\nHate crimes are on the rise in Trump's America, a trend that has been attributed in large part to Trump's incendiary rhetoric, tacit endorsement of violence, and embrace of far-right extremism.\n\nAccording to new FBI statistics released this week, documented hate crimes rose by 17 percent in 2017, with particularly notable increases in anti-Hispanic and anti-Semitic crimes. During the same time period, white supremacist murders doubled, making 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence.\n\nClearly, there's a need to do something to address the surge in hate crimes.\n\nThe good news is that there is already a bill in Congress that not only seeks to stop these alarming trends, but also to establish a clearer picture of who is being targeted, what types of crimes are being committed, what services are needed to help victims, and how reporting practices can be improved.\n\nThe bad news is that the bill is sitting in Congress and not going anywhere because not a single Republican has signed on as a co-sponsor.\n\nThe \"National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality Act,\" also known as the \"NO HATE Act,\" was first introduced in March 2017 by Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA), with a parallel bill introduced in the Senate by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).\n\nIn light of the new FBI statistics released this week, on top of the recent anti-Semitic attack that killed 11 Jews at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Beyer is issuing a renewed call to pass the legislation and improve current data collection practices to gain a better understanding of hate crimes in America.\n\n\"For the third year in a row, hate crimes across the country have risen, this year by 17 percent,\" Beyer said in a statement Wednesday. \"[It] is time for Congress to take action. With each passing year, the problem of hate in the United States grows, and it requires Congress to take up and pass the NO HATE Act.\"\n\nAs Beyer noted, the documented rise in hate crimes almost certainly underestimates the true numbers, given that underreporting is a persistent and widespread problem.\n\nAn estimated 1 in 6 law enforcement agencies nationwide failed to file a single hate crimes report between 2009 and 2015, and in some states, a majority of agencies failed to file a single report. Meanwhile, at least one state \u2014 Hawaii \u2014 doesn't even participate in the national hate crime reporting program.\n\nAs a result, many hate crimes are simply not reflected in national statistics, even if they make national headlines.\n\nFor example, the Charlottesville, Virginia, Police Department reported no hate crimes between July and September of last year, meaning that the murder of Heather Heyer by a white supremacist is missing from federal hate crimes statistics. So, too, are the 35 people who were injured when the accused killer, James Alex Fields Jr., plowed his car into a crowd of protesters.\n\nCurrently, federal guidance states that it is the responsibility of law enforcement officers responding to an incident to determine whether there are any indications of a hate crime, which introduces a significant degree of subjectivity into the reporting process.\n\nThe \"NO HATE Act\" seeks to improve reporting practices by establishing a standardized protocol outlining the types of information that law enforcement agencies should collect when investigating possible hate crimes, and providing training to ensure that police know how to recognize hate crimes and pursue them appropriately.\n\nThe bill would also provide grants to states to establish and run hotlines to record information about hate crimes, and to refer victims to the services they need. New York and Maryland have already set up hate crimes hotlines, but the new legislation would allot funding to do the same in all 50 states.\n\nAnother section of the legislation is designed to help victims of hate crimes get justice in court, even if they live in a state without hate crimes laws. Currently, 20 states still do not consider attacks on LGBTQ people to be hate crimes, and five states \u2014 Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina, and Wyoming \u2014 do not have any hate crime statutes on the books at all.\n\nAs it stands, the \"NO HATE Act\" has earned the support of groups like the NAACP, along with nearly 100 co-sponsors in both the House and the Senate.\n\nWith hate crimes on the rise, this type of legislation should pass with overwhelming bipartisan approval. But as they've done so many times before, Republicans are responding to the need with complicit silence.\n\nWhile Trump may be the face of hate, his Republican allies have enabled it every step of the way \u2014 and innocent Americans have paid the price for it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "William Barr, Trump's choice for attorney general, has already called for Clinton to be investigated and downplayed any concerns about Trump. That's probably why he was chosen.\n\nEarlier this morning, President Trump nominated William Barr to be his next attorney general. Barr previously served in that same role under George H.W. Bush.\n\nBut don't be fooled into thinking that Barr's past experience means he'll be an adult in the room and provide a check on Trump. Barr has already made outrageous public statements that show he is entirely in line with Trump's way of thinking.\n\nAlthough Barr might not have as tawdry or shady a past as acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, he's just as committed to baselessly accusing Hillary Clinton of crimes while blithely dismissing any of Trump's wrongdoings.\n\nLast year, the New York Times asked ten former attorneys general if they'd be willing to comment on whether the Justice Department should open an investigation into the Uranium One deal that occurred when Clinton was secretary of state.\n\nAll of them declined to respond, save for Barr, who said he saw more basis for investigating that deal than in looking into the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia.\n\nThis isn't the only time Barr has backed Trump's outrageous position that the DOJ should be going after his political rivals. After Trump publicly demanded that the Justice Department open a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton, Barr came forward to claim that \"there are things that should be investigated that haven't been investigated.\"\n\nBack in May 2017, Barr penned an op-ed backing Trump's decision to fire former FBI director James Comey. He even endorsed the ludicrous fiction that Trump fired Comey because of Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation rather than the real reason, which is that Comey had refused to look the other way regarding Michael Flynn.\n\nBarr also thinks that Mueller is obliged to police the political donations of the prosecutors he employs and thinks there should be more \"balance\" in the group. While that isn't quite as bad as Trump calling the prosecutorial team \"13 hardened Democrats,\" it still isn't a good look.\n\nIn a lot of ways, it looks like Barr has been auditioning for this job for quite some time. He's consistently made high-profile statements signaling his approval for Trump's actions.\n\nGiven Trump's very public loathing of Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, it's easy to believe that Trump picked Barr precisely because he thought Barr would meddle in \u2014 or shut down \u2014 Mueller's investigation.\n\nAnd given his public proclamations, there's no reason to think that Barr won't do just that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Faced with new evidence that Don Jr. may have perjured himself, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is providing cover instead of oversight.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is once again rejecting calls to bring Donald Trump Jr. back in to testify before the committee, even in the face of new evidence indicating that the president's son may have lied to Congress during sworn testimony.\n\nGrassley said Monday that he did not see a need to re-interview Don Jr. because \"there is nothing inconsistent\" about his prior statement to the committee in which he claimed that he was only \"peripherally\" aware of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations.\n\nThis comes just days after Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Moscow real estate deal, which Donald Trump was allegedly pursuing during the presidential campaign through at least June 2016, despite previous claims that the negotiations ended in January of that year.\n\nIn his plea deal, Cohen said he had kept Trump's family members briefed on the talks through summer of 2016. Although the names of the family members were not specified, multiple reports indicate that Don Jr. and Ivanka were heavily involved in the Moscow deal and would have known that negotiations to build the property were still going on at the height of the 2016 campaign.\n\nIn light of the new information regarding the Trump Tower Moscow deal, Democratic lawmakers want to bring Don Jr. back to address the potentially false statements he made in previous testimony.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) released a statement calling into question the truthfulness of Don Jr.'s testimony, with an emphasis on three areas of particular concern: the Trump Tower Moscow deal; offers of foreign assistance to the Trump campaign; and the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting when Don Jr. met with a Russian government lawyer promising \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Lying to Congress is a federal crime & the Judiciary Committee must determine if facts were deliberately omitted or misstated to mislead & prevent us from getting to the truth. Chairman Grassley, we must have Donald Trump Jr. & other key witnesses re-appear before the Committee,\" Blumenthal (D-CT) said in a tweet.\n\nLying to Congress is a federal crime & the Judiciary Committee must determine if facts were deliberately omitted or misstated to mislead & prevent us from getting to the truth. Chairman Grassley, we must have Donald Trump Jr. & other key witnesses re-appear before the Committee. pic.twitter.com/tfQEshrqTJ \u2014 Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) December 3, 2018\n\nAccording to CNN, Don Jr. has testified under oath about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow deal to at least three congressional committees.\n\nIn September 2017, shortly after the details of the Moscow deal were made public for the first time, the House Judiciary Committee asked Don Jr. about his role in the project. At the time, he said he was \"peripherally aware of it\" but that most of his knowledge of the real estate venture \"has been gained ... over the last few weeks.\"\n\nHe also testified about the Moscow deal before the Senate and House Intelligence committees.\n\nDespite his claims of being only peripherally aware of the negotiations, recent reports indicate that both Don Jr. and Ivanka not only knew about Cohen\u2019s efforts to broker a deal to build Trump Tower Moscow in 2016, but \"were also working to make Trump Tower Moscow a reality.\"\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly looking into their involvement in the Moscow talks, but Grassley apparently doesn't think Don Jr.'s potential perjury is worth the time to investigate further.\n\nTaking a cue from Trump, Grassley claimed this week that allegations that Don Jr. lied to Congress are based on \"fake news.\"\n\nAt the same time, however, Grassley and other GOP leaders are pushing for criminal investigations of witnesses who they believe gave misleading statements during the Kavanaugh hearings, and during testimony surrounding the so-called \"dossier.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Don Jr. has been accused of lying to Congress during the course of the Russia investigation \u2014 nor is it the first time Trump's GOP allies have helped provide cover for witnesses who may have perjured themselves in congressional testimony.\n\nAll of this, of course, begs the question: If Republicans don't think Don Jr. did anything wrong, why are they going to such great lengths to keep it covered up?\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "It's a courageous act that puts a well-deserved spotlight on Trump's racism and hypocrisy toward immigrants.\n\nTwo immigrant women have gone on the record with The New York Times to admit they were undocumented when they worked at one of Trump's golf clubs \u2014 and to speak out against Trump's dehumanizing treatment of immigrants during his presidency.\n\nThe Times conducted extensive interviews in Spanish with Victorina Morales, who crossed the southwest border illegally in 1999 from Guatemala, and Sandra Diaz, a native of Costa Rica who is now a legal U.S. resident but says she was undocumented when she worked at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, from 2010 to 2013.\n\nTheir story is remarkable. Trump, of course, routinely demonizes immigrants \u2014 especially undocumented immigrants, and especially people from Latin America. And as the Times pointed out, he has also bragged about verifying his workers' documents electronically to make sure he \"didn't have one illegal immigrant on the job.\"\n\nBut Morales and Diaz say that while they can't say for sure how many other workers at the club have been undocumented, they are far from the only ones.\n\nAnd while there's no hard evidence that either Trump himself or Trump Organization executives knew that the Bedminster club hired undocumented workers, Morales and Diaz say it's a common and accepted enough practice that multiple supervisors knew about their status. One manager, Morales said, even loaned her money to get new fake documents when there was a problem with her old ones.\n\nAnd Morales \u2014 who was given a personalized certificate from the White House Communications Agency for the \"outstanding\" support she gave Trump during his many stays at the club \u2014 said she had trouble believing Trump was totally ignorant of her status.\n\n\u201cI ask myself, is it possible that this se\u00f1or thinks we have papers? He knows we don\u2019t speak English,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he figure it out?\u201d\n\nDiaz trained Morales, cleaned Trump's two-story residence with her for a time, and quit shortly thereafter. But Morales still works at the club, and still doesn't have papers.\n\nMorales told the Times that she knows she will probably lose her job and risks being deported by coming forward.\n\nBut she felt she couldn't stay silent anymore in the face of Trump's hypocritical and hurtful public comments about people like her.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of the abuse, the insults, the way he talks about us when he knows that we are here helping him make money,\u201d Morales told the Times. \u201cWe sweat it out to attend to his every need and have to put up with his humiliation.\"\n\nOne of those humiliations, Diaz said, included getting yelled at by Trump when she couldn't get a stubborn orange makeup stain out of his white golf shirt.\n\nShortly after Trump kicked off his virulently racist and anti-immigrant presidential campaign in 2015, Morales was told she couldn't work inside Trump's residence anymore. Other undocumented workers she knew had their hours cut and eventually quit.\n\nThe Times reports that despite all of this, the two women found Trump to be \"demanding but kind\" in their personal interactions with him, and sometimes a very generous tipper. Morales even thought of him as \"a good man.\"\n\nBut as time went on, the Times notes, Morales and other workers grew \"increasingly disturbed\" about Trump's demeaning anti-immigrant remarks, which \"seemed to embolden others to make negative comments.\"\n\nThat included a supervisor at the golf club, who Morales says called workers \"stupid illegal immigrants\" with less intelligence than a dog.\n\nAnd so Morales and Diaz, through a lawyer they are both working with on immigration issues, finally decided to go public.\n\nIt's a courageous act that puts a well-deserved spotlight on Trump's racist, brutal, and wildly hypocritical treatment of hard-working immigrants who are trying to make a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Jamie Raskin (D-MD) told the New York Times, \"They have turned the government of the United States into a moneymaking operation for the president and his family and close friends.

The entire crisis reveals just how much Republicans gave Trump a pass, and how things are going to change when the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

They were scheduled after several of Trump's Cabinet secretaries got caught wasting taxpayer dollars on items including private jet trips, helicopter rides, luxury furniture, and doors that cost more than many homes.\n\nAccording to CNN, the purpose of the meetings was to scold the officials \"for embarrassing stories about questionable ethical behavior at their respective agencies\" and to send \"a clear message that optics matter.\"\n\n\"Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt all met with officials from the White House counsel's office and the Cabinet liaison,\" CNN reported.\n\nAt the meeting, the four Cabinet secretaries were given a set of guidelines that included advice such as, \"always consider optics.\" The guidelines also advised the agency leaders on how to protect their reputations.\n\nNotably, the guidelines did not include recommendations to stop abusing taxpayer money \u2014 rather, the document focused on how to avoid the bad optics associated with such behavior.\n\nShortly after the White House met with Zinke, CNN published a report describing several instances in which he appears to have misused taxpayer dollars.\n\nIn one instance, Zinke spent more than $139,000 on three sets of doors for his office. In another instance, he spent nearly $40,000 to go on a helicopter ride \u2014 using money that had been earmarked to help people prepare for wildfires.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel is also looking into a speech Zinke gave to a professional hockey team owned by a major donor to his congressional campaigns, and his habit of flying on private chartered flights is the subject of a lawsuit as well as an investigation by the Office of the Inspector General.\n\nPruitt is also under investigation for misusing tax dollars on first-class flights and luxury hotels, while Shulkin is accused of misusing funds during a trip to Europe and then doctoring emails to cover it up.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to step down for similar abuses.\n\nAnd last month, Carson became the sixth member of Trump's Cabinet to face an ethics investigation after he was caught spending more than $31,000 on a dining room set for his office at HUD \u2014 just as the agency called for cuts to programs for the needy.\n\nIn total, there at least nine ongoing audits, reviews, or investigations of Trump's Cabinet secretaries and the agencies they oversee, according to CNN.\n\nBut in the Trump White House, abusing taxpayer dollars is not seen as a problem \u2014 getting caught is the real scandal."

They've moved to weaken the powers of the incoming Democratic attorney general, preventing her from monitoring the flow of dark money in the state. They're pushing bills with language that frustrates the intent of the voters, who overwhelmingly backed a proposal that expanded voting rights.\n\nUnsurprisingly, local papers are calling out this undemocratic behavior.\n\nAn op-ed from the full editorial board of the Lansing State Journal called the GOP's actions \"a ridiculous power play\" and told the Michigan Legislature that it shouldn't use the lame-duck session to override the will of the voters.\n\nThe bills pushed by the GOP, the paper said, are \"offensive\" and \"controversial\" and are being rammed through in a fashion that ignores the need for transparency.\n\nUltimately, the State Journal concludes, Michigan Republicans are acting with a \"false urgency and secrecy that sends a clear message to every voter: What we, the Legislature, want is more important than what you want.\"\n\nThat paper isn't alone. The Record-Eagle, based in Traverse City, wrote an op-ed slamming the lame-duck session as a loser for voters.\n\n\"Hundreds of issues are being rammed through \u2014 on short notice, without proper hearing or public percolation,\" the Record-Eagle notes.\n\nOver at the Detroit Free Press, an op-ed calls this lame-duck session \"Washed-up legislators gone wild.\"\n\nThey're not wrong. As the Free Press points out, the structure of the lame-duck session decreases accountability. Too many legislators have nothing to lose because they're not returning next year.\n\n\"Just one week into their lame-duck adventure, this year's outgoing legislative class has already demonstrated its contempt for Michigan voters and the politicians they've elected to represent them in Lansing starting Jan. 1.\"\n\nFinally, the statewide editorial board of MLive says that the lame-duck session has already been a time for the GOP to \"undermine, subvert, and attack the will of Michigan voters.\"\n\nThose spoke loud and clear when they elected Democrats for governor, attorney general, and secretary of state, MLive says. But now the Michigan GOP, \"instead of respecting those decisions, is trying to render them moot by limiting the power of executive-branch officials.\"\n\nAll of this is a blatant power grab that represents a depressingly cynical worldview: The people shouldn't decide what they want because only Republican legislators get that privilege. That's why it is almost impossible to find anyone to defend this behavior.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republican lawmakers in Michigan are trying to torpedo a voting-rights ballot proposal overwhelmingly approved by voters.\n\nThe Michigan GOP is taking every opportunity to use the lame-duck session to undo the will of the voters.\n\nThey've already severely weakened both the paid sick leave and minimum wage laws. Now, they're working on sabotaging expanded voting rights in the state.\n\nLast month, Michigan voters overwhelmingly supported a ballot proposal, known in the state as the Promote the Vote initiative, which made several changes to voting in the state: It allowed for election-day registration, for voters to request absentee ballots without a reason, and for automatic registration when getting a driver's license.\n\nNow, the GOP is pushing two separate bills through the state Senate, which, taken together, thwart the intent of the ballot measure entirely. For example, same-day registration would remain, but voters registering in the 14 days prior to the election would have an additional proof-of-residency requirement.\n\nAdditionally, automatic motor voter registration would be hobbled by a provision that state identification applications contain a designation of United States citizenship.\n\nAnd, though Michigan voters clearly signaled they want to make it easier for people to register, the GOP decided it's critical to make it easier for Michigan citizens to know they can opt out of being registered \u2014 Republicans are pushing a provision that allows people to opt out of automatic voter registration, too.\n\nRepublicans say the changes voters approved are duplicative and would increase bureaucracy and regulations. \"I'm not trying to keep people from voting,\" state Sen. Mike Kowall, who sponsored both bills, said. \"I'm just trying to prevent chaos for the local clerks.\"\n\nBut there's no way that either of these provisions can be said to decrease bureaucratic burdens. Rather, they increase the burden on both the state and the voter by creating more work for them.\n\nOf course, it is far more likely Republicans oppose Promote the Vote because it dramatically increased voting access. In fact, the Michigan GOP introduced three unsuccessful voter ID bills earlier this year.\n\nMichigan voters swept progressive Democrats into statewide office and supported a ballot initiative that represented progressive views about expanding ballot access. That's a resounding rejection of what the Michigan GOP stands for \u2014 and they know it \u2014 which is why they have to resort to pushing these measures through in a lame-duck session where they can't be stopped.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "White House chief of staff John Kelly has given up on Trump and is just spending his time at the gym now.\n\nWhen former Marine general John Kelly became Trump chief of staff nearly a year ago, he was heralded as the \"adult\" who would finally rein in the impetuous, tantrum-throwing, rage-tweeter in chief.\n\nAnd now, Politico reports, Kelly is done even trying. Sources say he \"has largely yielded his role\" as the man who's supposed to keep Trump in line, having realized just how pointless that effort is, and is now spending a lot of time at the gym \u2014 in the middle of the day.\n\n\"He has told at least one person close to him that he may as well let the president do what he wants, even if it leads to impeachment \u2014 at least this chapter of American history would come to a close,\" according to Politico.\n\nStories have swirled for months about the collapsing relationship between Trump and his minder, with Trump publicly undermining and humiliating his chief of staff, despite their many similarities.\n\nKelly, for example, has also been a big proponent of horrific and racist policies, including ripping children away from their parents. In 2017, when Kelly was still the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, he was pushing for the policy of separating families. He has since praised the so-called \"deterrent\" value of the practice and shrugged off concerns about those children.\n\n\"The children will be taken care of \u2014 put into foster care or whatever,\" he said last month.\n\nKelly, like Trump, also has no problem making up vicious lies about his critics. Last fall, Kelly completely fabricated a story to try to smear Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL), who was seeking answers about the death of one of her constituents, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, one of four Special Forces troops killed in an ISIS-led raid in Niger on Oct. 4.\n\nEven after video emerged that proved Kelly was lying, he refused to back down or apologize.\n\nKelly, like Trump, has even praised traitors as heroes, calling Confederate commander Robert E. Lee was \"an honorable man\" who \"gave up his country to fight for his state.\"\n\nBut even though Trump and his chief of staff share so many of the same abhorrent views and goals for the United States, Kelly cannot keep Trump from shooting himself in the foot. He has repeatedly called Trump \"an idiot\" \u2014 not unlike many others in Trump's inner circle of advisers and Cabinet secretaries.\n\nAs he has watched Trump say and do things that make him look incredibly guilty, it seems even Kelly believes Trump might be headed toward impeachment. And he's no longer willing to make much effort to protect Trump from himself.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Talking about it publicly, Trump fretted, could make Putin angry.\n\n\"He doesn't want us to bring it up,\" a White House official told NBC News. \"It is not something he wants to talk about.\"\n\nApparently, this isn't an anomaly.\n\nAs Trump signs off on policies taking a tougher stance toward Russia, he has told his aides not to talk about the moves in public because he doesn't want to upset Putin or harm their relationship.\n\nWhite House officials told NBC News that the perplexing divide between Trump's policy decisions and public position on Russia \"stems from his continued hope for warmer relations with Putin.\"\n\nWhen the White House announced this week that the U.S. was expelling 60 Russian diplomats in response to the Kremlin's involvement in a nerve agent attack on a former spy living in the U.K., Trump \u2014 keeping with his practice of never personally calling out or condemning Putin \u2014 was nowhere to be seen, and still has not issued a public statement about it.\n\nApparently worried that Putin might be upset by the move, Trump also reportedly insisted that the White House's announcement include the message that he \"still wants to work with Russia.\" Then, during a private phone call with the Russian president, Trump ignored his national security advisers and their all-caps message to him \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE,\" and refused to condemn the poisoning.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump signed a bill imposing sanctions on Russia for its interference in the U.S. election and its aggression in Ukraine \u2014 but promptly followed up by complaining that it would harm relations with Russia.\n\nTrump's refusal to take a tough public posture toward Putin is only fueling further speculation that the Russian president may know something about Trump's past that could hurt him if it got it.\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan made that exact point last week, suggesting that Trump is withholding criticism of Putin because Russia may have compromising information on Trump.\n\n\"The fact that he has had this fawning attitude toward Mr. Putin, has not said anything negative about him, I think continues to say to me that he does have something to fear and something very serious to fear,\" Brennan said on MSNBC's Morning Joe.\n\n\"The Russians could have something on him,\" he added.\n\nTrump has repeatedly spoken out about his desire for a warmer relationship with Putin and regularly heaps praise on the authoritarian leader. He even bragged recently about their \"chemistry.\"\n\nThis stands in stark contrast with his criticism of the leaders of ally nations like Britain's Theresa May, Germany's Angela Merkel, and Australia's Malcolm Turbull.\n\nAnd now, even as Trump shows signs of toughening his stance toward Russia, he still can't bring himself to do the same towards Putin."

    "text": "A bombshell new report suggests that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was directly involved in the cover-up of Jamal Khashoggi's murder.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo hand-delivered a plan to the Saudi royal family to help the crown prince get away with ordering the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to a bombshell new report.\n\nCiting a senior Saudi source, Middle East Eye reported Monday evening that Pompeo devised a plot to help shield Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (\"MBS\") from the fallout following the highly publicized murder of Khashoggi, who was brutally killed in the Saudi consulate in Turkey on October 2.\n\nPompeo reportedly discussed the plan with Saudi Arabia's king during a visit to the country's capital city, Riyadh, two weeks after Khashoggi's murder.\n\nWhile the specific claims made by the source in the report have yet to be independently confirmed by other news outlets, the details align with previous extensive reporting on the Khashoggi scandal and the ensuing \"damage control\" efforts carried out by the Saudi regime.\n\nAccording to Middle East Eye, the plan to shield the crown prince encompasses several steps, including an option to blame Khashoggi's murder \"on an innocent member of the ruling al-Saud family in order to insulate those at the very top.\"\n\nThus far, that person has not been chosen, but Saudi officials are reportedly still considering the option as pressure continues to mount on the crown prince, who has been directly implicated in Khashoggi's assassination.\n\nOn Friday, the Washington Post reported that the CIA had concluded in a high-confidence assessment that the crown prince personally ordered the murder of the journalist.\n\nEven before the CIA's conclusion was made public, evidence released by Turkish officials strongly suggested that the Saudi crown prince had a hand in Khashoggi's brutal murder.\n\nThis evidence was starting to emerge right around the time of Pompeo's visit to Saudi Arabia, during which he met with the crown prince. After the visit, Pompeo urged patience and said the administration had pledged to give the Saudi regime more time to produce an explanation regarding Khashoggi's killing.\n\nWhen pressed by reporters, Pompeo said he didn't want to talk about the \"facts\" of the case, and that the Saudis didn't want to, either.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to deflect criticism away from the Saudi royal family, Pompeo also emphasized the need to preserve the U.S.-Saudi Arabia relationship, saying, \"We have a long strategic relationship with Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They're an important partner. We need to be mindful of that as well.\"\n\nAccording to Middle East Eye, the Trump administration was so invested in maintaining that \"strategic relationship\" that it sent Pompeo to Saudi Arabia \"to advise the Saudis on how to handle the fallout in the Khashoggi case.\"\n\nBesides blaming the murder on a family member, the plan to shield the crown prince reportedly also included steps to buy time, such as offering to help investigate the crime and identifying other people who played a role in the killing.\n\nThe Saudis have taken all of these steps. Since Pompeo's visit, they've offered to coordinate a joint Saudi-Turkish investigation, sent a team of investigators to the consulate in Istanbul, and arrested at least 21 suspects.\n\nThose aren't the only indications that Pompeo may have discussed a strategy for damage control during his meetings with Saudi officials.\n\nNotably, prior to Pompeo's visit, Saudi Arabia had maintained a false narrative claiming that Khashoggi left the consulate alive and well. But after meeting with Pompeo, Saudi officials changed their story and admitted that Khashoggi was dead, then proceeded to offer several different accounts of his death.\n\n\"They [the Saudi leadership] have done everything [Pompeo] wanted to execute,\" the senior Saudi source told Middle East Eye.\n\nIf Pompeo did indeed help devise a plan to help the Saudi crown prince get away with the murder of Khashoggi, it would not be the first effort by Trump associates to obscure the truth surrounding the brutal killing.\n\nJust as Pompeo was returning from his Saudi Arabia trip, Republicans and right-wing pundits kicked off a smear campaign aimed at protecting Trump and supporting his refusal to confront his allies in the Saudi regime about the slain journalist.\n\nAt the time, evidence implicating the crown prince was mounting, but Trump continued to parrot Saudi Arabia's denials and even provided a theory of his own, suggesting that \"rogue killers\" could be responsible for the murder.\n\nTrump also repeatedly emphasized the crown prince's \"strong\" denial, even appearing to take his word over the high-confidence assessment of the CIA in a Fox News interview on Sunday.\n\nThe response of the Trump White House in the aftermath of Khashoggi's murder has brought increased attention to Trump's business ties to Saudi Arabia, the close relationship between Jared Kushner and the crown prince, and other potential conflicts of interest that could explain the administration's motivation to provide cover to the Saudi regime.\n\nOf particular interest is a $110 million payment that Saudi Arabia made to the U.S. government on the same day that Pompeo arrived in the Gulf kingdom. That's the same amount of money that was previously promised to the Trump administration to support its stabilization efforts in Syria.\n\nWhite House officials have insisted the timing of the payment was mere coincidence, but many Middle Eastern experts are skeptical.\n\n\"In all probability, the Saudis want Trump to know that his cooperation in covering for the Khashoggi affair is important to the Saudi monarch,\" Joshua Landis, director of the University of Oklahoma's Center of Middle East Studies, told the Washington Post. \"Much of its financial promises to the U.S. will be contingent on this cooperation.\""

Kelly said that Porter \"conducted himself as the ultimate gentleman,\" echoing the praise Trump heaped on him even after the photo of his ex-wife with a black eye surfaced.\n\nKelly tried to sell reporters on a fabricated timeline of events designed to make the White House look good. He claimed that they issued a press release backing Porter, which was followed up by \"a second report still not in the press\" with additional abuse allegations.\n\nBut CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins almost immediately flagged the deception and noted, \"CNN reporting shows that, by early fall, it was widely known among top aides \u2014 including Kelly \u2014 that Porter was having trouble getting a clearance and his ex-wives claimed he had abused them.\"\n\nDavid Martosko of the conservative Daily Mail, who published the photos of Porter's ex-wife, also challenged Kelly's phony retelling of events.\n\nHe noted that Kelly now claims that the White House was only first alerted to \"emotional abuse,\" but Martosko wrote, \"Untrue. We told the White House that Jennifer Willoughby claimed he physically dragged her, naked, out of a shower.\"\n\nThe Porter story pulled at the thread of an enormous security breach enabled by Trump himself. After news surfaced that Porter had been given access to classified material even though a protective order meant he couldn't pass a federal background check, it was revealed that dozens of other White House officials were in a similar situation.\n\nMost notably, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has been unable to pass the security clearance commensurate with the information he has been given access to by Trump. Ivanka Trump is also under similar scrutiny.\n\nThe Trump reaction to these revelations has followed their playbook. Rather than be contrite or open, instead he and his underlings have engaged in deception and distraction. Trump has even chosen to throw financial markets and international relations into chaos, rather than deal with what he has done.\n\nHe and his chief of staff are in sync: Women don't matter, victims don't matter, and the truth doesn't matter. Their sole interest is in preserving their political and personal power, and the truth doesn't count for anything in their cynical calculations."

Visitor logs show RT staff came to the Ecuadorian embassy in London that day to interview Assange.\n\n\"RT staff met and interviewed Assange on the same day \u2014 2 August 2016 \u2014 that Roger Stone, the self-described 'dirty trickster' and longtime Trump associate who had previously bragged about having special access to WikiLeaks, was passed information about Assange's plans,\" the Guardian reported.\n\nMueller's team is reportedly looking at Malloch's relationship with RT reporter Afshin Rattansi, on whose show he has appeared at least five times since Trump took office.\n\nRattansi was the RT reporter who interviewed Assange on August 2, 2016. According to the Guardian, a U.S. intelligence assessment published after the election alleges that Rattansi's interview of Assange was part of Russia's propaganda effort aimed at helping Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"The US intelligence report also noted a past relationship between RT and Assange, alleging that the Kremlin-backed channel had 'actively collaborated with WikiLeaks' in an effort to denounce the US,\" the Guardian reported.\n\nIn February 2018, RT was forced to register as a foreign agent with the U.S. Justice Department. That came just over a year after a January 2017 intelligence report identified RT as part of \"Russia's state-run propaganda machine\" that played a central role in the Kremlin's election interference operation.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He probably won't be doing that again.\n\nIt isn't just average Americans who think the occupant of the Oval Office is an \"idiot.\" His chief of staff, John Kelly, thinks so too.\n\nNBC reports that the increasingly isolated Kelly, who for months has seemed just one more scandal away from being fired on Twitter, has repeatedly called Trump \"an idiot,\" though presumably not to his face. White House officials say Kelly portrays himself \"as the lone bulwark against catastrophe.\"\n\nThe catastrophe being, of course, Trump himself.\n\n\"He doesn't even understand what DACA is. He's an idiot,\" Kelly reportedly said in one meeting. \"We've got to save him from himself.\"\n\nIn his many bizarre rantings about DACA, the program that allows young immigrants brought to the United States as children to remain in their homes, Trump has clearly demonstrated he has no idea what DACA is.\n\nKelly isn't the first member of Trump's inner circle to express his frustration with Trump's intellect. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly described Trump as a \"fucking moron\" \u2014 and then refused to deny the story.\n\nH.R. McMaster, Trump's former national security adviser who was fired and replaced in March by Fox News commentator and warmonger John Bolton, expressed similar thoughts about Trump. McMaster reportedly described Trump as an \"idiot,\" a \"dope,\" and someone with the intelligence of a \"kindergartener.\"\n\nAnd that was before he was fired on Twitter.\n\nPlenty of Trump's top aides and advisers have expressed their frustration with the man who spends hours every day rage-tweeting Fox News and saying demonstrably false things his team will later struggle to explain.\n\nPerhaps it shouldn't be surprising that Kelly has called Trump an idiot.

Chris Coons (D-DE), Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ).\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-UT) objected to the request to vote on the bill, claiming that it would be unconstitutional to pass legislation to prevent Mueller from being arbitrarily fired or prohibited from carrying out the Russia investigation.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also voiced his opposition to the bill, calling it \"a solution in search of a problem.\"\n\nRepublicans have consistently refused to take action to protect Mueller, arguing that such legislation is not necessary. However, the most recent push to bring the bill to the floor for a vote comes amid a series of moves by Trump that indicate the bill is not only necessary, but more important than ever before.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump retweeted a meme showing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of the Russia probe, behind bars. The meme also included a caption suggesting that Rosenstein should be tried for \"treason.\"\n\nTrump later defended the retweet by saying that Rosenstein \"should have never picked a special counsel.\"\n\nThis comes just weeks after Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions and installed loyalist Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general. Whitaker has spoken out against the Russia investigation and indicated that he would support restricting the scope of the probe or even cutting funding for it.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has ramped up his attacks on Mueller, his team, and the investigation, falsely accusing the special counsel of encouraging witnesses to lie and frequently referring to the probe as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nDespite what Republicans claim, there is no reason to believe that Trump won't try to coerce the new acting attorney general to fire Mueller or obstruct his work. In fact, there's good reason to believe he may try to do just that, given that he has already fired an FBI director in an attempt to shut down the probe.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "This is big.\n\nTwo new legal filings related to Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer, are very, very bad news for Trump.\n\nMost strikingly, federal prosecutors are now claiming that Trump himself committed a felony when he directed Cohen to commit campaign finance violations.\n\nAnd as if that weren't enough, Cohen has given special counsel Robert Mueller new information about contacts between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nCohen entered guilty pleas to crimes in two different investigations \u2014 one led by federal prosecutors in New York that's looking into the Trump Organization's finances, and one led by Mueller that's looking into the Trump campaign's potential links to Russian election interference.\n\nProsecutors in both cases released their sentencing recommendations for Cohen on Friday.\n\nIt's not the best news for Cohen. He could still face several years in prison despite his decision to turn against his former boss and cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nBut it's much worse news for Trump.\n\n\"Just to make it crystal clear, New York federal prosecutors concluded that the President of the United States committed a felony,\" CNN legal analyst Renato Mariotti wrote on Twitter.\n\nNeal Katyal, former acting solicitor general of the United States, agreed with that assessment.\n\n\"The real news right now is not about Cohen\u2019s sentence,\" Katyal wrote. \"It is about the conclusion by federal prosecutors that Donald J. Trump has committed a serious felony.\"\n\nAnd that alleged felony was indeed very serious, prosecutors emphasized. Because women Trump had affairs with were paid off to stay silent, Americans were prevented from hearing their stories ahead of the presidential election.\n\nThe revelations in the Mueller sentencing memo are also shocking. For one thing, Cohen admitted that he had direct conversations with Trump, all the way back in September of 2015, about reaching out to Putin for a meeting.\n\nCohen also gave Mueller's team \"useful information concerning certain discrete Russia-related matters core to its investigation,\" and \"relevant and useful information concerning his contacts with persons connected to the White House\" in 2017 and 2018.\n\nIt's probably time for certain \"persons connected to the White House,\" especially Trump, to panic.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Elections have consequences.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) calls several GOP investigations \"a waste of time\" and said he'll stop them when he takes over as chair of the committee next year.\n\nNadler made the comments as he was walking into a closed-door GOP-led interrogation of former FBI director James Comey. Republicans, led by retiring Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), are still clinging to the notion that there is corruption within the Department of Justice and FBI in not charging Hillary Clinton over her use of emails.\n\nRepublicans also claim, with no evidence, that the DOJ was biased against Trump, and that this was the reason why the department opened investigations into his campaign's links to Russia.\n\n\"There is no evidence of bias at the FBI and this other nonsense they are talking about,\" Nadler said as he went to the hearing, according to the Hill. \"The entire purpose of this investigation is to be a diversion of the real investigation, which is Mueller,\" he added.\n\nComey initially resisted the subpoena ordering him to appear, fearful that Republicans would selectively leak parts of his testimony to the media in an attempt to mischaracterize the conversation. Comey agreed to attend only if he would be free to speak to the media about his testimony, and a written transcript would be released.\n\nRepublicans relented, and moved forward with the lame-duck hearing, seeking to flex their power one last time before the new Democratic majority takes over, not only in the House Judiciary Committee, but in every House committee.\n\nRepublicans across the board have used their perch to nakedly shill for Trump without any pretext of holding legitimate investigations. No member better exemplifies the servile attitude of a co-equal branch of government to another better than Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), chair of the House intelligence committee. Nunes once secretly met with Trump to share information, and used his position as the chair of the committee to run a sham investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia that were laughably partisan.\n\nRather than shill for a corrupt Trump administration or waste time on nonsense investigations, Democrats have a plan to both engage in substantive legislative efforts and actually hold the Trump administration accountable.\n\nIn other words, Democrats will try to restore Congress to a co-equal branch of government, not a lapdog willing to obey the whims of Trump and the White House.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The former secretary of state once said Trump was a 'moron.' His opinion clearly hasn't improved.\n\nRex Tillerson, the former secretary of state who was, like many Trump advisers, fired on Twitter, is perhaps most infamous for calling Trump a \"moron\" \u2014 or a \"fucking moron,\" according to some reports \u2014 and then refusing to deny he said it.\n\nNow, nine months after being forced from the administration, he's still saying unflattering \u2014 though unquestionably accurate \u2014 things about his former boss.\n\nAt an event in Houston this week, Tillerson bemoaned the fact that Trump \"is pretty undisciplined, doesn't like to read, doesn't read briefing reports, doesn't like to get into the details of a lot of things.\" He also discussed how he struggled to explain to Trump that much of his plans and dreams were illegal.\n\n\"So often, the president would say here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it,\" Tillerson said, \"and I would have to say to him, 'Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can't do it that way. It violates the law.'\"\n\nTillerson was kicked to the curb in March of this year, mere hours after he dared to criticize Russia. The firing reportedly \"came as a shock\" to Tillerson, who had no idea that it was going to happen and certainly did not expect it to happen via tweet.\n\nIn a statement at the time, he said he \"had every intention of staying\" and did not know why he was fired. Nor had he even spoken with Trump, who prefers to fire people by tweet rather than face-to-face.\n\nTillerson is one of many Trump advisers who have commented on Trump's lack of intellectual rigor. H.R. McMaster, the former national security adviser who was also fired via Twitter, reportedly called Trump an \"idiot\" and a \"dope\" with the intelligence of a \"kindergartener.\"\n\nChief of staff John Kelly has also been rumored to have said Trump is an \"idiot,\" a report that unsurprisingly inspired an incoherent meltdown in which Trump actually accused the media of being \"unhinged.\"\n\nAs for Tillerson, the reason he called Trump a moron is far more alarming than amusing. In a July 2017 meeting at the Pentagon with top military advisers, Trump demanded that the United States reverse its policy of reducing nuclear weapons and increase its stockpile \"tenfold.\"\n\nTrump's failure to understand why launching a new nuclear arms race is a bad idea, along with all the other typical behavior and absurd utterances, was enough to push Tillerson over the edge and refer to the commander in chief and leader of the free world as a \"moron.\"\n\nThe former secretary of state has stayed largely quiet since his firing \u2014 until now. While he did not specifically reiterate that Trump is a \"moron,\" it isn't hard to read between the lines of his other comments. Unless, of course you're Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The bombing killed 2,403 Americans and the USS Arizona was sunk. The attack pushed the United States into World War II, which is to date the biggest military conflict in world history.\n\nBut rather than start the day commemorating veterans and paying tribute to the lives that were lost, Trump fumed about \"Robert Mueller and Leakin' Lyin' James Comey.\"\n\nThe tweet about the \"Mueller Conflicts of Interest\" was followed up by five more defensive and panicked tweets attacking the ongoing FBI investigation that has racked up multiple convictions and guilty pleas.\n\nTrump started his anti-Mueller tirade at 6:18 a.m.\n\nHis official account didn't bother to acknowledge Pearl Harbor Day until over 3 hours later, at 9:46 a.m.\n\nThe tone of the eventual Pearl Harbor tweet was significantly different from the anti-Mueller missives and was written in the more calm and measured tone of a White House staffer, rather than Trump himself.\n\nLater, when speaking to the press as he departed the White House, Trump didn't bother to address the solemn anniversary.\n\nThe episode showed Trump once again prioritizing himself and his demons, while denigrating the armed forces.\n\nMost recently Trump didn't even bother to mention the three servicemen killed in Afghanistan, and instead used Twitter to promote books written by his supporters at Fox News.\n\nHe used the Veterans Day holiday to push for ignoring military votes cast in the election.\n\nWhen addressing Navy graduates earlier in the year, Trump lied to them with ease about military pay raises, to make himself look good.\n\nTrump wouldn't even bother to respect the flag while he was on a military base, and instead laughed it up with a Fox News host.\n\nFor Trump the military is an accessory, to be used in a childish parade for his ego.\n\nHe showed that even on the anniversary of one of the saddest moments in U.S. history, it's still all about him and the trouble he's in, not about the nation he leads.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

She offered \"Congratulations, all the way around\" for something Trump hadn't done.\n\nAnd, less than a year after she began spewing Trump propaganda on Fox, it was announced that Nauert would join the administration as the State Department spokesperson in April of 2017.\n\nDuring Nauert's time at Fox News, she repeatedly made bigoted remarks and promoted lies and smears as part of Fox's attacks on progressives and Democrats.\n\nNauert was part of Fox's ongoing campaign against immigration, and once said on-air that terrorists were \"being granted tourist visas\" to come to America.\n\nShe insisted that \"thousands of immigrant children\" who came to America in 2014 were carrying \"disease\" with them when they crossed the border.\n\nWhen Virginia decided to allow immigrants with DACA status to be eligible for in-state tuition, she complained that \"illegals\" would benefit from the decision.\n\nShe also proclaimed that \"Sharia law is now changing everything\" after a YMCA in Minnesota accommodated Muslim girls for swim lessons.\n\nAs news emerged of contaminated water in Flint, Michigan, Nauert insisted that \"PC stuff\" helped to cause the crisis, along with the government focusing on climate change.\n\nBut when Democratic politicians began discussing the problems in Flint, Nauert opined that they merely saw it as \"a way they could potentially get more black votes.\"\n\nNauert also said a video exploring the problems of systemic racism was \"trying to make students feel guilty for being white.\"\n\nAnd she complained that Beyonce's Super Bowl halftime performance referencing police brutality was \"anti-cop.\"\n\nWhen the EPA awarded a grant to study water conservation practices at hotels, Nauert did a segment on Fox alleging the government would be \"monitoring showers at hotels.\"\n\nShe warned Fox viewers in an October 2015 broadcast that \"the war on Christmas is already in full swing,\" and when then-Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee chose not to host a tree lighting ceremony at the statehouse, Nauert accused him of making the \"decision to kill Christmas.\"\n\nNauert used the storyline of Spongebob Squarepants being fired from his job to editorialize about people \"mooching off social services at Bikini Bottom,\" where the cartoon character lives.\n\nShe pushed an intentionally edited and misleading video of President Obama and said it \"sounded like he was blaming the troops\" for terrorism.\n\nShe described Hillary Clinton's campaign to be the first woman president as merely \"bra-burning.\" After Hillary Clinton released her Spotify playlist, Nauert told viewers it featured \"themes of jealousy\" and \"a lack of strong convictions.\"\n\nIf her nomination is approved, Nauert will be one of the key public faces representing America at the United Nations. Behind her is a legacy of bigotry, lies, and dishonesty \u2014 a perfect representation of the ideals that Trump and his administration have wholeheartedly embraced.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, said Trump instructed him to illegally pay hush money to one of Trump's mistresses for the express purpose of influencing the election.\n\nIn North Carolina, Republicans in the 9th Congressional District face allegations of massive election fraud involving potentially thousands of votes. A campaign operative allegedly collected absentee ballots from residents, and either destroyed the ballots or filled them in for the Republican candidate, Mark Harris.\n\nAnd several other House Republicans won re-election despite evidence of criminal behavior.\n\nTwo returning Republican House members, Chris Collins of New York and Duncan Hunter of California, won their elections while out on bail after being indicted by federal prosecutors. Other shady returning members of Congress include Montana's Greg Gianforte, who pleaded guilty to violently attacking a reporter, and Ohio's Jim Jordan, who allegedly turned a blind eye to students getting molested at Ohio State University.\n\nJosh Hawley will enter the Senate under an ethical cloud \u2014 which should make him feel right at home in an increasingly corrupt Republican Party.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Mick Mulvaney used his tenure at the CFPB to do the bidding of corporations, not help consumers.\n\nThe Senate approved Kathy Kraninger as the new head for the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), but not before previous chief Mick Mulvaney could make a mockery of the agency.\n\nMulvaney took over the consumer protection agency in November 2017, even though he hated the agency and once said, \"I don't like the fact that CFPB exists.\"\n\nWhen the Washington Post delved into Mulvaney's tenure at the CFPB, it found a disturbing pattern of Mulvaney using his position to go soft on companies that were harming consumers.\n\nThe shady behavior was so prevalent that career CFPB staffers gave it a nickname: \"The Mulvaney Discount.\"\n\nIn one case, career staffers recommended an $11 million fine for a South Carolina lender, Security Finance, for allegations that it improperly pressured consumers to buy insurance and approached borrowers at their homes and jobs to collect on debts, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The recommendation went to a political appointee named Eric Blankenstein, the former private-sector lawyer who once described the bureau as \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in legal papers. Blankenstein ordered the staff to abandon some of their initial complaints and pushed to slash the fine, which was eventually lowered to $5 million. The company agreed to pay the penalty.\n\nAnd it got worse from there.\n\nIn another case, career government lawyers tried to force a settlement with National Credit Adjusters that would have refunded $60 million to consumers. But one of Mulvaney's political lackeys got involved, nixed the whole plan to refund consumers, and brought the total fines against the company down to a mere $800,000.\n\nOne of his final actions as director was one of his most egregious. After State Farm Bank was accused of giving credit agencies the wrong information about consumers and thereby hurting their credit scores, Mulvaney settled the case for zero fines and a promise the bank would not do it again.\n\nThe CFPB was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers against being taken advantage of by financial institutions.\n\nPresident Obama's administration embraced the agency, which the Post notes \"aggressively pursued lenders and other financial firms, returning more than $12 billion to more than 29 million consumers and imposing nearly $600 million in civil penalties.\"\n\nRepublicans, always willing to do the bidding of their corporate donor overlords, tried and failed to weaken or defund the agency using legislation. So Trump did the next best thing by appointing a leader willing to sabotage the agency's work from within.\n\nFormer Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), never one to mince words, is in no way pleased with the actions of Mulvaney and the Trump administration.\n\n\"It's a blatant dishonesty,\" Frank told the Post. \"He's accomplishing administratively what he couldn't do legislatively.\"\n\nMulvaney's shady practices led one of the agency's top student loan officers to resign in protest, accusing Mulvaney of using the bureau \"to serve the wishes of the most powerful financial companies in America\u201d instead of helping American families.\n\nAnd it's very possible that Kraninger, who previously worked in the Trump White House, will try to continue Mulvaney's legacy of kowtowing to big business interests.\n\nBut this time, a new Democratic majority in the House will be able to hold her accountable.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

They've moved to weaken the powers of the incoming Democratic attorney general, preventing her from monitoring the flow of dark money in the state. They're pushing bills with language that frustrates the intent of the voters, who overwhelmingly backed a proposal that expanded voting rights.\n\nUnsurprisingly, local papers are calling out this undemocratic behavior.\n\nAn op-ed from the full editorial board of the Lansing State Journal called the GOP's actions \"a ridiculous power play\" and told the Michigan Legislature that it shouldn't use the lame-duck session to override the will of the voters.\n\nThe bills pushed by the GOP, the paper said, are \"offensive\" and \"controversial\" and are being rammed through in a fashion that ignores the need for transparency.\n\nUltimately, the State Journal concludes, Michigan Republicans are acting with a \"false urgency and secrecy that sends a clear message to every voter: What we, the Legislature, want is more important than what you want.\"\n\nThat paper isn't alone. The Record-Eagle, based in Traverse City, wrote an op-ed slamming the lame-duck session as a loser for voters.\n\n\"Hundreds of issues are being rammed through \u2014 on short notice, without proper hearing or public percolation,\" the Record-Eagle notes.\n\nOver at the Detroit Free Press, an op-ed calls this lame-duck session \"Washed-up legislators gone wild.\"\n\nThey're not wrong. As the Free Press points out, the structure of the lame-duck session decreases accountability. Too many legislators have nothing to lose because they're not returning next year.\n\n\"Just one week into their lame-duck adventure, this year's outgoing legislative class has already demonstrated its contempt for Michigan voters and the politicians they've elected to represent them in Lansing starting Jan. 1.\"\n\nFinally, the statewide editorial board of MLive says that the lame-duck session has already been a time for the GOP to \"undermine, subvert, and attack the will of Michigan voters.\"\n\nThose spoke loud and clear when they elected Democrats for governor, attorney general, and secretary of state, MLive says. But now the Michigan GOP, \"instead of respecting those decisions, is trying to render them moot by limiting the power of executive-branch officials.\"\n\nAll of this is a blatant power grab that represents a depressingly cynical worldview: The people shouldn't decide what they want because only Republican legislators get that privilege. That's why it is almost impossible to find anyone to defend this behavior.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "As the North Carolina absentee-ballot scandal worsens, the state GOP is melting down, while the national GOP is completely quiet.\n\nIt's becoming more apparent that there was significant absentee ballot fraud in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. As the scandal refuses to fade from public view, the state GOP is in deep disarray and the national GOP is in deep denial.\n\nBy now, we know that the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, who currently holds a very narrow lead, employed a consultant, Leslie McRae Dowless, who had already served a felony prison term for insurance fraud. Dowless, in turn, paid \"repeat witnesses\" like Ginger Eason to pick up absentee ballots.\n\nRather than giving them to the state elections board, Eason gave them to Dowless, and now Dowless isn't saying where those ballots are. It's undisputed, though, that a shocking and disproportionate amount of the ballots from just two counties \u2014 Bladen and Robeson \u2014 were never returned.\n\nAfter days of insisting that Harris be certified as the winner immediately, things finally looked bad enough for the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, Dallas Woodhouse, to support calls for a new election in the district.\n\nWoodhouse may have yielded to calls for a new election because reports surfaced that it was possible Harris engineered this same sort of fraud when he defeated GOP incumbent Robert Pittenger back in the GOP primary. Perhaps it's one thing to defraud a Democrat out of a seat, but another thing entirely to weaponize absentee ballots against a fellow Republican.\n\nIn the middle of all this, former GOP Gov. Pat McCrory, who as recently as two weeks ago was blaming college students for voter fraud, popped up to say that this should all be solved by banning absentee voting for all but members of the military. Such a stance ignores the fact that there are plenty of people that simply can't get to the polls, and that isn't solved just by offering early voting.\n\nAt the legislature, the GOP is addressing this by sending a voter ID law to the governor to sign. The law is very similar to the same law that was struck down as unconstitutional back in 2016 and focuses on the near-nonexistent problem of voter impersonation at the polls. Worse, it wouldn't do much at all to stop the sort of absentee ballot fraud that the state is currently grappling with.\n\nMeanwhile, at the national level, it's evident that the GOP wants this to just disappear. Trump, previously very concerned about voter fraud, hasn't said anything, and is instead complaining about his approval rating. Paul Ryan is quiet, the National Republican Congressional Committee is quiet, and the Republican National Committee doesn't have anything to say either.\n\nThe North Carolina GOP finally got an election fraud scandal \u2014 something they've seemed to long for. They just didn't expect it would trip up one of their own, and now they don't know what to do.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

In the 2016 electoral cycle, for example, for every $10 donated to the campaign, Trump pocketed $1 for himself.\n\nForbes reports that Trump Tower Commercial LLC, which is wholly owned by Trump, has charged his re-election campaign $665,000 to date. Additionally, there was a joint expenditure by his campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) to spend $225,000 at Trump Tower.\n\nThat spending represents the payment of $6,300 in monthly rent for every person officially listed on the campaign payroll. By comparison, the 2016 campaign paid $2,700 per person to Trump Tower.\n\nThat is an increase of 133 percent. Occupying the presidency is proving to be good for Trump's personal bottom line.\n\nThe campaign also has paid $42,000 to Trump Plaza LLC for a mysterious rental at the Trump Plaza complex. Forbes went to the property and found \"no signs of campaign activity\" at the location despite the expenditure.\n\nThe outlet also staked out two brownstone buildings owned by Trump Plaza LLC for 14 hours and couldn\u2019t find any evidence of a campaign.\n\nA Forbes reporter spoke to a man at the front desk of Trump Plaza, who said there was no campaign office at that location.\n\n\"If there was any kind of office rented out for campaigning or whatever, I would know about it,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the payments for phantom campaign space, the rent being paid is also suspiciously high.\n\nTrump Plaza LLC received an average of $4,200 a month from the Trump campaign, but online listings for the same building show rent closer to the $3,700-3850 per month range.\n\nIt isn't just rent and real estate.\n\nThe Trump Corporation received a payment from the campaign for $90,000 that was described as \"legal consulting.\" The payment came a month after Robert Mueller was named special counsel to investigate the relationship between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump hotels are in on the action as well. The Trump hotel in Washington, D.C., which has benefitted greatly from Trump's corruption in the last two years, received $120,000 from the campaign. Trump's Las Vegas hotel has received another $15,000.\n\nAll of this means Trump and his family stand to make millions of dollars from his re-election efforts.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

It's not like they can stop him.\n\n\"I don't think there's anyone in the world that can stop Donald Trump from tweeting,\" Rudy Giuliani admitted. \"I've tried,\" he added.\n\nThe reason for the complete lack of preparation? Trump's unwillingness to stick to any plan, according to officials.\n\n\"We would always put together plans with the knowledge that he wouldn't use them or they'd go off the rails,\" a recently departed official told the Atlantic. \"And at this point, with Mueller, they've decided they're not even going to do that.\"\n\nTrump's bungling of plans often makes its way into the public sphere. After Russian dictator Vladimir Putin \"won\" re-election in Russia, Trump's national security team told Trump in no uncertain terms, \"DO NOT CONGRATULATE.\"\n\nOn a call with Putin, Trump of course congratulated him, and was then furious his inability to follow simple directions \u2014 written in all caps \u2014 was discovered by the press.\n\nThe Mueller investigation has already led to more than 30 indictments, including guilty pleas and/or convictions of five high-level Trump confidants.\n\nMost recently, Trump's longtime lawyer and oft-described \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, entered into a second plea deal with federal prosecutors after spending 70 hours giving testimony to Mueller's team. Cohen's initial plea deal fingered Trump as an accomplice in felonies related to the 2016 election. In the most recent plea deal, Cohen admitted he lied to Congress about the extent of Trump's business dealings with Russia during the 2016 campaign.\n\nYet despite the mountain of evidence Mueller is gathering, Trump's White House team is not preparing for an eventual report.\n\n\"It's like, 'Jesus, take the wheel,'\" one person told the Atlantic, \"but scarier.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

But under Trump, the Republican Party has become so craven that it would openly welcome an accused pedophile into Congress just to gain one more Senate seat.\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal CEO Council, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) lamented that Alabama rejected accused sexual predator Roy Moore in a 2017 special election. Voters in the traditionally conservative state rejected Moore in favor of Democrat and civil rights lawyer Doug Jones.\n\n\"Mr. McConnell called Mr. Jones' victory over Republican Roy Moore 'the Alabama mistake in 2017,'\" the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nWhen Moore was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, he began dating Leigh Corfman, a 14-year-old child. Corfman told the Washington Post that after one date, Moore took off her shirt, groped her, and tried to get her to touch his genitals. Barely a teenager, Corfman told the Post she remembered thinking, \"I wanted it over with \u2014 I wanted out.\"\n\nThis is the man Republicans nominated to be a U.S. Senator. This is the man McConnell says it was a \"mistake\" to reject.\n\nBut McConnell is not alone. The entire Republican establishment went all-in to try to put Moore in the Senate.\n\nThe Alabama Republican Party stood by Moore and refused to withdraw its support. Marion County GOP chairman David Hall went so far as to say he \"didn't see the relevance\" of Moore molesting children.\n\nTrump, the leader of the Republican Party, also rushed to Moore's defense and refused to let accusations of child abuse get in the way of his agenda.\n\nThe Republican National Committee followed Trump's lead, committing time and resources to fully embrace Moore and everything he stands for.\n\nIt wasn't the first time the Republican Party wholeheartedly embraced an accused sexual predator, nor was it the last.\n\nMcConnell and Republicans continued to rally behind Trump even after Trump admitted on tape that he sexually assaulted women on a routine basis.\n\nAnd after Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court \u2014 an alleged attempted rapist who is also suspected of lying under oath \u2014 McConnell and his Republican minions condescendingly dismissed the serious charges against Kavanaugh and gleefully celebrated his ascent to the highest court in the land.\n\nMcConnell's laments about not being able to pal around with Moore in the Senate are not an aberration.\n\nStanding up for child molesters and sexual predators is what it means to be a part of today's Republican Party.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Tom Emmer (R-MN), the man Republicans tapped to lead their 2020 House campaign efforts.\n\nEmmer dismissed an idea from one of the few Republican women in Congress, New York's Rep. Elise Stefanik, to use party money and endorsements to help more Republican women win their primaries.\n\n\"I think that's a mistake,\" Emmer said in an interview with Roll Call about Stefanik's proposal. \"It shouldn't be just based on looking for a specific set of ingredients \u2014 gender, race, religion \u2014 and then we're going to play in the primary.\"\n\nEmmer is the new chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), which refuses to endorse or fund GOP candidates until after they have won their primaries.\n\nStefanik thinks that policy disadvantages women and other \"nontraditional candidates.\" Stefanik, as the NRCC's first female head of recruitment, recruited over 100 Republican women to run for office \u2014 but just one of them succeeded in winning both the primary and the general election.\n\nWhile a record number of women are headed to Congress next year, the number of Republican women actually dropped precipitously. Democrats will have 89 women serving in the House, while Republicans will only have 13 \u2014 which is 10 fewer women than they had this year.\n\nTo put it in perspective, 90 percent of Republicans in the House will be white men, who only make up 31 percent of the American population.\n\nBut when approached with the idea that this is a systemic problem the Republican Party needs to actively invest in fixing, Emmer just brushed it off.\n\nThe GOP's problems with women run very deep, and in recent years the party's misogyny has emerged in some high-profile and ugly ways.\n\nRepublicans rallied behind Trump even after he admitted to being a serial sexual predator.\n\nWhen Roy Moore was accused of molesting underage girls, the entire Republican establishment continued to support his run for the Senate in Alabama, including a vocal Trump.\n\nAfter several women came forward with credible allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh, Republicans enthusiastically elevated him to the Supreme Court.\n\nHostility to a woman's right to make medical decisions for herself, including the decision of whether to carry a pregnancy or have an abortion, permeates the party at both the federal and state level.\n\nThe GOP has gotten so extreme on these issues that the group Republican Majority for Choice actually shut down, admitting that the GOP \"has become a party that wants to punish pregnant women by limiting their economic choices.\"\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, have increasingly invested in elevating women to public office. EMILY's List, a pro-choice Democratic women's organization, has spent more than 30 years recruiting, training, and endorsing women to run for all levels of elected office.\n\nDemocrats elected the first woman Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who will likely hold the position again in January 2019. And Democrats were the first major party to nominate a woman presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt's no wonder the 2018 election saw a massive gender gap in voting patterns. Women overwhelmingly sided with a Democratic Party that both respects and represents women.\n\nBut when the GOP meets, it might as well hang a \"Boys Only\" sign on the door.\n\nAnd with Trump at the top of the ticket and people like Emmer deciding GOP campaign strategy, it's likely women around the country will hear that message loud and clear again in 2020.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Scott Walker. Touting the incumbent, Ryan said the state was \"working\" as a result of policies the conservative governor had put in place. Less than a week later, voters rejected Ryan's empty claims and voted Walker out of office.\n\nSince then, the sore loser Republicans in the state legislature have staged a nakedly partisan attempt to curtail the power of Democrat Tony Evers, who will be Wisconsin's next governor.\n\nThe party used their lame-duck period to pass bills that grant more power to the Republican-run legislature and take it away the incoming governor, which Walker has indicated he will sign in the next few days.\n\nHowever, when the Huffington Post reached out to Ryan on the lame-duck moves by Republicans in his home state, Ryan's spokesman responded with \"I don't have anything for you.\" The cowardly reply echoes the manner Ryan has handled Trump and his often nonsensical, dishonest and completely racist proclamations from the presidency: with silence or a tepid rebuke.\n\nWisconsin Democratic Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling called the effort to pass the bills, which stretched on until 5 a.m Wednesday morning, \"embarrassing.\"\n\nDemocratic Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz told Republicans, \"You're sore losers.

Since fewer people are buying products, fewer laborers are employed, and there are other ripple effects too. When accounting for the broader economic impacts, the Nebraska Farm Bureau estimates the pain Trump is inflicting to the entire state of Nebraska increases to between $859 million and $1.2 billion.\n\nCorn, soybeans and pork are the commodities that have taken the brunt of the damage, according to Rempe.\n\nFarmers in the upper midwest are seeing spikes in bankruptcies, thanks in large part to Trump's trade war.\n\nFamilies and communities are suffering, but the response from the Trump administration has been callous at best, bordering on outright cruel.\n\nTrump suggested that farmers just suck it up and take one for the country. \"I'll tell you, our farmers are great patriots,\" Trump said in April. \"These are great patriots. They understand that they're doing this for the country,\" he added.\n\nAs the trade war lingered into summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue compared the income loss to dieting. \"It's a little bit like weight loss,\" Perdue said in July. However, $1 billion in losses does not sound like a \"little bit.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the midterm elections, Trump sought to buy off farmers with by pledging a $12 billion bailout plan. (The Nebraska Farm Bureau's report did not incorporate this bailout in their analysis.)\n\nFarmers saw straight through it.\n\n\"This is an election ploy,\" Michael Slattery, a soybean, corn, wheat and alfalfa farmer in Wisconsin, lamented. \"And we as farmers are playing the dupes again in this whole process.\"\n\nSlattery was right, as the bailout has been hampered by red tape and slow to dole out the relief to farmers.

The question is how much.\n\nAccording to the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, we already know that Trump has been \"compromised\" by financial ties to Russia and potentially other foreign elements.\n\nThe question is just how deep it goes.\n\n\"The president's deception about his pursuit of a Trump Tower in Moscow, his refusal to disclose his tax returns and his opaque finances present deeply concerning questions: What else does he have to hide and, more urgently, who else knows about it?\" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) asked in a USA Today op-ed about Trump.\n\nSchiff noted that Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer, Michael Cohen, has already admitted that Trump was pursuing real estate deals in Russia even while he was running for president, and even while he denied having any business dealings with Russia.\n\nThis raises a lot of important questions. For instance, did this financial relationship influence Trump's decision to side with Vladimir Putin and attack American law enforcement for concluding that Russia tried to influence the 2016 election?\n\nSchiff is especially alarmed that a hostile foreign government could have blackmail material on a U.S. president.\n\nFor instance, Schiff pointed out, \"there have long been credible allegations that Russian money was laundered through the Trump Organization. If Russia could show that Trump, his business or his immediate family had benefited from tainted money or broken the law \u2014 or if Trump believed they could \u2014 it would mean that Russia could exert pressure on Trump to influence U.S. foreign policy.\"\n\nRussia also appears to have known full well that both Cohen and Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser who is now cooperating extensively with federal investigators, were lying about Trump's Russia ties. That's potential blackmail material.\n\nBut Russia isn't the only worry when it comes to Trump's conflicts of interest. The California congressman also raised the concern that Trump's tacit support for Saudi Arabia murdering a journalist may be related to his financial entanglements with that nation.\n\nSome of those closest to Trump, including Cohen and Flynn, have been cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI by revealing the inner workings of team Trump, rather than face jail time.\n\nBut Trump's Republican allies in Congress have repeatedly refused to do any serious investigation into his obvious corruption, neglecting their constitutional role of providing oversight over the executive branch.\n\nThat was a big part of why millions of Americans voted in November to sweep Democrats into control of the House.\n\nAs a result of that blue wave, Schiff will become the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, where he has been serving as the ranking member in the minority.\n\nWhen the new Congress is sworn in, Schiff will be able to do what Republicans protecting Trump were unwilling to.\n\nAnd Schiff made these intentions crystal clear in the conclusion to his op-ed: \"The American people deserve to know that our president is acting in their interest and not his own financial self interest, or because he has been compromised by a foreign power. Now, with a new Democratic majority in the House, we should be able to find out.\"\n\nTrump is now on notice that his shady dealings will be investigated and exposed.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans have nothing to say about evidence that shows one of their nominees benefited from election fraud.\n\nThe entire Republican Party machine \u2014 from Trump to Congress to Fox News \u2014 is refusing to acknowledge evidence of rampant election fraud in a North Carolina congressional race.\n\nThere are serious and credible reports that in at least one county, an operative working for Republican Mark Harris' campaign ran a systemic fraud campaign in which absentee ballots belonging to real voters were either filled in with fake votes for Harris, or thrown away if they had already been filled in for Democrat Dan McCready.\n\nThe evidence of this fraud is so strong that the North Carolina State Board of Elections is refusing to certify results that would give Harris a victory over McCready in the 9th Congressional District. House Democrats are even considering refusing to seat Harris in the new Congress unless the controversy is resolved.\n\nBut after years of hyping the completely imaginary \"threat\" of in-person voter fraud, Republicans have suddenly gone silent about the very real election-rigging on their own side.\n\nTrump hasn't discussed the 9th District election at all, even though he often uses his Twitter account to push nonsense conspiracy theories about election fraud.\n\nNeither has Mike Pence, even though his wife campaigned on behalf of Harris in October.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the election fraud from Buzzfeed. The Republican National Committee also didn't respond. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC led by Speaker Paul Ryan, has not been involved in the race, and Ryan's office declined Buzzfeed's request for comment.\n\nAnd the Republican Party's all-but-official propaganda arm, Fox News, has done all it can to avoid reporting on the very credible allegations of GOP election fraud in North Carolina. On the rare occasions that the scandal was even mentioned, Fox has shamefully minimized it and told lies about Democrats doing something similar.\n\nFor years, Fox has banged the drum on bogus claims of voter fraud whenever such allegations seemed likely to help Republican candidates.\n\nBut now that Republicans might have committed real election fraud in North Carolina, Fox has chosen instead to report on topics like toy bananas, a teacher who told children Santa isn't real, and the reunification of the band Hootie and the Blowfish.\n\nIn-person voter fraud, the kind Republicans love to fearmonger about, almost never happens. But election fraud, like the illegal harvesting of absentee ballots that's alleged in North Carolina, can and does happen.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee is now calling for an emergency hearing on the race.\n\n\"Votes have been stolen by preying on senior and minority voters, and now a cloud of doubt and suspicion hangs over this election result,\" Connolly said in a press release.\n\nBut it's not clear yet whether Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), the outgoing Oversight Committee chair, will agree to hold a hearing before the end of the current session.\n\nRepublicans just don't want to talk about their own party's alleged attempt to commit election fraud, nor do the vast array of organizations designed to help Republicans win elections.\n\nThe silence is complete, and the cynicism is obvious.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The sentencing memorandum for Michael Flynn doesn't look good for Trump.\n\nThe Office of the Special Counsel dropped the sentencing memorandum for Michael Flynn, President Trump's short-lived national security adviser, on Tuesday night.\n\nIt's only 13 pages, and 6 of those are heavily redacted, but it seems to send a message to Trump: Michael Flynn talked. And he talked a lot.\n\nFirst, the memo goes out of its way to praise the \"significance and usefulness\" of Flynn's assistance. This includes assistance in another criminal investigation that's separate from the special counsel probe, the subject of which is unfortunately redacted.\n\nThat redaction is tantalizing because it makes clear that Flynn has helped with more than just the investigation into collusion \u2014 and that a criminal investigation may well be circling ever-nearer to Trump and his inner circle.\n\nMueller also takes pains to point out that the full scope of Flynn's cooperation really can't be known yet because the investigations about which he provided information are still ongoing.\n\nSo, even though it is a possibility that the collusion investigation itself might be winding down, there are still more investigations out there. It's a neat way of reminding Trump that Mueller has a broad charge to pursue any other matters that come out of the collusion investigation.\n\nEveryone already knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the transition, where he asked them to refrain from \"escalating the situation in response to sanctions\" that had been imposed against Russia. The subtext of that request, of course, was that the Trump administration would go easy on Russia and lift or minimize the sanctions.\n\nThe sentencing memo notes that Flynn provided information on just that. However, it goes on to say that Flynn also offered information about contacts between the Trump transition team and Russia.\n\nWhile that section is redacted, it shows there are more points of collusive contact out there \u2014 and Mueller knows it.\n\nIt's also important to remember that the Office of the Special Counsel asked for multiple delays in issuing their sentencing recommendation. There's a very real possibility that those delays were because Flynn kept on talking.\n\nHere's perhaps the most critical takeaway from this memo: Even though Flynn's conduct is described as quite serious, Mueller is ultimately recommending no jail time for Flynn.\n\nFormer Trump aide George Papadopoulos got 14 days in prison, and it looks like former campaign chair Paul Manafort will face significant prison time. But Michael Flynn isn't going to be locked up for even a minute.\n\nThe message to potential defendants: Talk and you won't see the inside of a cell. The message to Trump: Flynn talked about you and your team, and he's being rewarded.\n\nThe GOP is already trying to spin this as somehow good for Trump, but it really isn't. With this sentencing memorandum, Mueller is telling Trump that thanks to Flynn, he knows more \u2014 a lot more \u2014 about collusion and about other crimes, and he's not stopping any time soon.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Before joining Trump's team, Labor Secretary Alex Acosta helped a serial child predator get an unconscionably lenient plea deal.\n\nMore than a dozen members of Congress are demanding an investigation into a member of Trump's Cabinet, Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, after a bombshell report by the Miami Herald revealed that he once brokered a shockingly weak plea deal for the leader of a child sex trafficking ring.\n\nIn a letter to the Justice Department's Inspector General, lawmakers asked the agency to look into irregularities surrounding the 2007 plea deal between then-U.S. Attorney Acosta and serial child predator Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Miami Herald's investigation identified more than 80 women who say they were victimized by Epstein, who regularly coerced underage women into a variety of sex acts in his posh Palm Beach mansion and then paid them for it. At least one woman alleges Epstein forcibly raped her and then paid her $1,000 to leave.\n\nBut rather than bring the full weight of the law down on a child sex trafficker, Acosta \u2014 who now has oversight over U.S. policy on sex trafficking \u2014 let Epstein cut a sweetheart deal.\n\nDespite allegedly molesting hundreds of young girls, Epstein served just 13 months in a county jail after pleading guilty to two felony prostitution charges.\n\nThat meant some of Epstein's young victims were smeared as prostitutes, even though anyone under 18 who is paid for sex is legally considered to be a trafficking victim.\n\nWhat's more, the Herald reported, the deal Acosta made \"essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein\u2019s sex crimes.\"\n\nNot only were Epstein and four of his accomplices granted immunity from federal charges, but broad immunity was also granted to any other \"potential co-conspirators\" who might come up in the course of an investigation.\n\nThe Herald reports that the FBI \"had enough evidence to put Epstein away for a long time but was overruled by Acosta,\" who \"buckled under pressure\" from Epstein's high-powered lawyers to wrap the case up quietly \u2014 even as the FBI was uncovering new evidence against Epstein.\n\nThe Herald continues:\n\nIt\u2019s clear, from emails and other records, that prosecutors spent a lot of time figuring out a way to settle the case with the least amount of scandal. Instead of charging Epstein with a sex offense, prosecutors considered witness tampering and obstruction charges, and misdemeanors that would allow Epstein to secretly plead guilty in Miami instead of in Palm Beach County, where most of the victims lived, thereby limiting media exposure and making it less likely for victims to appear at the sentencing.\n\nSadly, it is not unexpected that Trump would appoint a Cabinet member who showed preferential treatment to a pedophile.\n\nAnd it's not just because Trump was personal friends with Epstein himself.\n\nTrump, as well as the Republican Party, endorsed and campaigned for accused child molester Roy Moore in Alabama. Moore eventually lost to Democrat Doug Jones, but Trump stood by Moore every step of the way.\n\nTrump's inner circle includes numerous appointees and advisers who have been accused of domestic violence or sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump himself admitted to being a serial sexual predator when he was caught on tape bragging about grabbing women without their consent.\n\nThe fact that Trump would surround himself with other predators, and those who enable predators, is as unsurprising as it is disgusting.\n\nIt's also unsurprising that Democrats in Congress are now calling for Acosta to be investigated. Voters ushered in a new Democratic majority in part to provide a check on Trump and his morally bankrupt Cabinet.\n\nRepublicans repeatedly turned a blind eye to Trump's culture of corruption. But now Democrats are letting Acosta know that they intend to hold him, and every other member of Trump's team, accountable.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Probably not.\n\nIt's getting more and more difficult for Trump to cover up Saudi Arabia's role in the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAfter a classified briefing with the head of the CIA, even Republican senators were convinced that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was behind Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\"It is zero chance \u2014 zero \u2014 that this happened without the crown prince,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told reporters on Tuesday after the briefing, adding that one would have to be \"willfully blind\" not to see that.\n\nA willfully blind Trump has tried to sow doubts about whether or not the Saudi prince was involved \u2014 even after the CIA concluded that he was, and even though Trump has access to the same information the CIA shared with senators.\n\n\"[M]aybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Trump said flippantly in a bizarre White House statement that also praised Saudi Arabia for helping keep oil prices down.\n\nBut after the CIA briefing, even Republican senators who support almost everything else Trump does, like Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, were convinced that \"all this leads back to the crown prince.\"\n\nRetiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) declared that if Crown Prince Mohammed were in front of a jury, \"he would have a unanimous verdict in about 30 minutes. Guilty. A guilty verdict.\"\n\nBut while some Senate Republicans came out of the closed-door meeting spouting fiery rhetoric, there is little reason to believe they will take any concrete action that would displease Trump.\n\nFor starters, they can't even agree on what action they should take. The New York Times reported that the senators were \"divided\" on what to do next.\n\nAnd some of these Republican senators, like Corker, have a habit of occasionally voicing mild disapproval of Trump, yet steadfastly voting in favor of the Trump agenda in almost every circumstance.\n\nTrump's complicit administration has joined his cover-up attempts, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. But it is unlikely a Republican-controlled Senate will take any steps to hold any of them accountable.\n\nIn a shocking admission that he puts party ahead of country, Graham said of Pompeo and Mattis, \"If they were in a Democratic administration, I would be all over them for being in the pocket of Saudi Arabia.\" But since they work for Trump, Graham assumes they are simply \"good soldiers.\"\n\nOver the first two years of the Trump era, the American people have learned that there are no Republican heroes in Congress \u2014 just Trump's lapdogs.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "This is not how democracy works.\n\nRepublicans in Wisconsin, led by ousted Gov. Scott Walker, are undermining democracy and trying to thwart the will of Wisconsin voters with an unethical power grab in the lame-duck session.\n\nIn a show of utter contempt for the people of Wisconsin, Republicans are on the verge of passing sweeping measures restricting the powers of Democratic Governor-elect Tony Evers and Democratic Attorney General-elect Josh Kaul.\n\nThe undemocratic legislative package passed the Senate in the wee hours of the morning over the opposition of every single Democrat, and passed the state Assembly later on Wednesday morning. It is expected to be signed into law by Walker.\n\n\"Wisconsin has never seen anything like this,\" Evers said in a statement. \"Power-hungry politicians rushed through sweeping changes to our laws to expand their own power and override the will of the people of Wisconsin who asked for change on November 6th.\"\n\nBut even Republicans admit the bill is foiling the will of voters who chose a new direction for the state.\n\nRepublican Speaker Robin Vos said that if the bill didn't pass, \"we are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in.\"\n\nBut if the majority of Wisconsinites actually agreed with Vos, they wouldn't have kicked Walker out of office and ushered in Democrats to take over statewide offices.\n\nVos is not an emperor, and Walker is the furthest thing from a deity. In a democracy, the will of the people is supposed to reign supreme \u2014 yet Republicans are preparing to thwart that will in the most patronizing way possible and ram through their clearly unpopular political agenda.\n\nThe measures Walker is prepared to sign will weaken the new governor's power over a state jobs agency until September, and place severe limits on early voting. This is a common theme among Republicans nationwide \u2014 trying to make it harder, not easier, to vote.\n\nWisconsin Republicans also want to make it harder for the incoming Democrats to fulfill a campaign pledge to withdraw the state from a lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act. If successful, the Walker-led suit would take away Obamacare's protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions, which would make health insurance completely unaffordable for many American families.\n\nBoth Evers and Kaul campaigned on withdrawing from the harmful lawsuit, and their position won over the majority of Wisconsin voters. But Republicans evidently don't care about what voters want, and don't care whether their constituents go bankrupt over health costs.\n\nIn the dark of night, Republicans are diligently and purposefully attacking the most foundational aspect of democracy: the will of voters.\n\n\"The first thing Scott Walker did when he walked through the door of the Capitol was to create chaos,\" Democratic Sen. Jon Erpenbach said during Senate debate over the bill. \"The last thing he is doing is creating chaos.\"\n\n\"If anyone is unsatisfied with the results of an election,\" writes UW-Madison professor Michael Wagner, \"the remedy is not to change the rules, it is to try and win the next election.\"\n\nWagner adds that the \"peaceful transfer of power in republican democracies requires that lawmakers do not change the job descriptions, between Election Day and Inauguration Day, of the elected offices their party lost.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Republicans in Wisconsin \u2014 along with those in Michigan and North Carolina \u2014 are more focused on upholding their own power than upholding the democratic principles America is built upon.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "House intel Republicans said they found no evidence of collusion or crimes. Perhaps that's because they didn't look for either.\n\nA bombshell report published Saturday by The New York Times reveals the existence of a second Trump Tower meeting and provides the first indication that a country other than Russia offered to help the Trump campaign in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe report \u2014 which details an August 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Blackwater founder Erik Prince (who is also the brother of Betsy DeVos), an emissary for two Arab princes, and an Israeli social media specialist promising a plan to help Trump win the election \u2014 opens up an entire new line of questioning about why Trump associates were so eager to meet with representatives of foreign governments offering assistance to the campaign.\n\n\"It is illegal for foreign governments or individuals to be involved in American elections, and it is unclear what\u2014if any\u2014direct assistance Saudi Arabia and the Emirates may have provided. But two people familiar with the meetings said that Trump campaign officials did not appear bothered by the idea of cooperation with foreigners,\" The Times reported.\n\nThe revelation of a second Trump Tower meeting during which Donald Trump Jr. received an offer of help from officials representing two other foreign governments \u2014 the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia \u2014 also blows a huge hole in the already flimsy final report released this month by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nHouse intel Republicans ended their Russia investigation in March, declaring that they found no evidence of wrongdoing, no collusion, and no crimes committed by anyone they interviewed or investigated. They also broke with the intelligence community and said Russia had not attempted to help Trump win the election.\n\nWhen the Majority report was released earlier this month, Republicans effectively declared 'case closed' and shut the book on investigating the Trump campaign so they could move on to more important matters \u2014 like risking the life of an FBI informant in an attempt to shield Trump from scrutiny.\n\nThe Times' report reveals that House intel Republicans were completely in the dark about this second Trump Tower meeting (or if they knew about, they concealed it and failed to investigate it), calling into question what other major revelations they may have left out of their report or never even looked at.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of Erik Prince at the August 2016 meeting seems to show that he lied to the House intel committee during sworn testimony. On Nov. 30, 2017, Prince testified, under oath, that he had no formal communication or contact with the Trump campaign.\n\n\"So there was no formal communication or contact with the campaign?\" Rep. Tom Rooney (R-FL) asked Prince during his interview before the House intel committee.\n\n\"Correct,\" Prince responded.\n\nWith Blockbuster NYT report (\"Trump Jr. and Other Aides Met With Gulf Emissary Offering Help to Win Election\")... 1. Meeting was arranged and attended by Erik Prince. 2. Compare this to what Prince told Congress and looks a lot like perjury. Prince's testimony:\n\n<thread>1/ pic.twitter.com/IIKOknUpxk \u2014 Ryan Goodman (@rgoodlaw) May 19, 2018\n\nPrince mentioned that he met Trump Jr. once \"at a campaign event\" and again at Trump Tower \"during the transition\" \u2014 but he never mentioned the meeting in August 2016, when an Israeli social media specialist offered a \"multimillion-dollar proposal for a social media manipulation effort,\" and an emissary, George Nader, informed Trump Jr. that the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were \"eager to help\" the campaign.\n\nThis isn't the first time Prince's testimony before the House intel committee has been called into question. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly has evidence contradicting Prince's claim that a meeting he attended in the Seychelles with a Putin ally was an unplanned encounter. Nader, a cooperating witness, reportedly told Mueller's team that he helped arrange the meeting in advance \u2014 undermining what Prince said during his testimony.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the House intel committee, called into question the accuracy of Prince's testimony in early March. At the time, he asked his GOP colleagues \u2014 the only ones who have subpoena power \u2014 to bring Prince back for a second interview to address inconsistencies in his testimony.\n\nBut Republicans ignored his request. Just four days later, they ended the committee's Russia probe without ever calling Prince back for additional testimony.\n\nGiven that House intel Republicans missed such a major development and failed to follow up on misleading testimony despite requests from their Democratic colleagues, it's hard to take them seriously when they claim they found \"no collusion.\" They didn't find evidence of this meeting, either, nor did they find evidence that Prince lied to them \u2014 yet the evidence was there.\n\nIt's easy not to find something when you don't even look for it."

    "text": "Michigan Republicans are using the lame-duck session to undermine the will of the voters, but people are fighting back.\n\nMichigan's lame-duck session is moving almost too fast to keep track of, as the GOP races to strip citizens of paid sick leave and undercut the authority of the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general.\n\nNow, two bills \u2014 one that functionally dismantles paid sick leave and another that delays the minimum wage hike for nearly a decade \u2014 are headed to the governor's office for a signature.\n\nThe changes to the minimum wage law are drastic. Where the existing law would have raised the minimum wage to $12 per hour by 2022, the revised bill drags that raise out until 2030. And tipped workers will only see a farcical 48 cents per hour wage hike in that same time, a rise that can't possibly keep up with inflation.\n\nThe changes to the paid sick time law are equally bad. The new bill exempts all companies that employ 50 or fewer workers, which is actually the bulk of the companies in the state. Workers would also need to wait a full year before sick time starts accruing.\n\nThose bills are now headed to the desk of lame-duck GOP Gov. Rick Snyder, and there's no reason to think that the anti-worker governor won't sign them.\n\nBut the people are gearing up to fight back. Groups such as Mothering Justice that supported the paid sick leave ballot initiative are phone banking to get people to call Snyder and ask him to veto the bills. That may ultimately prove unsuccessful at this stage, but may also galvanize Michigan citizens for the battle ahead.\n\nOne of the organizations that backed the original ballot initiative supporting paid sick leave, the Michigan Time to Care coalition, has already filed new petition language. That's the first step in getting paid sick time back on the ballot in 2020. In a press release, the coalition said they are also ready to take the matter to court, arguing that there is a 1964 Michigan Attorney General's opinion that says the GOP can't do what it is trying to do now.\n\nAnd if not, Michigan Time to Care and other groups will go back to the voters and begin collecting petitions again. The citizens of Michigan are going to have to continue to mobilize against a GOP legislature that has no interest in protecting and uplifting the workers of the state.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The stunt was meant to appeal to the anti-immigrant hostility in Republican voters in hopes of increasing turnout in the midterm elections.\n\nThe stunt failed, with Democrats gaining 40 seats in the House of Representatives, but Trump still demanded troops miss both Thanksgiving and Christmas while deployed at the border. Some troops are spending their time shoveling horse manure rather than celebrating the holidays with their family.\n\nNielsen praised this action as \"the act of a leader\" in an official statement. True, but not a good leader.\n\nThe outward embrace of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric seems to have put Nielsen on solid footing with Trump. But her allies in the administration are still frustrated, they told Politico.\n\n\"One source close to the secretary said 'she's just now starting to bear fruit for all the work she's put in,' claiming that Nielsen has been a quiet steward of Trump's immigration agenda for months, but couldn't discuss several policies in public until recently,\" Politico reports.\n\nThe argument is that Nielsen has been a coldhearted monster all along, but she was just quietly ruining the lives of asylum-seekers and other immigrants.\n\nIf there is anything we know about Trump, it is that he does not hide his racism.\n\nNow we know that he expects his loyal minions to be as outwardly racist as he is if they want to keep their jobs.\n\nAnd that's no problem for Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Steny Hoyer (D-MD), who will be House majority leader when the new Congress is sworn in, told reporters the House should hold off on swearing in Harris until questions about the race are resolved.\n\nThere are serious concerns about voting irregularities in the race, particularly allegations that absentee ballots were either thrown away or fraudulently filled in, benefitting the Republican.\n\nPicking up ballots in this manner, which is also known as \"harvesting,\" is a crime in North Carolina.\n\nHarris won 61 percent of the absentee ballots that were submitted in the election from Bladen County. Curiously, only 19 percent of those ballots came from registered Republicans.\n\nThe county also had the highest rate of absentee ballot requests in the state, according to the New York Times. In Bladen County, 7.5 percent of voters made absentee requests, while less than 3 percent of voters did the same in most of the rest of the state.\n\nForty percent of the requested ballots in Bladen County were not returned, nor were 62 percent of the ballots in neighboring Robeson County. By contrast, no other county in the state had a higher rate than 27 percent of unreturned ballots, the New York Times reported.\n\nPolitical operative L. McCrae Dowless Jr. was hired as a contractor by consultants working for the Harris campaign.\n\nIn an affidavit submitted to authorities as part of the dispute, a resident of the 9th District said Dowless was rumored to be in line for a $40,000 bonus if Harris won the race.\n\nIn an interview with local television station WSOC, Ginger Eason admitted to being one of the \"harvesters\" in question, saying she was \"helping McCrae pick up ballots\" for $75 to $100 a week.\n\nShe said that after taking ballots from voters, she did not put them in the mail. Instead, she delivered them to Dowless.\n\n\"I don't know nothing what happened after I dropped them off,\" she explained.\n\nThis is a stunning admission in the #NC09 election controversy by \u2066@wsoctv\u2069\u2019s \u2066@JoeBrunoWSOC9\u2069 on what one of the \u201charvesters\u201d did with the absentee by mail ballots she picked up: #ncpol pic.twitter.com/NtcmJOVnpE \u2014 Michael Bitzer (@BowTiePolitics) December 3, 2018\n\nDowless is a convicted felon who served six months in prison in the 1990s for felony fraud and has also been indicted for perjury.\n\nHe has also been involved in other schemes to illegally collect unreturned absentee ballots in North Carolina.\n\nDespite repeated fear-mongering about supposedly fraudulent election results and making stories up about elections being rigged, prominent Republicans like Trump and Mike Pence have not commented publicly on the North Carolina race.\n\nWhen their own Republican Party is implicated in election fraud, both men have gone silent.\n\nThe party is holding on to seats in the House for dear life after a Democratic wave of voters removed the majority. Now one more seat sits in the balance, and it looks like Republicans got caught trying to steal it.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is waging a devastating trade war just to make himself look tough.\n\nTrump loves to brag about all the \"deals\" he makes. He loves it so much that sometimes he'll brag about making a deal that isn't actually a deal yet.\n\nThis appears to be what happened after Trump talked trade with Chinese president Xi Jinping over dinner this weekend at the G-20 summit in Argentina. Somehow in Trump's mind, a temporary \"trade truce,\" pending further negotiations, transformed into China immediately giving the U.S. everything it wants.\n\nAnd once again, Trump's advisers are left scrambling to explain their boss's wild claims.\n\nTrump boasted in a tweet Sunday night that China had agreed to reduce its tariffs on U.S. automobiles, which are currently at a staggering 40 percent. Beijing charges 15 percent for foreign imports more generally, but added an extra 25 percent for U.S. cars to retaliate against Trump's needless tariffs.\n\nThere's just one problem, Bloomberg reports: This agreement \"doesn't exist on paper and still hasn't been confirmed in Beijing.\"\n\nHere's what both the U.S. and China agree happened over dinner, although they failed to release a joint statement about it: Trump agreed to a 90-day postponement of additional tariffs on China that he'd planned to take effect starting Jan. 1, in exchange for China agreeing to negotiate on other issues like intellectual property protections and forced technology transfer.\n\nSure, it's a trade truce. For now. But it's nothing close to a trade deal. And now Trump's economic advisers are furiously backpedaling on Trump's sweeping declarations about a nonexistent \"deal.\"\n\n\"I'll call them 'commitments' at this point, which are \u2014 commitments are not necessarily a trade deal, but it's stuff that they're going to look at and presumably implement,\" top Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters Monday.\n\n\"I think there is a specific understanding that we are now going to turn the agreement the two presidents had into a real agreement in the next 90 days,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday. \"I'm taking President Xi at his word, at his commitment to President Trump. But they have to deliver on this.\"\n\nMnuchin didn't specify what \"commitment\" Xi actually made, Bloomberg pointed out \u2014 and all of this confusion \"underscored the risk entailed by Trump's eagerness to strike deals without nailing down details in advance.\"\n\nIt also wasn't enough for Trump to make just one big, baseless exaggeration about his \"deal\" with China.\n\nHe tweeted Monday morning that U.S. farmers, who have been severely hurt by Trump's trade war, will actually be \"a very BIG and FAST beneficiary of our deal with China,\" because China will \"start purchasing agricultural product immediately.\"\n\nThat might happen. Maybe. But the details are still very much being negotiated, Mnuchin admitted.\n\nTrump tweeted about China again on Tuesday, this time admitting that a potential \"REAL deal\" is still being negotiated.\n\nHe even gave himself a nickname for once, \"Tariff Man\" \u2014 presumably to threaten China with more tariffs if things don't go his way and to try to make himself look tough ahead of the negotiations.\n\nTrump's trade war has been an unmitigated disaster for the U.S. economy, hurting iconic American industries from farming to manufacturing.\n\nBut all Trump cares about is how he can spin it into bragging rights for himself.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Tuesday's request for a sentencing delay indicates 'there's likely to be a big indictment in which Flynn is going to be one of the star witnesses,' said former Watergate prosecutor Nick Ackerman.\n\nThe move to delay sentencing for Trump's former national security adviser Mike Flynn is \"not good news for Donald Trump,\" according to former assistant special Watergate prosecutor Nick Ackerman.\n\nCommenting on a court filing submitted Tuesday seeking to delay Flynn's sentencing by at least two months, Ackerman said the news is an ominous sign for Trump, because it indicates that Flynn is still talking \u2014 and special counsel Robert Mueller is still listening.\n\nThe request to push back sentencing for Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, was submitted by Mueller's office and attorneys for Flynn. They said Flynn is not ready for sentencing \"due to the status of the special counsel\u2019s investigation,\" according to the federal court filing.\n\n\"This is not good news for Donald Trump,\" Ackerman told MSNBC's Ari Melber. \"What they are looking to do is bring a major indictment in which Flynn is going to be one of the star witnesses. What Flynn wants to do is get as many brownie points as he can so when he goes to a sentencing judge he can say that he went all out, he testified for the government, he testified truthfully and as a result of his testimony there were a number of convictions.\"\n\nAckerman also noted that Mueller likely \"wants to kind of keep the lid on Flynn so that he has an incentive to go in and testify fully and truthfully. And by doing that, he keeps open sentencing.\"\n\n\"Both sides have a big incentive to keep this [sentencing] open,\" Ackerman added, \"and it's all open because there's likely to be a big indictment in which Flynn is going to be one of the star witnesses.\"\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty in December to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials. As part of his plea deal, Flynn agreed to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation into Russian interference and potential coordination with the Trump campaign.\n\nTuesday's request for a sentencing delay not only suggests that Flynn is still providing valuable information to Mueller, but that the investigation is not going to be wrapping up anytime soon.\n\nThat news is likely to come as a surprise to Rudy Giuliani, who joined Trump's legal team six days ago with the promise that he would soon bring the Mueller probe to a close. Instead, the investigation looks to be entering an entirely new phase \u2014 and the implications look ominous for the man in the Oval Office."

    "text": "A scam artist is now acting as the nation's chief law enforcement officer.\n\nAfter Trump fired Jeff Sessions as attorney general, he temporarily replaced him with Matthew Whitaker \u2014 a known critic of the Mueller investigation into Trump's ties to Russia whose appointment is likely illegal.\n\nThe whole thing is already a scam against democracy and the rule of law. And on top of all of this, Whitaker himself appears to be an actual scam artist.\n\nWhitaker was on the board of directors of World Patent Marketing, a company that was forced to close and pay a $25 million settlement to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) because it was such an outrageous scam.\n\nAnd according to new documents released by the FTC, Whitaker kept promoting the company even though he very likely knew it was a scam.\n\n\"Months after joining the advisory board of a Miami-based patent company in 2014, Matthew G. Whitaker began fielding angry complaints from customers that they were being defrauded, including from a client who showed up at his Iowa office to appeal to him personally for help,\" the Washington Post reported Friday.\n\nThese complaints were urgent and damning. Customers told Whitaker that the company's CEO, Scott Cooper, \"is running an absolute scam,\" and threatened to file formal complaints against the company.\n\nBut all Whitaker did was forward a few of the emails to Cooper and leave it up to him on whether or how to respond. Whitaker never replied to the customers who reached out to him for help.\n\nAnd in at least one case, he used his legal background to threaten a disgruntled former associate of Cooper's who threatened to report the company to the Better Business Bureau.\n\n\"I am a former United States Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa,\" Whitaker wrote in 2015. \"Your emails and message from today seem to be an apparent attempt at possible blackmail or extortion.\"\n\nThis type of behavior was allegedly systemic in the company.\n\n\"A key takeaway from the FTC documents is that World Patent Marketing used Whitaker's background as a U.S. attorney to impress potential clients and bully perceived enemies,\" Bloomberg reported.\n\nShortly after Whitaker joined the firm's advisory board, Cooper also wrote an email to a brand-building company with the subject line, \"Let's build a Wikipedia page and use Whitaker to make it credible.\"\n\n\"These new documents suggest that Mr. Whitaker was personally aware of allegations of fraud by World Patent Marketing and its CEO at the same time he was receiving payments as a member of the Advisory Board,\" Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, said Friday. \"If true, this is extremely troubling and raises serious concerns about his fitness to serve as acting Attorney General and whether he was properly vetted for this critical position.\"\n\nWhitaker also missed a deadline to comply with a subpoena from the FTC. When he did comply, the response was \"lackluster,\" Sen. Bob Udall (D-NM) said Friday.\n\nWorld Patent Marketing lured in customers with fake \"success stories\" and suppressed negative reviews. It promised to package and market anyone's patent or invention idea, no matter how unviable, for a fee. The FTC found that many of those customers ended up in debt or even lost their life savings, while Whitaker and other executives profited.\n\nThe alleged scam and Whitaker's alleged involvement in it was so bad, one FTC investigator wrote this incredulous email in late October 2017: \"You're not going to believe this. Matt Whitaker is now chief of staff to the Attorney General. Of the United States.\"\n\nAnd now, even more unbelievably, Whitaker has been promoted to acting attorney general. Of the United States.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The prosecutors who secured the plea deal are part of Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference.\n\nIf Mueller is going after people for lying to Congress, Trump Jr. should be very worried \u2014 because he appears to have lied when he testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May.\n\nIn his testimony, Trump Jr. denied that foreign governments either offered or provided direct assistance to the Trump campaign. But this was false, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) explained when he demanded that Trump Jr. return to the Senate and provide further details on his statements.\n\nAfter Trump Jr. spoke to the Senate, the New York Times reported that George Nader, an official emissary working on behalf of princes from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, met with Trump Jr. at Trump Tower before the 2016 election.\n\nAt that meeting, Trump Jr. was reportedly told that the princes wanted to help Trump win the election.\n\nIn a letter written to Sen.

Notably, the three men \"reviewed a confidential draft of a $10 billion government contract for the electronic-records project, even though they lack any relevant expertise.\"\n\nNewly released emails also show Moskowitz tried to push the VA to partner with Apple, Inc. to use an app that Moskowitz himself wrote \u2014 even though the VA identified serious problems with the app and tried to propose better ways to partner with Apple.\n\nAfter the VA went in another direction, ProPublica notes, Moskowitz was still fuming about it months later.\n\nThese new emails come to light just days after the independent Government Accountability Office (GAO) agreed to a request from Sens.

This would disproportionately suppress the vote in minority communities.\n\nThe GOP even wants to help rig a 2020 state Supreme Court election in advance by scheduling it on a separate date from the presidential primary election. This would reduce voter turnout for the Supreme Court race, which would help the conservative candidate win.\n\nThe undemocratic power grab has prompted a groundswell of resistance.\n\nOrdinary citizens chanted \"Respect our votes!

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) as their new minority leader, even though he oversaw massive Republican losses in his home state of California.\n\nThat included losses in reliably red districts like California's 45th Congressional District, located in Orange County. Rep. Mimi Walters (R-CA), who won that district by 17 points in 2016, was one of Trump's staunchest defenders.\n\n\"He's the president of our party,\" Walters once said of Trump. \"He stands for what we stand for.\"\n\nWalters lost her seat to Democrat Katie Porter by almost four points.\n\nAt this rate, the GOP will embrace the same failed strategy in 2020 that helped them lose 40 House seats to Democrats in 2018.\n\n\"Now the party is Trump so we follow his lead,\" said retiring Rep. Tom Rooney (R-FL).\n\nAbject fealty to Trump is the only binding principle of today's Republican Party.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump has another meltdown as Robert Mueller closes in.\n\nIn a sharp reversal from several months ago, Trump is now calling for prison time for Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, oft-described as his \"fixer.\"\n\nIn an official White House statement released via Twitter, Trump said Cohen should \"serve a full and complete sentence\" for his numerous crimes.\n\nCohen has entered into two separate plea deals with federal prosecutors \u2014 one with the Southern District of New York, and a separate one with special counsel Robert Mueller. Both deals lay out unethical and illegal activities by Trump, his family, and his campaign.\n\nYet as recently as April, Trump was singing Cohen's praises.\n\n\"Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked & respected,\" Trump said on Twitter. \"Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if........it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!\"\n\nTrump was wrong, and Cohen most definitely flipped on him.\n\nAnd Cohen's testimony is absolutely devastating. He admitted to paying hush money to one of Trump's mistresses, Stormy Daniels, just weeks before the 2016 election in an illegal attempt to influence the election. In his plea deal, Cohen implicated Trump in more than one felony. In a separate plea deal, Cohen admitted lying to Congress about Trump's financial dealings with Russia during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAnd that's only what the public knows about. Mueller likely knows much, much more, since Cohen has spent 70 hours with his team.\n\nIf a series of increasingly unhinged tweets from this morning are any indication, Trump seems to be irked that Cohen's lawyers asked for no jail time after Cohen cooperated with investigations, including at least one led by Mueller.\n\nTrump typed, \"You mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc., and not serve a long prison term? He makes up stories to get a GREAT & ALREADY reduced deal for himself, and get.....his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free. He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence.\"\n\nTrump's angry outbursts at Cohen were quickly followed by a statement praising former campaign adviser Roger Stone, who said he will not testify against Trump. Trump praised Stone as having \"guts.\"\n\nNeal Katyal, former acting solicitor general under President Obama, speculated that Trump's statement about Stone \"is genuinely looking like witness tampering,\" noting that it looks like Trump \"is genuinely melting down.\"\n\nStone, according to CNN, is claiming credit for colluding with Wikileaks during the 2016 campaign, and there is wide speculation that Mueller will indict Stone in relation to the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump rounded out his angry rant by taking a shot at Mueller himself. \"Bob Mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of Angry Democrats, don't want the truth, they only want lies,\" Trump wrote.\n\nMueller is a decorated war hero who served as head of the FBI for 10 years, and first appointed by George W. Bush. Thus far, Mueller's investigation has led to 36 federal indictments and guilty pleas from five high-ranking Trump campaign officials.\n\nTrump can no longer hide his shady past, and is now publicly lashing out for all the world to see.\n\nThis is what panic looks like.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Ross and Emond were in the Army, while Elchin was in the Air Force.\n\nAll three men were killed in Andar, Afghanistan, when their vehicle was attacked by an improvised explosive device (IED).\n\nBut that day, Trump ignored the deaths of the men, choosing instead to promote books by his biggest admirers and attack the investigation into Russian election interference on his Twitter feed.\n\nTrump hailed discredited economic pundits Stephen More and Arthur Laffer for their book \"Trumponomics.\" Trump also promoted unhinged NRA host Dan Bongino and his new book \"Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump,\" which pushes the idea that there is a \"deep state\" conspiracy against Trump.\n\nTrump also took time to reiterate his support for books from Fox News hosts Gregg Jarrett and Jeanine Pirro that whitewash Trump's unpopular and corrupt presidency.\n\nWhile ignoring the military deaths, Trump also alleged, without a shred of evidence, that \"the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts\" and complained, \"This is our Joseph McCarthy Era!\"\n\nTrump also whined about the \"illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt.\"\n\nWith close to a week passing since the men's deaths, Trump launched a multi-Tweet tirade, attacking his former personal attorney Cohen for testifying about him and praising political dirty trickster Roger Stone for his promise to never testify against Trump.\n\nTrump also managed to defend himself as being involved \"lightly\" in Russian real estate deals (a reversal from his earlier claim that he didn't do business in Russia) when it emerged that Cohen revealed some of Trump's secrets to prosecutors.\n\nBut Trump never commented on the deaths with his millions of followers on Twitter.\n\nDuring an interview with the Washington Post, reporters asked him why Americans are still fighting in Afghanistan 17 years after 9/11 and to react to the deaths.\n\nHe cited \"experts\" who supposedly told him \"if we don't go there, they're going to be fighting over here.\"\n\nOn the murdered troops, Trump merely noted, \"It's very sad. I just heard about the three people this morning. Terrible.\"\n\nTrump views his Twitter account as a way of emphasizing what he believes is important and worthy of discussion. This week that meant promoting his friends' books and fuming about the ongoing investigation of his campaign and a foreign power.\n\nWhat it didn't mean was honoring the wartime deaths of those in the military.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

And ethically challenged Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is demonstrating exactly how we can expect Trump's team to respond to actual oversight ... with churlish temper tantrums.\n\nRep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), who will likely chair the House Committee on Natural Resources in January, recently penned an op-ed calling on Zinke to resign.\n\n\"I take no pleasure in calling for [his resignation],\" Grijalva wrote.\n\nBut he laid out the case against Zinke, which includes at least 17 publicly known ethics investigations into either Zinke or his department. One of the investigations \u2014 about a sketchy land deal that could enrich Zinke and/or his family \u2014 has been referred to the Justice Department.\n\n\"We would hardly look the other way at the mayor of a small town, let alone a cabinet secretary, who faced unending ethical questions, formal investigations and substantiated claims of attempted nepotism,\" Grijalva writes.\n\nIn addition to numerous ethical lapses, Zinke \"has overseen the dumbing down of science, often with a partisan edge.\"\n\nGrijalva promised to continue looking into Zinke's unending scandals should Grijalva become chair. \"If Mr. Zinke stays, stonewalling in the belief that a cabinet secretary answers only to Trump would be a mistake,\" he warns.\n\nFaced with the prospect of actual oversight, a seemingly frightened Zinke melted down and lashed out at Grijalva with childish personal attacks.\n\n\"It's hard for him to think straight from the bottom of a bottle,\" Zinke said in an official statement. Zinke went on to accuse Grijalva of \"drunken and hostile behavior at work.\"\n\nZinke is referring to a severance package Grijalva paid out to a staffer who made allegations of drinking on the job and creating a hostile work environment.\n\nAfter personal attacks, Zinke resorted to the classic I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I defense, calling on Grijalva to resign and refund taxpayers for the money his own department had to spend investigating \"unfounded allegations.\"\n\nIf Zinke's unprofessional response is any indication, Trump's cabinet is woefully unprepared for actual oversight.\n\nTrump's cronies have breezed by with zero accountability for two years, but that all comes to an end in January.\n\nNo wonder Zinke is throwing a tantrum.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The GOP majority in Michigan wants to weaken the supervision of dark money and fraudulent charities before the new Democratic attorney general is seated.\n\nLast week, the Michigan GOP used the lame-duck session to introduce the \"Personal Privacy Protection Act.\" The name sounds benign enough, but what it really does is allow fraudulent charities to thrive and dark money to flow unmonitored. And it's already passed the Michigan Senate.\n\nIn Michigan, the Attorney General's Office has the duty to oversee the 8,000+ charities that operate in Michigan and solicit donations. The office also has the authority to shut down fraudulent charities, and the current attorney general, Bill Schuette, has done so on some occasions.\n\nHowever, something about the election of a Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel apparently has the GOP majority spooked, because they're making moves to decrease what Nessel can do.\n\nOne of the critical ways in which the attorney general can investigate potentially fraudulent charities is by being able to access the names of charity members and donors. The attorney general may also inspect the books of charities doing business in Michigan.\n\nBut the new Senate bill would make all of that information presumptively private \u2014 and much harder to get. It could only be disclosed under a warrant or a subpoena, and the attorney general would have to demonstrate a \"compelling need\" as to why they needed the info. In short, the bill will make it much harder to provide meaningful oversight.\n\nThe bill also stops both the attorney general and the secretary of state's office from making 501(c)(4) nonprofits disclose the identities of any donors, members, or supporters.\n\nThis sort of bill has a lot of support with conservatives. When California imposed a law requiring disclosure of certain donor information to register in the state, Americans for Prosperity, an organization run by the Koch brothers, opposed it. In that litigation, outgoing GOP attorney general Bill Schuette filed a brief backing AFP's insistence it shouldn't have to disclose.\n\nThere's no question this bill would make it much harder to track the dark money that funds attack ads. It would also make it tougher for the attorney general to investigate any type of charity fully.\n\nAt a time when the entire family of the president of the United States is being sued for their involvement in a clearly fraudulent charity, it should really come as no surprise that the GOP in Michigan wants to protect bad actors.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Michigan Republicans are hoping to undermine the role of newly elected Attorney General Dana Nessel in the lame-duck session.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Michigan legislature kicked off its lame-duck session by decimating the paid sick leave and minimum wage laws.\n\nThey weren't content to stop there, however. On Thursday, Republican legislator Rob VerHeulen introduced a bill that would let the legislature intervene in legal proceedings when the state is a party.\n\nAs the law stands now, the Michigan attorney general represents the interests of the state in court. The legislature can intervene in the lawsuit, but only with the permission of the judge. It's an issue now because the current Michigan attorney general, conservative Republican Bill Schuette, will be replaced on January 1 by liberal Democrat Dana Nessel.\n\nDuring the 2018 campaign, Nessel had indicated that she likely wouldn't defend a homophobic law on the books in Michigan. The state currently lets faith-based groups bar same-sex couples from adopting.\n\nSchuette was eager to defend the law, but Nessel said if she were elected, she'd tell the legislature to hire its own lawyers and defend the law on its own, because the law is patently unconstitutional and discriminatory.\n\nIf the GOP gets their way, though, they'll be able to intervene to defend the law, likely on the public dime and with no need for permission from the judge handling the case.\n\nAlthough the bill hasn't advanced yet, it was immediately praised by Republican leaders.\n\nNessel, rightly so, pointed out the bill would undermine the role of the attorney general at a time when the voters of Michigan chose a Democratic attorney general for the first time in 24 years.\n\nBut the spokesperson for the Speaker of the House, Tom Leonard, absurdly insisted that this is just \"good government reform\" that gives legislators a voice in public policy. Of course, this ignores the fact that the legislature already has a voice in public policy because it has the authority to make laws.\n\nMichigan's GOP legislators have no intention of recognizing the fact that they lost three important statewide offices: governor, attorney general, and secretary of state. Instead, they're going to continue to use the lame-duck session to impose their views, regardless of what the people of Michigan want.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A new report shows right-wing terrorism is surging under Trump's leadership \u2014 and experts say it's not a coincidence.\n\nRight-wing domestic terrorism has surged since Trump took office in January 2017, according to a new analysis of global terrorism data from the Washington Post.\n\nThe report found that there were more acts of terrorism motivated by right-wing political ideologies in 2017 than all other types of domestic terrorism combined. Out of 65 total incidents, 36 were classified as right-wing terrorism. The remaining incidents included 10 acts of left-wing terrorism, 7 acts of Islamist extremism, and 12 classified as \"other/unknown.\"\n\nWhile right-wing terrorism was already on the rise in the years leading up to Trump's presidency, the report notes that the uptick in violence carried out by right-wing attackers \"accelerated\" in 2017 and again in 2018.\n\n\"Over the past decade, attackers motivated by right-wing political ideologies have committed dozens of shootings, bombings and other acts of violence, far more than any other category of domestic extremist,\" the report says.\n\nIt went on to note that although the data on domestic terror in the U.S. show \"a decades-long drop-off in violence by left-wing groups, violence by white supremacists and other far-right attackers has been on the rise since Barack Obama's presidency \u2014 and has surged since President Trump took office.\"\n\nOverall, acts of right-wing terrorism not only occur more frequently but are also more likely to be deadly than left-wing terrorism, experts told The Post.\n\nIn 2018 alone, at least 20 people have been killed in suspected right-wing attacks, according to the analysis. In comparison, analysts only documented one fatality from an attack that may have been motivated by left-wing ideologies.\n\nDespite this, Trump continues to peddle baseless lies portraying Democrats as an \"angry left-wing mob,\" while ignoring the actual mob violence carried out by right-wing extremists like the Trump-loving Proud Boys.\n\nTerrorism researchers told the Post that right-wing violence has risen alongside \"white anxiety about Obama's Presidency\" and has \"accelerated in the Trump era.\"\n\nWhile Trump has attempted to deny his role in inspiring violence, experts say right-wing extremists believe Trump is \"offering them tacit support for their cause,\" according to the Post. And they're right \u2014 he is.\n\nNotably, Trump's presidency hasn't driven increases in the incidence of left-wing or Islamist terrorism \u2014 only right-wing terrorism.\n\nSince 2014, the total number of politically motivated domestic terror incidents has remained relatively stable, at about 20 attacks per year. At least, it was stable until Trump took office. But in just the first year of his presidency, right-wing attacks tripled from their previous annual average, causing the overall incidence of domestic terrorism to soar.\n\nThe new analysis is in line with other recent reports on extremism in the U.S., all of which point to far-right violence as the greatest threat in this area.\n\nAccording to new FBI statistics released this month, documented hate crimes rose by 17 percent in 2017, with particularly notable increases in anti-Hispanic and anti-Semitic crimes. This coincides with a study by the Anti-Defamation League, which found a 57 percent surge in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017.\n\nDuring the same time period, white supremacist murders more than doubled, making 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence.\n\nThese trends been attributed in large part to Trump's incendiary rhetoric, tacit endorsement of violence, and open embrace of far-right extremism. But while Trump's role in the rise of right-wing violence may be more out in the open, Republicans have done their part too, standing by his side as complicit co-conspirators \u2014 at best.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Gordon reportedly told a member of the platform committee\u2019s national security subcommittee that Trump directed him to support the weakening of the platform language.\n\nThe Trump campaign, however, has denied that it was involved in watering down the party\u2019s stance on Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the events in July 2016, Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Sessions had any private conversations with Kislyak during a campaign event several months earlier at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, DC.\n\nDuring questioning last year, Sessions told congressional investigators that he could not recall having any conversations with Russian officials at the April 2016 Mayflower Hotel event, but that he could not rule out the possibility that a \"brief interaction\" with Kislyak may have taken place.\n\nIt was previously reported that congressional investigators are looking into the Republican National Convention as part of their investigation into Russian interference and potential coordination with the Trump campaign, but this is the first indication that the special counsel probe is also zeroing in on the 2016 event.\n\nAs Reuters noted, despite Trump's frequent claims that collusion has been taken off the table, Mueller\u2019s focus on the events that transpired at the Republican convention indicates \"that Trump campaign contacts and actions related to Russia remain central to the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Mueller's team made the most direct link yet between the Trump campaign and Russia, revealing in a court filing that former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates knew that the Russian operative with whom he was communicating at the height of the 2016 campaign was actually a Russian intelligence agent.\n\nThat revelation came just a week after it was reported that campaign adviser and longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone had been in extensive contact with a Russian military intelligence officer working out of the agency's headquarters in Moscow.\n\nStone claims he didn't know Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian intelligence agent, but the fact remains the same: Multiple Trump campaign aides had sustained contact with Russian spies during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nNo matter how much Trump may want to deny it, his campaign is squarely in the crosshairs \u2014 and collusion is still very much on the table."

Her involvement in the Moscow deal has reportedly drawn the attention of the FBI and congressional investigators.\n\nAccording to multiple sources and documents reviewed by Buzzfeed News, Ivanka urged Cohen to work with former Olympic weightlifter Dmitry Klokov, who offered to arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin for the purpose of facilitating the construction of Trump Tower in Moscow.\n\nIvanka's outreach to Cohen occurred in November 2015, just as the presidential campaign was heating up.\n\nAccording to Buzzfeed, Cohen had at least one phone conversation with Klokov after Ivanka pushed him to work with the Russian athlete.\n\nThey also exchanged several emails, and at one point Klokov told Cohen he could set up a meeting between Putin and Trump to \"pave the way\" for construction to begin on Trump Tower in Moscow.\n\nCohen later turned down the deal and said the Trump Organization already had an agreement to built the property.\n\nEmails show that Klokov lashed out at Cohen when he cut off communication with him. Ivanka was also angry at Cohen's refusal to work with the Russian athlete, according to Buzzfeed.\n\nWhen Cohen turned down Klokov's offer to help, he had already negotiated a separate deal with Felix Sater, an associate of Trump, for a Russian developer to build the tower.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's team and congressional investigators are reportedly scrutinizing the series of events, including by reviewing emails and interrogating witnesses. Among other things, investigators want to determine how Ivanka came to know Klokov, according to Buzzfeed.\n\nWhen contacted by Buzzfeed, Klokov initially denied the existence of his emails to Cohen, and then stopped responding after he was provided with details from the email exchange.\n\nAt the time that all of this was going on, Trump was well into his presidential campaign. In October 2015, he signed a letter of intent to put his name on a tower, slated to be built by a Russian developer in Moscow.\n\nThe October 2015 deal also stated that Ivanka would be able to brand a brand spa facility in the property as \"The Spa by Ivanka Trump.\" According to Buzzfeed, the agreement stipulated that \"Ivanka would be granted 'sole and absolute discretion' to have the final say on 'all interior design elements of the spa or fitness facilities'\" at Trump Tower Moscow.\n\nThe new report provides the first solid evidence that Ivanka was in contact with a Russian figure during her father\u2019s campaign, expanding the circle of close Trump allies and family members who were working with (or attempting to work with) Russians in the midst of the presidential campaign.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is already facing scrutiny for his communications with Russian officials, including his prominent role in a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York, when he enthusiastically met with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer in an attempt to get \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile there's no evidence yet of criminal wrongdoing, the revelation that Ivanka was working with a Russian to advance her family's business interests during the campaign raises a whole new set of questions about the campaign's ties to the Kremlin \u2014 and this time, Ivanka will have to answer for them."

    "text": "New guidance says federal employees can't use the word 'resist' or mention impeachment.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration handed down a startling document. It bars nearly two million federal employees from speaking in any negative fashion about Trump, including using the word \"resist\" or \"resistance,\" or discussing impeachment. Several legal scholars say this goes much too far, and they're right.\n\nAll federal employees are subject to the Hatch Act. It restricts them from participating in partisan political campaigns while at work or appearing in any official capacity. For a long time, the Trump administration refused to enforce it against any Trump officials, even when Kellyanne Conway went on \"Fox & Friends\" to stump for Roy Moore.\n\nFinally, after Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) complained multiple times, the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) \u2014 no, not the Mueller one \u2014 found that several Trump officials had violated the act by doing things like using their official Twitter account to tweet out #MAGA and retweeting partisan research from the RNC.\n\nOf course, if the OSC was going to gently rap the knuckles of some Republicans, they were at the same time going to restrict what all federal employees could say drastically.\n\nThe OSC told all federal employees that the terms \"resistance\" and \"#resist\" are now forbidden because they have become \"inextricably linked with the electoral success (or failure) of the president.\"\n\nSimilarly, since impeachment makes someone ineligible to hold the office of the presidency, advocating for impeachment is advocating against Trump because he is already running for office.\n\nIn other words, all of these restrictions happen because Trump decided, almost immediately, that he would run for re-election, which means he's a candidate for his second term for the entirety of his first term. And, in the eyes of his administration and the OSC, that means no one can speak out about him in a negative way.\n\nCivil rights lawyers say that this is the opposite of what the Hatch Act says. The act is there to stop the Trump administration from using federal employees as campaign staff or political props. Instead, this guidance stops federal employees from having any publicly expressed opinion on the administration \u2014 which goes much too far.\n\nThe specificity of the guidance is also troubling in that it refers only to those things that are perceived as anti-Trump \u2014 impeachment and resisting \u2014 rather than a more extensive discussion of prohibitions.\n\nThe Trump administration doesn't value free speech or robust discourse. It does value suppressing the speech of millions of federal employees if they dare speak out against Trump, and this guidance shows they'll use every tool at their disposal to do so.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "In a new interview, Trump issued a chilling dog whistle to his extremist base that effectively legitimizes future violence before it occurs.\n\nIn late August, Trump issued a chilling statement warning of violence if Republicans lost their majority in Congress in the midterm elections.\n\nA little more than two months after that, Republicans did lose their majority in the House of Representatives \u2014 and now, Trump is not only warning of violence, but tacitly endorsing it.\n\nIn an Oval Office interview with The Daily Caller, a right-wing news outlet founded by Tucker Carlson, Trump on Wednesday took aim at anti-fascist (\"antifa\") activists and warned that they \"better hope that the other side doesn't mobilize.\"\n\n\"Because if they [the opposition to Antifa] do, they\u2019re much tougher. Much stronger. Potentially much more violent. And Antifa\u2019s going to be in big trouble,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump added that although \"the opposition to Antifa\" has not yet mobilized, \"[t]hey\u2019re sitting back and watching and they\u2019re getting angrier and angrier.\"\n\n\"These people, like the Antifa \u2014 they better hope that the opposition to Antifa decides not to mobilize,\" he reiterated.\n\nAntifa is a term used to describe a movement of loosely connected anti-fascist activists and groups. The anti-fascist movement can be traced at least as far back as the 1930's, when it arose to fight the spread of fascism in Europe. Since the 1970s and '80s, antifa activism has resurged in both Europe and America to combat the rise of neo-Nazism.\n\nIn recent years, the term has also been used by far-right extremists in the U.S. to demonize anyone who opposes them.\n\nTrump has taken to using the term \"antifa\" to refer to groups of protesters, activists, and Democrats \u2014 lumping together anyone and everyone on the left side of the political spectrum under one label, and then using a broad brush to paint the entire group as violent and unruly.\n\nThis is what he did in August, when he warned a group of evangelical leaders that violence would ensue if Republicans lost the majority in Congress.\n\n\"You\u2019re one election away from losing everything you\u2019ve got,\" Trump told the group of Christian leaders in a private speech that was recorded and later leaked to the press.\n\n\"They will end everything immediately,\" he said, apparently referring to Democrats. \"They will overturn everything that we\u2019ve done and they\u2019ll do it quickly and violently. And violently. There\u2019s violence. When you look at Antifa, and you look at some of these groups, these are violent people.\"\n\nThey're actually not violent people, at least not on a scale that is reflected in national statistics. According to one analysis, in more than three decades of anti-fascist activity in the U.S., only one fatality could be linked to a member of an organized antifa group.\n\nIn contrast, looking at two decades of far-right activism in the U.S., at least 670 fatalities, more than 3,000 injuries, and more than 4,400 violent attacks were attributed to members of far-right groups.\n\nUnlike far-right extremists, anti-fascist activists abide by a strategy that is defensive in nature. They don't go looking for trouble, but rather form out of necessity after being targeted and victimized by the same extremists whom Trump calls \"very fine people.\"\n\nAs one historian explained, \"Anti-fascist resistance movements arise out of actual material conditions, like being attacked by fascist gangs and paramilitary groups, so it\u2019s a self-defense response from a lot of different communities, including the leftist groups \u2014 and today it\u2019s the immigrant communities; people of color; lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people; all these communities that are the targets of fascist violence.\"\n\nBy falsely portraying antifa as dangerous and threatening to Americans \u2014 and then suggesting that the \"opposition\" to antifa may soon mobilize and respond with violence \u2014 Trump is using the same rhetorical strategy that extremists use to incite violence among their followers.\n\nKnown as stochastic terrorism, the tactic involves using pointed and suggestive language that inspires random people to carry out violent acts, but without explicitly telling them to do so.\n\nAs law professor David Cohen explained previously, \"Trump puts out the dog whistle knowing that some dog will hear it, even though he doesn\u2019t know which dog.\"\n\nIn other words, Trump doesn't have to issue a directive to his extremist supporters in order to signal his support for politically motivated violence.\n\nWith his history of calling for violence, condoning violence, and excusing violence when it's carried out by his supporters, the thinly veiled threat Trump issued Wednesday is a way of giving the go-ahead to his supporters who may be considering engaging in political violence.\n\nFurthermore, given his use of \"antifa\" to describe Democrats and others on the left side of the ideological spectrum, Trump's warning of violence against antifa could be interpreted as a tacit endorsement of violence against \"the left\" more broadly.\n\nTo make matters even worse, all of this occurs at a time when hate crimes and extremist violence are on the rise.\n\nThis isn't just a coincidence. When Trump and his Republican allies peddle conspiracy theories about antifa and push disinformation portraying Democrats and citizen protesters as unruly violent \"mobs,\" they're fueling the same narrative that extremists use to justify acts of violence against \"the left.\"\n\nNo one should be surprised when an extremist hears Trump's latest dog whistle and acts on it.\n\nHe may not be directly ordering violence, but make no mistake: Through his words \u2014 and in some cases, his deafening silence \u2014 Trump is legitimizing future violence before it takes place.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Despite what Trump claims, no one has been \"vindicated\" \u2014 far from it, actually.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Jared Kushner\u2019s efforts to secure foreign funding for his family's real estate company during the presidential transition, CNN reported on Monday.\n\nAccording to CNN, Mueller is expanding his probe beyond Russia to look at Kushner's contacts with potential foreign investors from several different countries, including China and Qatar. This is the first sign that Mueller's investigation is looking at Kushner's financial dealings with countries other than Russia.\n\nPrevious reports indicated that Mueller was focusing on Kushner's contacts with Russian officials, his relationship with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and the role he played in the Trump campaign's data operation.\n\nBut as the investigation has uncovered new leads, it has also opened up new lines of inquiry \u2014 and the latest one is centered squarely on Kushner.\n\nAccording to CNN, Mueller is honing in on Kushner's efforts to secure funding for his 666 Fifth Avenue real estate venture. Kushner divested from the project in early 2017 after years of struggling with debt from his purchase of the property for $1.8 billion in 2007.\n\nAmong other things, investigators are looking at a Nov. 16, 2016, meeting between Kushner and executives of a Chinese company that was interested in investing in 666 Fifth Avenue, as well as a meeting with a Qatari investor regarding the same property.\n\nThe watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) suggested that Kushner's significant debt could make him \u2014 and his wife, Ivanka Trump \u2014 a prime target for blackmail.\n\n\"Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump\u2019s debt increased to between $31 million to $155 million,\" CREW tweeted. \"With those sorts of financial obligations, what kind of pressure could a creditor place on them?\"\n\nAs Mueller explores Kushner's foreign financial dealings, he'll have plenty of material to work with. As a lead contact for foreign governments during the presidential transition period, Kushner told congressional investigators he had spoken to \"over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries.\"\n\nThat includes a meeting with Sergey Gorkov, chairman of a Russian state bank, in December 2016. Gorkov has said he met with Kushner because of his position as the head of Kushner Companies \u2014 contradicting Kushner's testimony that the meeting was for U.S. government purposes. This meeting is also among those that Mueller is scrutinizing.\n\nThis is just the latest sign that the investigation into Russian interference and potential coordination with the Trump campaign will not be winding down anytime soon \u2014 a reality for which the White House is quietly preparing, despite Trump's previous claims to the contrary.\n\nIt was reported in January that Mueller was also looking into Ivanka's potential knowledge of the infamous Trump Tower meeting involving Kushner, Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, as well as a Russian lobbyist and several Russian businessmen.\n\nThis comes on the heels of Friday's explosive indictment against 13 Russian nationals and 3 Russian organizations for their involvement in the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump spent all weekend having a public meltdown over news of the indictment \u2014 and after hearing about Kushner, he's unlikely to calm down down anytime soon."

    "text": "Trump hasn't nominated anyone for a key White House science post, so the position fell into the lap of a 31-year-old with no training in science.\n\nAs the U.S. faces one of the worst flu seasons in decades \u2014 on the heels of a record-breaking hurricane season \u2014 key decisions about science policy are being made by someone with no training in science.\n\nYou can thank Trump for that.\n\nHe still hasn't appointed anyone as the top science adviser for the White House, a position that has traditionally been held by prominent scientists with extensive education and experience. So the post fell into the lap of a 31-year-old politics major whose most recent job was as chief of staff for Trump ally and venture capitalist Peter Thiel.\n\nAs the de-facto head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Michael Kratsios \u2014 who holds a degree in Political Science with a concentration in Hellenic (Greek) studies \u2014 is tasked with advising the White House on decisions about matters ranging from disease outbreaks to natural disasters. He was initially brought into the White House to advise Trump on tech-related issues.\n\nTrump's failure to appoint a top science adviser leaves the nation vulnerable during times of crisis, when it's critical to have a point person who can offer objective advice informed by science. Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush both appointed physicists to fill the position.\n\n\"You need somebody who the president trusts, who can sort all that stuff out and who can explain to the president that there are all these different perspectives and here's why there are and here's what I think,\" Neal Lane, who served as science adviser under President Bill Clinton, told Scientific American.\n\n\"There is nobody like that with regards to science, technology and engineering matters, so we have a crisis, and there may be some brewing that you and I don't know even about,\" Lane continued. \"Usually they come as surprises, and that's scary.\"\n\nAs Scientific American points out, a science adviser could have helped advise Trump's decision-making during the deadly hurricanes and wildfires that ravaged the country last fall, as well as on issues such as nuclear tensions with North Korea and Iran, lead contaminated water, and outbreaks of the flu and other infectious diseases.\n\nIn one week alone in January, about 4,000 Americans died from the flu, and the death toll is expected to grow even higher in coming weeks because flu activity is still on the rise. When the ebola outbreak struck during President Obama's administration, his science adviser played a major role in guiding and coordinating outbreak prevention and control activities.\n\nTrump's adviser may still play a key role \u2014 but he doesn't appear to have the qualifications to do so competently or effectively.\n\nUnfortunately, this is par for the course for the Trump administration, where being woefully under-qualified is apparently a work requirement \u2014 even if lives may hang in the balance."

    "text": "Less than 24 hours after Trump called the Russia probe a 'hoax,' his own DOJ made clear just how real it is.\n\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is suspected of serving as a \"back channel\" between the presidential campaign and Russians seeking to interfere in the 2016 election, a lawyer for the Department of Justice revealed Thursday.\n\nThe revelation by U.S. prosecutors came during a hearing on whether special counsel Robert Mueller was within the scope of his mandate when he made the decision to indict Manafort on charges of money laundering and acting as an unregistered foreign agent.\n\nManafort\u2019s lawyers are trying to get the charges dismissed, arguing that they fall outside of Mueller\u2019s mandate to investigate \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\" of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut Manafort's quest to have the charges against him dropped ended up backfiring in a big way.\n\nIn the process of defending Mueller's investigation, a lawyer for Trump's DOJ revealed that part of the probe into Manafort is focused specifically on whether he acted as a \"back channel\" to Russia, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.\n\n\"He had long-standing ties to Russia-backed politicians,\" DOJ lawyer Michael Dreeben told U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson. \"Did they provide back channels to Russia? Investigators will naturally look at those things.\"\n\nMueller's team has previously cited Manafort's business ties to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, saying that an investigation of connections between the Trump campaign and Russia would \"naturally cover ties that a former Trump campaign manager had to Russian-associated political operatives, Russian-backed politicians, and Russian oligarchs.\"\n\nBut until now, federal prosecutors hadn't explicitly stated that they suspect Manafort of serving as a back channel for collusion with the Russian government.\n\nManafort is one of four Trump campaign advisers who have been indicted or pleaded guilty in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference and potential coordination with the Trump campaign.\n\nHe was first indicted in October on charges of conspiracy, money laundering, false statements, and failure to disclose foreign assets in relation to his work for pro-Putin Ukrainian politicians. In February, Mueller filed a new case against him, hitting him with charges for tax, financial, and bank fraud.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign aide George Papadopoulos both pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about their contacts with Russian officials, and former campaign aide Rick Gates pleaded guilty to one charge of making false statements to the FBI and one charge of conspiracy against the United States.\n\nAll three struck plea deals with Mueller's team, agreeing to cooperate and provide information to investigators.\n\nIn total, Mueller's investigation has resulted in over 100 charges against 19 people and three companies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump once again called the Russia probe a \"hoax\" and repeated his frequent cry of \"no collusion.\" Less than 24 hours later, Trump's own DOJ shot down those claims, confirming that the investigation is very, very real \u2014 and the issue of collusion is smack in the middle of it."

    "text": "Nancy Pelosi and a new Democratic majority will kick things off with a bold proposal to protect voting rights and fight corruption when they reclaim power in January.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, voters sent a clear message rejecting Republican efforts to prioritize the wealthy and privileged over regular Americans, which included the failed GOP tax scam and attempts to rip away health care from millions.\n\nBut since most Americans don't actually support Republican policies, the GOP has spent decades working to make it harder for some Americans to vote, so that the party can avoid democratic accountability.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have also steadfastly refused to hold Trump accountable for his many abuses of power, and have enabled a culture of corruption in Washington.\n\nThat's why, when Nancy Pelosi and a new Democratic majority take control of the House of Representatives in January, their top priority will be to ensure that democracy works for everyone.\n\n\"In the 116th Congress, our first order of business is giving democracy back to the people,\" Rep. Terri Sewell (D-MS) said at a Friday press conference introducing \"HR 1,\" the symbolically important first bill of the new session.\n\nHR 1 will focus on strengthening democracy, which Republicans have abandoned in their complicit acquiescence to the Trump agenda.\n\n\"We will promote national automatic voter registration, bolster our critical election infrastructure against foreign attackers, and put an end to partisan gerrymandering once and for all by establishing federal guidelines to outlaw the practice,\" Pelosi and Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD) wrote in a recent Washington Post op-ed.\n\n\"Let's make it easier, not harder, to vote in America,\" Sarbanes said at the Friday press conference.\n\nWhile Democrats believe that voting is a foundational right in a democracy, Republicans have spent years trying to deny that right to many, mainly racial minorities and young people.\n\nIn North Carolina, the GOP-controlled legislature passed a voter suppression bill so outrageous that a federal court said it targeted black Americans \"with almost surgical precision.\"\n\nIn Georgia, then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp spent years purging mostly black residents from the voter rolls, while the Republican-dominated state drastically decreased the number of polling locations in predominantly African-American neighborhoods.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court struck down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, Republicans in Congress refused to make any attempts to find a legislative solution.\n\nPaul Ryan, who is retiring this year after a disastrous tenure as House speaker, went so far as to claim that it's \"bizarre\" to actually count every vote in large states like California.\n\nUnlike Republicans, Democrats believe that every eligible voter deserves the right to vote, and that their vote should be counted.\n\nBeyond strengthening voting rights, HR 1 also seeks to protect our democracy by fighting the corruption that tilts the playing field in favor of wealthy dark money organizations.\n\nAccording to draft legislation viewed by the Washington Post, the bill will set \"new donor disclosure requirements for political organizations,\" and help strengthen the impact of small donations to political campaigns.\n\n\"Wealthy special interests shouldn\u2019t be able to buy more influence than the workers, consumers and families who should be our priority in Washington,\" Pelosi and Sarbanes wrote.\n\nThe bill tackles one more issue that Republicans blithely ignored \u2014 the rampant corruption in the Trump administration. The draft bill the Post saw includes provisions to end first-class travel for most federal employees.\n\nTrump's Cabinet is widely known for abusing the trust of taxpayers by spending millions of dollars for luxury travel, while a complicit Republican Congress did nothing to rein in the wasteful, and possibly illegal, spending.\n\nTo boost transparency, the bill will also require the president to release his or her tax returns.\n\nTrump has steadfastly refused to do this, even as questions swirl about his family's shady attempts to avoid paying taxes, and as criminals reveal Trump's financial connections to Russia during the 2016 campaign.\n\nFor the first two years of Trump's term, Republicans have given corruption free rein and refused to hold Trump accountable.\n\nThey were willing to do anything to hold onto power in Congress so that the GOP could keep handing out deficit-financed kickbacks to Wall Street billionaires and ripping health care away from children and families.\n\nDemocrats, led by Pelosi, will soon take back the reins of power and begin the process of cleaning up the mess left behind by the failed Paul Ryan and the Trump-enabling Republican Party.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Devin Nunes is refusing to comply with requests to release transcripts that appear to confirm that key witnesses lied during congressional testimony.\n\nDevin Nunes, chairman of the House intelligence committee, is best known for staging stunts to shield Trump from scrutiny in the ongoing Russia investigation. But now, Nunes is extending the cover-up to include key witnesses who may have perjured themselves while testifying before the committee.\n\nThe committee's ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, called on Nunes two weeks ago to release transcripts from all interviews they conducted related to the Russia investigation, saying they could shed \"additional light on the issues of collusion and obstruction of justice.\"\n\nSchiff also noted that it appears that some of those witnesses lied to the committee, and said special counsel Robert Mueller's team \"should consider whether perjury charges are warranted.\"\n\nBut two weeks after Schiff wrote the letter to Nunes requesting that he release the transcripts, Nunes has failed to even respond to the request, NBC News reported on Thursday.\n\nIn an interview with Mother Jones, Schiff said he has previously asked Nunes to provide Mueller's team with transcripts pertaining to specific witnesses who may have perjured themselves, but that Nunes \"would not commit to sharing this material with Mueller.\"\n\nSchiff also noted that Mueller has told the committee he is interested in scrutinizing the testimony of certain witnesses, but that it will be up to Nunes to decide whether or not to comply with any formal requests from Mueller.\n\nWhile Schiff didn't say which witnesses Mueller wants to scrutinize more closely, he told NBC News that \"the testimony of Don Jr., Erik Prince, Roger Stone and others is inconsistent with the public reports of meetings, conversations and other facts that have now been established.\"\n\n\"And so if those public reports are accurate, then clearly they were not telling the truth,\" Schiff added.\n\nIndeed, recent reports suggest that Don Jr. may have lied to Congress repeatedly when discussing the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer promising \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton. Among other things, Don Jr. failed to disclose his father\u2019s involvement in crafting a misleading statement meant to deceive the public about the true purpose of the meeting.\n\nAnother recent report calls into question the testimony of Trump ally and Blackwater founder Erik Prince, who told Congress in November 2017 that he had no formal communication or contact with the Trump campaign.\n\nAs it turns out, Prince actually attended the August 2016 Trump Tower meeting with key campaign aides and an Israeli social media specialist offering a \"multimillion-dollar proposal for a social media manipulation effort\" to help Trump win.\n\nMeanwhile, longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone appears to have lied to the committee about his contact with WikiLeaks when he testified that his only communication took place through an intermediary. After he gave that testimony, the Atlantic published a series of direct messages between Stone and WikiLeaks from October 2016.\n\nSchiff wants answers about these discrepancies, but Nunes apparently isn't interested in finding out the truth or holding these witnesses accountable for potentially committing perjury.\n\nThis is not the first time Republicans have shut down efforts by Schiff and his Democratic colleagues to release transcripts from interviews with key witnesses.\n\nWhen Republicans unilaterally shut down the committee's Russia probe and released an incomplete and widely criticized report on the findings in April, Democrats pushed to include transcripts from interviews with more than 60 witnesses.\n\nHowever, despite publicly stating that they supported the release of the transcripts, Republicans voted to block the move.\n\nSchiff told NBC News that he thinks Republicans want to keep the transcripts under wraps because they don't want the public to see how often they \"acted as defense lawyers for the president rather than true investigators.\"\n\n\"Apparently the public will have to wait until the majority changes to see what kind of investigation the majority was doing,\" Schiff said.\n\n\"I think probably the reason why the Republicans decided to renege on their commitment is, the transcripts reveal among other things how often the majority acted as defense lawyers for the president rather than true investigators,\" he said. \"And I think they\u2019re embarrassed by that.\"\n\nAnd they should be embarrassed.\n\nWhen House intel Republicans claimed in their report that they found \"no evidence of collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russia, they did so without even interviewing a host of key witnesses, including four Trump associates who are under indictment by special counsel Mueller.\n\nThe GOP-led panel also ignored evidence that the NRA may have served as a conduit between the Trump campaign and Russia, and failed to look at evidence showing that a key Trump associate was in contact with an operative working for Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency.\n\nAnd now, in the face of evidence that appears to confirm that several of the witnesses they did interview lied during their testimony, Nunes and his fellow Trump sycophants are refusing to even look into the matter.\n\nThis, of course, raises a simple but crucial question: What are Republicans so afraid of finding that they don't even want to look?"

    "text": "Rep. Kevin McCarthy pushed his fellow California Republicans to fall in line with Trump. That was a huge mistake.\n\nDemocrats obliterated California Republicans in the 2018 midterms, ousting half of the state's GOP congressional delegation.\n\nSo it's pretty remarkable that Republicans picked as their new leader California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who helped seven Republicans in his home state lose their seats this cycle.\n\n\"The GOP's losses, highlighting a terrible midterm election for long-suffering California Republicans, have caused some to question McCarthy's judgment,\" the L.A. Times reports.\n\nMcCarthy has prostrated himself before the altar of Trump, becoming such a sycophant that Trump regularly calls him \"my Kevin.\"\n\nWhile McCarthy himself is in a safe deep-red district, Trump has become increasingly unpopular in California. But McCarthy ignored these trends and cajoled fellow California Republicans to hop on the Trump bandwagon.\n\nThe L.A. Times notes that McCarthy \"helped round up the votes to narrowly pass\" the GOP's attempt to rip health care away from millions of families \u2014 including several California Republicans who faced tough re-election fights.\n\nThat vote, along with the decision of many California Republicans to support the massively unpopular GOP tax scam, proved pivotal in a year when Democrats focused the campaign on health care issues.\n\n\"His ability to command unwavering loyalty from his California colleagues on issues such as healthcare, gun control and an unpopular tax bill bolstered the Bakersfield Republican on Capitol Hill and raised his stock with Trump,\" the Times reports. \"But it may have helped decimate his home-state delegation.\"\n\nIn California's 25th Congressional District, Democrat Katie Hill used her own personal experience with medical debt to hammer Republican Rep. Steve Knight, who obediently lined up behind McCarthy and Trump in voting to sabotage health care.\n\nIn Orange County, Democrat Katie Porter told the story of her own emergency appendectomy during the campaign to explain the dangers of Rep. Mimi Walters' vote to deny health care to millions of California families.\n\nMcCarthy had personally recruited Walters to run, according to the Times, only to see her ousted after two short terms. He even helped raise $5 million for his fellow California Republicans.\n\nBut in the end, California voters wanted representatives who looked out for their best interests \u2014 not Trump loyalists who would turn their back on their own constituents if McCarthy asked them to.\n\n\"The irony,\" the Times observed, \"is that in securing his position as the top House Republican, McCarthy may have helped ensure there will be fewer from California to serve alongside him.\"\n\nA defeated Republican Party will be led by a man who helped push them into the minority.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Cory Gardner, has already picked up a Democratic challenger.\n\n\"It's time for a new voice in the U.S. Senate,\" Lorena Garcia said in a statement announcing her candidacy. \"I'm running because we need innovative leaders who will work on behalf of the interests of every Coloradan, not for political self-interest,\" she added.\n\nRepublican insiders are already worried about Gardner's prospects, even though the election is two years away. His staunch loyalty to Trump, including his vote to rip away health care protections from individuals with pre-existing conditions, could hurt his chances in a state that increasingly supports Democrats.\n\nColorado voters backed President Obama twice, and supported Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.\n\nIn the 2018 midterm, Colorado voters ousted Republicans from control of the state Senate, and they elected Democrat Jared Polis as the nation's first openly gay governor.\n\nTwo outlets that keep a close eye on congressional races, Roll Call and the Hill, call Gardner one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the country.\n\nWhile Garcia was the first to formally announce her bid, the Denver Post notes several other Democrats could compete with her to earn the opportunity to challenge Gardner.\n\nPolitical insiders are keeping their eye on four potential candidates: Colorado House Speaker Crisanta Duran, former state Sen. Mike Johnston, U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter, and Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\n\"It's going to be a crowded field,\" Ian Silverii, executive director of Progress Now Colorado, told the Post.\n\nRepublicans are already showing signs of weakness ahead of 2020. In Mississippi, a racist, confederate-loving Trump loyalist won by less than 8 points in a deep-red Mississippi special election.\n\nIn the West, Democrats can build on the momentum from 2018. In the midterm, Democrats ousted Sen. Dean Heller from Nevada, and elected Kyrsten Sinema to fill retiring Sen. Jeff Flake's seat.\n\nThe Democrats' path to a Senate majority runs through Colorado, and less than a month after the 2018 midterms, candidates are already lining up to oust Gardner.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "It only took one day of the lame-duck session for Michigan Republicans to start gutting the state's paid sick leave and minimum wage laws.\n\nThe Michigan legislature began its lame-duck session on Tuesday. By Wednesday afternoon, the GOP-controlled state Senate had completely decimated the state's paid sick leave and mandatory minimum wage laws.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, since the GOP was telling everyone this was exactly what they were going to do.\n\nBack in September, they took the choice away from voters who organized for a minimum wage and sick leave by passing their own bills instead of letting the issues be decided by ballot. After they did so, they immediately announced they would hobble the bills during the lame-duck session \u2014 or entirely overturn them.\n\nThe minimum wage law took a huge hit, and the existing law wasn't all that great to begin with. The law passed in September was set to go into effect in March 2019. At that time, it would raise the minimum wage for tipped workers to the level of the regular minimum wage. It would then have raised the minimum wage to a very modest $12 per hour by 2022.\n\nThe bill that just cleared the Senate Government Operations Committee takes until 2030 to raise the minimum wage to $12, and it keeps tipped workers at the lower minimum wage. Taking 11 years to raise the minimum wage from $9.25 to $12 is a disgrace and a slap in the face to the 373,000 Michigan residents that asked for the initiative to be on the ballot.\n\nThe sick leave law didn't fare any better. The existing law would have required employers to provide one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours of work, or 72 hours per year. Businesses with fewer than 10 employees would only have needed to make 40 of those 72 hours paid leave.\n\nUnder the new proposal, employees would only earn one hour of sick time for every 40 hours worked and employers could cap paid sick leave at 36 hours per year. Additionally, the bill drastically circumscribes who is covered. The existing law covered every employee, albeit with some changes for very small businesses. The proposed law exempts all businesses with fewer than 50 employees.\n\nThere's still a bit of hope for Michigan citizens who wanted these protections: The bills have to clear Michigan's House and they have to be signed by current governor Rick Snyder. Michiganders can still try to get their government to recognize their wishes, even as Republicans seem to be determined to ignore them.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Ryan went on to say, \"There are a lot of races there we should have won.\"\n\nRyan continued to make wild accusations to imply wrongdoing.\n\n\"The way the absentee-ballot program used to work, and the way it works now, it seems pretty loosey goose,\" Ryan said. \"When you have candidates who win the absentee ballot vote and then lose three weeks later because of provisionals, that's really bizarre. I just think that's a very, very strange outcome.\"\n\nBut in California, the laws are written to give as many people as possible the chance to vote. For example, voters in California can mail in their ballot on Election Day. In addition, voters can register to vote and cast a ballot on Election Day, giving more people the opportunity to participate in democracy. Counting and verifying all the votes takes time. These are \"bizarre\" concepts to Ryan.\n\nIt's possible this seems \"strange\" to Ryan and Republicans because their party often relies on extreme forms of voter suppression and gerrymandering to win elections (Georgia's racist new governor, Brian Kemp, is a prime example).\n\nUnlike Republicans, Democrats around the country, including in California, encourage black Americans and other minorities to vote, rather than putting up barriers to participation.\n\nWhat's \"bizarre\" and \"very, very strange\" to Ryan \u2014 the principle of protecting the right to vote, and then counting every vote \u2014 is actually a bedrock of democracy.\n\nCalifornia's Secretary of State Alex Padilla simply wants to ensure that \"all voices can be heard in the political process,\" even if it takes a little longer to count the votes, he told the Hill.\n\nAnd when all those voices were heard in California, Republicans got fairly well annihilated.\n\nBut voters did indeed reject Ryan and his far-right agenda, which is why California's 14-member Republican delegation was cut in half.\n\nWhen Congress reconvenes in January, Democrats will control 46 of California's 53 House seats. Democrats won all seven of the most competitive House races in the state.\n\nThere's nothing strange about this. It's just democracy at work.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump loves to spread conspiracy theories about nonexistent voter fraud \u2014 but he's shutting up about evidence of actual voter fraud in North Carolina that may have helped a Republican candidate.\n\nEvidence is mounting that voter fraud may have benefitted a Republican congressional candidate in North Carolina.\n\nYet despite Trump's obsession with voter fraud, he is suddenly silent now that his own party \u2014 and a candidate he personally endorsed \u2014 might be in trouble for it.\n\nMark Harris declared victory after vote tallies showed him leading Democrat Dan McCready by a narrow 905-vote margin in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District.\n\nBut the state board of elections has now twice declined to certify these results due to serious concerns about voting irregularities. And the Associated Press has officially revoked its projection that Harris had won, making the race once again \"too close to call.\"\n\nThe board of elections will be holding an evidentiary hearing \"to assure that the election is determined without taint,\" said Joshua Malcolm, vice chairman of the North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement.\n\nThere is a lot to investigate \u2014 including shocking allegations that someone associated with the Harris campaign coordinated an effort to either throw away or fraudulently fill in absentee ballots cast by Democratic voters.\n\nThis isn't the same kind of \"voter fraud\" that Trump and Republicans love to spread conpsiracy theories about. They claim that in-person voter fraud is rampant \u2014 but in reality, it's so rare that it's practically nonexistent.\n\nAbsentee ballot fraud, on the other hand, does happen and is a very real threat to election integrity.\n\nJust two weeks before the election, Trump was in the state campaigning for Harris and attacking his Democratic opponent.\n\nTrump has often fearmongered over voter fraud. In a pre-election message, he wrote, \"Cheat at your own peril. Violators will be subject to maximum penalties, both civil and criminal!\"\n\nTrump also shamelessly lied by claiming that illegal voting is the only reason he got 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton in 2016. He even set up a government-funded effort to try to prove this alleged fraud, a crusade that collapsed in scandal and humiliation.\n\nYet now that there's a real example of voter fraud, with strong evidence that it may have swayed an election, Trump has nothing to say.\n\nOf particular concern in North Carolina are the votes in Bladen County, where Harris received 61 percent of the absentee votes even though only 19 percent of those who submitted absentee ballots were Republicans. 39 percent of the ballots came from unaffiliated voters.\n\nMichael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College, analyzed the results and told the Charlotte Observer that it would be \"pretty astonishing\" if every single one of those unaffiliated voters actually voted Republican.\n\n\"If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s a very concerted effort to use that method to one candidate\u2019s advantage,\" he said. \"But at that level there\u2019s something else beyond a concerted effort that could be at work.\"\n\nSeveral voters provided notarized affidavits alleging suspicious behavior from people who claimed to be authorized to collect absentee ballots, but who may have really been operatives for Harris' campaign.\n\nDatesha Montgomery said that a woman came to her house and told her she was collecting absentee ballots. When Montgomery told the woman she had voted for two candidates in non-congressional races, the woman told her \"the others were not important,\" collected Montgomery's signed ballot, and said she would finish it herself.\n\nEmma Shipman also had an encounter with a woman who presented herself as an absentee ballot collector without providing any proof of the claim.\n\nOthers reported that they received absentee ballots by mail that they never requested. In Bladen, requests for absentee ballots were unusually high \u2014 7.5 percent of registered voters, compared to just 3 percent in most North Carolina counties.\n\nThis is a lot of evidence that something irregular happened in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District.\n\nBut because these irregularities benefited his fellow Republican, Trump is ignoring them \u2014 and railing instead against the totally imaginary kinds of voter fraud.\n\nOther prominent Republicans, like outgoing Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, have also recently chimed in to promote a Trump-style conspiracy theory accusing Democrats of stealing elections after the GOP was crushed in the midterms.\n\nRyan hasn't said anything about North Carolina either.\n\nRepublicans are under the legal microscope for election fraud that may have benefitted a candidate Trump personally backed. But despite leaping to wild conclusions about voter fraud on multiple occasions, Trump is now suspiciously silent.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

TJ Cox has defeated Republican Rep. David Valadao in California, bringing the net gain for Democrats up to 40 House seats.\n\nValadao's defeat also adds further decimation to California's Republican Party, being the seventh Republican to lose their seat this election cycle.\n\nDemocrats are welcoming a cadre of new members, which includes a record number of women, whereas the number of Republican women has decreased.\n\nPreparations are already underway for Democrats to take over control of the House of Representatives.\n\nCalifornia's Nancy Pelosi won the overwhelming support of the Democratic Caucus to be House speaker in January. In fact, Pelosi received more support from her caucus this year than failed faux-wonk Speaker Paul Ryan received from Republicans a few years ago.\n\nDemocrats ran on a positive message of protecting access to affordable health care and creating a better economy for middle-class families, rather than kowtowing to the wealthy and Wall Street billionaires like Republican. And Democrats also promised to hold Trump and his unethical cabinet accountable, vowing to clean up the culture of corruption Republicans have complicity embraced.\n\nAs this final House race is called, the cataclysmic losses of Republicans across the country are coming into clearer focus.\n\nIn addition to a net gain of 40 House seats, Democrats flipped Senate seats in Nevada and Arizona, and held on to seats in deep-red states like Montana and West Virginia. With Democrats facing a daunting Senate map this cycle, the Senate went from 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats at the beginning of 2017 to 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats at the beginning of 2019.\n\nOn the state level, Democrats flipped control of seven governor's mansions, including in the Midwest (Michigan and Wisconsin) and even in deep-red Kansas.\n\nDuring 2017 and 2018, Democrats flipped 393 state legislative seats and created eight new Democratic majorities, according to Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC).\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans flipped control of zero governors' mansions and zero state legislative chambers.\n\nVoters overwhelmingly made their preferences known, and Democrats across the country are prepared to bring about progressive policies, from Congress to the statehouse.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The statement was the latest in a series of announcements about the summit, which has seen Trump go back and forth on whether he will speak to Russia.\n\nDespite Trump's announcement, the Kremlin said Putin would have a brief, impromptu meeting with Trump at the summit.\n\nReacting to the Kremlin statement, a White House official told reporters traveling with Trump that \"there is no scheduled pull aside.\"\n\nBut since Trump has assumed the presidency, repeated assurances from him and his team that Trump is the one in charge of the relationship have collapsed under Russian pressure.\n\nJust a few months ago, Trump gave America a black eye by standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Putin, and denigrating findings from American law enforcement that Russia interfered in the presidential election.\n\nWhen he first met with Putin, the Russian dominated Trump, and in return Trump shook his hand and warmly slapped him on the back.\n\nTrump cited the recent clash between Russia and Ukraine for cancelling the G-20 meeting. But Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) pointed out in a television interview that Russia's aggression was well-known back when Trump had declared he would meet with the autocrat. \"This president showed no inclination to step away from the meeting with Putin,\" Warner said.\n\nThe Russian government publicly scoffed at Trump's excuse.

Cohen has reportedly spent over 70 hours interviewing with Mueller's team, telling them about Trump's exploits \u2014 including his ties to Russia.\n\nThe origin of the on-again, off-again G-20 meeting has its roots in Russian dominance of Trump as well. National security adviser John Bolton first said meetings with Putin would be postponed until 2019, due to the ongoing investigations of Russian interference.\n\nBut then when Putin said he wanted to meet with Trump before the end of the year, the administration quickly buckled to Russia.\n\nTrump wants the world to believe he has the upper hand when dealing with Putin and Russia.

James Lankford insists charging U.S. taxpayers $5 billion for Trump's pet project is no big deal.\n\nAfter years of Trump's claims that Mexico will pay for a border wall, Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) now says it is \"not excessive\" for American taxpayers to pay $5 billion for the useless structure.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have been pushing for cuts to Social Security to make up for tax cuts given to the ultra rich.\n\nTrump has insisted that $5 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds be allocated for the border wall, risking a second shutdown of the government.\n\nAppearing on CNN, Sen. Lankford was asked about Trump's demands.\n\nHe replied, \"The big drama is about the border wall funding, a 5-billion-dollar amount is not an excessive amount for what can be done reasonably in a year.\"\n\nThe decision to put taxpayers on the hook is an about-face for Republicans, who campaigned with Trump on the claim that the wall would be built and financed by Mexico.\n\nAfter Trump assumed the presidency, the Mexican government made it abundantly clear it would not be funding the construction of the wall. The Mexican foreign ministry said in a statement, \"Our country will not pay, under any circumstances, for a wall or physical barrier built on US territory along the Mexican border.\"\n\nThe wall has never made any sense, except as a symbol of the Republican Party's embrace of racism and bigotry.\n\nThe new demand that taxpayers pay for the structure comes just a few weeks after the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, called for cuts to Social Security to fund the gaps created by the party's failed tax scam.\n\nLankford's rhetoric shows that his party's misplaced priorities favor hurting average Americans while wasting money on projects motivated by bigotry.\n\nThe wall doesn't make any sense and Mexico isn't paying for it, but Republicans want to waste billions of dollars on it anyway.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) abandoned her 'moderate' reputation to fully embrace the Trump agenda of disenfranchising black Americans.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-ME) is backing one of the most divisive and racist judges Trump has ever nominated for the federal bench.\n\nWith this move, Collins is abandoning all pretenses of being a moderate and proving that she fully embraces the sordid Trump agenda.\n\nThomas Farr has engaged in a \"lifetime crusade to disenfranchise African-Americans and deprive them of their rights,\" Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau, told NBC News.\n\nSo naturally, Trump nominated him for a seat on a federal court.\n\nBy supporting Farr's nomination, Collins is standing with Trump and against the voting rights of millions of African-Americans.\n\nAs a North Carolina attorney, Farr played a key role in drafting a racist North Carolina voter ID law that, according to a federal appeals court, was written to disenfranchise black voters \"with almost surgical precision.\"\n\nFarr also defended racially gerrymandered districts, which multiple courts struck down as illegal.\n\nAs far back as 1990, Farr was an attorney for the re-election campaign of notorious racist Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC). That year, the Helms campaign sent out 120,000 postcards to primarily black voters which were \"intended to intimidate them from voting,\" according to NBC News. Farr denies any knowledge of the activity.\n\n\"It is no exaggeration to say that had the White House deliberately sought to identify an attorney in North Carolina with a more hostile record on African-American voting rights and workers' rights than Thomas Farr, it could hardly have done so,\" the Congressional Black Caucus wrote to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nThis is the type of person Collins wants to give a lifetime appointment to a federal court.\n\nCollins' unequivocal support for such an awful Trump nominee should come as no surprise, though. After all, she offered a full-throated defense of alleged sexual predator and raging right-wing partisan Brett Kavanaugh, giving the Trump nominee a crucial swing vote to send him to the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter a disastrous midterm election for the GOP, Collins will be the only Republican from New England returning to Congress in January.\n\nLoyalty to Trump doesn't seem to go over well with New England voters. And with Democrats eyeing Maine in 2020, when Collins is up for re-election, she might find that out the hard way.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is expected to extend the deployment of troops to the southern border until January.\n\nIn the midst of World War II, Bing Crosby recorded the song \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" about soldiers in Europe longing to be with their family for the holiday. At that time, Americans were fighting Nazis.\n\nFast-forward to 2018, and Trump (who coddles Nazis) is forcing troops to be separated from their families during the holidays \u2014 but not for any noble cause.\n\nAccording to NPR, Trump is expected to prolong the deployment of thousands of troops along the southern border into January.\n\nThe troops were originally supposed to come home no later than Dec. 15, and the Pentagon recently indicated that everything was on schedule for servicemembers to come home soon.\n\nInstead of spending time with their families at either Thanksgiving or Christmas, troops are shoveling horse manure out of border patrol horse stalls. The Pentagon reports that the deployment is a giant waste of resources and \"a morale killer to boot,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nThe deployment was part of a racist pre-election border stunt from Trump, meant to gin up xenophobia and encourage the Republican base to go vote.\n\nThe ploy failed spectacularly, as Democrats are now on pace to pick up 40 House seats.\n\nBut Trump isn't giving up on the charade. And since he already showed a callous indifference to using troops as a political prop over Thanksgiving, it's not a surprise that he would be willing to do the same over Christmas and New Year's.\n\n\u201cThe reason Donald Trump has no problem wasting military resources and keeping troops away from their families, for a political stunt, is that he doesn\u2019t respect them or their service,\" Will Fischer, director of government relations for VoteVets, told Shareblue Media in a statement. \"It\u2019s beyond insulting to those who have or who are currently serving in uniform.\"\n\nNPR also reports that the extension \"comes days after U.S. agents fired tear gas at migrants who tried to cross into the United States from Tijuana, Mexico, on Sunday.\"\n\nTrump's use of chemical weapons against families with small children earned a rebuke from the American Academy of Pediatrics, but a gleeful response from members of the Trump administration.\n\nInstead of letting military servicemembers spend well-earned time with their families over the holidays, Trump is forcing them to waste time putting up fences and shoveling horse manure while border patrol agents fire tear gas, and possibly use lethal force, against refugee families fleeing violence.\n\nAnd the Christmas story itself, of course, is about a refugee family fleeing violence.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The group was \"stunned and shaken\" at images of families with young children, many of whom are seeking asylum, on the receiving end of U.S.-launched tear gas.\n\nUsing chemical weapons against infants and toddlers in diapers \"goes against evidence-based recommendations, and threatens their short and long-term health,\" the group says.\n\nChildren are smaller and breathe more rapidly than adults, which combines to \"magnif[y] the harm of agents such as tear gas,\" the AAP says, explaining the science behind their objection to the Trump administration's attack on children.\n\nIn addition to the physical harm, the AAP is worried about the psychological ramifications of Trump's xenophobic anti-immigrant stance.\n\n\"Many of these children are fleeing conditions that threaten their health and safety; they have taken harrowing journeys to seek refuge in our country,\" the group says. \"Our government must take extra precautions when it comes to children.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the Trump administration has shown a callous disregard for the well-being of children.\n\nOver the summer, Trump's anti-immigrant deterrence plan consisted of ripping children away from their families for weeks and even months. Even though the administration knew of the potential harms, Trump pressed forward with the family separation policy anyway.\n\nUnlike the Trump administration, the AAP \"recommends that all immigrant children and families seeking safe haven are treated with dignity and respect to protect their health and well-being.\"\n\nUsing tear gas on children shocks the conscience, and Trump's regime needs to listen to pleas of pediatricians and stop these inhumane activities.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Judges he worked with \"made clear that this was an unprecedented attack on the justice system.\"\n\nAfter voicing concerns to his supervisors, De Girolamo ultimately resigned, \"unwilling to continue to lend credence to this compromised system.\"\n\nAn immigrant himself, he refused to help a \"a campaign that hurts many of my fellow immigrants in the process.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The cruelty never stopped.\n\nAfter worldwide outrage, the Trump administration claimed it was ending its cruel practice of separating children from their parents at the border.\n\nBut this was a lie, according to a new investigation from ProPublica. Instead of the old \"zero tolerance\" policy that caused so much controversy, now Trump officials are quietly \"using whatever justification they can find, with or without substantiation, to deem immigrant parents unfit or unsafe,\" ProPublica reports.\n\nOne a parent has been so labeled, agents are wasting no time taking their children away.\n\n\"If the authorities have even the most specious evidence that a parent was a gang member, or had some kind of blemish on their record, anything they can come up with to say that the separation is for the health and welfare of the child, then they\u2019ll separate them,\" Neha Desai, a senior attorney at the National Center for Youth Law, told ProPublica.\n\nDuring the summer of 2018, the Trump administration ripped thousands of families apart in a cruel effort to deter immigration. Their unconscionable efforts sparked global outrage and even comparisons to Nazi concentration camps. But rather than stop the practice, the Trump administration decided to engage in shady efforts to continue it.\n\nOver the past few months, lawyers for Catholic Charities have discovered more than a dozen new instances of family separation.\n\nAlarmingly, these discoveries were made by chance. That means we can't be sure just how many families have been newly ripped apart \u2014 months after a judge ordered the Trump administration to reunite the families who had already been separated.\n\nAnd the consequences for these families are heartbreaking.\n\nJulio, a 27-year-old father, told ProPublica that his 4-year-old son, Brayan, was literally yanked screaming from his grasp by border agents.\n\n\"I failed him,\" Julio, a 27 year-old father, said through sobs. \"Everything I had done to be a good father was destroyed in an instant.\"\n\nAs required by U.S. law, Julio and Brayan presented themselves to border agents to claim asylum. Julio even had a letter from a lawyer in El Salvador explaining that he and Brayan were fleeing attacks and threats from gangs.\n\nJulio passed a credible fear interview with an asylum officer, including a statement from the officer which \"indicated that she had been provided no derogatory information or criminal records that would automatically bar Julio from winning asylum,\" according to ProPublica.\n\nYet border patrol agents still ripped Brayan away from Julio because they claim, without providing any evidence, that Julio \u2014 who left his home country to flee gang violence \u2014 is actually himself affiliated with the violent MS-13 gang.\n\nAnd the agency refuses to share any of its supposed evidence with Julio's lawyer.\n\n\"I'm furious about this. They aren't playing by the rules,\" Georgia Evangelista, Julio's lawyer, told ProPublica, referring to U.S. immigration authorities. \"They're treating him like a criminal so they can justify taking away his son. Where's the proof?\"\n\nAfter agents tore Brayan away, they put him on a plane and sent him to a temporary foster care agency in New York \u2014 without informing his future caretakers that this 4-year-old had been separated from his father.\n\nUntil ProPublica stumbled upon Brayan's case by chance, Brayan's lawyer didn't even know that the child had been separated.\n\nAfter massive political pressure over the summer, Trump reluctantly signed a sham executive order pledging to stop the practice of family separation.\n\nBut as Shareblue reported at the time, this executive order actually left \"huge loopholes\" for the administration to do exactly what ProPublica has found: Using flimsy excuses to justify separating families.\n\nFrom tearing families apart to using chemical weapons against toddlers, the Trump administration's cruelty towards immigrants truly knows no bounds.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Manafort seemingly blew his plea deal by repeatedly lying to the special counsel's office, and then news broke that he had visited Julian Assange of Wikileaks during the 2016 election.\n\nBut in light of today's news that Manafort's lawyers were feeding information about the investigation to Trump's lawyers all along, things look quite a bit different.\n\nIt seemed odd, given Manafort's devotion to Trump (and to Russian oligarchs), when Manafort took a plea deal back in September. But now it looks like that plea deal might not have been the betrayal it first seemed.\n\nIn fact, Manafort may have acted as a sort of mole for Trump, pretending to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller just so that he could get inside information on how the probe was working.\n\nFor the last two months, Manafort has kept Trump apprised of specific things Mueller has asked about, including whether Trump knew about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian nationals. Trump continues to insist he didn't know about this meeting, even though his son, his campaign manager, and his son-in-law attended in an attempt to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nAlthough Trump and Manafort have a joint defense agreement that allows them to share such information, those agreements are typically pulled when someone pleads guilty. If a defendant wants to show the prosecutor that they have good intentions and are forthcoming, they'll terminate an arrangement that allowed them to share information with someone who is also a subject of the investigation.\n\nBut Rudy Giuliani, ever the amoral defender of Trump, said this highly unusual arrangement was just fine because it was a source of \"valuable insights\" into the investigation.\n\nGetting that sort of inside information explains why Trump claimed to have insights into the questioning of Manafort, tweeting that the inner workings of the investigation were a mess and that investigators were treating people \"horribly and viciously.\"\n\nIt's possible that all of this is happening because Trump has promised a pardon to Manafort. Indeed, even before his first trial, Manafort appeared pretty confident that Trump would grant him a pardon. And today, Trump said such a pardon was not off the table.\n\nLegal experts have pointed out that this arrangement \u2014 Manafort feeds Trump helpful info because Trump has possibly dangled a pardon in front of him \u2014 may be its own form of obstruction. If Trump's goal was to use a promised pardon to influence Manafort's cooperation with the special counsel, that might be witness tampering.\n\nFor a few months, it looked like Manafort might have decided to do the right thing and cooperate, regardless of his motivation to do so.\n\nNow, perhaps with the promise of a pardon, it looks like he remained a loyal soldier \u2014 and a Trump mole \u2014 all along.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Michigan Republicans say employers need protection from the state's sick leave law.\n\nAs the lame-duck legislative session begins, Michigan Republicans are working to kill the newly passed sick leave law, and it's all because business groups don't like it.\n\nA progressive group in Michigan collected 380,000 signatures to get a sick leave measure on the ballot in the 2018 election. The GOP-controlled legislature took that choice away from the voters, instead passing their own sick leave bill that they vowed to undermine immediately after the midterms.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof complained, \"We need to make it more acceptable to the business community, so we keep our economy on track. We don't want to put a roadblock or hindrance in their way.\"\n\nThe existing sick leave law is modest, requiring one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours of work, for a total of 72 hours per year. Smaller businesses have to provide the same amount of hours, but only 40 of those hours must be paid. So, the law already takes into account the challenges smaller employers may face.\n\nThat's not good enough for Republicans like Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard. In explaining why more accommodations for businesses need to be made, Leonard's spokesperson, Gideon D'Assandro, made an argument that willfully misunderstands how sick leave works: \"Let's say you've got a landscaping company with four employees and two of them call in sick. You've got to shut down for the day.\"\n\nIn the world of the Michigan GOP, paid sick leave isn't an option they can even understand. Republicans want to make people work even when they are sick. And they want to penalize people who take sick days by making those days unpaid. Both are designed to do nothing except punish workers, particularly those at low-wage and part-time jobs.\n\nExperts, including doctors, agree sick leave is a necessity, not a frivolity. It ensures a healthy workforce because people don't come to work while ill, risking spreading illness. It ensures healthy and strong families, as parents are available to care for their children.\n\nBusiness groups, however, have seen these basic rights as disruptions, complaining about things like needing to change their payroll systems to accommodate sick leave payouts. They also complain about the \"regulatory burden\" of the bill \u2014 a burden that seems to be limited to businesses being required to keep track of hours worked and sick leave granted.\n\nMichigan Republicans clearly believe that employers must be protected from the slightest inconvenience, while workers must shoulder the burden of working while sick or losing a job for calling in sick.\n\nIf the GOP has their way, the lame-duck session is yet another opportunity to swing the pendulum entirely towards employers again.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Now Trump is attacking the company and hurting its stock price.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to attack General Motors (GM) a day after the company announced that it will be cutting thousands of jobs amid Trump's disastrous trade war.\n\nGM has announced that about 14,000 factory and white-collar workers in North America are slated to be laid off, and that the company may close five plants. The company also said it would phase out production of the gas-electric hybrid Chevrolet Volt.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the move is part of larger restructuring \"as GM prepares for the next economic downturn, shifting trade agreements under the Trump administration, and potential tariffs on imported automobiles.\"\n\nThe tariffs Trump has imposed on imported steel have reportedly cost GM $1 billion, just one example of major financial losses in multiple industries caused by Trump's poorly thought out fiscal and trade policies.\n\nOne of the plants that might close is in Warren, Michigan, the site of a Trump rally in 2016. At that event Trump promised supporters that if he won the election, \"you won't lose one plant.\"\n\nBut rather than reconsider his bad decisions or apologize for his broken promises, Trump attacked GM on Twitter.\n\n\"Very disappointed with General Motors and their CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan and Maryland,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThen he threatened, \"We are now looking at cutting all @GM subsidies, including or electric cars.\"\n\nShares in GM dropped on the stock market following Trump's tirade.\n\nIronically, Trump also wrote as part of his attack, \"The U.S. saved General Motors, and this is the THANKS we get!\"\n\nBut the rescue of GM was engineered under President Barack Obama and was widely criticized by Republicans at the time. Failed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney infamously wrote an op-ed arguing that the U.S. should \"let Detroit go bankrupt.\"\n\nTrump himself also criticized \"Obama's auto bailout,\" as he put it in a 2012 tweet that claimed the bailout was \"creating jobs in China\" and \"ruining American industry.\"\n\nBut with his attacks on a major American business and his reckless trade policies, it looks like Trump is the one trying to ruin American industry.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "GOP legislators are looking to undermine a sick leave law during Michigan's lame-duck legislative session, regardless of what voters want.\n\nBy electing progressive, pro-labor Gretchen Whitmer as governor, Michigan voters sent a decisive message that they favored the sort of values Whitmer ran on, including more rights for workers.\n\nBut that message isn't sitting well with the conservative majority in the Michigan legislature. Led by the state Senate's Republican majority leader Arlan B. Meekhof, the Michigan GOP is targeting the state's sick leave law ahead of Whitmer taking office in January 2019.\n\nPrior to the 2018 midterm election, voters had gathered enough signatures to get a sick leave measure on the ballot. Fearing what voters actually had to say on the issue, the GOP passed their own sick leave bill earlier this year \u2014 and not because they cared about sick folks in Michigan.\n\nThey did it because if voters passed the sick leave law it would take a three-fourths majority of the legislature to overturn it. But, with the legislature passing the law, it only takes a simple majority to undo it. And Michigan Republicans lost their supermajority in the House and Senate after the 2018 elections, leaving them without the power to block a voter-led initiative in the coming session.\n\nAfter passing the sick leave law, the GOP immediately admitted they would substantially alter \u2014 or get rid of entirely \u2014 the law.\n\nThe sick leave provision currently provides for 72 hours of paid sick leave for both full- and part-time employees, one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked. All employers are covered by the law, but employers with fewer than 10 employees only need offer 40 hours of paid leave, with the remaining 32 unpaid. The law also prohibits employers from retaliating against workers who assert that their right to use sick time was violated.\n\nThe GOP majority has already indicated they want to weaken that protection against retaliation. They also want to drastically cut down on the length of time businesses are required to keep records of hours worked and sick time earned, from three years to just six months. Both of these changes would substantially weaken the law by making it more difficult for workers to track whether they're receiving sick time they\u2019re owed \u2014 and more risky to make a complaint about it.\n\nSome GOP legislators are going so far as to say that the entire sick leave law should be scrapped because they believe most signatures in favor of putting the measure on the ballot came from Detroit, Flint, and Lansing, and those voters don't actually represent the will of voters elsewhere in the state.\n\nRegardless of whether all of this is permissible under Michigan's legislative rules, it reflects a deeply cynical way of governing. The GOP outright said they passed a law just to take the choice away from voters so that they can undo that law later, and they've issued a racist dog whistle loud and clear: the only people that want things like sick leave are minorities that live in urban areas, not the \"real\" voters in other parts of the state.\n\nThis isn't governance. It's imposing the will of the GOP on Michigan voters regardless of what those voters want. And if the GOP has their way, the lame-duck session will allow them to do just that.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "If a big-money conservative donor gets his way during the lame-duck session, Michigan could create a two-tier police system \u2014 one for the rich, and one for everyone else.\n\nDuring the 2017-2018 session of the Michigan legislature, GOP Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof introduced a bill that would have allowed the creation of \"special police agencies\" \u2014 private police forces run by for-profit corporations.\n\nIt's a bill so poorly thought out that even law enforcement officials in Michigan oppose it. The head of the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police noted that under the law, even the KKK could create its own private police force. The past president of the association called it \"a mercenary force to police in some of our communities.\"\n\nThe measure died in committee. But now, law enforcement officials are worried that the GOP majority may try to get it passed before December 31 in the lame-duck session.\n\nSupporters of the bill have argued that it would give greater security options to business groups, but that's actually part of the problem. It creates a two-tier police system in the state \u2014 one for the rich, and one for everyone else.\n\nPrivate police would enjoy key privileges like governmental immunity, but wouldn't have to follow the same rules as regular police. For instance, private police wouldn't have to provide information under the state's Freedom of Information Act, and they wouldn't necessarily have to meet the same training standards as municipal forces do.\n\nThe bill is also a giveaway to a rich conservative donor, J.C. Huizenga, who has been very generous to Meekhof. Huizenga donated over $250,000 within the state of Michigan for 2015-2016, and has given Meekhof $20,000 since 2013.\n\nHuizenga also just happens to own three private police agencies in North Carolina, where about 10 percent of the force is private police.\n\nSince the private police bill didn't have enough support to make it through the regular session, there's hope that it would stall again this time around.\n\nBut as Meekhof is already busy using the lame duck session to try to gut the state's minimum wage law, it's clear he is just fine with using the session to rush legislation through \u2014 whether it reflects the will of the people or not.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "With his cooperation deal collapsing and new revelations about visits to see Julian Assange of Wikileaks, Manafort is a source of constant consternation for Trump.\n\nYesterday, former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort's plea deal seemed to implode when special counsel Robert Mueller alleged that Manafort repeatedly lied to the FBI even after taking the deal.\n\nToday, the Guardian reported that Manafort repeatedly visited Wikileaks head Julian Assange, including right around when Manafort joined Trump's campaign.\n\nAll of this is a problem for Donald Trump. And he knows it.\n\nEarlier this morning, Trump went on a tweet rampage against Mueller, claiming that his office treats people \"horribly and viciously\" if they refuse to lie.\n\nTrump attorney Rudy Guiliani is shopping the same story, telling CNN that Trump has been unhappy for several weeks over the \"un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.\"\n\nManafort lying to Mueller was bad enough for Trump, but the news about Manafort and Assange makes things even more complicated.\n\nAfter all, Manafort isn't the only one in Trump's orbit who has been cozy with Assange. Donald Trump Jr. spent nearly a year emailing Assange about everything from his father's tax returns to strategies for contesting the election if his dad lost.\n\nTrump himself has repeatedly expressed his appreciation of Wikileaks, declaring, \"I love Wikileaks\" and \"This Wikileaks is like a treasure trove.\"\n\nIn light of the new reporting on Manafort's visits with Assange, the Trump-Wikileaks connection may be even closer than it first appeared.\n\nManafort visited Assange in 2013, 2015, and around March of 2016, the Guardian reports.\n\nMarch of 2016 is also when Russians started hacking Democratic emails, which were dumped by Wikileaks a few months later.\n\nIt's getting tougher and tougher for Trump to maintain the fiction that his campaign wasn't the direct, intended beneficiary of these hacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Manafort seems to be acting erratically. First he went through a trial, without seeking a plea deal, that found him guilty on numerous charges of financial wrongdoing. Then he inexplicably reversed course and entered into a plea deal to avoid a second trial. Now he appears to have buyer's remorse and decided he didn't want to cooperate after all \u2014 so he's facing immediate, and likely harsher, sentencing.\n\nAll of this seems to be deeply concerning to Trump, and rightly so. If Trump or his campaign explicitly coordinated with the Russians and Assange to influence the elections, Manafort \u2014 whether he cracks under pressure or has his secrets exposed by prosecutors \u2014 could help expose that.\n\nEven if Trump is trying to lay the groundwork to pardon Manafort, that may not stem the bleeding. The special counsel's office is clearly aware of something that Manafort \u2014 and possibly Trump \u2014 hoped to hide with a lie. And that truth can still come out, pardon or no pardon.\n\nNo wonder Trump is worried.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

In exchange, Trump promotes Hannity, telling his followers to tune and watch the show. He even fawned over the dishonest host during a lengthy softball interview last year, telling Hannity, \"I'm very proud of you.\"\n\nTrump already has the propaganda network of his dreams, and he can see it every day during his so-called \"executive time\" periods dedicated to watching television.\n\nHe even has one of the network executives who orchestrated the cover-up of rampant sexual harassment, Bill Shine, now on the White House payroll as his communications director.\n\nIn Fox, Trump has the same sort of propaganda autocratic and oppressive regimes utilize.

They are welcoming the attacks as an excuse to once again push for wasting millions on a border wall, one of Trump's favorite obsessions.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that officials in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and at the White House \"quietly cheered\" as the children were targeted.\n\nA former senior official told the site that Trump administration officials are \"totally all in\" on the attacks and \"have gone batshit crazy.\"\n\n\"They are getting exactly what they want, which is the ability to present the narrative that the border is out of control.\"\n\nRepublicans have sought to portray migrants escaping violence and persecution they face in countries like Honduras as an \"invasion\" of the United States. The party, led by Trump, sought to use the racist distortion of human suffering as a way to stave off Republican losses in the midterm election. It did not work.\n\nThe Daily Beast notes that senior staff at DHS has focused on more frequently releasing statements from DHS Secretary Kristjen Nielsen focused on the migrants. And Pro-Trump media outlets like Fox News have pushed the narrative obsessively.\n\nNielsen was one of the architects of the Trump administration's policy of ripping apart migrant families with border prosecutions, including the placement of babies in cages.\n\nOne White House official even told the outlet the mainstream media owes Trump \"an apology\" for reporting that showed his fearmongering about the migrants was not rooted in reality.\n\nThe posture is in line with Trump's bizarre public statements on the topic.\n\nDespite photographic and video evidence showing that young children were subjected to tear gassing, Trump insisted that those who were attacked were \"stone cold criminals.\"\n\nWhen Trump asked by reporters how he felt about images of women and children running from the gassing, he again denied reality.\n\nInstead, Trump said \u2014 falsely \u2014 that the gas used was \"a very minor form\" that is \"very safe.\" He went on to state, \"You really say, 'Why is a parent running up into an area where they know the tear gas is forming and it\u2019s going to be formed, and they're running up with a child?'\"\n\nHe added, \"And in some cases, you know, they're not the parents.

It's another in a long line of absurdist conspiracy theories he has espoused in his time in the public eye.\n\nThe suffering he has enabled is being used to push a nonsensical idea \u2014 the wall \u2014 that will not resolve any immigration issues. Instead, Trump makes desperate migrant children suffer physical pain through unnecessary abuse.\n\nMeanwhile he and his underlings brush off serious concerns for the welfare of children and put the weight of the American government behind human suffering.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republican Mia Love has conceded to Democrat Ben McAdams.\n\nRep. Mia Love (R-UT) has conceded to Democrat Ben McAdams, giving Democrats their 38th pickup in the House of Representatives.\n\nAfter weeks of counting ballots from the close election, officials determined that McAdams had won by 694 votes. The victory in deep-red Utah showed just how strong the \"blue wave\" really was in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nIt also highlighted the GOP's problems with diversity. While Democrats elected historic numbers of diverse female candidates this year, the number of Republican women in Congress actually decreased.\n\nLove was the first and only black Republican woman in Congress.\n\nWhat's more, Trump started mocking Love for losing even before all the votes were counted.\n\n\"Mia Love gave me no love and she lost,\" Trump said just a day after the midterm election. \"Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\"\n\nLove actually voted for the Trump agenda more than 95 percent of the time. But that didn't stop Trump from mocking her and claiming that she'd been disloyal to him.\n\nIn her concession speech, Love called out Trump for this behavior \u2014 and called out the GOP as a whole for its failure to reach communities of color.\n\nLove said Trump's remarks made clear that Trump has \"no real relationships, just convenient transactions.\"\n\nAnd her own Republican Party, Love said, has failed to \"take minority communities into their home and citizens into their homes and into their hearts.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to the Nov. 6 midterm election, Trump promoted racist fear-mongering about immigration in hopes of boosting turnout among his xenophobic base, telling wild lies about a group of asylum-seeking immigrants on a desperate journey to seek refuge in the United States.\n\nHis racist efforts failed.\n\nMcAdams said his first priority in Congress is to fight for Dreamers, the immigrants who were brought to the United States as young children and now live in legal limbo.\n\nTrump and Republicans turned their backs on this hard-working community \u2014 but McAdams and the new Democratic majority in the House have vowed to work towards a compassionate and positive resolution.\n\nWhile Republicans like Love and Trump point fingers at each other, Democrats will focus on making America a stronger and more compassionate country.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "A new report shows right-wing terrorism is surging under Trump's leadership \u2014 and experts say it's not a coincidence.\n\nRight-wing domestic terrorism has surged since Trump took office in January 2017, according to a new analysis of global terrorism data from the Washington Post.\n\nThe report found that there were more acts of terrorism motivated by right-wing political ideologies in 2017 than all other types of domestic terrorism combined. Out of 65 total incidents, 36 were classified as right-wing terrorism. The remaining incidents included 10 acts of left-wing terrorism, 7 acts of Islamist extremism, and 12 classified as \"other/unknown.\"\n\nWhile right-wing terrorism was already on the rise in the years leading up to Trump's presidency, the report notes that the uptick in violence carried out by right-wing attackers \"accelerated\" in 2017 and again in 2018.\n\n\"Over the past decade, attackers motivated by right-wing political ideologies have committed dozens of shootings, bombings and other acts of violence, far more than any other category of domestic extremist,\" the report says.\n\nIt went on to note that although the data on domestic terror in the U.S. show \"a decades-long drop-off in violence by left-wing groups, violence by white supremacists and other far-right attackers has been on the rise since Barack Obama's presidency \u2014 and has surged since President Trump took office.\"\n\nOverall, acts of right-wing terrorism not only occur more frequently but are also more likely to be deadly than left-wing terrorism, experts told The Post.\n\nIn 2018 alone, at least 20 people have been killed in suspected right-wing attacks, according to the analysis. In comparison, analysts only documented one fatality from an attack that may have been motivated by left-wing ideologies.\n\nDespite this, Trump continues to peddle baseless lies portraying Democrats as an \"angry left-wing mob,\" while ignoring the actual mob violence carried out by right-wing extremists like the Trump-loving Proud Boys.\n\nTerrorism researchers told the Post that right-wing violence has risen alongside \"white anxiety about Obama's Presidency\" and has \"accelerated in the Trump era.\"\n\nWhile Trump has attempted to deny his role in inspiring violence, experts say right-wing extremists believe Trump is \"offering them tacit support for their cause,\" according to the Post. And they're right \u2014 he is.\n\nNotably, Trump's presidency hasn't driven increases in the incidence of left-wing or Islamist terrorism \u2014 only right-wing terrorism.\n\nSince 2014, the total number of politically motivated domestic terror incidents has remained relatively stable, at about 20 attacks per year. At least, it was stable until Trump took office. But in just the first year of his presidency, right-wing attacks tripled from their previous annual average, causing the overall incidence of domestic terrorism to soar.\n\nThe new analysis is in line with other recent reports on extremism in the U.S., all of which point to far-right violence as the greatest threat in this area.\n\nAccording to new FBI statistics released this month, documented hate crimes rose by 17 percent in 2017, with particularly notable increases in anti-Hispanic and anti-Semitic crimes. This coincides with a study by the Anti-Defamation League, which found a 57 percent surge in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017.\n\nDuring the same time period, white supremacist murders more than doubled, making 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence.\n\nThese trends been attributed in large part to Trump's incendiary rhetoric, tacit endorsement of violence, and open embrace of far-right extremism. But while Trump's role in the rise of right-wing violence may be more out in the open, Republicans have done their part too, standing by his side as complicit co-conspirators \u2014 at best.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Paul Manafort is reportedly betting on a presidential pardon, something Trump's past words and actions indicate is a very real possibility.\n\nThe evidence is mounting against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. And his longtime deputy Rick Gates is cooperating with the special counsel investigation, after pleading guilty last month to conspiracy and lying to the FBI.\n\nBut Manafort is reportedly hoping that a presidential pardon will be his get-out-of-jail ticket.\n\n\"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is now betting his future on a presidential pardon,\" CBS News reported Wednesday. \"Manafort expects that the President would grant him a pardon. Legal sources close to the case \u2014 but not representing Manafort \u2014 believe that is a reasonable expectation.\"\n\nSpeculation about a possible Manafort pardon has been swirling for months.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Trump's personal attorney was in touch with Manafort's attorney last year and broached the idea of a pardon.\n\nThe discussions \"raise questions about whether the lawyer, John Dowd, was offering pardons to influence their decisions about whether to plead guilty and cooperate in the investigation,\" according to the Times.\n\nManafort pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, money laundering, and tax and bank fraud charges related to his lobbying work for a Russian-friendly political party in Ukraine. He's currently awaiting trial later this year.\n\nThe CBS report came just hours after Robert Mueller's office released new court filings that document ongoing ties between Manafort, Gates, and Russian intelligence during the closing months of the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe men discussed the stolen Democratic National Committee emails with the Russian contact \u2014 emails that were stolen by Russian operatives.\n\nObservers suggest Gates' cooperation has increased the pressure on Manafort to cooperate with Mueller as he zeroes in on Trump. But if Manafort is confident a Trump pardon is looming, there's less incentive to cooperate with Mueller.\n\nPardoning Manafort, especially preemptively before any trial even took place, could ignite a political firestorm. It could also bring a legal challenge, since it would virtually nullify Mueller's case against Manafort.\n\nTrump would have to rip up protocols for issuing presidential pardons, which call for a five-year waiting period between a conviction and a pardon appeal. The guidelines also require the person seeking a pardon take responsibilities for their crimes, something Manafort would unlikely do.\n\nBut Trump has already ignored pardon guidelines in order to reward his crooked, political allies.\n\nLast year, Trump pardoned Arizona's disgraced former sheriff and full-fledged birther Joe Arpaio after he was convicted for refusing to cease racial profiling. Arpaio then lost his re-election bid, but is now running for the U.S. Senate.\n\nDemocrats saw the Arpaio pardon as a possible sign of future, weightier pardons.\n\n\"The concern I have is that he\u2019s sending a message to people that may be under investigation by Bob Mueller, that \u2018I have your back and I\u2019ve got a pardon waiting for you,'\" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told MSNBC last year.\n\nAnd last winter, Trump seemed to signal that disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn might receive a pardon.\n\nManafort may be relying on getting the same support from Trump that Arpaio and Flynn did.\n\nBut expecting loyalty from Trump is not exactly a safe bet."

    "text": "Rudy Giuliani sent former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort a loud and clear message following Manafort's cooperation agreement.\n\nTrump attorney Rudy Giuliani made another naked attempt to influence Paul Manafort just hours after the former Trump campaign chairman entered into a plea deal that included a cooperation agreement with special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nOn Friday night, Giuliani told the New York Daily News that Manafort was not \"disqualified\" from a pardon because of the cooperation agreement:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not disqualified from it,\u201d Giuliani, Trump\u2019s top lawyer in the Russia investigation, told the Daily News hours after Manafort entered the cooperation agreement with Mueller. \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to believe it\u2019s happening now, but I also don\u2019t have any reason to preclude it in the future.\u201d [...] \u201cI don\u2019t think the President is concerned about anyone flipping as long as they tell the truth, and certainly Paul would do that,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThe President never did anything wrong with him.\u201d\n\nBut Giuliani's confidence in Manafort is belied by a pair of statements issued by Trump's legal team just after the plea deal was announced.\n\nThe initial statement said that Trump \"did nothing wrong and Paul Manafort will tell the truth.\u201d But within minutes, a new statement was issued that omitted the reference to Manafort telling the truth.\n\nTrump's legal team, it seems, may have recognized that defending Manafort's credibility could hurt Trump down the line.\n\nThis is not the first time that Giuliani has dangled the possibility of a pardon for Manafort. In June, he suggested that \"when [the Mueller investigation]'s over,\" Trump \"retains his pardon power,\" and wouldn't rule out a pardon for Manafort at that time.\n\nTrump himself has also frequently refused to rule out a pardon for Manafort.\n\n\"I don't talk about that,\" Trump demurred when he was asked in June about pardoning Manafort. But Trump also went on to praise Manafort as \"a very good person,\" adding, \"I think it\u2019s very sad what they\u2019ve done to Paul Manafort.\"\n\nAs House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has observed, Trump could also be signaling to would-be cooperators that \"those who lie under oath may be rewarded with pardons.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, legal experts Paul Rosenzweig and Justin Florence explained in a Washington Post editorial, pardoning Manafort would likely be an unconstitutional abuse of power and an impeachable offense.\n\nBut even if Trump did take that risk and try to pardon Manafort now, it's probably too late to do Trump any good.\n\nAfter all, Manafort has already started cooperating with Mueller, according to Manafort's lead attorney.\n\nAnd the plea deal Mueller granted to Manafort \"appears built to be pardon-proof,\" Josh Gerstein reported at Politico.\n\nThat doesn't mean Trump won't try to pardon Manafort anyway. But if he does, maybe that act of corruption would finally be brazen enough to convince elected Republicans that Trump needs to be removed from office.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "In a shameful plot to avoid the will of the voters, Michigan Republicans passed a law raising the minimum wage just so they could gut it in the lame-duck session before a new Democratic governor takes over.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, Michigan voters overwhelmingly supported the Democratic candidate for governor, Gretchen Whitmer. She beat her conservative GOP challenger, outgoing Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, by nearly 10 percentage points.\n\nWith that, Michigan voters sent a clear message that they favored the sort of progressive values Whitmer ran on, including policies like raising the minimum wage, enforcing equal pay laws, and offering paid family leave.\n\nNow, however, the Republican-controlled state legislature \u2014 led by Arlan B. Meekhof, the state senate\u2019s Republican majority leader \u2014 wants to use its lame-duck session to eradicate an existing minimum wage law before Whitmer takes office in January 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, the Michigan legislature passed a law that would require businesses to gradually raise the minimum wage to $12 per hour.\n\nGOP state lawmakers didn't do this because they genuinely want to see people make more money, though. They did it because progressive groups in Michigan had obtained enough signatures to get a minimum wage question on the ballot.\n\nIf the measure had passed via ballot referendum, it would have taken a three-fourths majority of the Michigan legislature to overturn it, and the GOP doesn't have a three-fourths majority. If the legislature itself passed a minimum wage law, however, that could be undone by a simple majority.\n\nSo the GOP took the choice away from the voters and passed their own measure to raise the minimum wage, all while admitting that they would radically change the law right after the election.\n\nIt's not entirely clear how the lame-duck legislature plans to amend the existing law, but the Michigan GOP is in thrall to conservative business groups that didn't want the wage increase.\n\nMichigan voters want policies that benefit workers, not just corporations, and a fair minimum wage law is central to that goal.\n\nBut with tricks like these, Michigan Republicans are proving they don't care about respecting the will of the people they are supposed to represent.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Democrats have indicated they plan to investigate the practice and the White House's role in hiding her behavior.\n\nMeeting with reporters outside the White House Tuesday, Trump sought to downplay what had happened.\n\n\"For a little period of time Ivanka did some emails,\" Trump said. \"They weren't classified like Hillary Clinton. They weren't deleted like Hillary Clinton, who deleted 33 \u2014 she wasn't hiring, she wasn't doing anything to hide her emails.\"\n\nHe continued to baselessly claim that the Post reported \"fake news\" and \"a false story.\"\n\nTrump regularly smears journalism as \"fake news\" simply because it's unflattering, or because it accurately reports on corruption within his administration.\n\nThe truth is, the White House knew about Ivanka Trump's activities \u2014 and tried to cover them up.\n\nAnd Republicans in Congress helped.\n\nWhen Congress became aware that both Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were using these email services, the House Oversight Committee issued a bipartisan request for clarification and documents from the White House.\n\nInstead of complying, however, Trump officials simply asserted they were following the law.\n\nCongressional Republicans simply accepted this and let the whole thing go, giving Trump yet another free pass and skipping out on their oversight responsibilities.\n\nDemocrats have continued to push for answers and have said they will investigate after taking over the House majority in the new year.\n\nTrump's casual dismissal of his daughter's actions is shockingly hypocritical in light of his obsession with Hillary Clinton's email server.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump led his supporters in chants of \"lock her up,\" with the implication that Clinton had done something illicit or illegal. An FBI investigation showed that this was false, but that hasn't deterred Trump.\n\nYears after winning the election (but losing the popular vote), Trump still loves to talk about Clinton's emails to make himself feel good.\n\nBut now we know that Trump's daughter, acting in the official capacity he handed to her, was using a private account. His son-in-law did the same.\n\nThe Trump administration has been covering it all up \u2014 but it won't be able to hide for long once House Democrats start investigating.\n\nIvanka Trump can no longer hide what she did, and her father's excuses won't persuade anyone outside of his inner circle of sycophants.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Just days after the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history, the Trump administration is reportedly about to end a DHS program devoted to countering violent extremism in America.\n\nOn the heels of the deadliest act of anti-Semitic violence in American history, the Trump administration is planning to shut down the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Countering Violent Extremism Grant Program, according to a new report.\n\nThe anti-extremism program was initially established under the Obama administration for the purpose of funding groups around the country that work to counter domestic terrorism.\n\nSince Trump took office, funding for certain projects \u2014 particularly those focused on stopping far-right violence \u2014 has been cut and/or withheld, but the program itself is still operational.\n\nNow that's about to change. NBC News reports that the Trump administration is not going to renew funding for the program, despite recent high-profile acts of violent extremism and a nationwide spike in white supremacist violence and far-right extremism.\n\nCurrently, that funding goes toward the development of new approaches to preventing domestic terrorism and identifying early warning signs of extremism. \"Programs that develop training materials for law enforcement, mental health counselors and schools to better identify warning signs of extremism so that terrorism can be averted were designated to receive funds,\" according to NBC News.\n\nIf the Trump administration moves forward with the reported plan to end funding, none of those programs will get the grants they were slated to receive.\n\nThat's what happened last year to a program called Life After Hate, the only program in the country devoted solely and specifically to countering neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideologies. It was supposed to receive $400,000 in grants. Ultimately, it received nothing.\n\nDHS has not yet publicly confirmed that funding will be canceled for the Countering Violent Extremism program. But the Office of Terrorism Prevention Partnerships, which is housed within DHS, has taken down any mention of future funding from its website.\n\nThe Countering Violent Extremism program is at least the second domestic terrorism program that the Trump administration has gutted.\n\nAccording to a recent report in The Atlantic, the interagency task force on Countering Violent Extremism \u2014 which included experts from the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services \u2014 has gone inactive and exists only in name now.\n\nGeorge Selim, the former director of the Office of Community Partnerships, which oversaw the task force, told The Atlantic that \"there\u2019s been a precipitous decline in the dedicated staff and program funding devoted to combatting ideologically motivated violence\" under the Trump administration.\n\nAll of this comes amid a growing threat of homegrown extremist violence, particularly from white supremacist groups.\n\nThe FBI concluded in a 2017 report that white supremacists killed more Americans from 2000 to 2016 than \"any other domestic extremist movement,\" and would likely continue to pose a growing threat of lethal violence in the year to come.\n\nAnd they did.\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, white supremacist murders doubled in 2017. White supremacists \"were directly responsible\u201d for 18 out of 34 extremist-related deaths nationwide \u2014 double the number of deaths attributed to Islamic extremists. Overall, 2017 was the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America.\n\nBut officials in the Trump administration continually deny these facts, and instead point to Islamic extremism and illegal immigration as the primary domestic terror threats in America, despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nOn top of that, national security agencies are being directed to focus on threats other than white supremacist terrorism, even though white supremacist violence poses the greatest domestic terror risk.\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast, DHS convened a conference call with more than two dozen current and former government officials on Tuesday, just three days after the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.\n\nThe topic of the call? The so-called \"caravan\" of asylum-seekers slowly working their way towards the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump claims to be \"making America safe again,\" but his own anti-immigrant fervor and white supremacist sympathies may actually pose the greatest risk to national security.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Cindy Hyde-Smith's campaign adamantly denies she is a racist \u2014 but a 2014 Facebook post features a photo of her wearing a Confederate soldier's hat, holding a rifle, and smiling, with a caption praising the Confederate era in her state as \"Mississippi history at its best!\"\n\nWhat's more, the man Hyde-Smith is smiling and posing with is reportedly a member of a white nationalist hate group.\n\nThe Facebook post, first reported by Politico, included several photos from Hyde-Smith's visit to the Jefferson Davis Home and Presidential Library. Jefferson Davis was the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, and fought to maintain the institution of slavery in America.\n\nHis former home has been turned into museum celebrating the Confederacy. The museum's gift shop sells such items as a book called \"The South Was Right!\" and a \"Flags of the Confederacy\" coffee mug.\n\nAnd according to journalist Judd Legum of Popular Information, the man smiling and posing next to Hyde-Smith with rifles and Confederate hats is Greg Stewart, a member of a white nationalist group that fought to keep the Confederate symbol on the state flag.\n\nLegum noted that the group, called \"Free Mississippi,\" has been identified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nHyde-Smith, a white woman, is locked in a close race with Democrat Mike Espy, a black man, for the U.S. Senate seat Hyde-Smith has held since April. Both Hyde-Smith and Espy received roughly 40 percent of the vote on Nov. 6, and will face off on Nov. 27 in a runoff election.\n\nHyde-Smith is already dealing with a scandal over a racist remark. In a recent video, she made a \"joke\" about attending a public hanging with one of her supporters, a phrase that brought to mind Mississippi's dark history of racist mobs lynching black people.\n\nHer comments have brought rebukes not only from the Espy campaign, but from corporations as well. Walmart has withdrawn its support from Hyde-Smith and demanded a refund of its $2,000 donation to her campaign. Union Pacific and Boston Scientific have also demanded refunds and sought to distance themselves from Hyde-Smith's divisive campaign.\n\nHyde-Smith also shocked Americans by praising voter suppression tactics that make it harder for liberal college students to vote.\n\nHyde-Smith's racist missteps in particular have many Republicans \"unnerved,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nBut despite her many controversies, the Republican Party steadfastly stands beside Hyde-Smith, and is even willing to spend $1 million to help her hold on to her seat.\n\nTrump, also known for making racist comments, is planning to visit Mississippi to hold a rally with Hyde-Smith.\n\nEspy, meanwhile, is looking to pull off a Doug Jones-style upset in the deep South.\n\nIf Espy won, he would become the first Democratic senator elected in Mississippi since 1982 \u2014 and the state's first black senator since the Reconstruction era, when America started trying to clean up the racist mess that Hyde-Smith's beloved Confederacy had left behind.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Republicans in Congress tried to sweep it under the rug a year ago, but now the scandal over Ivanka's emails has gotten too big to ignore.\n\nAs Shareblue reported Tuesday, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), the outgoing chairman of the House Oversight Committee, stonewalled an investigation into Ivanka Trump's potentially improper email use a year before it became a public scandal.\n\nBut now that he can't avoid it anymore, Gowdy is finally admitting Ivanka may have broken the law when she used a private email account to conduct government business.\n\n\"Ms. Trump\u2019s use of a personal email account for official communications may implicate the Presidential Records Act and other security and recordkeeping requirements,\" Gowdy wrote in a letter to the White House requesting a briefing on the email issue.\n\nThe Presidential Records Act requires government business to be conducted through proper government channels, so that the record can be preserved for future reference.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Monday that Ivanka Trump, along with her husband Jared Kushner, used a private email system to send hundreds of messages to government officials. Ivanka Trump did this while serving in her capacity as an aide to her father, and sent messages pertaining to government business.\n\nThe White House initially tried to hide that she had done this, minimizing the extent of the problem and placing the blame on Kushner.\n\nAnd Republicans in Congress, led by Gowdy, helped enable the cover-up.\n\nGowdy knew about the potentially illicit email exchanges over a year ago, but he dropped a bipartisan investigation into the issue after taking the White House's unverified word for it that everything was on the up-and-up.\n\nBut now we know that it wasn't \u2014 and that congressional Democrats on the Oversight Committee, led by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), were right to object to Gowdy's actions and push for the committee to do its constitutional duty.\n\nDonald Trump tried to cover for his daughter on Tuesday by weakly arguing that the reporting on her email use was \"fake news.\"\n\nFor years, Trump has attacked Hillary Clinton for using a private email server and led his supporters in chants of \"lock her up\" at rallies. But now that Trump's daughter is under fire after he gave her a senior position in his administration, he suddenly sees things differently.\n\nAnd only now that the White House's deception has been exposed by the Washington Post is Gowdy starting to do the follow-up work that he should have done over a year ago.\n\nGowdy has already announced he is leaving Congress, and Democrats will be taking over leadership of the House after sweeping Republicans out of power in the midterms.\n\nCummings' office has said the Ivanka Trump email scandal will be one of many investigations that will be conducted under Democratic leadership in the new Congress.\n\nIvanka Trump is going to be held accountable for her actions, even though her fellow Republicans failed to make that happen when they had the chance.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Taxpayer dollars are being used to spy on migrants fleeing violence, adding to the huge cost of Trump's wasteful border stunt.\n\nThe Trump administration is reportedly paying undercover informants to infiltrate the migrant caravan and spy on the group as they make their way north after fleeing violence in Central America.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the Department of Homeland Security is overseeing the operation to gather intelligence from the group of about 4,000 asylum-seeking migrants.\n\nIn addition to placing undercover informants within the caravan, DHS personnel are also reportedly collecting intelligence from migrants using WhatsApp groups to communicate along their journey.\n\nOn Monday, officials from DHS said the intelligence they'd gathered had led them to believe that a large group of migrants was planning to rush the border by running through the car lanes of a border crossing near San Diego.\n\nThat prompted Customs and Border Control to close all northbound traffic lanes near the port of entry for three hours on Monday. However, the supposed influx of migrants never occurred.\n\nThe use of taxpayer dollars to spy on asylum-seeking migrants has come under scrutiny from some national security officials, who say that although it's not illegal to pay informants and fund efforts to monitor communications, it's a highly questionable use of limited resources.\n\n\"Those resources have to come from some place. They are not being devoted to thwarting terrorist threats, mass shootings, mailed fentanyl coming into the country or cyberattacks,\" John Cohen, former acting undersecretary of intelligence for DHS, told NBC News.\n\n\"I find it hard to believe that the highest risk facing this nation comes from this caravan,\" he added.\n\nWhile Trump has tried to portray the migrants as a threatening group of terrorists, gang members, and drug dealers \u2014 even sending thousands of troops to the border in a desperate and costly stunt \u2014 there have been no reports of violence from the caravan and no indication that they pose any risk to anyone.\n\nFurthermore, the Defense Department's own risk assessment contradicts Trump's claims about the migrants being a national security threat.\n\nHowever, Trump's apocalyptic fear-mongering did resonate with gun-toting militia members and other far-right extremists, who interpreted his rhetoric as a call to arms and responded by descending on the border region.\n\nMilitary and law enforcement officials were alarmed enough by the prospect of armed vigilantes gathering alongside thousands of U.S. troops at the border that they were forced to issue warnings to Army commanders and local communities.\n\nMeanwhile, as Trump authorizes the use of tax dollars to spy on people fleeing violence, he is simultaneously stripping funding from programs aimed at combating the exact type of far-right extremism he's inflaming with his anti-immigrant fear-mongering \u2014 in other words, exactly the outcome you'd expect when racism and xenophobia are used to inform public policy."

    "text": "Armed militias and other vigilantes are heeding Trump's call and heading to the border to confront migrants \u2014 and put our troops in danger.\n\nGun-toting far-right militia members and other vigilantes are interpreting Trump's apocalyptic fear-mongering about the so-called migrant \"caravan\" as a call to arms \u2014 and they're answering that call, with potentially disastrous results.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, members of multiple armed militia groups are headed to the U.S.-Mexico border, where they plan to converge with other \"patriot\" groups, set up patrols, and wait for the \"caravan\" of Central American migrants who are still more than a month away from reaching the border.\n\nSeveral of these groups have put up calls on social media for members around the country to take up arms and travel to the border region.\n\nMilitary and law enforcement officials are alarmed enough by the prospect of armed vigilantes gathering alongside thousands of U.S. troops at the border that they have issued warnings to Army commanders and local communities.\n\nAccording to planning documents and intelligence reports obtained by Newsweek, the military is concerned about the arrival of \"unregulated militia members self-deploying to the border in alleged support\" of border patrol agents already stationed along the border with Mexico.\n\n\"Preliminary intelligence assessments are preparing for encounters with a litany of groups from unregulated militias to transcontinental criminal organizations,\" the report warns. \"They operate under the guise of citizen patrols.\"\n\nThe report went on to warn of \"incidents of unregulated militias stealing National Guard equipment during deployments.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Customs and Border Patrol sent out an advisory last week telling landowners in Texas to expect \"possible armed civilians\" on their property.\n\nIn some areas, they're already there. The Albuquerque Journal reported on Friday that militia members had started to show up in border towns in New Mexico:\n\nAt a hotel in town Wednesday, a few members of the militia rested and waited for nightfall to patrol the border. One of their trucks in the parking lot had an \u201cISIS hunting\u201d decal on the bottom of the windshield. As one of the militiamen paced in front of the hotel, smoking and talking on his phone, another sat in a chair on the second-floor balcony holding binoculars. They were spurred to action by news of thousands of Central American migrants in a caravan headed for the border, said Jim Peyton, a 71-year-old retired Detroit police officer.\n\nAnd these aren't just any armed civilians.\n\nThe so-called \"Patriot movement\" is an umbrella term used to describe a loosely connected web of radical right-wing groups \"characterized by armed militias, wild conspiracy theories, a hatred of the Federal Government and government regulation, an overarching love for guns, and occasionally a strong component of racism,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which researches hate groups and extremist movements.\n\nAn estimated 689 anti-government patriot and militia groups are active in the U.S. today, many of which are considered domestic terror groups.\n\nDespite their penchant for violence and anti-government ideology, some of these groups have formed alliances with mainstream Republicans \u2014 like in Oregon, where the state Republican party moved to have militias provide security at its events.\n\nIn a particularly disturbing development, the past few years have seen the emergence of hybrid militia groups that combine the anti-government, pro-gun insurrectionist spirit of the Patriot movement with the violent and racist ideology of the white supremacist movement.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center describes this movement as a \"white nationalist army working to create 'the new American nation state.'\"\n\nAlready emboldened by Trump, these groups now hear his anti-immigrant rhetoric and fear-mongering as a legitimate call to arms.\n\nSome of them are even mimicking Trump's language in their own calls to action, urging other armed militia members to join them in securing the border from \"a Mob of Migrating Immigrants.\"\n\nThe militia members who have gathered at the border have parroted Trump's campaign rants by describing the group of asylum-seeking migrants as a \"Trojan horse\" or a \"decoy\" hiding ISIS, MS-13, and cartel gang members.\n\nBased on no evidence whatsoever, Trump continues to claim that \"unknown Middle Easterners,\" \"very tough men,\" and large numbers of gang members and violent criminals are traveling among the women, children and families.\n\nNow, he's sending our troops to go defend against a threat that he manufactured for political purposes.\n\nBut in a twisted turn of events, it looks like our troops really will have dangerous people to contend with \u2014 the radical right-wing militia members who were inspired by Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Retired Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters is not impressed with Trump's plan to use our troops as part of a political stunt at the border.\n\nWith midterms fast approaching, Trump has resorted to increasingly desperate measures in a last ditch effort to rile up GOP voters and convince people he's not really as incompetent as he is.\n\nWhile he may think he sounds tough when he barks orders to send thousands of U.S. troops to the border, not everyone is impressed with Trump's bluster.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN's \"AC 360\" Thursday night, retired Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters didn't mince words when describing his thoughts about Trump's plans to exploit the military for political gain.\n\n\"The president of the United States is a draft dodger, playing with our troops,\" Peters told host Anderson Cooper. \"This idea of sending 15,000 troops to the southern border right now, it's an election ploy.\"\n\nPeters made the comments in response to a question about Trump's remarks earlier in the day, when he suggested that he may order U.S. troops to shoot migrants who throw rocks at them.\n\n\"Our active duty troops aren't going to do that,\" Peters said. \"Commanders aren't going to order them to do that.\"\n\nAs Peters pointed out, there's no need to send thousands of troops to the border, and it's not even clear what they will do when they get there.\n\n\"There's no plan to use 15,000 or 10,000 or even 5,000 troops,\" Peters said. \"For purely partisan political purposes, Trump is ripping these soldiers, airmen, marines, sailors \u2014 he's ripping them away from their training, which is vital.\"\n\nFurthermore, he added, \"To show you how much Trump loves his troops, he's ripping them away from their families with the holiday season coming. Soldiers are used to that. They understand their duty and they're glad and proud to do their duty, but when they are manipulated for partisan political purposes, it \u2014 it literally is disgraceful.\"\n\nFor its part, the Pentagon has said it has no plans to send 15,000 troops to the border. Apparently, Trump didn't think to check with top military brass before committing to sending more service members away from their families to take part in his election stunt.\n\nTrump is justifying his demands for an unnecessary military presence at the border by claiming that the migrants who are still thousands of miles away from America are the biggest threat to U.S. national security.\n\nEven in the aftermath of several high profile incidents of extremist violence, including the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history, Trump continues to downplay the threat of white supremacist and far-right violence so he can divert more resources to his political theater at the border.\n\nAnd that's the greatest irony of all: As Trump claims to be making America safer by militarizing the border, he's actually leaving us more vulnerable to domestic terrorism and violence.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Donald Trump was recognized for going out of his way 'to attack the press and undermine the norms that support freedom of the media.'\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on Monday released a list of the world's worst press oppressors \u0097 and Donald Trump took home home the top honor, beating out dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nThe list of global press oppressors recognizes world leaders \"who have gone out of their way to attack the press and undermine the norms that support freedom of the media.\" It was released in response to Trump's upcoming \"fake news\" awards ceremony.\n\nTrump was named the winner of the \u0093Overall Achievement in Undermining Global Press Freedom\u0094 award for going \"above and beyond to silence critical voices and weaken democracy.\"\n\nAmong other things, Trump has popularized the term \"fake news,\" using it to describe any news that he doesn't like \u0097 at times, even his own words. He uses the bully pulpit to openly promote Fox News as his personal propaganda arm while denigrating other news sources and calling for the firing of journalists who make honest mistakes.\n\nMost recently, Trump called for banning the book \"Fire and Fury\" because he doesn't like its unflattering portrayal of his first year in office.\n\n\u0093\"The United States, with its First Amendment protection for a free press, has long stood as a beacon for independent media around the world,\" CPJ wrote. \"While previous U.S. presidents have each criticized the press to some degree, they have also made public commitments to uphold its essential role in democracy, at home and abroad.\"\n\n\u0093Trump, by contrast, has consistently undermined domestic news outlets and declined to publicly raise freedom of the press with repressive leaders such as Xi [Jinping], Erdogan, and Sisi.\u0094\n\nCPJ noted that, under the Trump administration, the Department of Justice has failed to commit to guidelines to protect journalists' sources, while the State Department has proposed funding cuts for organizations that promote free press around the world.\n\nPerhaps that explains CPJ's decision to name Trump as the runner-up in the \u0093Most Thin-skinned\u0094 category, right behind Turkey's Erdogan.\n\n\u0093He regularly attacks outlets and individual journalists on Twitter and in speeches, calling them \u0091sad,\u0092 \u0091failing,\u0092 or \u0091garbage,\u0092\u0094 the committee wrote about Trump. \u0093Since declaring his presidential candidacy in 2015, Trump has posted about 1,000 tweets critical of the press.\u0094\n\nWhile the effects of Trump's attacks on the press are felt at home, they are most dire abroad. According to CPJ, with countries like the United States failing to hold repressive leaders accountable for their treatment of the press, the number of journalists in prison globally has reached a record high.\n\nTrump's disdain for the free press threatens fundamental democratic values. He took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution \u0097 and every time he attacks the press, he is attacking the basic principles that make America the great nation it is."

    "text": "Once again, America is retreating from the global stage under Trump's leadership. And once again, Russia stands to benefit from it.\n\nMore than 50 countries signed onto a historic cybersecurity pact Monday as part of the Paris Peace Forum, marking an important step forward in the global fight against cyberwarfare and criminal activity on the internet.\n\nIn addition to the governments that pledged to work together to combat malicious online activities, at least 150 tech companies and 90 charitable organizations and universities also signed onto the agreement.\n\nHowever, there were a few notable absences from the list of signatories. Among the countries that declined to pledge support for the global pact were the repressive regimes of Russia, China, and North Korea \u2014 and the United States.\n\nThe agreement, known as the \"Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace,\" represents the largest and most coordinated effort to date to create a set of international laws and norms for cyberwarfare and security \u2014 akin to a Geneva Convention for the digital world.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron unveiled the initiative Monday, just a day after Trump refused to join other world leaders to commemorate the centenary of the end of World World I at a cemetery for fallen soldiers.\n\nThe cybersecurity pact \u2014 which calls for countries to work together to promote human rights on the internet, thwart malicious activities such as theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, and develop better methods to prevent foreign election interference \u2014 was supported by most modern democratic nations including Japan, Canada, and the countries of the European Union.\n\nTech companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and HP also signed onto the agreement, pledging to accept more responsibility for bolstering cybersecurity and preventing abuses of their own products and services.\n\nWhile the pact is meant to serve as a starting point for future, more comprehensive efforts, countries were asked to sign the document to signal their commitment and intent to cooperate with the agreement's clauses.\n\nThe need for the international pact couldn't be clearer. Current international law protecting civilians is founded on notions of state sovereignty and traditional methods of warfare, but the digital environment doesn't respect or abide by international borders, and the information battlespace does not separate state actors and combatants from civilians.\n\nWithout rules and norms to define these matters in the digital environment, civilians can all too easily get caught in the crossfire of state-sponsored hacking, misinformation campaigns, and cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.\n\nJust as the Geneva Convention specified rules of combat to protect civilian populations during wartime, the cybersecurity pact is meant to define what is unacceptable, and to provide a legal basis for punishing those who breach international rules and norms in the digital world.\n\nIt's not clear why the United States chose to join some of the world's most repressive regimes in refusing to sign the agreement, but it's far from the first time America has split from its allies under the leadership of the Trump administration \u2014 and just like the previous times, Russia stands to benefit substantially from America's retreat from the global stage.\n\nThe Kremlin regularly uses its cyber capabilities as tools of war, sometimes turning them against the Russian population, and at other times aiming at countries like Ukraine, Estonia, and, most recently, the United States. And in many instances, Russia has gotten away with these acts of aggression and human rights violations, in part because there is not even widespread agreement on the definition of cyberwarfare or the rules of engagement.\n\nA new agreement like the one unveiled Monday would put the United States and its allies in a stronger position to mount a defense and hold Russia accountable for such acts. But, as the RAND Corporation warned in a 2017 report, \"Without clear consensus on what constitutes a cyber violation, Russia will likely continue to maneuver unfettered in the vast gray area of international law,\"\n\nWith the Trump administration continuing to make inexplicable decisions that benefit Russia with no apparent gains for the U.S., it's not hard to see why so many people believe that Putin has a hold on Trump.\n\nUnfortunately for the American people, that also means Putin has a hold on Trump's decision-making \u2014 and despite what Trump may claim, there's nothing \"America First\" about America retreating.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump is trying to destroy the one institution that can most effectively constrain his abuses of power.\n\nTrump has never been a friend of the First Amendment. From the earliest days of his presidential campaign through the first year of his presidency and into the second, Trump has waged an all-out war on the free press, seeking to destroy the one institution that can most effectively constrain his abuses of power.\n\nBut this week, Trump's assault on the free press reached an alarming new level. With battles raging on multiple fronts, Trump is intentionally undermining the First Amendment in an effort to stifle dissent, evade accountability, and ultimately make it easier for his administration to delegitimize any other institutions that get in his way.\n\nTrump kicked off the week by rushing to defend his personal propaganda arm, Sinclair Broadcasting, after it faced backlash amid revelations that the company was forcing local anchors across the country to read from a script.\n\nIn doing so, Trump was keeping up his end of what can only be described as a blatant quid pro quo agreement.\n\nWhile he was still a candidate, Sinclair struck a deal with the Trump campaign to give him more favorable coverage. And as president, he has paid the media empire back by praising its coverage, denigrating its competitors, and \u2014 with the help of his handpicked FCC chairman Ajit Pai \u2014 made it easier for Sinclair to expand its viewing audience to reach 72 percent of American households.\n\nAs others have noted, the true danger in Sinclair's coverage is not its reach or its right-wing bias. Rather, the danger is that it conceals its bias by packaging it as local news while not revealing the source. Propaganda is dangerous \u2014 but propaganda disguised as news coming out of the mouths of trusted local news anchors is nothing short of Orwellian.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump stood before an international audience at a press conference and told the leaders of three Baltic nations not to call on U.S. reporters, saying that American media outlets are \"fake news.\"\n\nTrump popularized the term \u201cfake news\" as a candidate, and then turned it into a weapon to use against stories he doesn't like. His use of the term has spread to other government officials, who have followed in his footsteps and now wield the term to get away with their own misdeeds by labeling critical reporting as \"fake.\"\n\nAs the Associated Press reported in March, \"President Donald Trump's campaign to discredit the news media has spread to officials at all levels of government, who are echoing his use of the term 'fake news' as a weapon against unflattering stories.\"\n\n\"It's become ubiquitous as a signal to a politician's supporters to ignore legitimate reporting and hard questions, as a smear of the beleaguered and dwindling local press corps, and as a way for conservatives to push back against what they call biased stories,\" AP reported, citing several instances in which lawmakers have used the term to dismiss questions and downplay evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nAlso this week, Bloomberg Law reported on a chilling plan by the Department of Homeland Security to compile a list of more than 290,000 journalists, bloggers, and \"media influencers\" for the purpose of tracking and monitoring them. According to the report, DHS is \"seeking a contractor that can help it monitor traditional news sources as well as social media and identify 'any and all' coverage related to the agency or a particular event.\"\n\nUltimately, DHS wants to set up a database of \"influencers\" that the government can use to browse based on \"location, beat, and type of influence.\" The database would include \"present contact details and any other information that could be relevant, including publications this influencer writes for, and an overview of the previous coverage published by the media influencer.'\"\n\nEven if the intent of such a database is not nefarious, the potential for abuse is endless. And given that lawmakers have actually proposed legislation that would force journalists to register and receive a license from the government, it's reasonable to ask whether this database could lay the foundation for the government to surveil American journalists \u2014 and ultimately, to curtail their work.\n\nNews of the DHS plan came amid reports that the State Department is considering a proposal that would require all visa applicants to the U.S. turn over their social media information for the previous five years.\n\nAll of this followed a weekend during which Trump publicly contemplated using the government to punish news outlets that don\u2019t follow in the footsteps of Trump-friendly outlets like Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting. And the day after Trump made the suggestion, his 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale called for CNN reporter Jim Acosta to be disciplined for asking Trump a question.\n\nThis is, quite literally, an attack on a fundamental pillar of our democracy.\n\nBut it's more than that \u2014 it's an assault on our Constitution by a leader who swore to uphold and protect it.\n\nAs Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations\u2019 high commissioner for human rights, noted last year, \"Freedom of the press, not only sort of a cornerstone of the U.S. Constitution but very much something that the United States defended over the years, is now itself under attack from the president.\""

    "text": "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker released his financial disclosure form, and it shows a big paycheck from a dark money group and possible Hatch Act violations.\n\nLate Tuesday, Trump's acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, finally released his financial disclosure form. While it is a pretty sparse document, what does appear there says a lot about Whitaker \u2014 and it's not good.\n\nFirst, it was difficult to even get Whitaker to release the form. Two weeks ago, when his appointment was first announced, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) asked to see his previous disclosures. As disclosure forms are public, that should have happened right away.\n\nInstead, he revised the forms five times in those two weeks. It isn't quite as bad as Jared Kushner revising his disclosure forms over 40 times, but it still isn't great.\n\nNext, the form shows that over the last three years, Whitaker raked in $1.2 million from a dark money group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT). FACT won't reveal the source of its funding but says its goal is to \"expose unethical conduct by public officials.\"\n\nHowever, two years ago, FACT supposedly existed to study the impact of environmental regulations. That version of the group, according to a former board member, only existed on paper. Even its current incarnation appears to have no other employees than Whitaker.\n\nThen there is the curious fact that he received campaign donations totaling $8,800 during 2017. Those donations were for his failed 2014 Senate bid but were received after he had already joined the DOJ. This likely violates the Hatch Act, which bans executive branch employees from asking for or receiving campaign donations.\n\nThis isn't the only problem the acting attorney general faces right now. His appointment to the job, without Senate confirmation, is so problematic that even conservative commentators agree the move was illegal. He also faces a lawsuit over the appointment. That lawsuit may also relate to the timing of Whitaker's appointment, a date that is currently shrouded in secrecy.\n\nWhile Jeff Sessions' forced resignation was announced Nov. 7, the White House refuses to say when Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff, was actually appointed to take his place.\n\nWith his stream of dark money, his Hatch Act violations, and his continuously revised disclosure forms, Whitaker looks a lot like his boss. Trump is also very interested in hiding the sources of his income and perpetually campaigning in order to raise even more money. Their unethical behavior, unfortunately, makes them a perfect fit.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "At the behest of far-right fringe figures, Trump's Department of Agriculture forced 4-H, the agriculturally-focused youth group, to rescind guidance that welcomed LGBT youth.\n\nEarlier this year, the youth organization 4-H proposed language saying that it would welcome \"all gender identities, gender expressions, sexual orientations, and sexes.\" Additionally, the proposed language called for 4-H clubs to let transgender people use the accommodations that conform with their gender identity.\n\nRight-wing Christians immediately reacted with fury, accusing 4-H of fomenting a \"transgender revolution in rural America.\"\n\nPrior to the Trump administration, this sort of thinking might have been relegated to Fox News and right-wing blogs. Now, however, these bigoted views are reflected in the highest echelons of the Trump administration, which means that the LGBT-affirming language was inevitably removed.\n\nThe major architect of making sure that the language was removed was Heidi Green. At the time, Green was the chief of staff for USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue. Prior to being named to Trump\u2019s cabinet, the very conservative Perdue had served as governor of Georgia, where he did things like holding public vigils to pray for rain.\n\nPerdue also has a long history as a homophobe, having opposed marriage equality and, while running for governor, denounced \"liberal judges and radical homosexual activists.\"\n\nGreen\u2019s demand that the language be taken down was directed at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the body that oversees 4-H at the national level. Her demand led to NIFA insistently urging that 4-H organizations in New York and Iowa remove the LGBT guidance.\n\nUltimately, it also led to the firing of Iowa 4-H director John-Paul Chaisson-C\u00e1rdenas, who had defended the policy. That firing was celebrated by conservatives.\n\nThis is just the latest in a long series of actions by the Trump administration to harm already-marginalized communities. Trump himself demanded a transgender troop ban that appeared to be a product of his Fox News viewing habits, and also enthusiastically embraced the cruel practice of family separation.\n\nBut the rest of his administration works hard at being equally cruel.\n\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions scorned domestic violence victims that simply wanted a better life in America. Betsy DeVos met with a group that shamed rape survivors and let them weigh in on federal guidelines for handling campus sexual assault.\n\nIt was inevitable that someone like Perdue and his chief of staff would take the opportunity to harm another marginalized community as soon as they got the chance.\n\n4-H\u2019s motto has always been \"To make the best better.\" Sadly, under the Trump administration, that goal entirely excludes LGBT youth."

    "text": "Trump's decision to send troops to the border to fight a non-existent threat could be the most expensive campaign season ploy ever.\n\nTrump's campaign season stunt of sending thousands of U.S. active duty troops to the Mexico border to fend off a non-existent \"invasion\" will likely come with gigantic price tag of hundreds of millions of dollars. And that cost could balloon if the political production is extended into 2019.\n\nFor now, Trump has ordered approximately 8,000 troops be dispatched to the border to supposedly reinforce security as refugees from Central American slowly make their way to the United States in search of asylum.\n\nBased on Pentagon estimates for how much it costs to deploy active duty troops, and the machinery that accompanies whenever they go into action, the border stunt \"could cost between $200 million and $300 million\" this year, CNN reports.\n\nThat estimate includes the ongoing costs for the 2,000 National Guardsmen Trump already sent to the border back in spring.\n\nTrying to turn asylum-seekers into objects of white-hot conservative hatred during the campaign season, Trump and the right-wing media have unleashed baseless and dangerous attacks, suggesting the crowd of migrants is filled with killers and disease-infested refugees.\n\nMike Pence claimed it was \"inconceivable that there are not people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than 7,000 people advancing toward our border,\" and insisted he had \"the statistics\" to back that up. (He did not.)\n\n\"It\u2019s a political ploy to blow upon the embers of racism and nativism, and he is using the military again as a political prop to advance his own agenda,\" said former Marine Will Fischer, now with the advocacy group VoteVets.\n\nSoon after making the announcement about the active duty deployment, and without consulting military officials, Trump publicly announced the U.S. was going to send far more troops \u2014 as many as 15,000 U.S. personnel.\n\nThe AP provided context for that enormous number. \"A deployment of 15,000 would bring the military commitment on the border to roughly the same level as in war-torn Afghanistan.\"\n\nIn Afghanistan, U.S. troops are fighting the Taliban. At the border, U.S. troops would square off against unarmed refugees, mostly women and children.\n\nBut even that's not quite accurate, because according to federal law, established to make sure the military would not police its own population, U.S. soldiers are restricted in what they can do on American soil with regards to law enforcement.\n\nThat means, despite Trump's reckless threats about how federal troops may open fire on the refugees, deployed personnel at the border won\u2019t be able to seize illegal drugs, detain migrants, or an in away directly stop people from crossing into the U.S.\n\nThat's likely one reason why key voices within the military community continue to condemn Trump's blatantly partisan move.\n\n\"This operation is a political stunt,\" wrote Ret. Col. Paul Yingling, who commanded U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nIn a tweet last week, Gen. Martin Dempsey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, derided the border operation as a \"wasteful deployment of over-stretched Soldiers and Marines.\"\n\nAnd VoteVets' Fischer noted, \"Unless there is a Democratic Congress that actually does oversight, Trump and the GOP will keep blowing Americans\u2019 hard-earned dollars on ridiculous stunts like this, further running up record deficits, and use that as their excuse to cut Social Security, Medicare, health care, destroy and privatize the VA, and more.\"\n\nFor Trump, his personal corruption extends to all branches of the government.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's prolific tweeting shows he is more willing to attack television shows and American patriots than Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.\n\nSince moving into the Oval Office, Trump has used his Twitter account to attack Americans like John McCain and Dianne Feinstein way more often than his pal Vladimir Putin.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive analysis by the New York Times, Trump has attacked the FBI 24 times as often as Putin, and his own Department of Justice 8 times as often.\n\nThe Times catalogued 547 people, places, or things Trump has insulted on Twitter since he first announced his campaign for president.\n\nBut among Trump's wide-ranging name-calling and petty insults, Russia's dictator was on the receiving end only one single, solitary time: On April 8, 2018, Trump attacked Putin for backing Syrian dictator Bashir Assad.\n\nBy comparison, Trump has insulted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau five times, the European Union seven times, NATO five times, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan twice.\n\nTrump's unwillingness to say anything negative about Putin, who directed Russia to help Trump in the 2016 election, is noteworthy. Trump's campaign is under investigation for illegally coordinating with Russia, and Trump himself is under additional scrutiny for trying to obstruct that investigation.\n\nThe investigation, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, has already led to dozens of indictments and several convictions or guilty pleas, including Trump's former campaign chair Paul Manafort, deputy campaign chair Rick Gates, and longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nAs he is apt to do when women express their wishes, Trump has completely ignored his wife's lackluster efforts to #BeBest on social media, unleashing a regular flood of scorn and animosity.\n\nTrump attacked McCain seven times, Feinstein three times, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper give times, and former CIA Director John Brennan seven times.\n\nOf course, Trump berates all three federal branches of the American government more than often that he criticizes Putin, managing to attack the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals three times and James Robart, a U.S. district judge in Washington, eight times.\n\nTrump also attacks American states and territories, most notably when they are already suffering.\n\nEven as California families struggle with wildfires that killed dozens with hundreds still missing, Trump attacked the state's forest management efforts three times.\n\nAfter Puerto Rico was devastated by hurricanes, Trump attacked Puerto Ricans twice in addition to singling out San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz for multiple insults.\n\nTrump's Twitter attacks aren't limited to politics. He spent more time mocking the 2017 Emmy Awards ratings (two tweets) than saying anything critical about Putin. And he insulted \"Saturday Night Live\" four times.\n\nHe leveled the same amount of anger at the bullpen of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team (one tweet) as he has at Putin.\n\nOn at least one occasion, Trump used Twitter to both cast aspersions on a political opponent and simultaneously try to help his pal Putin.\n\nLeading up to the midterms, Trump twice insulted California Democrat Harley Rouda.\n\nIn the end, Rouda won his election, defeating a close ally of both Trump and Putin: Congressman Dana Rohrabacher.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Borrowing Trump's despotic language, Russia invoked the term 'fake news' to discredit reports about the chemical attacks in Syria.\n\nTaking a cue from Trump, the Russian government on Sunday dismissed reports of a deadly chemical attack in the Syrian town of Douma, referring to the reporting as \"fake news\" and accusing rebel groups of fabricating the story.\n\nAccording to the International Rescue Committee, more than 70 people were reportedly killed Saturday when Syrian forces dropped barrel bombs filled with toxic gas over the rebel-held city of Douma. An additional 500 people \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 were injured in the chemical attack.\n\nThis marks the eighth chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians since Trump took office.\n\nJust as we've seen in each previous attack, the Russian government, which supports the Syrian regime, was quick to dismiss reports that Syrian forces were to blame \u2014 and thanks to Trump, Russia had a script to follow.\n\nBorrowing Trump's despotic language about the press, Russia invoked the term \"fake news\" to discredit reports about the atrocity and foster distrust of the news media in an effort to delegitimize future reporting.\n\n\"Fake news on the use of chlorine or other chemical agents by the government forces continue,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \"Another piece of such fabricated information on the alleged chemical attack in Douma emerged yesterday.\"\n\nThe Russian government also referred to the attack as a \"hoax\" that was \"fabricated\" to justify Western intervention in Syria.\n\nOnline, Russian media outlets like RT and Sputnik have been busy pushing propaganda to discredit news reports about the chemical attacks.\n\nRussian-linked networks on social media have also joined in the effort, pushing out \"alternative facts\" to spin the narrative. On Sunday, topics and hashtags related to the chemical attacks dominated the activity on Securing Democracy's Hamilton 68 Dashboard, which tracks 600 Twitter accounts linked to Russian influence operations.\n\nThis is just the latest example of how Trump's use of the term \"fake news\" has been used by repressive regimes around the world to undermine the free press, reject evidence of human rights abuses, and stoke cynicism about the objectivity of news media.\n\nSyrian president Bashar al-Assad and other Syrian government officials have repeatedly borrowed the term, using it to dismiss evidence that the government summarily executed prisoners and murdered civilians with chemical weapons.\n\n\u201cYou can forge anything these days. We\u2019re living in a fake-news era,\" the Syrian dictator said in February, referencing an Amnesty International report that up to 13,000 prisoners had been executed in one of his military prisons.\n\nIn December, Politico identified 15 instances in which autocratic leaders or state media have used the term \"fake news\" to dismiss questions about human rights violations.\n\n\"By aligning themselves with Trump\u2019s words, despots have been able to use the U.S. president as a shield for their attacks on press freedom and human rights,\" Politico reported.\n\nThere is clear evidence that the use of the term \"fake news\" to dismiss allegations of widespread human rights atrocities has picked up since Trump took office. Politifact found more than a dozen such instances since Trump took office \u2014 and none before then.\n\nDespots use information (and disinformation) as a weapon, and Trump's anti-press rhetoric has armed dictators around the world, emboldening them to carry out atrocities \u2014 and giving them a roadmap to get away with it."

    "text": "Only 11 Syrian refugees have been allowed into the U.S. this year, a figure that is dwarfed by the number of bombs Trump dropped on Syria in a single night.\n\nThe U.S. fired at least 118 missiles in an airstrike on Syria Friday night, in what Trump claimed was a response to the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons against its own people.\n\nSpeaking about the chemical attack that killed as many 70 civilians last weekend, Trump called the incident a \"heinous attack on innocent Syrians,\" adding, \"This is about humanity. We\u2019re talking about humanity.\"\n\nIndeed, this is about humanity. But Trump wasn't so concerned about humanity when he slammed the door shut on Syrian refugees and turned his back on the world's most vulnerable people.\n\nAccording to the State Department, the U.S. has only allowed 11 Syrian refugees into the country since the start of 2018 \u2014 meaning that the number of bombs Trump dropped on Syria in one night is about 10 times greater than the number of Syrian refugees he has allowed into the country all year.\n\nFor comparison, during the last year of President Barack Obama's presidency in 2016, the U.S. let 15,479 Syrian refugees into the country. By mid-April 2016, almost 800 Syrian refugees had already been resettled that year \u2014 about 79 times as many as this year.\n\nAlmost immediately after taking office, Trump slammed the door on those refugees with his first \"travel ban,\" which prohibited all refugees and all arrivals from Syria. Despite being put on hold and restricted by the courts, the ban still had its intended effect as refugee admissions plummeted.\n\nWhen the 120-day refugee ban expired in October, Trump replaced it with a pause on refugee admissions from 11 countries, including Syria. The U.S. started accepting refugees from Syria again in January, but the \"vetting\" procedures put in place by the Trump administration have effectively barred Syrian refugees from entering the country.\n\nOnly 44 Syrians fleeing war have found refuge in the U.S. since October 2017 \u2014 a 99 percent drop from the same period the year before.\n\nAnd Trump didn't just turn his back on Syrian refugees \u2014 he dehumanized them, criminalized them, and cast them as so dangerous that he inspired attacks against them.\n\nTaking his cruel assault even further, Trump publicly condemned the leaders of countries like Germany \u2014 which has taken in a huge number of people seeking asylum \u2014 for accepting refugees, and urged them to shut their doors, too.\n\nThe United Nations has declared the Syrian refugee crisis to be the worst in modern history. Just this week, Defense Secretary James Mattis described the atrocities in Syria, saying, \"I've seen refugees from Asia to Europe, Kosovo to Africa. I've never seen refugees as traumatized as coming out of Syria. It's got to end.\"\n\nBut bombing Syria isn't going to end the refugee crisis \u2014 and falsely invoking humanitarianism as a rationale to launch a largely ineffective airstrike isn't going to help the innocent Syrians Trump spoke of this week.\n\nIf Trump cares about humanity, he should stop turning his back on the humanitarian crisis at his doorstep."

    "text": "Donald Trump's failure to condemn white supremacist violence is a symptom of a much larger problem within the Republican party.\n\nIn a shocking press conference Tuesday, Donald Trump defended white supremacists and blamed \u201cmany sides\u201d for the fatal violence that erupted days before at a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump\u2019s unhinged statement was outrageous and beyond the pale. But as far as downplaying the growing problem of white supremacy and violent right-wing extremism in America, he was not alone. Republican leaders, as usual, are enabling him from the sidelines.\n\nAs Politico reported Monday, Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee are pleading with their GOP colleagues to hold congressional hearings to look into the rise of white supremacist violence.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it has become clear we cannot count on President Trump for action,\" the Democrats wrote in a letter to committee chairman Mike McCaul (R-TX).\n\n\"Even before he was elected, many of us were concerned that his unwillingness to denounce and distance himself from white nationalists would be taken as tacit support by those ready to use violence to advance their racist ideology,\" the letter continued. \"As leaders of the legislative branch of government, we must stand up to all ideologically-motivated violence.\"\n\nBut Republicans don\u2019t seem to view white supremacist violence as a priority. Democrats have already called for such hearings twice this year, and numerous times in previous years, but their GOP colleagues have ignored the requests.\n\nBecause they are the minority party, Democrats cannot schedule and hold hearings on their own, so the responsibility for doing so falls on the shoulders of Republicans \u2014 an onus they have consistently shirked.\n\nEven the bigotry-driven violence in Virginia, which led to the death of a young woman and injured 19 others, has not been enough to move McCaul to act. According to Dallas News, McCaul has once again refused to hold any standalone hearings focused on white supremacy and neo-Nazi extremism. Instead, he says Democrats can raise their concerns next month at an annual hearing to assess worldwide threats to the homeland.\n\nThis response \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 should not come as a surprise to anyone. Republicans have consistently failed to hold Trump accountable as he elevated and aligned himself with white supremacists.\n\nSure, many of them condemned the white supremacists in Charlottesville \u2014 but they\u2019ve shown no concern about the white supremacists in the Trump administration.\n\nWhen Trump brought white nationalist Steve Bannon on as his chief strategist, Republicans did nothing. When he hired white supremacist Stephen Miller as a senior adviser, Republicans were silent. When he nominated lifelong racist Jeff Sessions to lead the Department of Justice, Republicans confirmed him unanimously.\n\nEven as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are warning of the growing threat of white supremacist violence, Republicans still won\u2019t even hold a hearing to address the problem.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s because they, too, depend on the support of white supremacists, and have chosen to appease them rather than risk losing voters."

There is no depth to which this guy won\u2019t go to help lowlifes make money, at the expense of honorable Americans,\" said Will Fischer, director of government relations at VoteVets.\n\nTrump illegally installed Mulvaney as acting director of the agency in November, even though then-Deputy Director Leandra English had already been appointed to the post by retiring director Richard Cordray. English filed a lawsuit against Trump and Mulvaney as a result.\n\nIn July, however, English announced she was resigning from CFPB and dropping her lawsuit, because Trump is now following the law by seeking Senate confirmation for a permanent director.\n\nOnce Mulvaney took over the consumer protection agency, he immediately began dropping the enforcement and weakening the regulations that are supposed to protect consumers.\n\nIn January, for instance, Mulvaney forced the CFPB to roll back Obama-era regulations that protected poor consumers from being trapped into loans they could not afford to pay back.\n\nMulvaney's CFPB also dropped investigations and enforcement actions against payday lenders who disproportionately prey on military veterans and service members.\n\nNow, Mulvaney is taking one last shot at our military before the Senate votes on the nomination of Mulvaney's permanent replacement, Kathy Kraninger.\n\nBut the badly weakened CFPB isn't likely to get stronger if Kraninger is confirmed; she is just a less-qualified underling from Mulvaney's Office of Management and Budget.\n\nTrump has been a disaster for American workers and consumers in general. But it is particularly disturbing to see the Trump administration targeting our bravest \u2014 even as Trump hypocritically wraps himself in the flag and disrespects our troops at every turn.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

The latest numbers as of Monday morning are about 135 and counting, according to CNN's Brian Stelter.\n\nThe push was organized by the Boston Globe and is supported by the American Society of News Editors. The Globe's editorial staff approached other news outlets to ask them to write editorials on this subject.\n\nEach paper's editorial will be different, but all will address the same theme: the White House's dangerous attacks on the First Amendment.\n\n\"Publications, whatever their politics, could make a powerful statement by standing together in the common defense of their profession and the vital role it plays in government for and by the people,\" the Boston Globe's appeal to other editorial boards read.\n\nThe collective media pushback, one of the first of its kind since Trump took office, comes as the United Nations' high commissioner of human rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, warns that Trump's unhinged, anti-press rhetoric could \"easily\" lead to journalists being physically attacked.\n\nHe stressed that Trump's outbursts are \"getting very close to incitement to violence,\" which might cause journalists to engage in \"self-censorship\" to protect themselves.\n\nTargeting the free press and demonizing reporters is a habit of authoritarian leaders who are anxious to undermine journalism's crucial oversight role in open societies.\n\nTrump's unprecedented attacks on journalism as an institution seem to have escalated in recent months as bad news has piled up for his administration, particularly involving the Russia investigation. He's taken to calling the press \"the enemy of the people,\" a phrase that echoes Joseph Stalin's attacks on his enemies.\n\nAnd it's not just Trump; White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently refused to back down from Trump's hateful claims that journalists are the \"enemy of the people.\"\n\nThat came after a mob of Trump supporters at a Tampa rally came dangerously close to attacking reporters who were there covering the event.\n\nAs the pressure on Trump grows, he is also telling even more lies in public than ever before during his time in office.\n\nBut now, journalists are uniting to tell the truth about his dangerous behavior.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

This is what an autocrat does.\"\n\nDean noted that political scientists have developed checklists to assess world leaders for signs of autocratic behavior, and that \"Trump is checking all the boxes.\"\n\n\"You just said that Richard Nixon would tell Donald Trump he\u2019s going too far?\" Berman responded, calling the statement \"extraordinary.\"\n\n\"I think he would,\" Dean replied. \"This is clearly a level that Richard Nixon never went to, where you went after somebody\u2019s personal well-being by a criminal prosecution.\"\n\nDean said he listened to all of the Nixon tapes, referring to the infamous recordings of the scandal-plagued former president talking about a plan to break into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Hotel.\n\n\"While I heard him break the law on some of those tapes, I never heard him do it by turning on his enemies and trying to put them in jail,\" Dean said. \"This is really very, very heavy sledding.\"\n\nCarl Bernstein, one of the Washington Post reporters who broke the Watergate story, echoed Dean's remarks a few moments later, calling the revelations in the Times report a \"defining moment in the history of the Trump presidency\" and a \"demonstration of his unfitness\" for office.\n\n\"We are watching the president of the United States undermine the very principles of our democracy,\" Bernstein added.\n\nWhile Trump has frequently expressed his desire to prosecute his political rivals, the new report suggests that he took things even further and actually tried to make the DOJ act on his wishes.\n\nAccording to the report, Trump told then-White House counsel Don McGahn in the spring of 2018 that he wanted to order the DOJ to pursue charges against both Comey and Clinton. It's not clear what he wanted to prosecute them for, the Times noted.\n\nMcGahn reportedly pushed back on the suggestion and said Trump did not have the authority to do so. He then informed Trump that although he could legally ask the DOJ to open an investigation, such a request would be seen as an abuse of power and could result in serious consequences.\n\nTo underscore the gravity of the situation, McGahn and other White House lawyers wrote a memo outlining Trump's authorities as president and warning him that asking for the prosecutions of Comey and Clinton could lead to impeachment.\n\nDecades of historical precedent and institutional norms dictate that the DOJ should operate independently of the White House. After Nixon abused the DOJ to protect his allies, new guidelines were established to limit the president's ability to interfere with DOJ affairs.\n\nBut as an autocrat-in-the-making, Trump doesn't believe norms, rules, or laws apply to him. Since taking office, he has repeatedly compromised the independence of the DOJ to shield himself and go after his rivals, often with the support of his Republican allies in Congress.\n\nWith a cult of supporters enabling him, Trump is unlikely to reign in his authoritarian tendencies anytime soon.\n\nBut now that Democrats have the majority in the House of Representatives, they also have subpoena power. That means for the first time of his presidency, Trump will have to answer for his many abuses of power.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The ploy didn't help Republicans win in the midterm elections.\n\nThe Pentagon has acknowledged that, despite Trump's fearmongering about the refugee caravan traveling from Central America, the mission given to soldiers at the border is effectively over, and they will soon return home on schedule.\n\nLt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the Army commander of the mission, told Reuters the \"number of U.S. troops at the border with Mexico may have peaked at about 5,800.\" They were initially expecting more than 7,000 troops, according to Reuters.\n\nThe original order authorized by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis put troops at the border in support of U.S. Customs and Border (CBP) until Dec. 15. Buchanan told Reuters, \"It is a hard date. And we have no indications that CBP is going to need us to do our work for longer than that.\"\n\nThe acknowledgement is effectively an admission that Trump's heated rhetoric and lies, amplified by fellow Republicans and outlets like Fox News, was a big fake out. The deployment never reached the 15,000 Trump ranted to reporters about in late October, for example.\n\nBut the heated rhetoric was right in line with the desperate move Trump and Republicans adopted facing massive defeat in the midterms, attempting to characterize refugees seeking help from America as a dangerous group of criminals hoping to hurt innocent people.\n\nMike Pence even said that since the Honduran refugees were not from Mexico, they must be Middle Eastern and secretly terrorists.\n\nTax cuts couldn't save the Republican majority, so they turned to racism, lies, and xenophobia, with an assist from the mainstream media.\n\nWhat that became in the real world was a nonsensical deployment of military to the border. When the troops got there, their mission consisted of putting up concertina wire and shoveling horse manure. Thousands of soldiers will be away from their families at Thanksgiving as a result.\n\nAnd Republicans ended up losing the House anyway.\n\nThe vast majority of refugees are still hundreds of miles away from the border and are not a threat to American security requiring a military response anyway.\n\nThe Pentagon's statement that the troops are unlikely to be needed after Dec. 15 confirms that the deployment was, as many said, a pre-election stunt.\n\nAmerican soldiers and their families were disgustingly used as pawns in the Republican Party's cynical game, and tax dollars were wasted just to please Trump.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

While Trump whines that he is \"too busy,\" he typically spends his weekends playing golf at various resorts along the east coast.\n\nWhen Trump flew to Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, he couldn't even bother to attend a major ceremony at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery because it was drizzling outside.\n\nWhen he returned, Trump skipped the Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington Cemetery, flatly refusing to honor those who fought and died for this country.\n\nNow, in addition to tearing troops away from their loved ones at Thanksgiving, Trump is telling Americans to not even bother thinking about them.\n\nWhat a shameful message to send to Americans at Thanksgiving.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Joni Ernst (R-IA) is concerned, this shameful misuse of our military was actually a great \"opportunity for real-life training.\"\n\nIn an interview on Face the Nation, Ernst tried to spin Trump's multi-million dollar boondoggle into some kind of positive for military readiness.\n\nErnst said deploying troops to the U.S.-Mexico border gives those troops \"greater opportunity to respond quickly in those types of situations, whether they are supporting with food or body armor, whatever it might be for Border Patrol agents.\"\n\nFor the most part, however, \"whatever it might be\" looks like troops shoveling horse manure and putting up concertina wire instead of enjoying turkey and stuffing with their loved ones.\n\nWhat a great \"opportunity.\"\n\nIt's not surprising that Ernst would bend over backwards to defend something indefensible from Trump. Ernst has voted for the Trump agenda more than 91 percent of the time over the past two years, including supporting the failed GOP tax scam and efforts to take health care away from millions of families.\n\nConservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin called out Ernst, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, for failing to speak out against \"a president using troops as props.\"\n\n\"She appears to be just another Trump enabler,\" Rubin said.\n\nErnst, a first-term senator, will be up for re-election in Iowa in 2020. While the state supported Trump in 2016, Iowa voters strongly rejected his agenda in the 2018 midterms.\n\nBefore the midterm election, Republicans held three of the state's four congressional seats. Now Democrats control three of the four, after flipping two seats from red to blue.\n\nIf Ernst can't \"start putting distance between herself and the toxic president,\" Rubin argued, \"she'll be a sitting duck in 2020.\"\n\nYet Ernst just keeps defending Trump, even if it means turning her back on military families.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "The extremist group has close ties to the Trump White House, the Republican Party, and high-profile right-wing media figures.\n\nThe FBI now classifies the violent pro-Trump Proud Boys gang as an extremist group, according to a new document from the Clark County Sheriff's Office in Washington state.\n\nThe law enforcement document, which was obtained by the Guardian via the government transparency group Property of the People, represents the first reported instance of the FBI officially referring to the gang as an \"extremist\" organization.\n\n\"The FBI categorizes the Proud Boys to be an extremist group with ties to white nationalism,\" wrote Commander Michael McCabe, who authored the report on Aug. 10.\n\nThe document \u2014 an internal affairs report describing an investigation into a sheriff's deputy's membership in the Proud Boys \u2014 states that the \"Proud Boys were publically [sic] categorized as an extremist group by the FBI in 2018.\" In an interview with the Guardian, McCabe confirmed the authenticity of the document and said the designation of the Proud Boys as an extremist group was revealed to him in an Aug. 2 briefing by the FBI. The FBI said they \"have been warning [local law enforcement] for a while\" about the Proud Boys, not just in Washington but around the nation, McCabe told the Guardian.\n\n\"The FBI has warned local law enforcement agencies that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific Northwest,\" he wrote in the document.\n\n\"Proud Boys members have contributed to the recent escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses, and in cities like Charlottesville, Virginia, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington,\" the document added.\n\nThe Proud Boys were founded in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign and have made a name for themselves with their violent brand of neo-fascism, which is characterized by explicitly anti-feminist, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-transgender, and anti-liberal ideology.\n\nThe group is also explicitly pro-Trump, and members can often be seen wearing red MAGA hats as part of their unofficial uniform. As the Southern Poverty Law Center explains, \"There is an obvious overlap between their views and those of President Donald Trump, whose election in 2016 played a clear role in increasing Proud Boys' membership.\"\n\nMembers of the Proud Boys have often aligned and worked alongside members of other hate groups, and they've made frequent appearances at white supremacist rallies and other extremist events like the deadly \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe organizer of \"Unite the Right,\" Jason Kessler, is a former member of the Proud Boys.\n\nThe group's founder, Gavin McInnes, has repeatedly called for members of his gang to carry out acts of political violence, and even established a \"militant division\" devoted to street fighting. Those calls have been heeded.\n\nFor over a year and a half, the gang has unleashed violent attacks from coast to coast \u2014 and they've done it all while cultivating close relationships with Republican Party officials and lawmakers, Trump associates, and high-profile right-wing media figures.\n\nTrump and the GOP have thus far refused to condemn the Proud Boys, even in the aftermath of violent incidents like a recent mob-style attack following an appearance at a mainstream Republican institution in New York City. Meanwhile, right-wing media outlets like Fox News have alternated between completely ignoring the group's violence at times, or blaming it on Democrats at other times.\n\nThe FBI's designation of the Proud Boys as an extremist group comes amid a series of moves by Trump to shutter government programs aimed at countering violent extremism and far-right domestic terrorism. This is despite recent reports documenting a rise in hate crimes and white supremacist violence.\n\nMoves like this help to explain why violent extremists have become so emboldened under Trump's leadership.\n\nThe Proud Boys are one of many extremist groups that sprouted up during or right after Trump's presidential campaign, and their close alliance with the GOP reflects the mutually beneficial relationship that has developed between the Republican establishment and the most extreme elements of the far-right.\n\nAccording to the SPLC, extremist groups have thrived under the Trump presidency, with the number of neo-Nazi groups growing from 99 to 121 in 2017, and anti-Muslim organizations increasing from 101 chapters to 114. But the surge in extremist groups has been most intense among white supremacist groups closely aligned with Trump.\n\n\"Groups that latched onto Trump flourished,\" SPLC reports.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump, the Republican Party, and the right-wing media figures who helped mainstream the Proud Boys will change their tune now that the FBI has officially classified the group as an extremist organization. However, all available evidence suggests they won't.\n\nAfter all, if the GOP and its media allies suddenly decide to reject far-right extremism, they'll also be rejecting some of their most fervent supporters.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

When the fire came through they were unprepared,\" Zinke told Breitbart, referring to residents and business owners who suffered through the fires.\n\n\"I'm not sure that Paradise will return. ... They're strong people, but it's not an affluent neighborhood,\" he added.\n\nAnd rather than offer any real plans or words of comfort, Zinke opted to take cheap shots at political adversaries.\n\nZinke told Breitbart \"it's not the time for finger-pointing.\" But exactly 10 seconds later, Zinke blamed \"radical environmentalists\" for the deadly blazes which have killed at least 82 people so far (79 in Northern California, 3 in Southern California).\n\n\"I will lay this on the foot of those environmental radicals that have prevented us from managing the forests for years, and you know what, this is on them,\" Zinke went on to say, making wild accusations that have no factual support.\n\nZinke's politically biased lies were previously refuted by the Pasadena Firefighters Association, which said, \"The fires in So.

John Garamendi (D-CA) told Shareblue Media in August. That's because the state is now entering its \"third decade of significant ecological changes as a result of the climate getting hotter.\"\n\nTrump pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, and he regularly ignores the advice of scientists who work for the administration.\n\nThe Trump administration's plan for dealing with the devastating impact of climate change seems to be nothing more than political blame games.\n\nThat won't solve anything.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump's allies are orchestrating a smear campaign against Jamal Khashoggi to take the heat off Trump for his failure to hold Saudi Arabia accountable.\n\nIn a sick new form of victim-blaming, Republicans and right-wing pundits are mounting a smear campaign against murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi in what appears to be a twisted effort to shield Trump from criticism of his poor handling of the scandal.\n\nCiting four anonymous GOP officials, the Washington Post reports that \"a cadre of conservative House Republicans allied with Trump has been privately exchanging articles from right-wing outlets that fuel suspicion of Khashoggi,\" an apparent first step in a coming character assault.\n\nWhat started as a behind-the-scenes \"whispering campaign\" has begun to spill over into the public eye as pro-Trump media figures and platforms \u2014 including Rush Limbaugh, Donald Trump Jr., Front Page, Fox News, and several prominent voices on social media \u2014 have started to amplify the attacks and conspiracy theories about Khashoggi, who was reportedly murdered and dismembered at the Saudi consulate in Instanbul under orders from the Saudi crown prince.\n\nThe smears, which have been amplified by pro-Saudi accounts on Twitter, \"are aimed in part at protecting Trump\" and supporting his refusal to confront his allies in the Saudi regime about the slain journalist, the Post reports. On Thursday, Twitter removed a network of pro-Saudi automated accounts (\"bots\") that were spreading false claims about Khashoggi.\n\nAccording to the Post, the main lines of attack focus on falsely characterizing Khashoggi as a terrorist sympathizer with close personal ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and distorting his interactions as a journalist with former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe GOP officials who spoke with the Post declined to reveal the identities of the Republican lawmakers and other Trump allies who are circulating the information attacking Khashoggi \"because they said doing so would risk exposing them as sources.\"\n\nHowever, some of these attacks have already made their way into public view as pundits on Fox News have parroted the smear linking Khashoggi to the Muslim Brotherhood, and using it to imply that the journalist isn't deserving of such a widespread outpouring of support, and even that he may have brought on his own murder.\n\nOn conservative CR-TV, a broadcast viewed more than 12,000 times labeled Khashoggi a \"longtime friend\" of terrorists and attributed the outcry over his murder to an \"insane\" media conspiracy targeting Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, on Twitter, Glenn Beck invoked the same line of attack to suggest that Khashoggi was \"not a good guy\" and that \"both sides are bad here,\" while pro-Trump conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer cited the smear before warning that people should \"not allow yourselves to be manipulated by the media into feeling sorry for Jamal Khashoggi.\" This came after Donald Trump Jr. shared a post smearing Khashoggi as a terrorist.\n\nVirginia GOP Senate candidate and white supremacist sympathizer Corey Stewart joined in on the attacks Thursday, telling a local radio show that \"Khashoggi was not a good guy himself.\"\n\nOther pundits, including Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, have invoked Benghazi as a justification for dismissing the outcry over Khashoggi's murder, with Limbaugh taking things a step further and floating a conspiracy theory about the journalist not really being dead.\n\nThroughout it all, Fox News has tried to muddy the waters and cast doubt on Saudi Arabia's involvement in Khashoggi's murder, apparently in an attempt to take the heat off Trump as he coordinates with the Saudi regime to cover up its alleged role in the brutal killing.\n\nAll of this appear to be laying the groundwork for a massive smear campaign aimed at finding a way to excuse Trump's inexcusable silence about the alleged torture, murder, and dismemberment of a U.S. journalist. The excuse they're going with, evidently, is that Trump's failure to respond is acceptable because the victim isn't deserving of anything more.\n\nEven for a crowd that trafficks in victim-blaming, an orchestrated hit job on a murdered journalist is a sickening new example of how low Trump supporters are willing to go to justify his unjustifiable failures as a president and a person.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Over 60 million Americans voted for Democrats in 2018, nearing presidential levels of support in a midterm election. That is very bad news for Trump in 2020.\n\nAmericans made the blue wave a reality by casting more than 60 million votes for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm election \u2014 very close to the number of votes Trump got in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIt was an unprecedented achievement in American politics. Never before has an opposition party come so close to matching the number of votes that the president got two years earlier, according to FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver.\n\nThe 60.5 million votes, and counting, for Democrats in House races across America dwarfs the much-ballyhooed Republican takeover of the House in 2010, when the party received 44.8 million votes.\n\nThanks to this historic blue wave, Democrats retook the majority in the House and managed to hold losses to a minimum in the Senate, where the map heavily favored Republicans this year.\n\nHistorically, midterm elections don't have the same intensity and turnout as presidential elections. But in 2018, voters were motivated to send a strong message to Trump and his enablers.\n\nNone of this is good news for Trump's re-election chances in 2020.\n\nWhen he ran in 2016, Trump received 62.9 million votes. It's only thanks to the He also lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes,\n\nThe midterm vote against Trump's party was 96 percent of his 2016 vote \u2014 and he wasn't even on the ballot.\n\nBut the election was still clearly a referendum on Trump, with 54 percent of those voting telling pollsters they disapprove of the job he has done.\n\nVoters punished Republicans harshly for standing with Trump and against oversight of his corrupt presidency.\n\nTrump has never had the support of a majority of the American people \u2014 and he is disliked now more than ever. Americans simply don't want to see him serving another term.\n\nPresidential years always have much higher turnout and engagement from voters. If Trump is this unpopular and voters are this mobilized against him in 2018, there's no telling how much worse it will get for Trump and his supporters in 2020.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) is running such a racist campaign that companies like Walmart are both renouncing their support and demanding refunds of their campaign contributions.\n\n\"Sen. Hyde-Smith's recent comments clearly do not reflect the values of our company and associates,\" Walmart tweeted. \"As a result, we are withdrawing our support and requesting a refund of all campaign donations.\"\n\nIn a recent video, Hyde-Smith is seen laughing and joking about attending a \"public hanging\" with a campaign supporter. Mississippi has a long and racist history of white crowds gathering to watch black Americans lynched in public.\n\nHyde-Smith, who is white, is in a close Senate race with Democrat Mike Espy, a black man. Both nominees received about 40 percent of the vote on Nov. 6, and the runoff election will be held on Nov. 27.\n\nWalmart had donated $2,000 to Hyde-Smith, but after pressure from news site Popular Information and celebrities like Debra Messing, the corporation is joining other companies, including Union Pacific and Boston Scientific, in demanding a refund.\n\nHyde-Smith's handling of her own bigoted remarks have Republicans \"unnerved,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nOn a conference call with donors, Hyde-Smith refused to apologize for her lynching remark, reports the Times, and instead \"offered a meandering and vague answer, saying that she was considering an apology but worried that offering one would only further fuel the issue.\"\n\nHer handling of the issue has caused \"outrage among African-Americans, discomfort among educated whites who are sensitive to the way their state is perceived nationally,\" added the Times.\n\n\"We're going to have to see moderate white folks in Mississippi, enough of them, say: That's not how we want to be represented; that's not how we want to be depicted,\" Jarvis Dortch, a Democratic state representative, told the Times.\n\nIn addition to \"joking\" about lynching, Hyde-Smith also made supportive comments about voter suppression efforts.\n\nAt a campaign stop at a Mississippi college, Hyde-Smith said, \"There's a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who maybe we don't want to vote. Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that\u2019s a great idea.\"\n\nThe bungling from Hyde-Smith's campaign is helping the Espy bid to become the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Mississippi since 1982.\n\n\"People know there's a runoff.

In fact, he compared the situation to accused attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court.\n\nDefending murder is not a big leap from defending attempted rape, and Trump is showing the world that he will do both.\n\nTrump isn't acting alone, either. According to recent news reports, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is working with Saudi Arabia to help cover up the murder, working with the regime on damage control measures.\n\nOne of Trump's first acts after being sworn in was an attempt to ban Muslims from the United States. In the years since then, Trump has repeatedly called the free press \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\nNow that a Muslim U.S. journalist has been brutally murdered, Trump is helping to cover it up, just as long as the country can maintain access to cheap oil.\n\nThe oil may be cheap.

    "text": "Republicans won't denounce the strain of extremism fueling violent attacks \u2014 because doing so would mean denouncing themselves.\n\nAfter a week of terrorist violence, Republicans are defiantly trying to avoid acknowledging that the rhetoric spewed by Trump and other members of their party appears to have played a role in fueling the horrific attacks that targeted Trump's perceived enemies and, a few days later, members of a synagogue.\n\nIn the case of suspected mail bomber Cesar Sayoc, the connection to the Republican Party is hard to miss. Sayoc, a hardcore Trump supporter, drove a van covered in stickers that advertised his political beliefs and disdain for CNN, and had vocalized his animosity toward Trump's political opponents on social media.\n\nRobert Bowers, the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter, indicated in his social media posts that his deadly rampage was motivated at least in part by a conspiracy theory about Jews funding the so-called migrant \"caravan\" from Central America. Variations of this conspiracy theory were floated by Republican politicians including Rep. Matt Gaetz, Mike Pence, and Trump, as well as pundits on right-wing outlets like Fox News.\n\nIt's not difficult to make the connection between the violence that played out last week and the politics of fear and scapegoating championed by Republicans. In the weeks leading up to the attacks, Trump and his allies were busy spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric, peddling conspiracy theories about George Soros, smearing Democrats as unruly mobs, and leading chants of \"CNN Sucks!\" and \"Lock Her Up!\"\n\nPerhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise, then, that Republicans are deflecting, pointing the finger elsewhere, and refusing to comment when asked if they take responsibility for their heated rhetoric. While some GOP lawmakers have offered vague condemnations of violence and hate, their response to the spate of violence has been overwhelmingly characterized by collective silence and denial \u2014 just as it was weeks before when violence once again erupted from the extremist elements in their midst.\n\nOn Oct. 13, after leaving an event at the Metropolitan Republican Club in New York City, members of the violent pro-Trump \"Proud Boys\" gang unleashed a brutal assault on multiple individuals, leading the police to pursue riot charges against nine members. Violence is nothing new for the Proud Boys, nor is the group's relationship with mainstream GOP figures, but the link between the Republican Party and the SPLC-designated hate group had managed to remain largely under the radar \u2014 until now.\n\nThe incident itself made the Republican Party's close ties to extremism hard to miss. The Metropolitan Republican Club, which has been part of the mainstream GOP establishment in New York for more than a century, had invited Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes to speak at the club that night.\n\nMcInnes has repeatedly called for members of his gang to carry out acts of political violence, and even established a \"militant division\" devoted to street fighting. For over a year and a half, the gang has unleashed violent attacks from coast to coast, with no signs of stopping any time soon. One day after the mob-style attack in New York, members of the Proud Boys helped lead a massive street brawl in Portland, Oregon.\n\nA week before that, they were busy inciting violence and starting fights at a protest in Rhode Island. The Proud Boys often target \"antifa\" (anti-fascist protesters) and have \"joked\" about wanting to shoot and kill them. At other times, they go to liberal cities like Berkeley looking to incite political violence.\n\nIn addition to advocating for violence, McInnes has personally engaged in violent attacks on repeated occasions. In 2017, he threw a punch at someone protesting outside of a pro-Trump event in Washington, bragged about assaulting a man who looked \"kind of Hispanic,\" and was filmed smashing a cell phone that he took from a man described as being mentally disabled.\n\nViolence isn't the only thing the Proud Boys are known for \u2014 they've also made a name for themselves by spreading a new brand of far-right extremism. While McInnes doesn't like being called a white supremacist, he espouses white supremacist ideology, writes for white supremacist websites, associates with white supremacists, and is comfortable enough with Nazi symbols to have a tattoo associated with a neo-Nazi band. He's known for his anti-Muslim views, virulent misogyny, and anti-Semitic rage, and his gang has proven to be a fertile recruiting ground for white supremacists.\n\nNone of this stopped the Metropolitan Republican Club \u2014 which, according to its website, \"continues to serve as headquarters for many Republican campaigns and the New York Republican State Committee as well as host of many social and educational events\" \u2014 from embracing McInnes and giving him a platform to spread the brand of extremism for which he is known.\n\nPerhaps that's because this brand of far-right extremism is a product of the Republican Party and has now become a defining feature of it. Indeed, in the era of Trump, extremists like McInnes and the Proud Boys have found themselves being welcomed into the GOP because of their extremism, not despite it.\n\nMcInnes' appearance at the Metropolitan Republican Club reflects a broader trend of extremists embedding themselves within the Republican Party and working their way from the fringes into the mainstream. On the campaign trail, Republican politicians like Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) and Devin Nunes (R-CA) have posed for photos with Proud Boys, while former Trump aide Roger Stone has taken the first step toward becoming a member of the hate group and even shows up to events with an entourage of Proud Boys as his personal security detail.\n\nMetropolitan Republican Club chairman Ian Reilly, who reportedly invited McInnes to speak at the club, is a campaign manager for Republican New York state Sen. Marty Golden. Meanwhile, New York Republican gubernatorial nominee Marc Molinaro uses the club\u2019s building as his campaign headquarters.\n\nThe Proud Boys have also gotten a boost from right-wing media outlets like Fox News. McInnes was a contributor to Fox News for eight years and appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s show at least two dozen times. In 2017, Hannity invited a Proud Boys member with ties to the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville to come on his show and discuss political violence. Earlier this year, Tucker Carlson and Roger Stone posed for a photo with members of the hate group in a Fox News green room. Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the New York City gang beating, Glenn Beck and his fellow right-wing pundits at The Blaze devoted an entire segment to justifying the violent behavior of the Proud Boys.\n\nAt times, the alliance between the extremist group and mainstream Republican politicians has been even more overtly alarming. In a frightening event just over a week ago, Nelson Diaz, chairman of the Republican Party in Miami-Dade County, helped lead an angry mob of Proud Boys protesting against a visit by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) in South Florida. The incident, in which the all-male mob was filmed pounding on the door of Pelosi's event, became so unruly that the building had to be put on lock-down by Capitol Police and local law enforcement. Also in attendance during the mob-style protest were former aides of Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL) and GOP gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis.\n\nThe recent incident in New York City also highlights a startling dynamic whereby the Proud Boys are facilitating alliances between the GOP and the most extreme, violent elements of the far-right movement. According to the SPLC, at least three members of local skinhead gangs were among those who attended McInnes' speech and participated in the violence afterwards. By eschewing the traditional symbols of the white supremacist and neo-Nazi movements, the Proud Boys have put a fresh face on extremism and provided a conduit for skinhead movements to establish direct connections to the Republican Party."

    "text": "Like most of Trump's weird ideas, his latest claim about Finland using rakes to fight fires is a garbled version of something he saw on TV.\n\nTrump has said plenty of spectacularly dumb and uninformed things about science. But while touring the devastation from California's wildfires this weekend, Trump uttered one of the weirdest dumb and uninformed things he's ever said about science.\n\nCalifornia wouldn\u2019t have all these problems with deadly wildfires, Trump claimed, if they just raked the forest floors, like they do in Finland.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take care of the floors. You know the floors of the forests, it\u2019s very important,\u201d Trump told reporters. \"I was with the president of Finland and he said, \u2018We have a much different \u2014 we\u2019re a forest nation.\u2019 He called it a forest nation, and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things. And they don\u2019t have any problem.\u201d\n\nThe president of Finland said he had no idea what Trump was talking about. The internet rejoiced with mockery and created the hashtag \"Rake America Great Again.\" Trump supporters tried to scold the Washington Post with claims that Trump obviously meant to say something totally different from what he actually said.\n\nThe Post also seems to have figured out where Trump got this bizarre idea in the first place. Can you guess?\n\nYep, it was something he saw on TV \u2014 probably on Fox News, given what we know about how Trump likes to spend his \"executive time.\"\n\nAnd not just something he saw on TV, but something he saw on TV, then misinterpreted and misremembered, then spewed back out in a garbled mutation of the original \u2014 as if Trump was playing a game of telephone with himself.\n\n\u201cI was watching the firemen the other day, and they were raking areas. They were raking areas!\" Trump told Fox News' Chris Wallace in an Oval Office interview taped before the California trip. \u201cThey\u2019re raking trees, little trees like this \u2014 nut trees, little bushes, that you could see are totally dry. Weeds! And they\u2019re raking them. They\u2019re on fire.\u201d\n\nTrump pantomimed raking as he did this.\n\n\u201cThat should have been all raked out,\u201d he added. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have the fires.\u201d\n\nSo, Trump saw a firefighter on TV dealing with underbrush in a way that looked to Trump like ordinary garden raking; Trump's brain decided that this \"raking\" is just how everybody handles underbrush growth in the type of forest management that prevents fires; Trump talked to the president of Finland in a general way about forest management; and voila, suddenly the entire nation of Finland has a rake-based fire prevention strategy.\n\nAs many scientists and lawmakers have pointed out, this idea of Trump's is extremely wrong and dumb for many reasons \u2014 not the least of which is that these latest fires started in urban areas, not forests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about forest management,\u201d University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison told the AP. \u201cThese aren\u2019t forests.\u201d\n\nAnd even if forest management were the issue, Trump has no idea what he's talking about.\n\n\u201cIf preventing wildfires were as easy as raking leaves, we would have done that by now,\u201d Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) said Sunday on MSNBC, pointing out that the real problem is climate change, dry weather, and high winds.\n\nTrump gets most of his ideas from Fox News, including on military policy. And sometimes he can't even get what Fox is saying right.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Cindy Hyde-Smith, who is facing a runoff election against Democrat Mike Espy.\n\nThe return to his beloved campaign events comes as Trump is still reeling from the aftermath of the midterm elections, when Republicans lost control of the House.\n\nReports indicate that Trump has retreated into a \"cocoon of bitterness and resentment\" since the Election Day thumping. He has since reacted by lashing out at the military and insulting the troops \u2014 and even skipping Veterans Day events.\n\nBut Trump appears to be excited to once again surround himself with the dwindling number of Americans who support him. He heralded the upcoming rally with Hyde-Smith on Twitter, saying she \"loves Mississippi and our Great U.S.A.\"\n\nHyde-Smith has been widely criticized for her remark in response to a supporter where she stated, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\" She defended the comment as an \"exaggerated expression of regard.\"\n\nHundreds of blacks were lynched in Mississippi between the 1800s and 1950. Hyde-Smith's challenger in the race, Espy, is a black man.\n\nMaking her commentary even worse, newly released video has emerged of the candidate describing efforts to suppress the vote as \"great.\" The video showed Hyde-Smith smiling as she addressed a mostly white crowd: \"There's a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who maybe we don't want to vote. Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that's a great idea.\"\n\nDespite the comments, Republicans are going all-in to defend their party's hold on the seat, and are spending $1 million to help Hyde-Smith.\n\nHer rhetoric on race is right in line with what Trump has espoused many times, most infamously when he praised neo-Nazis as \"very fine people.\"\n\nTrump campaigning with Hyde-Smith is just the sort of pick-me-up he's been searching for after the country repudiated him so thoroughly.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

He still hasn't done it \u2014 and he still claims he is too \"busy\" to do so.\n\nThere are an estimated 20,000 active duty troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. American presidents from both parties have visited troops in combat zones, including Trump's two immediate predecessors, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.\n\nIn early October, Trump was asked about shirking his duty as commander-in-chief by declining to make these visits. He replied, \"I will do that at some point, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overly necessary.\"\n\nHe added, \"I've been very busy with everything that's taking place here.\"\n\nAsked on Fox News Sunday this week about this failure, Trump once again made a weak excuse: \"I've had an unbelievable busy schedule and I will be doing it.\"\n\nIn reality, Trump has been \"busy\" tweeting insults to Democrats, praising Republicans, whining about the media, and watching Fox News on his DVR and responding to it online. He's golfed, sulked around the White House, and led dozens of political rallies.\n\nAnother part of Trump's \"busy schedule\" includes planning for not one, but two rallies in support of Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who infamously \"joked\" about lynching in Mississippi.\n\nIn short, Trump hasn't been doing much of value \u2014 but he's done all he can to avoid visiting the troops.\n\nPolling seems to show that our military service members are aware of Trump's misplaced priorities, and they don't like what they see.\n\nTrump's approval rating among active duty service members is 43.8 percent, while his disapproval has increased over the last year to 43.1 percent. These low numbers are especially noteworthy given the typically rightward tilt of the armed services.\n\nTrump has repeatedly attacked military institutions and prominent military figures, denigrating their service even though he avoided military service himself.\n\nInstead of paying his respect to those on the front lines defending the country with their lives, Trump tweets and fumes and has tantrums. This is who he is at the core.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

Her use of the account under a personal domain created by her and husband Jared Kushner caused concern throughout the White House, according to the report.\n\nHowever, when Politico first revealed the private Ivanka-Jared domain last year, White House officials let Kushner take the fall. Coverage at the time focused on Kushner's use of the private account to conduct government business without being archived, and the original report stated there was \"no indication\" Ivanka used the account for government business.\n\nThe White House insisted that Kushner\u2019s use of the account was limited and claimed fewer than one hundred emails were ever sent from Kushner\u2019s account.\n\nWhile Democrats in Congress demanded that Kushner immediately preserve those emails, White House officials intentionally remained silent about Ivanka\u2019s own rampant misuse of the family domain.\n\n\"She was the worst offender in the White House,\" a former government official told The Washington Post.\n\nThe White House moved quietly to end Ivanka\u2019s use of the private account in September 2017 and to meet the requirements of the Presidential Records Act without attracting any attention. As part of the process, Ivanka's personal attorney reviewed the emails and allegedly passed along ones pertaining to government business to the White House Counsel\u2019s Office.\n\nHowever, The White House Counsel\u2019s Office was never granted access to the account \u2014 meaning Ivanka and her team personally decided what material would be preserved, according to Washington Post reporter James Hohmann. It seems the Trump family and complicit White House staffers hoped that would be the end of it.\n\nNow with the secret out, the White House is in damage control mode.\n\nA spokesperson for Ivanka's ethics counsel claims the whole thing was just a big, innocent misunderstanding and that Ivanka had not been given proper \"guidance\" on emails and federal record keeping.\n\n\"While transitioning into government, after she was given an official account but until the White House provided her the same guidance they had given others who started before she did, Ms. Trump sometimes used her personal account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nIn other words, Ivanka used a private email address to conduct government business despite having an official government email and despite her father just wrapping up a campaign that made his opponent\u2019s use of a private email address its defining issue.\n\nThis, of course, raises many important concerns and questions \u2014 perhaps the most pressing of which is, when will Trump start calling to \"lock her up\"?\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "California Republicans lost six seats, including every seat in the former GOP stronghold of Orange County.\n\nHow bad was Election Night for California Republicans?\n\n\"Near-political annihilation,\" says Politico.\n\n\"The Grand Old Party is dead,\" says California Republican former Assembly leader Kristin Olsen.\n\nRepublicans \"turned Orange County into a GOP wasteland,\" says GOP strategist John Weaver.\n\n\"Cataclysmic losses,\" says Rob Stutzman, a California-based Republican strategist.\n\nDemocrats walloped Republicans in California, flipping six seats in the state \u2014 the most Republicans ousted in any single state during this year's midterm election. As votes continue to be counted, there is even a chance a seventh seat could be flipped.\n\nThe defeats were so brutal that next year Republicans \"won't even have enough lawmakers in California's 53-member House delegation to field a nine-person softball team,\" writes the L.A. Times.\n\nRepublicans went into the 2018 election holding 14 seats in California, unwisely mocking efforts of Democrats seeking to flip any seats.\n\n\"They think we're the new battleground,\" Fred Whitaker, the chairman of the Orange County Republican Party, laughingly told Politico in March 2018. \"There are four Republican-held seats here, and there will be four Republican-held seats here after the 2020 election,\" he said, speaking about Orange County.\n\nIf pride goeth before the fall, then Whitaker's immense pride made the GOP's fall that much worse. Of the four Republican-held seats Whitaker mentioned, Republicans lost every single one.\n\nOne of those seats was occupied by Russia lackey Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. Harley Rouda, a Republican-turned-Democrat businessman, trounced Rohrabacher by almost 7 points.\n\nIn another Orange County seat, Rep. Mimi Walters eventually conceded to UC Irvine law professor Katie Porter.\n\nRounding out the GOP's losses are seats won by Navy veteran Gil Cisneros, who defeated retiring Rep. Ed Royce's handpicked successor, Young Kim; and Mike Levin, who will occupy retiring suspected arsonist Rep. Darrell Issa's seat next year. Borth Cisneros and Levin are Democrats.\n\nIn addition to Orange County, Democrat Katie Hill ousted Republican Rep. Steve Knight from a seat in northern Los Angeles County, and Democrat Josh Harder picked up a formerly Republican-held seat in the Central Valley.\n\nIt is not just at the federal level where Republicans were almost \"completely decimated,\" to borrow words from GOP consultant Mike Madrid.\n\nRepublicans lost up and down the ballot, and lost badly.\n\n\"The GOP not only lost every statewide office in the midterm election \u2014 again, in blowout fashion \u2014 but Democrats reestablished their supermajority in Sacramento, allowing them to legislate however they see fit,\" writes the L.A. Times.\n\nOn the local, state, and federal level, Democrats unleashed a tidal wave of energy and activism, wiping out Republicans even in the deepest of deep-red areas.\n\nOrange County was once the \"spiritual center of the Republican Party,\" helping to elevate both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan to national prominence, writes the L.A. Times,\n\nIn January, Democrats will control all seven congressional seats that include any part of Orange County \u2014 and Democrats in Congress now represent the districts where both the Nixon and Reagan presidential libraries are located.\n\nAs former Assembly leader Olsen wrote, California \"experienced a blue tsunami.\"\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "In the year since Charlottesville, white supremacists and other extremists have only been emboldened by Trump's message.\n\nWhen a white supremacist rally erupted into fatal violence one year ago in Charlottesville, Virginia, it wasn't too hard to figure out which people were on the wrong side of history.\n\nBut Trump could never quite bring himself to say it, and a year later that still hasn't changed.\n\nTrump delayed and dragged his feet in responding to the tragic incident in 2017, then said \u201cboth sides\u201d of the protest were to blame for the death of Heather Heyer, who was killed when a white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters. Trump also described some of the violent white supremacists rioting over the removal of a Confederate statue as \u201cvery fine people.\u201d\n\nCongress actually had to pass a resolution calling on Trump \"to speak out against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and White supremacy,\" and asking him to use \u201call resources\u201d available to the White House to address \u201cthe growing prevalence\u201d of hate groups in America.\n\nBy assigning moral equivalency to those fighting for racial equality and those championing white supremacy, Trump lit a fuse that ignited the already-energized racist segments of society who helped propel Trump to victory in the first place.\n\nNow, a year later, the same white supremacists who rioted in Charlottesville have become so emboldened that they scheduled a rally right in the center of the nation's capital to mark the anniversary of the fatal violence they instigated. Experts who study extremism say the rally reflects the \"continued embolden[ing] ... of white nationalists in this country.\"\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson echoed these remarks, saying, \"If anything, it\u2019s gotten worse.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately the tone has been set by [President Donald Trump\u2019s] administration, and as a result, the level of racial intolerance increased,\" Johnson said. He noted that \"Charlottesville only exposed how the [Trump] administration would handle the issue of race,\" and the result of the way they handled it is that \"more people are emboldened to display their racism.\"\n\nIndeed, while the rest of the country was horrified and disgusted by Trump's remarks last year, racists were thrilled. They saw his comments as a form of approval that gave them unprecedented legitimacy by equating their hate speech and violent actions with the non-violent, anti-racist protesters who oppose them. As the SPLC wrote in its report on hate and extremism in 2017, \"Trump may have faced dreadful approval ratings among all Americans, but he did not disappoint his adoring fans within the radical right.\"\n\nThis is reflected in the activity of neo-Nazi, white supremacist, and other hate groups, which have flourished under Trump's leadership and continued to grow in the aftermath of Charlottesville. In 2017, the number of neo-Nazi groups grew from 99 to 121, and anti-Muslim organizations increased from 101 chapters to 114. According to the SPLC, the surge in extremist groups has been most intense among white supremacist groups closely aligned with Trump.\n\n\"In 2017, completely new groups sprouted up: Patriot Front, the Fraternal Order of Alt Knights, Identity Dixie and others,\" SPLC reports. \"Groups that latched onto Trump flourished. Identity Evropa went from one chapter in 2016 to 15 in 2017; The Right Stuff expanded from four chapters to 21 and spawned Identity Dixie; and Vanguard America grew from 12 to 25.\"\n\nJoan Donovan of Data & Society Research Institute told The Cut that although hate groups went through a period of turmoil in the immediate aftermath of Charlottesville, it was only temporary.\n\n\"... Six to seven months after Charlottesville, these groups started to come back together and converse more, and started to realign,\" Donovan said. \"Other groups that hadn\u2019t been as prominently involved in Charlottesville, like Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer, began to mobilize and organize in ways that were similar to what we saw happen in Charlottesville. Now we see a new leadership, but it\u2019s essentially the same political ideology, which is anti-immigrant, pro-white.\"\n\nIn the past year, white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups have taken to the streets for marches and rallies, clearly not fearing any backlash or condemnation from the White House. With Trump as president, white supremacists are no longer ashamed to show their faces, nor are they shy about taking to the streets and, in many instances, engaging in public acts of violence.\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, white supremacist murders doubled in 2017. They were \"directly responsible\" for 18 out of 34 extremist-related deaths nationwide \u2014 double the number of deaths attributed to Islamic extremists. Overall, 2017 was the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America.\n\nIn some cases, there are direct connections between Trump and the violent acts carried out by extremists.\n\nWilliam Edward Atcheson, a 21-year-old New Mexico resident who shot and killed two students at Aztec High School in December 2017, left behind traces of his online activity, which included extensive involvement on pro-Trump white supremacy sites and forums.\n\nIt's not hard to figure out why these extremists are feeling so emboldened: If there were any questions about Trump's views on race in the aftermath of Charlottesville, he has answered them with his own words and actions over the past year.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 2017, just days after the deadly rally, Trump held a press conference, during which he defended the pro-slavery Confederacy, and continued to claim white supremacists and anti-racist protesters were morally equivalent.\n\nA few days later at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, Trump defended his comments about Charlottesville and proceeded to launch into a racist rant in which he accused those advocating for the removal of Confederate statues of \"trying to take away our history and our heritage\" \u2014 a statement that skipped right past dog whistling and went straight for the bullhorn.\n\nThen, just two weeks after Charlottesville, Trump gave a huge gift to white supremacists when he pardoned notorious racist Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\n\nThe next month, Trump started attacking black athletes for protesting racial injustice with an unhinged racist rant during a rally in Alabama. Speaking about football players who kneel during the national anthem in a peaceful act of protest, Trump raged, \"Wouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out!'\"\n\nWhen ESPN anchor Jemele Hill called out the racist motives of Trump's attacks on black athletes, he responded by attacking her, too, and calling her for her to be fired \u2014 part of Trump's pattern of attacking black women.\n\nIn October 2017, the Trump administration launched a racially charged attack on Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL) after she publicly condemned the White House for hiring white supremacists amid a controversy over Trump's treatment of Gold Star families. While Trump's treatment of the families of fallen soldiers is notoriously bad, it's even worse when it comes to the families of slain black soldiers, who he has often just ignored.\n\nThe next month, Trump renewed his attacks on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during a White House event for Navajo veterans, referring to her by the racist slur \"Pocahantas.\"\n\nIn December 2017, it was revealed that Trump's \"very fine people\" were terrorizing Heather Heyer's mother, which Trump ignored. However, he did make time that month to throw his weight behind the group Turning Point USA just hours after it was exposed as a hotbed of racist activity.\n\nThis pattern continued into 2018, as Trump marked the start of the new year by referring to Haiti and African nations as \"shithole countries,\" and suggesting that the U.S. should limit immigration from those countries and accept more people from majority-white nations like Norway instead.\n\nJust last month, Trump issued a blatantly racist statement ahead of his meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, warning that Europe is \"losing its culture\" by letting in too many immigrants from the Middle East and Africa.\n\nA week ago, Trump attacked LeBron James as stupid and CNN anchor Don Lemon as stupider, following a familiar line of attack in which he accuses black people of being unintelligent or \"low IQ.\"\n\nAnd on Friday, Trump once again renewed his attacks on black athletes, accusing them of not knowing what they're protesting against, and demanding they find another way to protest \u2014 but not mentioning white supremacists, whose form of protest resulted in murder last year.\n\nSo it's not exactly a surprise that racists believe they have Trump's support behind them, given that he consistently reminds them they do.\n\nBut Trump didn't just embolden white supremacists and other racists to take to the streets \u2014 he invited them into the White House and codified their beliefs into policies and laws.\n\nWhile some of the most notorious bigots hired by Trump, like Steve Bannon and Seb Gorka, are no longer (officially) working for the administration, others, like Stephen Miller, are among the most influential voices in the Trump White House.\n\nOther members of the Trump administration \u2014 like Attorney General Jeff Sessions, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and chief of staff John Kelly \u2014 have helped legitimize racism and enact it through policies such as the cruel practice of separating families at the border, and minimizing or ignoring the threat of white supremacist violence while fear-mongering about the alleged threats posed by immigrants, refugees, and Muslims.\n\nApparently inspired by the racism emanating from the White House, a record number of white nationalists are running for national office this year, including candidates who deny the Holocaust and advocate for segregation. At least eight people associated with white nationalist groups are running for office in 2018, and even more are running at the local level.\n\nIn June, one of the white nationalists who rioted in Charlottesville was elected to public office as part of the Washington State Republican Party. His social media profile photos show him wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat, reflecting how acceptable it has become for people to simultaneously advertise their support for Trump alongside their racist viewpoints \u2014 and also reflecting how the Republican party has welcomed these extremists into the fold.\n\nIn this context, it's hardly a surprise that white supremacists feel welcome in the nation's capital.\n\nThrough their words and actions, Trump and other members of his administration have given the signal to racists that they have an ally in the White House \u2014 and this weekend\u2019s rally shows the message has been received loud and clear.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Trump just makes bad situations worse. Every time.\n\nEmerging from his \"cocoon of bitterness and resentment,\" as administration sources described it to the L.A. times, Trump spent the weekend insulting victims of California's deadly wildfires, then belittling the man who oversaw the operation that killed the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks.\n\nDuring his trip to California, Trump cruelly blamed the victims of the wildfires, saying the deadly fires were their fault \u2014 for not raking the forest floor. The comment was both blithely callous and scientifically illiterate. It was also a complete fabrication.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump said the president of Finland \"told him about raking the forest floors. 'He called it a forest nation,' Trump said, 'and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don't have any problem.'\"\n\nBut when reached for comment, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said he never brought up raking with Trump.\n\nEven before visiting the state to insult victims in person, Trump blamed California for poor forest management earlier this week. California firefighters called the remark \"ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering.\"\n\nNot content to simply make a bad situation worse, Trump also used his weekend to insult the man who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nIn an interview that aired on Fox News Sunday night, Trump belittled retired Adm. William H. McRaven and a huge swath of America's intelligence community for not finding Bin Laden \"a lot sooner.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn't it have been nice?\" Trump said. \"You know, living \u2014 think of this \u2014 living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan, in what I guess they considered a nice mansion, I don't know, I've seen nicer. But living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\"\n\nMcRaven, a 37-year military veteran, is a former Navy SEAL who oversaw both the killing of Bin Laden and the capture of Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Trump, on the other hand received multiple deferments, including one for bone spurs, and ultimately never served in the military.\n\nMcRaven has been critical of Trump, calling Trump's attacks on the press \"the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.\" McRaven alsp defended former CIA director John Brennan when Trump revoked Brennan's security clearance. \"Add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency,\" McRaven said at the time.\n\nTrump has a long history insulting war heroes. Earlier this month, Trump decided to skip a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington Cemetery because he arrived home late at night from his trip to France, where he skipped out on a ceremony honoring World War I heroes. During his 2016 campaign, Trump also insulted the Gold Star family of a fallen hero.\n\nMaybe it's a relief that Trump spends so many weekends golfing. When he emerges, all he does is blame victims and insult American heroes. Sadly, that's become par for the course.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "Instead of working for the public, Trump officials are scrambling to 'reverse-engineer' policies and contort reality to keep up with his lies.\n\nMany people were left scratching their heads recently when Trump completely fabricated the existence of an upcoming tax cut, and then pledged to deliver on the imaginary policy before the midterm elections.\n\nEven Trump's allies on Capitol Hill and within his own administration had no idea what he was talking about when he told reporters over the weekend that he was working on passing a new tax cut for middle-class Americans.\n\nNo such plan was in the works, and carrying it out would require passing legislation \u2014 but Congress isn't even session right now and will not return until after the Nov. 6 election.\n\n\"Yet Washington's bureaucratic machinery whirred into action nonetheless \u2014 working to produce a policy that could be seen as supporting Trump\u2019s whim,\" The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn what has apparently become a routine practice, congressional Republicans and White House officials soon found themselves scrambling to come up with a way to make Trump's lie seem real \u2014 and to deceive the American public about the whole thing.\n\nOne of the proposals being considered to stand in for an actual tax cut is a \"symbolic nonbinding 'resolution' designed to signal to voters ahead of the elections that if Republicans hold their congressional majorities they might pass a future 10 percent tax cut for the middle class,\" according to the Post.\n\nTrump's allies in Congress have said they will work with the White House and Treasury Department to \"develop\" the symbolic, non-binding piece of paper as part of a plan to cover for Trump's habitual lying \u2014 by lying to voters.\n\nAs the Post noted, this is far from the first time that Republicans and officials working for the administration have ended up \"reverse-engineer[ing]\" policies after Trump publicly committed to a policy that did not yet exist. Nor is it the first time they have manufactured evidence to prop up Trump's lies and conspiracy theories.\n\nAt the Pentagon, officials had to spring into action to plan a military parade when Trump announced his intent to hold one. Later, when Trump publicly floated the idea of a Space Force, the Pentagon had to create one.\n\nAt the Commerce Department, officials had to hurriedly develop a plan for auto tariffs after Trump threatened to impose them on the auto industry.\n\nAt the Defense Department, Secretary James Mattis and other top military brass were forced to figure out how to react when Trump abruptly announced a new ban on transgender service members.\n\nGoing even further back, Trump kicked off his presidency with a series of lies, including the false claim that widespread voter fraud was the reason he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. A formal committee was convened to investigate the matter, but it was disbanded amid a slew of legal trouble after only two meetings.\n\nTrump also insisted that his inaugural crowd sizes were the biggest ever, and reportedly made it clear to government agencies that they were expected to play along. It was later revealed that the White House had ordered his inaugural photos to be edited to make the crowd look larger.\n\nAnd just this week, the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Vice President Mike Pence all jumped to Trump's defense to prop up his lie about \"unknown Middle Easterners\" traveling with a so-called \"caravan\" of migrants from Central America. Only hours later, Trump admitted to reporters that he had no evidence for his claims, saying, \"There's no proof of anything.\"\n\nTrump keeps lying because he knows he can get away with it, and he gets away with it in large part because he is surrounded by a network of enablers spanning the White House, both chambers of Congress, and nearly every major government agency.\n\nAfter Trump announced Monday at a rally for Ted Cruz that he would be enacting his fake tax cut by \"next week,\" his enablers got to work once again trying to figure out how to cover for his latest lie.\n\nAccording to CNN, aides in the House scrambled \"to figure out if they could, or even needed to, draft something that would address what the President was promising,\" while Republican officials in the Senate said they contacted their House colleagues for guidance \"only to find out there wasn't any -- nobody was sure what exactly the President was referencing.\"\n\nPerhaps that's because Trump himself isn't sure.\n\nWith midterms approaching, Trump is alternating between blurting out things he thinks voters want to hear, lying about his own accomplishments, and launching into unhinged fits of falsehoods. And thanks to his enablers, your tax dollars are paying to prop it all up.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

    "text": "This is a scandal for anyone who cares about free and fair elections in America.\n\nDemocrats dominated the midterm elections this year and took back the most House seats they have since Watergate.\n\nBut the news was also full of reports about Americans facing long lines and broken voting machines \u2014 or even being unable to cast a ballot at all because of Republican-passed laws that make it harder to vote, especially in minority communities.\n\nAnd a new post-election poll includes a shocking indication of just how bad this problem was: At least 10 percent of people who didn't vote say that either voter suppression tactics or voter ID laws got in the way when they tried to vote.\n\nAbout 1 in 10 people who didn't vote or weren't registered to vote (9 percent) said the following statement applied to them: \"I was not able to vote, or it was harder for me to vote, because of voter suppression tactics in my state or at my polling location.\"\n\nAnother 10 percent of non-voters said they didn't have the right kind of identification in order to vote or register to vote.\n\nThe poll, a survey of 4,159 adults conducted by USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times between Nov. 7-15, has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.\n\nA couple of caveats: It's not clear from the poll results how many people experienced both voter suppression and ID problems, versus how many experienced just one or the other.\n\nIt's also not clear how many non-voters would have definitely been able to cast a ballot if they didn't run into either of these problems; some may still not have been able to get time off work, for instance. And the poll question didn't specify what exactly \"voter suppression tactics\" meant.\n\nBut even given all that, this result is shocking, and should scandalize anyone who supports free and fair elections in America.\n\nMany close midterm elections this year were determined by less than 1 percent of voters. If even a fraction of these non-voters had been able to cast a ballot, it could have changed the outcome of some close elections.\n\nVoter suppression tactics and voter ID laws are used heavily by Republicans in order to depress turnout among minority groups, college students, and others who are likely to vote for Democrats.\n\nThese dirty tricks actually work. Voter ID laws, for instance, consistently suppress voters of color, but have little if any effect on white voter turnout.\n\nAnd voting problems have been a major point of contention in some very close high-profile races \u2014 especially in Florida and Georgia \u2014 that Democrats are losing, but that are still counting and recounting ballots and that may be subject to court challenges.\n\nThe poll also found that 35 percent of non-voters reported being unable to vote because they could not take the time away from work or other personal obligations.\n\nThat's also an outrage, and it's why many voting rights advocates are calling to expand early voting and make Election Day a federal holiday.\n\nAs their very first bill after taking the majority in January, House Democrats plan to introduce a sweeping proposal to protect voting rights, as well as address other problems like partisan gerrymandering that have been central to the Republican war on voting.\n\nAnd given these disturbing poll results on voter suppression, it's clear that such reforms are more needed than ever.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."
