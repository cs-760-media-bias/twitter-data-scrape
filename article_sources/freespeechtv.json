Those arrests may provide a partial answer to the question of who killed her but many other questions, including who ordered her killing and why, remain unanswered.\n\n\n\nThis week, we talk with Yifat Susskind of MADRE and K.K Verdade of Fundo ELAS about the current fight for human rights in Brazil, and the right-wing hate campaign against feminist so-called \"gender ideology\" worldwide. Then we take a look at one demonstration that took place in New York City to remember Marielle Franco and the struggles she brought to the world's attention."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\nAfter nearly two years of investigations, the Special Counsel's office, headed by Robert Mueller III, is finally closing down. Mr. Mueller's final report, which was so heavily anticipated by so many, was submitted to the Attorney General's office as per the Special Counsel's regulations with no new indictments announced. Within hours, Attorney General William Barr, who has only been in his position for a few weeks, sent a 4-page summary of the Mueller report to Congress.\n\n\n\nAccording to Barr's summary, Mueller concluded that there was no collusion with Russia in the 2016 election and made no determination one way or another of whether the President attempted to obstruct justice. Barr also quoted the actual Mueller report on the issue of obstruction of justice: \"while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\"\n\n\n\nTrump has proclaimed that the report completely exonerates him. News reports are touting the end of the probe as a victory for Trump and as a damper on prospects of impeachment. But Democrats are demanding that the entire Mueller report be made public. More than a dozen state Attorneys General have also made such a demand.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Ron Fein, Legal Director of Free Speech for People, and a constitutional lawyer who previously served as Assistant Regional Counsel in the US EPA. He is the co-author with John Bonifaz and Ben Clements of the book The Constitution Demands It: The Case for The Impeachment of Donald Trump"

  "text": "The Pentagon notified Congress on Monday that it transferred $1 billion in military personnel funding to construct President Donald Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn a memo addressed to Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, said he authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin planning and building 57 miles of fencing along the southwestern border, as well as improving roads in Yuma, Arizona, and El Paso, Texas, CNN reported.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers were swift in their rebuke of the Pentagon chief\u2019s move.\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) released a statement Tuesday saying the committee has denied the Department of Defense\u2019s request to reallocate the money for the wall.\n\n\u201cThis needs to stop. Based on the unfunded requests received for the Fiscal Year 2020 budget and the issues raised by the Marine Corps, there are obviously more pressing issues with readiness and modernization that these funds could - and more importantly should - go to,\u201d his statement read. \u201cInstead of focusing on readiness, hurricane recovery and other genuine issues, the administration continues to spend billions of dollars on an imaginary crisis.\u201d\n\nIn a separate letter to Shanahan on Monday, a group of Democratic senators led by Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Richard Durbin of Illinois objected to the transfer of funds, which they described as a violation of congressional appropriations.\n\n\u201cWe strongly object to both the substance of the funding transfer, and to the Department implementing the transfer without seeking the approval of the congressional defense committees and in violation of provisions in the defense appropriation itself,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cAs a result, we have serious concerns that the Department has allowed political interference and pet projects to come ahead of many near-term, critical readiness issues facing our military.\u201d\n\nNoting that the Pentagon requests \u201cbillions in mid-year transfers\u201d every year to address \u201cunexpected shortfalls in paying our troops, providing training, maintaining their equipment and accelerating new technologies,\u201d the lawmakers said the reprogramming of funds \u201cconstitutes a dollar-for-dollar theft from other readiness needs of our Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump declared a national emergency last month in an effort to bypass Congress and divert billions of dollars in defense funds to build his long-touted border wall.\n\nThe New York Times noted that the Pentagon\u2019s recent transfer was made without using the president\u2019s declaration.\n\nThe Defense Department informed Congress last week that hundreds of military construction projects may be cut or delayed to fund the wall\u2019s construction."

  "text": "Nasa\u2019s plans for the first all-female spacewalk have fallen through \u2013 at least in part because the agency doesn\u2019t have enough spacesuits that fit the astronauts.\n\nWhat should have been a giant leap for womankind has turned into a stumble after Nasa said on Monday night that they will only have access to one correctly sized spacesuit top by Friday when the walk was scheduled. One of the two women on the mission, Anne McClain, will now have to give up her place to a male colleague.\n\nShe thought a large-sized suit would be fine but after a spacewalk last week found that the medium-sized was a better fit and would be the most appropriate suit to wear to venture back outside the International Space Station.\n\n\u201cAnne trained in \u2018M\u2019 and \u2018L\u2019 and thought she could use a large but decided after [last] Friday\u2019s spacewalk a medium fits better,\u201d a Nasa spokeswoman, Stephanie Schierholz, announced on Monday.\n\n\u201cIn this case, it\u2019s easier (and faster!) to change space-walkers than reconfigure the spacesuit.\u201d\n\nThe deadly truth about a world built for men \u2013 from stab vests to car crashes Read more\n\nThe news was met with disappointment and some anger by many following the much-anticipated mission on social media, with some arguing an all-female spacewalk was overdue.\n\nOthers said they were sad that a milestone moment on women\u2019s space exploration had been deferred, but safety came first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m suuper [sic] disappointed about the all-woman spacewalk not happening as scheduled this Friday but I\u2019m also super supportive of astronauts having the authority to say \u2018I would be safer using a different piece of equipment,\u2019\u201d Emily Lakdawalla, a senior editor at the US non-profit the Planetary Society, wrote on Twitter. \u201cAn all-woman spacewalk WILL eventually happen.\u201d\n\nEarly this month, Nasa announced that Christina Koch and Anne McClain would take part in the first-of-its kind mission on 29 March, walking outside the international space station (ISS) to install new batteries. In the past, missions have been all-male or male-female.\n\nBut in a press release on Monday, Nasa said its plans had changed, \u201cin part\u201d due to a shortage of outerwear. McClain had \u201clearned during her first spacewalk that a medium-size hard upper torso \u2013 essentially the shirt of the spacesuit \u2013 fits her best.\u201d Only one such top can be made by Friday, the agency said, and it will go to Koch.\n\nWhen McClain took part in a spacewalk last week, she became the 13th woman to do so, Nasa says; Koch will be the 14th. McClain is now \u201ctentatively scheduled\u201d to perform her next one on 8 April.\n\nAnne McClain (@AstroAnnimal) Some more shots of the #spacewalk on Friday \u2013 was privileged to work with my friend and colleague @NASA_Astronauts @AstroHague pic.twitter.com/KueUo7HXFm\n\nMcClain is sharing both spacewalk missions with men.\n\nThe first woman to perform a spacewalk was the Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, 35 years ago. More than 500 people have been into space, but only 11% have been women. But Koch and McClain were both part of Nasa\u2019s 2013 class, which was 50% female.\n\nFitting for spacesuits is a tricky business, according to Space.com, since microgravity makes you taller. McClain tweeted this month that she was 2in taller than when she launched."

Lee: He wasn\u2019t very good at his job]\n\n\u201cBy playing to that stereotype, she becomes an intelligence agent and, therefore, proves the value of black intelligence at undermining the institution of slavery itself,\u201d Lois Leveen, a historical novelist who based o\n\nne of her books on Bowser, said while discussing the spy\u2019s legacy in 2013 during a panel discussion at the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond.\n\n\u201cThis is a humdinger of a tale,\" said another panelist, University of Virginia historian Elizabeth Varon.\n\nVaron detailed Bowser\u2019s life and spy capers in her 2003 book, \u201cSouthern Lady, Yankee Spy.\u201d\n\nThe book is primarily a biography of Elizabeth L. Van Lew, a well-known Richmond society figure and daughter of prominent slave owners. Van Lew is the second humdinger in this story. She abhorred slavery. And when the war broke out, she decided to do something about it.\n\nVan Lew stayed in the family mansion with her mother during the war, according to Kar\n\nen Abbott, the author of \u201cLiar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy: Four Women Undercover in the Civil War.\u201d From there, she ran a spy ring known as the Richmond Underground. Her spy methods were not particularly sophisticated, but the information her agents provided to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant \u2014 especially during the siege of Richmond \u2014 was crucial.\n\nOne of those spies was Bowser.\n\n[Jefferson Davis: The Confederacy\u2019s first, worst and only president]\n\nShe was born around 1840 while her parents were enslaved by Van Lew\u2019s family. The Van Lews had conflicted feelings about slavery, though. Elizabeth sent Bowser north to be educated during her teenage years. Later, she did missionary work in Liberia.\n\nWhen she returned to Richmond, Bowser was arrested. It was illegal to return to a slave state after living in a free one.\n\n[Listen to a great history story every day. Get the \u201cRetropod\u201d podcast on Amazon Echo, Google Home or your favorite podcast app.]\n\nVan Lew bailed her out. At some point, she brought Bowser into her spy network, helping her get a job as a servant at the Confederate White House.\n\nThe tradecraft was simple, Abbott said. A family friend of the Van Lews worked for a seamstress near the Confederate White House. Bowser brought the first lady\u2019s dresses there not just when they needed work but also to send important messages to Van Lew.\n\n\n\nThe Confederate White House, where Mary Bowser did her best spy work. (Library of Congress) (LOC/LOC)\n\nThe dresses held the messages. Bowser sewed them into the fabric.\n\nThis was perilous work \u2014 especially for Bowser, who probably would have been executed if she were caught.\n\nBut she was too good to be caught.\n\nAs for Van Lew, the Confederates began closing in on her in 1864, but by then the war \u2014 for Virginia and the South \u2014 was pretty much lost. When Grant\u2019s army rolled into Richmond in 1865, Van Lew wrote in her journal, \u201cOh, army of my country, how glorious was your welcome!\u201d\n\nGrant was so pleased with her work he awarded her an official job: postmaster of Richmond.\n\nAs for Bowser, she moved to Georgia to become a teacher. And she spent the rest of her life telling the story of her time as a spy \u2014 down South and up North. Why?\n\n\u201cFor a purpose,\u201d Varon said. \u201cFor the purpose of saying: \u2018We need our rights protected. We\u2019re still vulnerable. The work\u2019s not done yet.\u2019\"\n\nThis story has been updated to cite Karen Abbott\u2019s book \u201cLiar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy: Four Women Undercover in the Civil War.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\n\u2018Assassins!\u2019: A Confederate spy was accused of helping kill Abraham Lincoln.

  "text": "A Texas flight attendant who was enrolled in the government\u2019s program for \u201cDreamers\u201d flew to Mexico for work and was stopped by immigration authorities who forced her to spend more than a month in detention, her attorney said.\n\nSelene Saavedra Roman, 28, who immigrated illegally to the U.S. as a child, was released Friday from a detention center in Conroe, Texas, according to a statement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\u201cBeing released is an indescribable feeling,\u201d she said through a spokesman. \u201cI cried and hugged my husband and never wanted to let go. I am thankful and grateful for the amazing people that came to fight for me, and it fills my heart. Thank you to everyone that has supported. I am just so happy to have my freedom back.\u201d\n\nOriginally from Peru and married to an American citizen, she raised concerns with Mesa Airlines about her immigration status after being assigned to an international flight, attorney Belinda Arroyo said.\n\nThe airline assured her she would be fine, but she was stopped by U.S. authorities on Feb. 12, when she returned to Houston, and was sent to detention, where she remained for more than five weeks, Arroyo said.\n\nSoon after her lawyer, her husband, the airline and a flight attendants\u2019 group publicly demanded her release, Saavedra Roman called to tell her husband she was getting out.\n\n\u201cShe was crying and she said, \u2018Please come get me,'\u201d her husband, David Watkins, told reporters.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement said the agency was looking into her status. Earlier, the agency said Saavedra Roman did not have a valid document to enter the country and was being detained while going through immigration court proceedings.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u2014 the agency that oversees the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA \u2014 declined to discuss the case. But the agency says on its website that participants who travel outside the country without a special document allowing them to do so are no longer covered by the program.\n\nThe agency no longer issues the document to the program\u2019s enrollees, according to the website.\n\nPeople enrolled in the program are commonly referred to as \u201cDreamers,\u201d based on never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act.\n\nThe Trump administration sought to end the Obama-era program but was blocked by litigation. New applications have been halted, but renewals continue for hundreds of thousands of immigrants already enrolled.\n\nIn a joint statement with the Association of Flight Attendants, Mesa Airlines chief executive Jonathan Ornstein apologized to Saavedra Roman and asked U.S. authorities to release her, arguing that it was unfair to continually detain someone \u201cover something that is nothing more than an administrative error and a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe should have never been advised that she could travel,\u201d Arroyo said. \u201cIt was a big mistake.\u201d\n\nSaavedra Roman \u2014 who is scheduled to appear before an immigration judge in April \u2014 attended Texas A&M University, where she met her husband.\n\nWatkins said he was not initially worried about her assignment because they already obtained approval from Citizenship and Immigration Services to apply for her green card as the wife of an American citizen. She has no criminal record and has long paid her taxes, he said, and she checked with her employer before the trip.\n\nThen she was detained. He could visit her only once a week and could only see her through thick glass. She sounded hopeless, he said.\n\n\u201cI told her, \u2018Even if you get deported to Peru, I\u2019ll just go with you,'\u201d he said to reporters. \u201cRegardless of whatever happens in the future, I am not giving up. I am going to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the union representing Saavedra Roman and her colleagues said the event \u201chighlights the urgency of commonsense immigration reform and resolution for America\u2019s children who are part of DACA.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Terry Wallace contributed to this report."

  "title": "Georgia Senate Passes 'Heartbeat' Abortion Ban Bill",
  "authors": [
    "Ben Nadler"
  ],
  "text": "(ATLANTA) \u2014 Amid protests and a heavy police presence, the Georgia Senate on Friday passed a bill banning almost all abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected.\n\nThe bill, backed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, passed on a 34-18 party-line vote and would be one of the nation\u2019s strictest anti-abortion measures if it becomes law and is not blocked in court battles. It will now go back to the House to approve Senate changes, where it\u2019s expected to pass again.\n\nWomen in Georgia can currently seek an abortion during the first 20 weeks of a pregnancy. A heartbeat can be detected in an embryo as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.\n\nGeorgia lawmakers and GOP-led legislatures in several other states have pushed anti-abortion measures in hopes of getting a case before the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The push comes amid rising optimism among conservatives that the restrictions might prevail in the reconfigured high court that includes President Donald Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nAndrea Young, the executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, said in an interview Friday that the group would challenge the heartbeat abortion ban in court if it\u2019s signed into law. Young called the legislation \u201cclearly unconstitutional\u201d and said that it \u201cflies in the face of 50 years of legal precedent.\u201d\n\nSeveral Republican senators, most of them men, spoke in favor of the bill, while several Democratic senators, most of them women, argued against it. Many Republican lawmakers in favor of the legislation outlined their position in religious terms.\n\n\u201cThere are many scriptures that make it clear to me that God knew us and had a plan for us when we were still in our mother\u2019s womb,\u201d said Republican Sen. Greg Kirk, a Baptist pastor. \u201cThe word abortion is not going to be found in the Bible.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Sen. Valencia Seay took issue with that line of reasoning, saying lawmakers were letting their \u201cpersonal religious beliefs dictate everyone else\u2019s ability to have a choice.\u201d Republican Sen. Greg Dolezal, speaking in favor of the legislation, said that every life is a miracle.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many of us are in this room right now, probably 200, but I am looking at 200 miracles,\u201d Dolezal said. He then began to look around the chamber. \u201cSenator, you are a miracle. Senator, you are a miracle,\u201d then up to the balcony, \u201cSir, you\u2019re a miracle. Ma\u2019am, you\u2019re a miracle.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jen Jordan, questioned whether the standard being contemplated by the legislation was actually a human heartbeat. \u201cEvery physician has said that the fetal cardiac activity present early in pregnancies is not a beating heart, and no matter how many times you say it, no matter what you call this bill, it does not make it so,\u201d she said.\n\nA large group of women at the Georgia Capitol protested the bill dressed as characters from \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which depicts a dystopian future where women are controlled by the government and forced to breed. The activists in red cloaks and white bonnets have been an almost daily presence ever since the House passed the measure earlier this month.\n\nA smaller contingent of anti-abortion advocates held signs and urged lawmakers to pass the bill.\n\nDebate took place amid heavy security. Over two dozen Georgia State Patrol cars flanked the Capitol building and as many troopers stood watch inside.\n\nDuring public testimony last week, several physicians and physician groups came out against the bill, saying it contained medical inaccuracies and would worsen health care for women in Georgia, a state that already has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the country.\n\nTwo influential groups, the Medical Association of Georgia and the Georgia Academy of Family Physicians, sent letters to lawmakers opposing the legislation.\n\nGOP lawmakers in Tennessee, Florida, South Carolina and Ohio are pursuing similar legislation, while Republican governors in Mississippi and Kentucky have recently signed heartbeat abortion bans.\n\nMississippi Gov. Phil Bryant on Thursday signed a heartbeat abortion ban, despite a federal judge\u2019s ruling last year that struck down a less-restrictive law limiting abortions there.\n\nKentucky\u2019s law was temporarily blocked by a federal judge shortly after Republican Gov. Matt Bevin signed it on March 14, in response to a challenge by the ACLU.\n\nA state judge found Iowa\u2019s heartbeat abortion ban to be unconstitutional in January.\n\nThe Georgia bill makes exceptions in the case of rape and incest \u2014 but only when the woman files a police report first \u2014 and to save the life of the mother. It also allows for abortions when a fetus is determined to be not compatible with life due to serious medical issues.\n\nIf signed, the law would take effect January 1, 2020.\n\nGov. Kemp said in a statement Friday that he looked \u201cforward to working with the House to ensure this legislation\u2019s final passage in the coming days.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com."

  "authors": [
    "Julia Carrie Wong"

  "text": "Facebook employees were aware of concerns about\u201cimproper data-gathering practices\u201d by Cambridge Analytica months before the Guardian first reported, in December 2015, that the political consultancy had obtained data on millions from an academic. The concerns appeared in a court filing by the attorney general for Washington DC and were subsequently confirmed by Facebook.\n\nThe new information \u201ccould suggest that Facebook has consistently mislead [sic]\u201d British lawmakers \u201cabout what it knew and when about Cambridge Analytica\u201d, tweeted Damian Collins, the chair of the House of Commons digital culture media and sport select committee (DCMS) in response to the court filing.\n\nIn a statement, a company spokesperson said: \u201cFacebook absolutely did not mislead anyone about this timeline.\u201d\n\nAfter publication of this article, the spokesperson acknowledged that Facebook employees heard rumors of data scraping by Cambridge Analytica in September 2015. The spokesperson said that this was a \u201cdifferent incident\u201d from Cambridge Analytica\u2019s acquisition of a trove of data about as many as 87m users that has been widely reported on for the past year.\n\n\u201cIn September 2015 employees heard speculation that Cambridge Analytica was scraping data, something that is unfortunately common for any internet service,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIn December 2015, we first learned through media reports that Kogan sold data to Cambridge Analytica, and we took action. Those were two different things.\u201d\n\nThe filing raised questions about when Facebook first learned about the misuse of personal data by Cambridge Analytica, the now defunct political consultancy.\n\nThis timeline has long been complicated by the different corporate entities involved in Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data misuse. The data of as many as 87m people was extracted from Facebook by GSR, a company formed by the former Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan, then transferred to Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, SCL.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal changed the world \u2013 but it didn't change Facebook Read more\n\nThe data extraction, though highly controversial, was not against Facebook\u2019s policies, which at the time allowed GSR to take information not only from users who consented but from all their friends. It was the transfer of the data from GSR to SCL that was against Facebook\u2019s policies, the company has long maintained.\n\nAfter Cambridge Analytica\u2019s acquisition of the data for political purposes became an international scandal, Mark Zuckerberg stated that Facebook \u201clearned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica\u201d in 2015. The article detailing this data sharing was published on 11 December 2015.\n\nThe attorney general for Washington DC sued Facebook over its failure to protect user data from Cambridge Analytica in late 2018. Facebook has sought to have the case dismissed and to seal a document \u2013 currently redacted in filings \u2013 that the DC attorney general cited as evidence in his opposition to the motion to dismiss.\n\nThe document is \u201can email exchange between Facebook employees discussing how Cambridge Analytica (and others) violated Facebook\u2019s policies\u201d, according to a Monday court filing by the DC attorney general.\n\nThose emails include \u201ccandid employee assessments that multiple third-party applications accessed and sold consumer data in violation of Facebook\u2019s policies during the 2016 United States presidential election\u201d, according to the filing. \u201cIt also indicates Facebook knew of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s improper data-gathering practices months before news outlets reported on the issue,\u201d the filing continues.\n\nThe filing further asserts that \u201cas early as September 2015, a DC-based Facebook employee warned the company that Cambridge Analytica\u201d was doing something that is currently redacted and \u201creceived responses\u201d \u2013 also redacted \u2013 relating to \u201cCambridge Analytica\u2019s data-scraping practices\u201d.\n\nFacebook faces fresh questions over when it knew of data harvesting Read more\n\nA Facebook spokesperson clarified after publication that there may have been two separate instances of data misuse by Cambridge Analytica. The data-scraping referenced in the filing was not the same data harvesting that has become synonymous with Cambridge Analytica\u2019s name over the past year, the company said.\n\n\u201cFacebook was not aware of the transfer of data from Kogan/GSR to Cambridge Analytica until December 2015, as we have testified under oath,\u201d the Facebook spokesperson said. \u201cThese were two different incidents.\u201d\n\nAnd while the email exchange appears to have been referenced in a report by parliament\u2019s DCMS, it appears that the committee mistakenly assumed that the emails referred to the Kogan/GSR data, and not a separate Cambridge Analytica scraping incident.\n\nThe report states: \u201cWe were keen to know when and which people working at Facebook first knew about the GSR/Cambridge Analytica breach. The ICO [Information Commissioner\u2019s Office] confirmed, in correspondence with the Committee, that three \u2018senior managers\u2019 were involved in email exchanges earlier in 2015 concerning the GSR breach before December 2015, when it was first reported by The Guardian. At the request of the ICO, we have agreed to keep the names confidential, but it would seem that this important information was not shared with the most senior executives at Facebook, leading us to ask why this was the case.\u201d\n\nFacebook will face off with the District of Columbia in court on Friday, where a judge will hear arguments over the company\u2019s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The judge may also decide then whether to keep the email exchange sealed."

  "text": "Ongoing protests are roiling Haiti, as demonstrators take to the streets to demand President Jovenel Mo\u00efse\u2019s resignation due to government corruption and mismanagement of the country\u2019s oil fund. The protests began in July, but Mo\u00efse is facing further scrutiny after five heavily armed Americans were arrested last month near Haiti\u2019s central bank in Port-au-Prince with a cache of weapons, claiming to be on a \u201cgovernment mission.\u201d The mercenaries were quickly sent back to the United States without facing criminal charges in Haiti, sparking outrage and mounting demands that the government explain why the men had been at the central bank in the first place. An explosive new investigation by Haiti Libert\u00e9 and The Intercept has found that the mercenaries were at the central bank on a mission ordered directly by the embattled Haitian president. Their goal was to escort a presidential aide to the Haitian central bank as he transferred $80 million from the government\u2019s oil account to another account controlled by Mo\u00efse. This news comes as Haiti\u2019s Parliament has thrown out Prime Minister Jean Henry Ceant in a no-confidence vote. DN! speaks with Kim Ives, an editor of Haiti Libert\u00e9 and co-author of the new joint investigation with The Intercept."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "The U.S. Border Patrol has reportedly released hundreds of migrants from detention centers in Texas along the U.S.-Mexico border due to severe overcrowding in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that a group of 200 migrants, mostly consisting of families with children, was released into the Rio Grande Valley on Wednesday, while 50 more were released the day before. More releases will occur every day until facilities are brought down to manageable levels of detainees, according to officials.\n\n\u201cIt is a crisis,\u201d a Border Patrol official, who remained anonymous, told the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s not a self-proclaimed crisis.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBorder apprehensions surged in February to more than 66,000, a jump of 38 percent from the month before and tying some of the highest levels of migrant apprehensions in the last 10 years, according to government figures.\n\n\u201cIt reached a breaking point,\u201d an official with ICE told the newspaper.\n\nA volunteer with a local Texas organization that assists migrants told the newspaper that the Trump administration's decision to release migrants in large groups could be meant to persuade Americans of the conditions on the border.\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re trying to put some stress on the volunteer and advocacy groups, all of us touting \u2018There\u2019s no crisis down here,\u2019\u201d activist Elizabeth Cavazo told the newspaper. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s for them to save face because they\u2019ve been calling this a border crisis and everything\u2019s peachy keen down here. That\u2019s what it feels like.\u201d\n\nNews of the Trump administration's solution to the sudden influx of migrants was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The program comes despite the president's often-stated opposition to \"catch-and-release\" policies, which he has characterized as a Democratic policy.\n\nThe developments come after President Trump Donald John TrumpDems hammer Nielsen over border crisis Ocasio-Cortez responds to 'AOC sucks' chant: Trump just wants another woman to 'vilify' Conservative outlet complains about lack of Trump shout-out at rally MORE last Friday issued the first veto, stymying Congress\u2019s attempt to block him from obtaining funds for his wall at the U.S.-Mexico border without lawmakers\u2019 approval.\n\nTrump, who has called border security a \"crisis,\" said Americans would be put at risk if the \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d resolution became law.\n\nThe House next week is expected to vote on overriding Trump\u2019s veto, but leaders lack the two-thirds support of the chamber necessary to pass the bill over the president\u2019s objections."

  "text": "Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know? Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\n\n\n(Jabin Botsford and evelyn hockstein/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the aftermath of a white supremacist terror attack in New Zealand on Friday, President Trump offered his \u201cwarmest sympathy\" and \u201csolidarity\u201d with the victims, their families and compatriots. But that\u2019s about it.\n\nThe Australian-born suspect, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, killed at least 50 people in two mosques in the city of Christchurch before being apprehended by authorities. On social media and in a 74-page manifesto circulated online, he made clear that his attacks were fueled by hatred of Muslim migrants, whom he described as invaders threatening the demographic integrity of a white nation. Like other ethno-nationalists in the West, he imagined himself as part of a broader warped history, inscribing on his weaponry the names of medieval warriors of Christendom who fought the armies of Islamic empires.\n\nWhen Trump asked New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern how he could help, she reportedly suggested he offer his \u201csympathy and love for all Muslim communities.\u201d But the U.S. president spent the weekend on Twitter once more decrying immigrant \u201cinvaders\u201d and defending a Fox News host who had just been suspended for Islamophobic remarks. At no point did he communicate any wider empathy for Muslims around the world or explicitly condemn white supremacy. Two days after the slaughter in Christchurch, Trump had yet to speak with his ambassador in Wellington.\n\nWhat has happened in Christchurch is an extraordinary act of unprecedented violence. It has no place in New Zealand. Many of those affected will be members of our migrant communities \u2013 New Zealand is their home \u2013 they are us. \u2014 Jacinda Ardern (@jacindaardern) March 15, 2019\n\nThis weekend, rather than focusing on the global rise of white nationalist militancy, Trump and his lieutenants downplayed its threat. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, was even compelled to atone on national television: \u201cThe president is not a white supremacist,\u201d he insisted. But too often in these instances, Trump\u2019s dismissals and disavowals ring hollow.\n\nNot for nothing did Tarrant hail Trump in his bigoted manifesto \u201cas a symbol of white identity and renewed purpose.\u201d Trump built his political career in part by weaponizing anti-Muslim sentiment in the West, promising sweeping bans against Muslims, grandstanding against Syrian refugees, and winking encouragement toward domestic extremists on the far right.\n\nTrump is not to blame for the tragedy in Christchurch. But, as an editorial in The Washington Post noted, there isn\u2019t much daylight between the \u201cgarden-variety racism\u201d of Tarrant\u2019s manifesto and the far-right nativism at times espoused by Trump and his advisers.\n\nMy colleagues pointed to the particular emphasis Tarrant seemed to place on the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory, a belief popular among the West\u2019s far right that white populations face \u201cgenocide\u201d as a result of declining birthrates and mass immigration. In his manifesto, Tarrant pointed to the formative impact of a trip to France in 2017, where he was disturbed by the number of Muslims he saw in a midsize French town.\n\n\u201cAs I sat there in the parking lot, in my rental car, I watched a stream of the invaders walk through the shopping centre\u2019s front doors,\u201d Tarrant wrote. \u201cFor every French man or woman there was double the number of invaders. I had seen enough, and in anger, drove out of the town, refusing to stay any longer in the cursed place and headed on to the next town.\u201d\n\nEuropeans greatly overestimate Muslim population, poll shows, with greatest perception gap in France https://t.co/KcSSz9bfrj pic.twitter.com/ldblbNZfEJ \u2014 Guardian Data (@GuardianData) December 14, 2016\n\nThough immigration levels have dropped significantly in Europe since 2015 \u2014 and though Muslims are a small minority in virtually every European country \u2014 this belief remains a virulent mobilizer of the European far right and has spread in various forms both across the Atlantic and to the Antipodes.\n\nRenaud Camus, the polemicist whose thesis in his 2012 book \u201cThe Great Replacement\u201d almost certainly influenced Tarrant, decried the gunman\u2019s actions in an interview with The Washington Post. But he felt little concern over how his ideas were being interpreted by far-right politicians and proliferated in the online echo chambers where Tarrant stewed in his hatred.\n\n\u201cTo the fact that people take notice of the ethnic substitution that is in progress in my country?\u201d he ventured to my colleague James McAuley. \u201cNo. To the contrary.\u201d\n\nCamus is hardly an outlier. Former Trump adviser Stephen K.

Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\n\n\n(Jabin Botsford and evelyn hockstein/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the aftermath of a white supremacist terror attack in New Zealand on Friday, President Trump offered his \u201cwarmest sympathy\" and \u201csolidarity\u201d with the victims, their families and compatriots. But that\u2019s about it.\n\nThe Australian-born suspect, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, killed at least 50 people in two mosques in the city of Christchurch before being apprehended by authorities. On social media and in a 74-page manifesto circulated online, he made clear that his attacks were fueled by hatred of Muslim migrants, whom he described as invaders threatening the demographic integrity of a white nation. Like other ethno-nationalists in the West, he imagined himself as part of a broader warped history, inscribing on his weaponry the names of medieval warriors of Christendom who fought the armies of Islamic empires.\n\nWhen Trump asked New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern how he could help, she reportedly suggested he offer his \u201csympathy and love for all Muslim communities.\u201d But the U.S. president spent the weekend on Twitter once more decrying immigrant \u201cinvaders\u201d and defending a Fox News host who had just been suspended for Islamophobic remarks. At no point did he communicate any wider empathy for Muslims around the world or explicitly condemn white supremacy. Two days after the slaughter in Christchurch, Trump had yet to speak with his ambassador in Wellington.\n\nWhat has happened in Christchurch is an extraordinary act of unprecedented violence. It has no place in New Zealand. Many of those affected will be members of our migrant communities \u2013 New Zealand is their home \u2013 they are us. \u2014 Jacinda Ardern (@jacindaardern) March 15, 2019\n\nThis weekend, rather than focusing on the global rise of white nationalist militancy, Trump and his lieutenants downplayed its threat. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, was even compelled to atone on national television: \u201cThe president is not a white supremacist,\u201d he insisted. But too often in these instances, Trump\u2019s dismissals and disavowals ring hollow.\n\nNot for nothing did Tarrant hail Trump in his bigoted manifesto \u201cas a symbol of white identity and renewed purpose.\u201d Trump built his political career in part by weaponizing anti-Muslim sentiment in the West, promising sweeping bans against Muslims, grandstanding against Syrian refugees, and winking encouragement toward domestic extremists on the far right.\n\nTrump is not to blame for the tragedy in Christchurch. But, as an editorial in The Washington Post noted, there isn\u2019t much daylight between the \u201cgarden-variety racism\u201d of Tarrant\u2019s manifesto and the far-right nativism at times espoused by Trump and his advisers.\n\nMy colleagues pointed to the particular emphasis Tarrant seemed to place on the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory, a belief popular among the West\u2019s far right that white populations face \u201cgenocide\u201d as a result of declining birthrates and mass immigration. In his manifesto, Tarrant pointed to the formative impact of a trip to France in 2017, where he was disturbed by the number of Muslims he saw in a midsize French town.\n\n\u201cAs I sat there in the parking lot, in my rental car, I watched a stream of the invaders walk through the shopping centre\u2019s front doors,\u201d Tarrant wrote. \u201cFor every French man or woman there was double the number of invaders. I had seen enough, and in anger, drove out of the town, refusing to stay any longer in the cursed place and headed on to the next town.\u201d\n\nEuropeans greatly overestimate Muslim population, poll shows, with greatest perception gap in France https://t.co/KcSSz9bfrj pic.twitter.com/ldblbNZfEJ \u2014 Guardian Data (@GuardianData) December 14, 2016\n\nThough immigration levels have dropped significantly in Europe since 2015 \u2014 and though Muslims are a small minority in virtually every European country \u2014 this belief remains a virulent mobilizer of the European far right and has spread in various forms both across the Atlantic and to the Antipodes.\n\nRenaud Camus, the polemicist whose thesis in his 2012 book \u201cThe Great Replacement\u201d almost certainly influenced Tarrant, decried the gunman\u2019s actions in an interview with The Washington Post. But he felt little concern over how his ideas were being interpreted by far-right politicians and proliferated in the online echo chambers where Tarrant stewed in his hatred.\n\n\u201cTo the fact that people take notice of the ethnic substitution that is in progress in my country?\u201d he ventured to my colleague James McAuley. \u201cNo. To the contrary.\u201d\n\nCamus is hardly an outlier. Former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon has invoked the writings of Jean Raspail, whose deeply racist 1973 novel \u201cThe Camp of the Saints\u201d conjured an epochal influx of swarthy migrants subsuming France. In 2015, French far-right leader Marine Le Pen urged her supporters to read the book.\n\nRaspail is more blunt about what he thinks should be the necessary response to migration. \"There is going to be a resistance movement, and it has begun,\u201d Raspail told journalist Sasha Polakow-Suransky in 2016. \u201cIf the situation becomes the one I predict \u2014 catastrophic \u2014 there will certainly be resistance that is both tough and armed. \u2026 Without the use of force, we will never stop the invasion.\u201d\n\nTo some, that the ideas of figures like Raspail and Camus even get politely aired in mainstream media and viewed as part of a legitimate debate is itself the problem.

  "authors": [],
  "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nMarch 18, 2019, 2:32 AM GMT By Associated Press\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. \u2014 Two young men were found dead inside torched cars. Three others died in apparent suicides. Another collapsed on a bus, his death ruled an overdose.\n\nThe six deaths, all involving men with connections to protests in Ferguson, Missouri, drew attention on social media and speculation in the activist community that something sinister was at play.\n\nPolice say that there is no evidence the deaths have anything to do with the protests stemming from a white police officer\u2019s fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, and that two were homicides with no known link to the protests.\n\nBut some activists say their concerns about a possible connection arise out of a culture of fear that persists in Ferguson four and a half years after Brown\u2019s death, citing threats \u2014 mostly anonymous \u2014 that protest leaders continue to receive.\n\nThe Rev. Darryl Gray said he found a box inside his car. When the bomb squad arrived, no explosives were found but a 6-foot python was inside.\n\n\u201cEverybody is on pins and needles,\u201d Gray said of his fellow activists.\n\nNo arrests have been made in the two homicides. St. Louis County police spokesman Shawn McGuire said witnesses have simply refused to come forward, leaving detectives with no answers for why the men were targeted.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe either one was connected to each other,\u201d McGuire said, but adding, \u201cIt\u2019s tough to come up with a motive without a suspect.\u201d\n\nFerguson erupted in protests in August 2014 after officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown during a street confrontation. Brown was unarmed, but Wilson said he fired in self-defense when the black teenager came at him menacingly.\n\nA grand jury declined to charge Wilson in November 2014, prompting one of the most violent nights of demonstrations, and one of the first activist deaths.\n\nDeandre Joshua\u2019s body was found inside a burned car blocks from the protest. The 20-year-old was shot in the head before the car was torched.\n\nDarren Seals, shown on video comforting Brown\u2019s mother that same night, met an almost identical fate two years later. The 29-year-old\u2019s bullet-riddled body was found inside a burning car in September 2016.\n\nThe four other deaths, including the three by suicide, were:\n\n\u2014 MarShawn McCarrel of Columbus, Ohio, shot himself in February 2016 outside the front door of the Ohio Statehouse, police said. He had been active in Ferguson.\n\n\u2014 Edward Crawford Jr., 27, fatally shot himself in May 2017 after telling acquaintances he had been distraught over personal issues, police said. A photo of Crawford firing a tear gas canister back at police during a Ferguson protest was part of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage.\n\n\u2014 In October, 24-year-old Danye Jones was found hanging from a tree in the yard of his north St. Louis County home. His mother, Melissa McKinnies, was active in Ferguson and posted on Facebook after her son\u2019s death, \u201cThey lynched my baby.\u201d But the death was ruled a suicide.\n\n\u2014 Bassem Masri, a 31-year-old Palestinian American who frequently livestreamed video of Ferguson demonstrations, was found unresponsive on a bus in November and couldn\u2019t be revived. Toxicology results released in February showed he died of an overdose of fentanyl.\n\nThe Ferguson protests added momentum to the national Black Lives Matter movement, but they also generated resentment from people angered by TV footage of protesters hurling rocks and insults at police. Amid lingering anger, activists and observers say that while they see no clear connection between the deaths and the protests, they can\u2019t help but wonder about the thoroughness of the investigations.\n\n\u201cThese protesters and their deaths may not be a high priority for (police) since there is this antagonistic relationship,\u201d Washington University sociologist Odis Johnson said. \u201cI think there is a need for them to have a greater sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nActivists say that in the years since the protests, they have been targeted in dangerous ways.\n\n\u201cSomething is happening,\u201d said Cori Bush, a frequent leader of the Ferguson protests. \u201cI\u2019ve been vocal about the things that I\u2019ve experienced and still experience \u2014 the harassment, the intimidation, the death threats, the death attempts.\u201d\n\nBush said her car has been run off the road, her home has been vandalized, and in 2014 someone shot a bullet into her car, narrowly missing her daughter, who was 13 at the time.\n\nShe suspects white supremacists or police sympathizers. Living under constant threat is exhausting, she said, but she won\u2019t give in.\n\n\u201cThey shut us up and they win,\u201d Bush said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if residual stress from the protests or harassment contributed to the suicides, but Johnson said many activists feel a sense of hopelessness.\n\n\u201cThis has to have a big impact on their mental health,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFor many, law enforcement is not a recourse. Many times law enforcement is not on their side.\u201d\n\nExperts say the deaths also are indicative of a concern at the core of the protests \u2014 the underlying difficulty of life for young people of color. Five of the men who died were black and in their 20s.\n\nBlack St. Louis County residents are three times more likely than whites to be poor, often meaning they lack adequate health insurance that could allow them to better address not only physical ailments but mental health issues like depression and anxiety.\n\nThey also tend to live in areas with higher crime rates. The 2010 U.S. census showed that while people who live in wealthy and mostly white western St. Louis County can expect to live well into their 80s, life expectancy in parts of mostly black north St. Louis County reaches only into the 60s. Life expectancy in Kinloch, a few miles from Ferguson, is 56.\n\nForty-five of the county\u2019s 60 homicide victims last year were black in a county where less than a quarter of the population is black, according to police statistics.\n\n\u201cHere in St. Louis, unfortunately, we have allowed the culture of crime and violence to morph into dimensions that anybody\u2019s at risk any day, any time,\u201d said James Clark of the nonprofit Better Family Life."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "Friday\u2019s mass shooting in New Zealand is sharpening scrutiny of the rhetoric of international political figures, including President Trump Donald John TrumpDems hammer Nielsen over border crisis Ocasio-Cortez responds to 'AOC sucks' chant: Trump just wants another woman to 'vilify' Conservative outlet complains about lack of Trump shout-out at rally MORE.\n\nEven trenchant Trump critics have not accused him of a direct line of culpability for the shooting at two mosques in Christchurch that left at least 49 people dead. It was the worst mass shooting in New Zealand\u2019s modern history.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the massacre has reinvigorated criticism that Trump has empowered extremists and Islamophobes globally since his 2015 call for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"\n\nGeorge Selim, senior vice president of programs at the Anti-Defamation League, declined to be drawn into specific comments on Trump in a Friday interview with The Hill but said, \"You need look no further than what the [alleged] shooter himself has said about political leaders in the United States.\"\n\nThe alleged shooter, Brenton Tarrant, is said to have published a lengthy manifesto on the internet before the attack.\n\nIn a question-and-answer section, the person thought to be Tarrant addressed the question of whether he was a Trump supporter.\n\n\"As a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose? Sure,\" the document states. \"As a policy maker and leader? Dear god no.\"\n\nWhite House aides have pushed back fiercely at suggestions that there is a common thread linking \u2014 however distantly or indirectly \u2014 the rhetoric used by Trump with the actions seen in Christchurch.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway Kellyanne Elizabeth ConwayTrump says Schiff should be forced to resign Trump: Schiff should be forced out of office Schiff defiant: 'Undoubtedly, there is collusion' MORE told reporters on Friday afternoon that the alleged shooter was \"wrong\" to see Trump as a symbol of white identity. She also objected to media coverage of the manifesto, saying, \"I think you should cover the entire manifesto if you\u2019re going to cherry-pick a piece of it.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, White House strategic communications director Mercedes Schlapp blasted any attempt to link the shooter\u2019s actions and Trump\u2019s rhetoric as \"outrageous.\"\n\nBut Trump fueled the controversy on Friday afternoon when he pushed back against the idea that white nationalism was a growing problem.\n\n\"I don\u2019t really [think so],\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I think it\u2019s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess.\"\n\nDuring the same encounter, marking the president\u2019s veto of a congressional resolution disapproving of his declaration of a national emergency regarding immigration, Trump referred to the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border as an \"invasion.\"\n\n\"People hate the word 'invasion,' but that\u2019s what it is,\" he said, according to pool reports.\n\nIn Tarrant\u2019s apparent manifesto, he repeatedly portrayed himself as seeking to stop an \"invasion\" of predominantly white countries by people of non-European heritage.\n\nWhite extremism has long been a flashpoint between defenders and critics of the Trump administration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe most infamous example came in 2017 amid fatal violence in Charlottesville, Va. In that instance, Trump referred to \"some very fine people on both sides\" despite the fact that one side included neo-Nazis and anti-Semites.\n\nThe title of Tarrant\u2019s manifesto, \"The Great Replacement,\" carried a similar echo to one of the chants heard in Charlottesville: \"You will not replace us! Jews will not replace us!\"\n\nAlmost immediately upon taking office, Trump ordered a ban on immigration from several countries with predominantly Muslim populations \u2014 a \"Muslim ban,\" as his critics called it.\n\nThe travel ban was mired in court challenges, though a modified version was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court in June 2018.\n\nMore recently, Trump called himself a \"nationalist\" during an October 2018 rally in Texas. The remark was seen by his defenders as encapsulating his \"America First\" approach to governing but as something more sinister by his critics.\n\nSelim, who served in the administrations of former President George W. Bush, former President Obama and during the first six months of the Trump administration, noted that \"when hateful rhetoric is allowed in our public square without condemnation, it gives the green light to extremists to speak up \u2014 and in the case of New Zealand, act on it; and in the case of Pittsburgh, act on it.\"\n\nIn October, 11 people were killed in a shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Robert Bowers, who has been charged with carrying out the mass killing but has pleaded not guilty, allegedly posted anti-Semitic sentiments and extreme xenophobic views on the internet.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Christchurch mass shooting, Rep. Rashida Tlaib Rashida Harbi TlaibTlaib on meeting Obama: He looked straight at me and said 'I'm proud of you' Steyer calls for 'must-see TV' congressional hearings on Trump Tlaib unveils resolution to investigate Trump impeachment MORE (D-Mich.) released a statement that she was \"so angry at those who follow the 'white supremacy' agenda in my own country.\" In November, Tlaib and Rep. Ilhan Omar Ilhan OmarTlaib on meeting Obama: He looked straight at me and said 'I'm proud of you' Hannity: Fox News host Jeanine Pirro to return on Saturday Overnight Defense: Pentagon transfers B for wall over Dem objections | Top general says North Korean activities 'inconsistent' with denuclearization | Pentagon details bases at risk from climate change MORE (D-Minn.) became the first Muslim women elected to Congress.\n\nNihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said on Friday that since Trump\u2019s campaign for the presidency, \"Islamophobia took a sharp rise, and attacks on innocent Muslims, innocent immigrants and mosques have skyrocketed.\"\n\nBut the events in Christchurch have also fueled discussion about the role of social media, both in fomenting extreme views and as a platform to disseminate actual acts of terrorism.\n\nA video of the Christchurch mass shooting, apparently filmed by the shooter, appeared in real time and was widely disseminated in the immediate aftermath, though most social media companies tried to scrub it from their platforms.\n\nTo date, no one has a simple solution to the challenges posed by social media, though there are some suggested remedies on specific topics. Some question whether companies should allow livestreaming without a delay if that capability is going to be used for footage of murder, for example.\n\nMeanwhile, there seems no doubt that the debate over Trump\u2019s rhetoric will only deepen \u2014 especially since the president himself sees no need to temper it.\n\nOn Friday, he called what happened in Christchurch \"monstrous terror acts\" and \"horrible.\"\n\nHe soon turned his attention back to immigration.\n\n\"We\u2019re bursting at the seams,\" he said.\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency."

The measure passed 54-47 and heads to the House where it appears likely to pass. The bill marks a rare show of partisan unity against the President. It passed the Senate last December but not the Republican-controlled House, so it was revived again in the Senate this year.\n\n\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders who pushed for the bill, said in a statement, \"U.S. participation in this war has not been authorized by Congress and is therefore unconstitutional. For the first time in 45 years, Congress must exercise its power under the War Powers Resolution and remove the U.S. from this war in Yemen.\" Trump has already said he will veto the bill if it passes both chambers."

Liyna Anwar is an Indian-American producer who used to work at StoryCorps. She desperately needs a stem cell transplant, but she does not match any of her family members or the 19 million people in a national registry. Her search for a match is made more difficult because South Asians are underrepresented in the national registry. A campaign urging people of South Asian descent to donate stem cells has been launched in Anwar\u2019s name. It\u2019s called #SwabForLiyna. DN! speaks with her brother Dr. Abbas Anwar and an expert on acute myelogenous leukemia, Dr. Azra Raza. DN! also speaks with Dave Isay, the founder of StoryCorps."

  "authors": [
    "Jack Morse"
  ],
  "text": "As if you needed another reason to stop posting on Facebook.\n\nThe Trump administration is reportedly working in collaboration with the Social Security Administration to develop a plan for combing through social media posts for evidence \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 that those receiving certain types of government benefits should have those benefits denied. That's right, your 'gram-worthy vacation pics could soon cause you to lose your disability insurance benefits.\n\nSo reports the New York Times, which cites \"administration officials\" as confirming that the White House is \"actively\" working on making this authoritarian fever dream a reality. The idea is not a new one, the Times notes, having been suggested in an earlier Social Security budget request, but this new reporting confirms that it's moved past the conceptual phase.\n\nEssentially, the proposal relies on the belief hat people with disabilities can never do physically active things and that all disabilities are visible. It also overlooks the simple fact that not all photos posted to Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter are in fact current.\n\nImagine a photo of you smiling and holding a golf club next to another person on a sunny day. You, a person on disability for back problems, must be lying about your health status according to the logic of the plan. No matter the extenuating circumstances \u2014 the clubs were actually a gift to your dad on Father's Day, for example, or the photo was taken years ago \u2014 you might get pegged for committing fraud.\n\nThat what you post to social media could be mined and used against you by some opaque organization is an idea as old as social media itself. Credit card companies have been analyzing our online posts for years, and we've all heard the horror stories of universities and colleges looking at applicants' Twitter and Facebook feeds. What makes this latest plan so pernicious, however, is that we're not talking about a credit card application getting declined.\n\nRather, the issue is a financial benefit being pulled out from under someone all because of a poorly considered Facebook post.\n\nOf course, this doesn't even take into consideration the potential for a new form of trolling to arise in response to the Trump administration's plan: fake social media accounts set up with the express purpose of targeting those receiving disability payments and getting them flagged for manufactured fraud.\n\nIf you don't think that's a real concern, then you haven't spent enough time online (and, honestly, you should probably stick with that healthy lifestyle choice).\n\nFor now, the only real protection we may have against this form of governmental overreach may be not posting personal pics or revealing details of any kind to social media. Which, frankly, is a good idea regardless of whatever madness this administration cooks up. And hey, apps like Signal work great for sharing beach pics."

It will be completely ignored by Congress and won\u2019t even provide a baseline for discussions. Still, it does provide a look at the president\u2019s priorities:\n\nThe budget also calls on increased military spending [and] for the first time calls for cutting $845 billion from Medicare, the popular health care program for the elderly that in the past he had largely said he would protect.\n\nThat isn\u2019t peanuts: it\u2019s about 10 percent of total Medicare spending. (As usual with budgets, this is a ten-year number, not a cut for a single year.) In fact, this is so far from being peanuts that it\u2019s nearly insane. Did Mick Mulvaney put this in without Trump knowing about it? Or is Trump testing the theory that he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and his fans wouldn\u2019t care?\n\nAnyway, this provides a great opportunity for creative attack ads from Democrats.

  "title": "The Western Erasure of African Tragedy",

  "text": "Elsewhere, Western publications engaged in selective reporting about the deceased. The Washington Post, for example, led its homepage coverage Sunday with a headline that informed readers only that \u201cEight Americans among 157 people killed in Ethiopian Airlines crash.\u201d (The Washington metropolitan area has the largest population of Ethiopian descent outside the country itself.) In a tweet about the national background of the deceased, the Associated Press listed eight nations affected by the crash. Not one of the countries mentioned in the AP\u2019s list is populated by black Africans. This, despite the fact that Kenya topped the list of the deceased, with 32, and nine Ethiopians were on board. On CNN and BBC News, the presence of American and British nationals respectively is what drew narrative prominence. (In a brutal irony, the Nigerian writer Pius Adesanmi, author of You\u2019re Not a Country, Africa, was among those on the flight.)\n\nFor many African readers, and other black people across the diaspora, it is perhaps unsurprising that Western media outlets would fail to report on a tragedy as devastating as the Ethiopian Airlines crash as\u2014first and foremost\u2014an African tragedy. Both the impulse to question the largest African air carrier\u2019s credibility and the hyper-focus on Western passengers are consistent with the pervasive, long-running Western disdain for\u2014or simple inability to empathize with\u2014people of African descent. Since the advent of the transatlantic slave trade, Africa has been treated largely as a repository for the Western world\u2019s fears (and during the colonial era, as the site of Europe\u2019s most dangerous and banal desires). Africa\u2019s residents and descendants, then, are more often portrayed as threats than as people.\n\nRead: Nia Wilson and the formula for covering black death\n\nConsider the recent New York Times reporting on the January terrorist attack in Nairobi, during which 21 people were killed. The outlet\u2019s first article about the assault on the luxury hotel and office complex in Kenya\u2019s capital was tweeted with a photo of three dead Kenyan men, their bullet-riddled bodies slumped over chairs on the hotel\u2019s veranda. The photo of the deceased men was also the lead image on the article page. This was a tone-deaf decision that magnified the damage of the initial tragedy by failing to account for the image\u2019s psychological impact. The photo drew a swift backlash, particularly from Kenyan readers and others with ties to the continent, who noted that the Times frequently covers violent crime in the United States and Europe without posting gruesome images of slain victims.\n\n\n\nBut rather than remove the disturbing photo, the Times published a conversation with two editors about the decision to share it. One acknowledged that \u201cthere are people in the newsroom who felt in retrospect that we shouldn\u2019t have run the Nairobi photo,\u201d and said that the Times \u201ccan do a better job of having consistent standards that apply across the world.\u201d"

  "text": "Thousands of Maryland teachers and education advocates are expected to pour into Annapolis for a march and rally to push for more school funding Monday night.\n\nThe \u201cMarch for Our Schools\u201d will lead to road closures and traffic delays.\n\nThe Maryland State Education Association is bussing in thousands of participants. Annapolis officials expect at least 7,500 participants, which would make it one of the largest rallies in the state\u2019s capital city in the past decade.\n\nPrince George\u2019s County Public Schools are dismissing two hours early to allow teachers and students more time to get to Annapolis.\n\nThe state teachers\u2019 union believes that Maryland\u2019s public schools are underfunded and need $2.9 billion more each year.\n\nState lawmakers are taking steps to boost education funding, adding more money for schools to Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s proposed $46 billion state budget as it makes its way through the General Assembly.\n\nThe House of Delegates Appropriations Committee voted on Friday to add $320 million more for public schools. The extra money is meant to start paying for recommendations of the so-called Kirwan Commission that studied ways to improve public schools, such as paying teachers more and expanding prekindergarten.\n\nA bill that would put that funding into law, and require even more funding next year, is being considered by lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, the ACLU and the NAACP are trying to reopen a settled lawsuit in an attempt to force the state to provide more funding for Baltimore public schools.\n\nParticipants in the rally plan to gather at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium and march down Rowe Boulevard to the intersection with Calvert Street. There, a stage will be set up for a program of speakers.\n\nRowe Boulevard \u2014 one of the main routes into Annapolis \u2014 will be closed at 6 p.m. when the march begins.

  "text": "In light of the reported Trump plan to make America\u2019s longtime allies pay what amounts to protection money, this is an important moment to revisit the resignation in protest last December of Defense Secretary James Mattis. It was a milestone in modern U.S. history that put in bold relief an avalanche of criticism from top national-security officials, all with a common theme: The commander in chief is unfit.\n\nThe Letter\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis was deep into a dark day of the soul that he had long seen coming when, on Dec. 19, 2018, he received a call on his private phone. Mattis checked the identification, recognized a friend and answered the call.\n\n\u201cJim, say it isn\u2019t so,\u201d said William Cohen, himself a former defense secretary, and before that a Republican senator from Maine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, Bill,\u201d Mattis told him, confirming the shocking news that President Donald Trump had just fired off tweets prematurely claiming victory in the war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and ordering the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Syria. Trump also called for withdrawing half the 14,000 U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan, likely crippling that mission as well.\n\nTrump\u2019s snap decision on Syria came just after Mattis met with partners in the anti-ISIS coalition and assured them the United States would remain committed to the Syrian mission through 2020. Rather than consulting with his top national-security advisers, Trump made the surprise decision after talking by phone with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an autocrat fond of anti-American rhetoric and conspiracies.\n\nIn 280 characters or less, Trump had thus thrown U.S. strategy in the Middle East and Southwest Asia into disarray, with aftershocks quickly rumbling in capitals throughout the region and as far away as Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin predictably praised the decision, telling Russian media that \u201cDonald is correct about this.\u201d\n\n\u201c Why has Trump adopted an agenda that exactly replicates Vladimir Putin\u2019s bucket list? \u201d \u2014 Former Defense Secretary William Cohen\n\nThe phone call between Mattis and Cohen was the first time the two men had spoken since the latter testified on Mattis\u2019 behalf during his Senate confirmation in January 2017. Congress had to waive a mandated seven-year waiting period before a retired general like Mattis could be considered for the top civilian job overseeing the sprawling Defense Department. The waiting period was designed to preserve the sacrosanct principle of unambiguous civilian control of the U.S. military.\n\nBill Cohen had endorsed Mattis for the job in 2017 out of a belief that the election of the first president of the United States who had never served in either the military or government called for extraordinary measures, and nothing that had happened since changed that conviction. After Cohen\u2019s congressional testimony, he and Mattis had exchanged private phone numbers, in case the latter ever needed some advice or a sympathetic ear. From the somber tone of Mattis\u2019 voice, Cohen figured that day had finally arrived.\n\n\u201cHow soon are the troops coming out?\u201d Cohen asked.\n\n\u201cImmediately,\u201d said Mattis, and he didn\u2019t have to fill in the blanks for his friend.\n\nThere would be no careful preparation and planning for the U.S. military chain-of-command, no advance consultation with close U.S. allies whose security would be jeopardized, no strategy to inform the vast U.S. government bureaucracy and the multinational anti-ISIS coalition how best to respond to the change of missions and goals. Just more of the impulsive, ready-fire-aim decision-making that increasingly had come to define President Trump and the White House. Only this time, lives literally hung in the balance.\n\nCharacteristically, on one of the most difficult days of his long career, Mattis\u2019 thoughts turned to the countless thousands of U.S. troops under his command. As a Marine Corps brigadier general and lifelong bachelor, Mattis had once pulled all-night watch duty on Christmas Eve so that a junior officer could spend Christmas with his wife and young children. The gesture explains why Mattis is sometimes affectionately referred to as a \u201cwarrior monk,\u201d and detests the wartime nickname of \u201cMad Dog\u201d that Trump had found enthralling.\n\nOn Dec. 19, Mattis thus composed a holiday video and letter to the troops, knowing full well the confusion and chaos that was about to be unleashed.\n\n\u201cTo those in the field or at sea, \u2018keeping the watch by night\u2019 this holiday season, you should recognize that you carry on the proud legacy of those who stood the watch in decades past. In this world awash in change, you hold the line,\u201d Mattis wrote, and, ever the student of military history, referenced General Washington and his troops crossing the Delaware River at Christmas in 1776. As if reflecting his somber mood, Mattis closed with a warning of sorts. \u201cStorm clouds loom, yet because of you, your fellow citizens live safe at home.\u201d\n\nMattis composed another letter for an altogether different audience, one that would land him unhappily in the history books as the first secretary of defense ever to resign in protest because of fundamental disagreements with his commander in chief.\n\nThe next morning, he carried that letter to the White House, where one last time Mattis tried to persuade the president to reverse course, but Trump\u2019s mind was made up. Mattis handed over his resignation letter and agreed to stay on the job for another two months in order to ensure a smooth transition and conclude an important NATO defense ministers meeting scheduled for February. Trump played the resignation as business as usual, tweeting a few hours later, \u201cGeneral Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February.\u201d Apparently Trump had not bothered to read the resignation letter.\n\nOnce back at the Pentagon, Mattis the old soldier was not ready to fade away so quietly. He instructed staff to distribute the resignation letter widely. Journalists and close Washington observers immediately recognized the letter for what it was\u2013a damning critique of the commander-in-chief. After nearly two years on the job, the president who emerges clearly from Mattis\u2019 carefully worded resignation is dismissive of the U.S. alliances that provide the sinew in America\u2019s superpower reach, and is unable or unwilling to grasp the profound threat to U.S. interests and the liberal international order posed by authoritarian regimes like Russia and China.\n\n\u201cMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,\u201d Mattis concluded in his letter. \u201cBecause you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\u201d\n\nWhen the true meaning of Mattis\u2019 letter was splashed across television screens and debated on cable news shows, Trump got the message and responded in a predictable fit of pique. Days later, he announced Mattis would not be staying on until February after all, and would vacate the Pentagon premises by Jan. 1, 2019. Of course Trump delivered the news by tweet.\n\n\u201cThe warrior in Jim Mattis never quit on a mission in his life, but I could tell by the tone in his voice that day that he had reached his breaking point,\u201d Cohen said in an interview. He noted that Mattis had been increasingly at odds with the president on a list of weighty issues, from Trump\u2019s frequent contention that the NATO alliance is a swindle and the European Union \u201ca foe,\u201d to his inexplicable deference to Putin in preference to his own intelligence community. \u201cKnowing Jim Mattis and seeing Trump\u2019s fickle and impulsive leadership, and the shameful mental abuse that he routinely inflicts on his top advisers, I think Mattis only stuck around for as long as he did out of a strong sense of patriotism. But at some point you have to ask yourself if you can do the job and still maintain your sense of integrity.\u201d\n\nThe Tsunami\n\nIn the short interim since the Mattis resignation the nation has endured the longest government shutdown in history, for instance, and President Trump delivered a State of the Union address in which he conjured a national security emergency out of an immigrant caravan on the southern border, while announcing a second summit with North Korea\u2019s truly threatening dictator Kim Jong Un, who Trump has \u201cfallen in love\u201d with over Kim\u2019s \u201cbeautiful letters.\u201d\n\nIn late January, leaders of the U.S. Intelligence Community testified before Congress and publicly contradicted the president\u2019s claims that a North Korea armed with nuclear weapons is no longer a threat, that ISIS has been defeated, and that the situation at the southern border with Mexico amounts to a national security emergency.\n\nIn the interim U.S. policy in the Middle East has also predictably devolved into strategic incoherence, with top Trump administration officials traveling to the region and announcing long-term conditions for the withdrawal of the 2,000 U.S. troops that is already well underway, and then backtracking after being contradicted by President Trump\u2019s tweets. In another jarring break with civil-military tradition, U.S. Central Command chief General Joseph Votel recently publicly disagreed with his commander-in-chief\u2019s decision to pull troops out of Syria, stating unequivocally in an interview with CNN that ISIS has not been defeated. Then Trump reversed course yet again and announced that roughly 400 U.S. troops would be staying in Syria after all, along with allied partners.\n\nIn mid-February, Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Europe and lashed out at the United States\u2019 closest and most important NATO allies for failing to fall obediently in line behind the Trump administration\u2019s unilateral decision to abandon a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, and then warned of a growing divide in transatlantic relations that is already acutely felt in Europe. Trump also officially declared a \u201cnational emergency\u201d on the southern border in an effort to bypass Congress and build a wall with taxpayer money, an assault on Congressional authorities and the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers that a bipartisan group of 58 former senior intelligence, diplomatic and national security officials denounced as unjustified and a serious erosion of presidential credibility \u201cwith foreign leaders , both friend and foe.\u201d\n\nTo cap off the tumultuous month, Trump\u2019s late-February summit with Kim Jong Un in Vietnam collapsed in disarray, with Trump abruptly walking away from the negotiating table and foregoing a planned signing ceremony and North Korea resuming construction at a long-range missile testing facility.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of media outlets recently reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller will soon complete his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and possible Trump campaign collusion in that effort, even as Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified before Congress and alleged under oath that his former boss was involved as president in criminal activity.\n\nDefense Secretary Mattis\u2019 resignation-in-protest may have sunk quickly beneath that tsunami of headlines, but it is viewed as an important marker by some of the nation\u2019s most respected former flag officers and national security officials precisely because the issues it highlighted put the current chaos and rapidly mounting crises into context. Their willingness to break with the nonpartisan tradition of even retired U.S. military and intelligence officials and speak out is due in part to the historic nature of the resignation and the respect accorded Mattis as one of the preeminent warrior intellectuals of his generation of military leaders. But his resignation is also notable for the critique of the commander-in-chief that accompanied it, and the belief by many stewards of U.S. national security that it largely explains why America and the alliance of free peoples that it professes to lead feel so dangerously unstable right now, with worse very likely to come.\n\nThe Generals\n\n\u201cIf we have someone who is as selfless and committed as Jim Mattis resigning his position, walking away from all the responsibility he feels for every service member in our forces, and he does so in a public way like that, we ought to stop and say, \u2018Okay, why did he do it?\u2019\u201d said retired General Stanley McChrystal, former commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, and a Special Forces pioneer who was behind the 2006 killing of arch terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. Speaking to ABC News\u2019 Martha Raddatz, McChrystal suggested that \u201cwe ought to ask what kind of commander-in-chief he had that Jim Mattis, \u2018the good Marine,\u2019 felt he had to walk away.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, McChrystal left no doubt that he believes the commander Mattis walked away from is not only fundamentally dishonest, but also \u201cimmoral.\u201d That assessment provides a \u201cpretty good summary of what most generals think about the President\u2019s character,\u201d Admiral James Stavridis, a former Supreme Allied Commander at NATO, wrote recently in Time Magazine. Stavridis attributes the exodus of Mattis and the other generals in Trump\u2019s inner circle to the president\u2019s chronic lack of discipline, indifference towards preparation and expert opinion, impulsive decision-making even on matters of great consequence, and instinctively dismissive attitude towards allies.\n\n\u201cI think Secretary Mattis clearly felt that Trump\u2019s attitude toward our allies hurt the U.S. position in the world, but the Syria pullout\u2013done without benefit of a coherent interagency process\u2013was the final straw,\u201d Stavridis wrote me in an email.\n\nRetired Lt. General Mark Hertling formerly commanded the U.S. Army Europe, and he was an assistant division commander in Iraq. \u201cI was not really surprised by Mattis\u2019 resignation, because I had been wondering what was taking him so long given how frequently Trump was walking his top advisers to the edge in terms of ethics and morality,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWhat worries me now is that Trump has created an absolutely toxic leadership environment that has driven good people like Mattis away, and the replacements and those who remain have shown no courage nor inclination to push back against the president\u2019s worst impulses. Instead Trump has created a cabal of like-minded people who share his worldview and are loyal only to him, and I am very concerned how that dynamic will play out if the administration confronts a real crisis not of its own making.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the issues surfaced by Mattis\u2019 resignation-in-protest, and others raised by a host of former senior officers and national security experts who have recently seconded his critique, deserve a close examination precisely because of the existential stakes.\n\n\u201c You have a rogue President of the United States, and we as a country are actually in serious danger. \u201d \u2014 Retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey\n\nTheir writ starts with a backstabbing and chaotic White House\u2013chronicled in meticulous detail in books like Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury , Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear and Cliff Sims\u2019 Team of Vipers \u2013that has driven away capable and experienced officials, made it difficult to replace them with qualified successors, and routinely produces haphazard decision making that sows chaos and interagency confusion.\n\nTheir case includes the president\u2019s stubborn disregard for factual truth, skewing real-world policies on issues ranging from North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons to the supposed \u201cdefeat\u201d of ISIS, and Trump\u2019s insistence on viewing everything through a partisan prism that politicizes all issues and erodes public trust in non-partisan institutions such as the U.S. military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe critique also highlights Trump\u2019s belittling and transactional approach that has badly undermined venerable alliances, even as Trump maintains chummy and inexplicably obsequious relations with murderous dictators, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un.\n\nTaken together, Defense Secretary Mattis\u2019 first ever resignation-in-protest and the issues it has surfaced represent the worst crisis in civil-military relations since the 2006 revolt of the generals against former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s mismanagement of the Iraq War. In that instance eight senior retired generals made headlines by publicly calling for Rumsfeld\u2019s resignation on the grounds that he was on the cusp of losing a major war, with potentially devastating consequences for U.S. national security. Given that the target of today\u2019s critiques is the commander-in-chief himself, the stakes are exponentially higher, and the warnings even more dire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that a lot of my fellow Americans fully appreciate the fact that there are only two people in the country who can give a lawful order to launch a military strike and start a war, and one of them just resigned to protest the poor judgment of the other,\u201d retired General Barry McCaffrey, former commander of U.S. Southern Command and a decorated combat veteran, said in an interview.\n\nMattis\u2019 resignation is also notable for his being the last of \u201cTrump\u2019s Generals\u201d and the original \u201caxis of adults\u201d to leave the administration, McCaffrey noted, ushering in the coming era of Trump unchained and unencumbered by their moderating influence.\n\n\u201cWe now have an impulsive and ill-informed president who routinely exhibits fantastical thinking on a host of major national security issues, surrounded by a lot of \u2018acting\u2019 cabinet officials who have never even been confirmed by the Senate, to include the acting Secretary of Defense, and senior aides who are beleaguered and frequently publicly humiliated by their boss,\u201d said McCaffrey. \u201cAnd for whatever reason, Trump has repeatedly insisted on meeting in private with the likes of Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, and refusing afterwards to share notes or even talking points with his own top aides. So you have a rogue President of the United States, and we as a country are actually in serious danger.\u201d\n\nThe 'Axis of Adults'\n\nNot since the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, himself a retired general, did senior military officers wield as much influence at the top levels of an administration as in President Trump\u2019s first two years. As a former four-star Marine Corps general, Mattis formed a nexus of power with three other generals: White House Chief of Staff and fellow retired Marine four-star John Kelly; National Security Adviser and active-duty Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster; and Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe generals, along with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, were dubbed the \u201caxis of adults\u201d early in Trump\u2019s term, steering an inexperienced commander-in-chief through the thickets of geopolitics, and smoothing the rough edges of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy that allies widely interpret as a fig leaf for naked nationalism and protectionism.\n\nIn the first 18 months of the administration \u201cTrump\u2019s Generals\u201d won important policy debates, and successfully acted as guardrails blocking some of the president\u2019s most reckless moves.\n\n\u201c In April 2017, Trump reportedly ordered Mattis to assassinate Assad and 'kill the fucking lot of them.' \u201d\n\nEarly on Mattis successfully pushed back on Trump\u2019s endorsement of torture, for instance, and he purposely slow-rolled the president\u2019s wish for a self-aggrandizing military parade in Washington, D.C. When Syrian President Bashar al-Assad crossed a U.S. red line by using chemical weapons on civilians in April 2017, Trump reportedly ordered Mattis to assassinate Assad and \u201ckill the fucking lot of them,\u201d according to Bob Woodward\u2019s book Fear. Mattis is said to have told Trump that he would \u201cget right on it,\u201d before hanging up the phone and telling an aide, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do any of that. We\u2019re going to be much more measured.\u201d The more limited missile strikes the Pentagon launched to enforce the red line won bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nMattis also secured a badly needed increase in the defense budget, and his 2017 National Defense Strategy started an overdue reorientation of the U.S. military towards great power competition with potential adversaries such as Russia and China. He won greater authority for U.S. field commanders leading the fight against ISIS. In that first year the generals also steered a reluctant commander-in-chief towards a mini-surge of roughly 4,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan to recapture momentum from an ascendant Taliban.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 the \u201caxis of adults\u201d also successfully talked Trump down the escalation ladder after he threatened to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u2026the likes of which the world has never seen\u201d on North Korea in response to its nuclear weapons and missile tests. Throughout their tenures Mattis and Tillerson, who formed a close bond over near weekly breakfasts, also engaged in constant clean-up duty in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s compulsive bullying of allies.\n\nAt a 2017 Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, for instance, I watched Mattis try and soothe nervous allies in Asia by implying, without saying it outright, that America had learned the cost of isolationism in World War II, and would not forfeit the mantle of democratic leadership in a fit of Trumpian \u201cus first\u201d nationalism. \u201cEven for all the frustrations that are felt in America right now and the sense that at times we carry an inordinate burden, that sense of engagement with the world is still deeply rooted in the American psyche,\u201d Mattis insisted, before paraphrasing Winston Churchill to explain Washington\u2019s wavering commitment to allies. \u201cBear with us, once we\u2019ve exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.\u201d\n\nTrump Unchained\n\nYet over time Trump grew progressively more frustrated by the restraining influence and internationalist instincts of his \u201caxis of adults.\u201d He took Pentagon officials by surprise by tweeting out a ban on transgender people from serving in the military, a move which reportedly \u201cappalled\u201d a vacationing Mattis. In May of 2018, Trump rejected the advice of his generals and top national security aides in moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, essentially ending the United States\u2019 venerable role as mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That same month Trump unilaterally pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal over the strong objections of close advisers and fellow signatories to the deal\u2013including Great Britain, France and Germany.\n\nAt his summer 2018 summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Trump blindsided Pentagon leaders by cancelling military exercises between U.S. and South Korean forces on the peninsula, a position top U.S. military officers have warned is dangerously eroding the readiness of the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed on the peninsula. After meeting privately with Kim, Trump even called the exercises \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cwar games,\u201d adopting the rhetoric of Pyongyang. On the way home Trump tweeted that, \u201cThere is no longer a Nuclear Threat\u201d from North Korea, relaxing the pressure on other nations to strictly enforce U.N. sanctions on the \u201cHermit Kingdom\u201d over its nuclear program.\n\n\u201c I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me. \u201d \u2014 President Donald Trump\n\nTrump followed that summit with an extraordinary burst of disruptive diplomacy during a single week overseas in July 2018, during which he publicly upbraided close allies, threw a NATO Summit in Brussels into disarray, and shattered diplomatic protocol by criticizing his host British Prime Minister Theresa May while visiting Great Britain and cheerleading for \u201cBrexit.\u201d\n\nTrump then traveled to Helsinki where, in a baffling performance, he met privately with Vladimir Putin, confiscated his interpreter\u2019s notes after the meeting, and then publicly gave the Russian president\u2019s denials of election interference equal weight to the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies. In a post-summit interview, Trump even suggested that the United States might be reluctant to come to the defense of new NATO ally Montenegro, whose \u201caggressive\u201d people could start \u201cWorld War III ,\u201d mouthing the talking points of Putin and casting doubt over NATO\u2019s bedrock commitment of collective defense.\n\nThe performances in Brussels and Helsinki highlighted a fundamental point driven home in Mattis\u2019 resignation letter: Trump embraces a worldview that often aligns him closer to American adversaries than its closest allies. \u201cHelsinki just added to enormous questions surrounding President Trump\u2019s relationship with Putin and his outlook on Russia more generally, elements of which just seem inexplicable and are very concerning from a national security point of view,\u201d said a former very senior intelligence official, speaking on background.\n\n\u201c President Trump continues to consistently tell the American people that NATO allies are bad, and that Putin is OK, which turns truth on its head. \u201d \u2014 Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns\n\nSecretary Mattis tried to counter Trump\u2019s favoritism towards Russia, said this former official, by supporting policies like the deployment of more U.S. and NATO forces to Eastern Europe, and the provision of anti-tank missiles to the Ukrainian armed forces. \u201cBut it was clear that Mattis harbored major concerns about Trump and Russia.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns described watching Trump at the NATO and Helsinki Summits last summer as nothing less than \u201cOrwellian.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump continues to consistently tell the American people that NATO allies are bad, and that Putin is OK, which turns truth on its head,\u201d said Burns, currently heading up the Project on Europe and the Transatlantic Relationship at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. Burns recently co-authored the Kennedy School report \u201cNATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis,\u201d in which the authors argue that NATO\u2019s core challenge is the lack of principled American leadership for the first time in its history.\n\n\u201cWhat really leaps out at me in my discussions with European officials is their belief that Trump no longer supports a democratic future for Europe, but rather embraces these right-wing, pro-Russian populist movements,\u201d said Burns. \u201cHe has thus reversed American policy by consistently picking fights with democratic allies, while cozying up to autocrats like Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\u201d\n\nSoldiers as Props\n\nAs Trump has become emboldened to reject the advice of his top national security aides over the past year, he has increasingly indulged his strong instinct to politicize nonpartisan institutions such as the U.S. military, intelligence and law enforcement communities. He routinely uses U.S. troops as convenient backdrops for campaign style speeches in which he excoriates Democrats to cheers from the crowd, including during a Christmas 2018 visit to troops in Iraq, after which Trump signed \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign hats. Trump\u2019s order to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to the southern border to supposedly repel a ragtag caravan of a few hundred immigrants and asylum seekers in the midst of a heated mid-term election campaign was rightly viewed in senior military circles as a naked political stunt, one which some officials close to Mattis suspect foreshadowed his resignation.\n\nUniformed leaders know that the U.S. military\u2019s position as far and away the most respected institution in America is founded on its nonpartisan status and ethos, and they see that tradition being steadily eroded by the commander-in-chief\u2019s frequent attempts to expropriate the military as one more cudgel in hyper-partisan battles with his political opponents. Historically that is a step on the road to autocracy, wherein the military becomes loyal to the autocrat it serves rather than the Constitution and rule of law the U.S. military is pledged to defend.\n\n\u201c Through your actions [Donald Trump], you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation. \u201d \u2014 Retired Admiral William McRaven, the former commander of U.S. Joint Special Operations Command\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, who formerly commanded all U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan and later served there as U.S. ambassador says, \u201cI worry that President Trump is eroding the boundaries between his role as Commander in Chief and Politician in Chief. Presidents wear many hats, and it is not unusual for them to use the military as a prop to burnish their image,\u201d he wrote me in an email. \u201cBut criticizing the political opposition at a visit with the troops\u2013when the troops are forbidden by law to engage in politics\u2013is a dangerous path to walk down. Soldiers assimilate the norm of staying out of politics through rules, education, and example\u2013the norm is not acquired simply by putting on a uniform.\"\n\nWhen Trump broke with decades of tradition last summer and revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, a frequent critic, many senior intelligence and military officials saw it as further evidence that Trump was politicizing dissent in national security circles and abusing the powers of the presidency to stifle free speech. Thirteen former intelligence chiefs signed a statement decrying Trump\u2019s actions as an \u201cill-considered\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d assault on free speech, including former CIA directors General David Petraeus, Robert Gates, Leon Panetta, Michael Hayden, Porter Goss, George Tenet and William Webster.\n\nRetired Admiral William McRaven, the former commander of U.S. Joint Special Operations Command who oversaw the Navy SEAL Team raid in Pakistan that killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, wrote to Trump asking for his own security clearance to be revoked so he could join the list of critics who have spoken up against his presidency.\n\n\u201cThrough your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation,\u201d McRaven wrote to Trump in a letter published in The Washington Post . \u201cIf you think for a moment that your McCarthy-era tactics will suppress the voices of criticism, you are sadly mistaken.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the scathing critique by a hero of the Bin Laden raid in a Fox News interview, Trump responded in the only vernacular he understands, falsely dismissing McRaven as a partisan \u201cHillary Clinton fan\u201d and an \u201cObama-backer.\u201d\n\nThe Generals Exit\n\nAs he became increasingly comfortable rejecting the advice of his generals and top officials, Trump also grew more impatient with their attempts to moderate his instincts and impulses. Tillerson was the first to go in March 2018, fired in a humiliating tweet while still on a diplomatic mission in Africa.\n\nOn his time in Trump world, Tillerson described for CBS This Morning the challenge of transitioning from the \u201cdisciplined, highly process-oriented\u201d world of ExxonMobil to work for a president \u201cwho is pretty undisciplined, doesn\u2019t like to read, doesn\u2019t read briefing reports, doesn\u2019t like to get into the details of a lot of things, but rather just kind of says, \u2018This is what I believe,\u201d Tillerson said.\n\nFrequently Tillerson said he would respond to Trump orders by replying, \u201cMr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can\u2019t do it that way. It violates the law.\u201d Trump\u2019s response to the interview was to call his former Secretary of State and ExxonMobil chief \u201cdumb as a rock.\u201d\n\n\u201c The fatal flaw in the 'axis of adults' narrative was the assumption that Trump himself was willing and able to change fundamentally. \u201d\n\nDays after firing Tillerson, Trump surprised his own White House staff by also firing National Security Adviser McMaster, complaining that the general\u2019s briefings were too long and structured. Before entering the Trump White House the warrior-scholar was best known for authoring the seminal book Dereliction of Duty , a critique of generals who didn\u2019t speak honestly enough to their civilian bosses during the Vietnam War, and he had built a reputation on speaking truth to power.\n\nAs is so often the case in the Trump era, that reputation was badly sullied during his White House tenure when the still active-duty Lt. Gen. McMaster played the dutiful soldier and tried to defend the indefensible: Trump\u2019s meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office the day after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. The director\u2019s dismissal had come in part because of the bureau\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia that Trump terms a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d When news quickly broke that Trump had shared highly classified intelligence with the Russians, McMaster was sent out to defend the action to the press. As a clearly uncomfortable McMaster dutifully walked out to the White House lawn to issue a brief statement calling the story \u201cfalse,\u201d he unexpectedly ran into a group of reporters in the West Wing.\n\n\u201cThis is the last place in the world I wanted to be,\u201d McMaster confessed. No one who witnessed his tenure as national security adviser has reason to doubt that was a pretty good summation of his time in the White House.\n\n\u201c Now the generals are gone, and they are being replaced by \u2018yes men\u2019 and ideologues who have no conception of the cost of war or the worth of allies. \u201d \u2014 John Nagl, former president of the Center for a New American Security\n\nLast December, Trump announced that Chief of Staff and retired General John Kelly would also be leaving by the end of the year. In an exit interview with The Los Angeles Times , Kelly defended his own rocky tenure by arguing that he would ultimately be judged by what Trump refrained from doing during Kelly\u2019s tenure as chief of staff, without specifying the paths that were not taken. According to Bob Woodward writing in Fear , Kelly once described the president as an \u201cidiot\u201d who has \u201cgone off the rails,\u201d the White House as \u201cCrazytown,\u201d and his time as the president\u2019s right hand man as \u201cthe worst job I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Kelly later denied calling the president an \u201cidiot.\u201d\n\nMattis\u2019 resignation was also probably foreshadowed with the September 2018 publication of Fear , in which Woodward describes Mattis leaving a meeting with Trump on the nuclear standoff with North Korea exasperated and alarmed, telling close associates that the president \u201cacted like\u2013and had the understanding of\u2013a \u2018fifth- or sixth- grader.\u2019\u201d Mattis denied the account, but the die was probably cast. In an interview in October, Trump branded Mattis with an ominous expletive, calling him \u201csort of a Democrat.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, the fatal flaw in the \u201caxis of adults\u201d narrative was the assumption that Trump himself was willing and able to change fundamentally.\n\nIf the generals and other \u201cadults\u201d among his close advisers could just establish a disciplined decision-making process, the thinking went, then surely the best arguments and policies would win most of the time.\n\nIn the end, Trump proved that his impulses and the chaos that inevitably ensues from them cannot be governed, and that dynamic is only likely to get worse now that the generals have left the building and the White House increasingly mirrors the dysfunction of the administration\u2019s very earliest days.\n\n\u201cUsually administrations get better as team members get more familiar with each other and more seasoned, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a learning curve with this administration, and we may already have seen the high water mark in terms of policy making and interagency coordination,\u201d said Peter Feaver, a former National Security Council staffer in both the Clinton and Bush 43 administrations, who is currently director of the Triangle Institute for Security Studies. \u201cAnd with President Trump constantly tweeting out reckless policy decisions with no interagency vetting or process, he will continue to cut the legs out from under his top officials and make them look foolish. It\u2019s going to be very hard to get good and really qualified people to sign up for that kind of work environment. It\u2019s just a hell of a way to run a railroad.\u201d\n\nJohn Nagl is the former president of the Center for a New American Security, and a retired Army lieutenant colonel. \u201cFor Trump\u2019s first two years he had in close proximity advisers who had devoted their lives to the security of the United States, were loyal to the constitution and U.S. institutions rather than to Trump personally, and who provided a break on the president\u2019s worst impulses. And Trump punished them all for it,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNow the generals are gone, and they are being replaced by \u2018yes men\u2019 and ideologues who have no conception of the cost of war or the worth of allies. I find that terrifying.\u201d\n\nWarning: Danger Ahead\n\nAs he heads into the third-year stretch before next year\u2019s reelection campaign, Trump is a decider-in-chief in full bloom, confident in the righteousness of his own counsel and instincts, or in Trump\u2019s own recent words, \u201cI have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\"\n\nTrump presumably has taken to heart former Defense Secretary Mattis\u2019 observation that he has the right to top advisers whose views are better aligned with his own, hiring former congressmen Mick Mulvaney and Mike Pompeo, both of whom came out of the Tea Party movement, as his acting White House chief of staff and secretary of state, respectively. Along with lifelong nationalist and uber-hawk John Bolton as National Security Adviser, Trump indeed now has a national security team more reflective of his disruptive, nationalistic worldview.\n\nFor his part Mulvaney has promised to manage down in terms of the White House Staff, and not up, reportedly determined to let \u201cTrump be Trump.\u201d The number of times the statements of top national security officials have recently been contradicted by Trump\u2019s tweets and proclamations suggests that they are still subject to the same feckless and haphazard decision-making emanating from the Oval Office.\n\nActing Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive with no military and little government experience, recently attempted to explain the administration\u2019s evolving Syria strategy during a brief of U.S. lawmakers on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in February. His explanations reportedly prompted Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., of the Senate Armed Services Committee to uncork a torrent of expletives and declare himself Shanahan\u2019s \u201cadversary.\u201d\n\nThat undisciplined decision making on Syria has been very much on the mind of retired Marine Corps General John Allen, former commander of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, and currently president of the Brookings Institution. Writing of the Mattis resignation with veteran Brookings national security analyst Michael O\u2019Hanlon, Allen called the Syria decision \u201ccapricious,\u201d and \u201cimpulsive\u201d and he worries that more may be on the way.\n\n\u201cWhat if, next time, the issue is a possible preemptive strike against North Korea\u2019s nuclear forces, or a violent naval confrontation with China, or a showdown with Russia over a Baltic nation, where the stakes would be even higher,\u201d Allen and O\u2019Hanlon wrote in the article \u201cLearning from Trump\u2019s Syria Debacle.\u201d\n\n\u201c Kim Jong Un knows that Trump is the only American president in history who might be willing to put our alliances on the negotiating table. That\u2019s why Kim keeps writing Trump love letters. \u201d \u2014 Sue Mi Terry, former senior Korea analyst at the CIA\n\n\u201cThe point John and I were trying to make was that while the Syria decision was important and very consequential for our allies in the anti-ISIS fight, it is not a top-tier U.S. national security issue,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon told me. \u201cWe wanted to make a strong statement before President Trump faces even more consequential decisions, and makes even worse mistakes because he fails to consult with or simply ignores his expert advisers.\u201d\n\nAs it happens Trump faced just such a profoundly consequential decision point at the end of February when he held his second summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un. Trump was under pressure to come away with a more substantive agreement than their first meeting produced, which was mainly vague pledges on denuclearization that lacked even an agreed upon definition of what that actually means. Instead the February summit ended in confusion and recriminations, with Trump walking away after Kim refused to accept his grand bargain of complete denuclearization for a lifting of sanctions.\n\nWhile a long line of U.S. presidents have failed to negotiate an end to North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, what worries many experts is the lack of preparation and impulsiveness in Trump\u2019s mano-a-mano diplomacy. As was the case at the last summit, for instance, the two leaders met privately with no aides or note-takers present, which is exactly how the North Korean dictator prefers it.\n\nThe biggest \u201cwild card\u201d in the summit was the possibility that Trump would once again threaten to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea, or even announce a pullout now that Defense Secretary Mattis is not around to dissuade him. While that didn\u2019t happen during this summit, many experts remain concerned it still might be offered as a future bargaining chip given Trump\u2019s oft-stated desire to bring the troops home, and his view that allies habitually take advantage of the United States.\n\n\u201cA U.S. troop reduction or withdrawal would be a very big blow to South Korea and Japan, but Kim Jong Un knows that Trump is the only American president in history who might be willing to put our alliances on the negotiating table,\u201d said Sue Mi Terry, a former senior Korea analyst at the CIA, and currently the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThat\u2019s why Kim keeps writing Trump love letters.\u201d\n\nThe recent Congressional testimony by U.S. intelligence chiefs assessing the major threats confronting the country suggests that the yawning disconnect between Trump\u2019s worldview and reality as perceived by the intelligence experts is not a fluke, but rather a permanent fixture of this presidency. After Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel contradicted the president\u2019s optimism on North Korea\u2019s willingness to surrender its nuclear weapons, and about the defeat of ISIS, Trump invited them to the White House woodshed and then blamed the entire misunderstanding on \u201cfake news,\u201d insisting the intelligence chiefs were \u201cmisquoted\u201d and \u201ctaken out of context\u201d even though the public testimony was there for all to see.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between President Trump and the Intelligence Community is as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen, and it\u2019s not going to get any better because the problem is fundamentally one of truth,\u201d said Paul Pillar, a former career CIA analyst and national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia. \u201cThe Intelligence Community has worked hard to adapt to his idiosyncrasies by dumbing down intelligence briefings, and mentioning him personally as frequently as possible in briefings to appeal to his obvious narcissism, but Trump is simply unwilling to ingest information from sources other than Fox News and a few others he relies on. And I don\u2019t see that problem getting any better, because the president has shown no learning curve in terms of his willingness to absorb inconvenient truths.\u201d\n\n\u201c The president has shown no learning curve in terms of his willingness to absorb inconvenient truths. \u201d \u2014 Paul Pillar, former national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia\n\nMeanwhile, the recent Munich Security Conference also underscored Mattis\u2019 concerns that Trump\u2019s rough handling and bullying of allies was inflicting real and potentially lasting damage on our bedrock alliances. Last month the New York Times reported that several times over the course of 2018, Trump privately told top aides that he actually wanted to withdraw the United States from NATO. In Munich, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hectored European allies for not joining the United States in tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, while the Europeans stood fast behind new financing mechanisms designed to work around U.S. sanctions and hedge against Trump administration bullying.\n\nThis month it was reported that the White House plans to transform America\u2019s alliances into a protection racket with a \u201ccost plus 50\u201d plan that would require allies to pay 150 percent of the cost of hosting U.S. troops, with a good behavior discount for those countries willing to take their marching orders from Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cIf you had told me that in just two years the Trump administration could convince our closest allies and friends that the United States was not the champion and leader of the liberal, international order, but rather a threat and danger to it, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it. But that\u2019s the conclusion the Europeans have clearly come to,\u201d said Kori Schake, a former National Security Council staffer in the George W. Bush administration, and currently the deputy director general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. \u201cThe question that dominated the Munich Conference was whether the United States would once again lead the Western democracies after Trump is gone, or whether the Europeans need to protect themselves further against a disruptive America.\u201d\n\nMueller Time\n\nFinally, there are reports that sometime in the coming weeks Special Counsel Robert Mueller will likely complete his investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, and whether the Trump campaign actually colluded in that foreign sabotage of our democratic process. Mueller may also reveal whether or not there is evidence that Trump or the White House attempted to obstruct the investigation.\n\nMany national security experts hope the Mueller report clears up the enduring mystery behind Team Trump\u2019s secret and profligate interactions with Russian officials and agents, with a CNN analysis of public records finding that at least 12 Trump associates had contacts with Russians during the campaign and transition, with at least 51 individual communications and 19 face-to-face interactions with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures.\n\nWhatever clarity the Mueller report provides may come at the cost of a constitutional crisis, however, with profoundly dangerous implications for the nation\u2019s security. At a similar culminating moment in the Watergate investigation, for instance, then Defense Secretary James Schlesinger admitted to taking the extraordinary, extra-constitutional step of telling senior U.S. military leaders to ignore orders from an embattled and increasingly paranoid President Richard Nixon\u2013including a potential nuclear launch order\u2013unless Schlesinger had signed off on them first.\n\n\u201c The President of the United States may well be compromised by the Russians, which I truly believe is the case. And he is unfit to serve. \u201d \u2014 Former Defense Secretary William Cohen\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning there has been a cloud of distrust hanging over the Trump White House because of the Russian question, and we\u2019re about to finally get some answers,\u201d said former Defense Secretary Bill Cohen in our interview. \u201cFor instance, why has Trump adopted an agenda that exactly replicates Vladimir Putin\u2019s bucket list, including sowing dissension and confusion in the American political system, discrediting the U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities, attacking the free media as \u2018fake news,\u2019 weakening the European Union by championing \u2018Brexit,\u2019 undermining the NATO alliance, and pulling U.S. forces out of Syria?\n\n\"What was behind Trump\u2019s obscene performance in Helsinki, where he tore up the interpreter\u2019s notes of his private meeting with Putin and then took a knee before the Russian leader and publicly accepted his lies, while rejecting the truth of his own intelligence community?\n\n\"There is an elephant standing in America\u2019s living room right now staring us in the face: the President of the United States may well be compromised by the Russians, which I truly believe is the case. And he is unfit to serve.\u201d"

H.R. 1 is not expected to receive a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder the legislation, presidents, vice presidents and major-party nominees for those positions would be required to disclose 10 years of tax returns to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). That agency would then make the returns publicly available.\n\nIf a candidate or office-holder fails to disclose their returns, the FEC chairman would send a request to the Treasury secretary to obtain copies of the documents.\n\nAn amendment was added to the bill this week so that under the legislation, office-holders and candidates would be required to disclose both their personal and business tax returns.\n\nThe tax return provisions are based on legislation offered by Reps. Bill Pascrell William (Bill) James PascrellKey Democrat cites new urgency to get Trump's tax returns Dems seize on Mueller obstruction of justice conclusion Booker takes early lead in 2020 endorsements MORE (D-N.J.) and Anna Eshoo Anna Georges Eshoo Cuts to Medicare and Medicaid will cause overall health-care costs to rise Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by PCMA \u2014 FDA issues proposal to limit sales of flavored e-cigs | Trump health chief gets grilling | Divisions emerge over House drug pricing bills | Dems launch investigation into short-term health plans Divisions emerge over House drug price bills MORE (D-Calif.).\n\nPascrell said Friday that he and Eshoo \u201cbelieve that we need to write it into the record that it is demanded of everybody who runs for the presidency.\u201d\n\nDemocrats included the tax return provisions in H.R. 1 to highlight the fact that Trump is the first president in decades to refuse to voluntarily release his tax documents. Trump has said he won't release his returns while under audit, but the IRS has said that audits don't prevent people from disclosing their own tax information.\n\nThe vote also comes as House Democrats appear to be moving toward requesting Trump\u2019s tax returns from Treasury. Democrats want to review Trump\u2019s returns to learn about any potential conflicts of interest, especially any entanglements with foreign governments.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal Richard Edmund NealHouse, Senate tax-writers offer bipartisan bill to modernize IRS Key Democrat cites new urgency to get Trump's tax returns House committee chairs call for Mueller report to be released by April 2 MORE (D-Mass.) has the authority under statute to request tax returns from the Treasury Department. The Ways and Means Committee could then review the returns privately and vote to send a report to the House that could make some or all of the information in the returns public.\n\nNeal has not given a timeline for when he'll request Trump\u2019s tax returns, but others have predicted that it will be soon.\n\nPascrell earlier this week predicted that Neal would make the request within the next couple of weeks. When asked Friday if Neal has given him a timetable, Pascrell said Neal hasn\u2019t made a final decision."

  "text": "FILE - In this Dec. 6, 2017, file photo, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson is testifies during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. Officials say Wilson has resigned. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, once seen as a candidate to succeed Jim Mattis as defense secretary, said Friday she is resigning to become president of the University of Texas at El Paso.\n\nA former U.S. House Republican member from New Mexico and graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Wilson has headed the Air Force since May 2017, making her President Donald Trump\u2019s first Senate-confirmed service secretary.\n\nShe had been an early skeptic of Trump\u2019s interest in creating a Space Force as an independent military department, but she publicly embraced the administration\u2019s proposal to Congress last month that would establish a Space Force as a separate service within the Department of the Air Force.\n\nTrump praised Wilson on Twitter Friday. \u201cA strong thank you to Heather for her service,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWilson also had been mentioned as a potential successor to Mattis. After Mattis announced his resignation in late December, Trump named the former deputy defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, as acting defense secretary. But Trump has not yet nominated anyone for confirmation by the Senate.\n\nIn her resignation letter to Trump, Wilson said the University of Texas Board of Regents announced on Friday that she is the sole finalist to become the university\u2019s next president, effective Sept. 1. \u201cUnder Texas law, my name will be public for three weeks before the regents take a final vote on my appointment,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cUpon a favorable vote by the regents, I will resign my position as secretary of the Air Force effective May 31, 2019,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis should allow sufficient time for a smooth transition and ensure advocacy during upcoming congressional hearings.\u201d\n\nShe graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1982 and later earned masters and doctoral degrees as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in England. Wilson is the first graduate of the academy to hold to hold the service\u2019s top civilian post. She served in the House from 1998 to 2009. From 1989 to 1991, she served on the National Security Council staff as director for defense policy and arms control for President George H.W. Bush.\n\nBy going to the University of Texas at El Paso, Wilson said she was returning to her academic roots. She previously served as president of the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology. Her family home is in New Mexico.\n\nWilson said she appreciated the opportunity to serve as the Air Force\u2019s top civilian official.\n\n\u201cIt has been a privilege to serve alongside our airmen over the past two years, and I am proud of the progress that we have made restoring our nation\u2019s defense,\u201d Wilson said in a statement distributed by the Air Force. \u201cWe have improved the readiness of the force; we have cut years out of acquisition schedules and gotten better prices through competition; we have repealed hundreds of superfluous regulations; and we have strengthened our ability to deter and dominate in space.\u201d\n\nRep. Michael Turner, an Ohio Republican, praised Wilson\u2019s work as Air Force secretary.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising to me that Heather would be sought out by other organizations looking for her strong leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish Heather all the best in her future endeavors. She will be deeply missed. Hopefully, someday we can see Heather Wilson as the first female secretary of defense.\u201d\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Lolita C. Baldor contributed to this report."

A group of organizations, including a Yemen-based human rights organization, released the damning report on Wednesday, claiming that between April 2015 and April 2018, 27 coalition attacks killed at least 203 civilians and injured at least 749 people. The report found that 22 of the attacks likely involved weapons produced in the United States. The other five attacks were carried out either with weapons produced in the United Kingdom or with parts produced in both the U.S. and the UK.

  "text": "ALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 Paul Manafort, the political consultant and Trump presidential campaign chairman whose lucrative work in Ukraine and ties to well-connected Russians made him a target of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was sentenced on Thursday to nearly four years in prison in the financial fraud case that left his grand lifestyle and power-broker reputation in ruins.\n\nThe sentence in the highest-profile criminal case mounted by the special counsel\u2019s office was far lighter than the 19- to 24-year prison term recommended under sentencing guidelines. Judge T. S. Ellis III of the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., said that although Mr. Manafort\u2019s crimes were \u201cvery serious,\u201d following the guidelines would have resulted in an unduly harsh punishment.\n\nA team of Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors sat glum-faced as Judge Ellis delivered his decision. Mr. Manafort, who has gout and came to the hearing in a wheelchair with his foot heavily bandaged, had asked the judge for compassion. \u201cTo say I feel humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement,\u201d he said in a barely audible voice, reading from a prepared statement.\n\nOf the half-dozen former Trump associates prosecuted by Mr. Mueller, Mr. Manafort garnered the harshest punishment yet in the case that came to a conclusion on Thursday \u2014 the first of two for which Mr. Manafort is being sentenced this month. While prosecutors sought no specific sentence, some legal experts said a prison term that amounts to one-fifth of the lightest punishment recommended had to disappoint them."

You can't turn on a cable TV news channel these days without seeing some TV pundit or panelist saying that Democrats need to \"move to the middle.\" What the heck do they mean? Do they mean that Democrats should say it's just fine that over 30 million Americans have no health care? Does \"moving to the middle\" mean that we love that the big banks make hundreds of billions in profits by ripping us off and putting our economy at risk? That fossil fuel and chemical industries should continue to poison us and our planet? That it's just fine if drug companies and for-profit colleges and Charter Schools keep ripping us off? That it's just fine that the American Dream is dead and there's no need to bring back unions and union jobs? What is \"the center\" beyond the status quo?"

A man named Ryan Magers of Madison County, Alabama had learned that his girlfriend had a medication-induced abortion at 6 weeks into her pregnancy. Magers, with the help of an anti-abortion organization petitioned to become the personal representative of the aborted fetus and on Tuesday the county Probate Judge Frank Barger granted his petition in the first such move of its kind nationwide. The case may be one of the first consequences of a state constitutional amendment passed last year recognizing the \"rights of unborn children.\"\n\n\n\nThe Alabama case comes at the same time that the Trump administration has ordered the blocking of federal grants under the Title X program from Planned Parenthood to faith-based organization based on abortion access. Nearly two-dozen states have sued the government over the drastic changes that are set to go into effect within 2 months. Trump's rule change could deprive millions of low-income American women of healthcare covered by government grants through the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Jessica Mason Pieklo is Vice President of Law and the Courts at Rewire.News. She is a writer and adjunct law professor in Boulder, Colorado. She is the former assistant director of the Health Law Clinic at Hamline Law School in St. Paul, Minnesota and former litigator."

  "text": "Rising Cost Of PrEP To Prevent HIV Infection Pushes It Out Of Reach For Many\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sakuma/AP Paul Sakuma/AP\n\nPublic health officials are expanding efforts to get the HIV prevention pill into the hands of those at risk, in a nationwide effort to curb infections. But the officials are hitting roadblocks \u2014 the drug's price tag, which has surged in recent years, and changes in insurance coverage that put a heftier financial burden on patients.\n\nSince brand-name Truvada was approved for HIV prevention six years ago, its average wholesale price has increased by about 45 percent. Now, the drug \u2014 which rakes in billions of dollars in annual global revenue for its manufacturer, Gilead Sciences \u2014 carries a list price of close to $2,000 for a 30-day supply.\n\nMost insurers cover treatment with the pill, also known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It has been shown to be more than 90 percent effective in HIV prevention when the medicine is taken daily, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut patients can get stuck with out-of-pocket costs that make the medicine unaffordable.\n\n\"If there is any example of the dysfunction in the American pharmaceutical system, it is this case,\" says James Krellenstein, a member of the AIDS advocacy group ACT UP New York. \"We have the most effective tool for ending the HIV epidemic, and one reason we're unable to scale up is because it costs so [much] unnecessarily.\"\n\nAs policymakers and the health system debate how to control ever-climbing drug prices, experts say this case underscores how patients are left holding the bag.\n\nPrivate health plans are making patients responsible for a larger share of drug costs. And more are restricting use of the copay coupons pharmaceutical companies have used to shield patients from out-of-pocket expenses. Insurers say the drug companies use coupons to steer consumers toward pricier meds. One way health plans are limiting their use is by no longer allowing them to count toward patients' deductibles.\n\n\"This is one more thing that is going to push people off their medications,\" says Jim Pickett, a senior director at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago.\n\nJared Wile, who lives in Chicago, started PrEP about three years ago, when he was dating someone with HIV. Wile, who has a $2,750 deductible, used a coupon to obtain the drug. He never paid anything out-of-pocket, he says.\n\nGilead waives up to $4,800 in out-of-pocket expenses for commercially insured patients.\n\nThat changed for Wile this past May, when he learned the coupon no longer counted toward his deductible and that he would have to pay the full cost of the prescription \u2014 $1,600 per month \u2014 until he hit his deductible. Wile says he felt \"blindsided\" and stopped taking the medication.\n\nGilead spokesman Ryan McKeel says the company has made extra efforts to help patients overcome financial barriers. He cites assistance programs for uninsured and underinsured people.\n\n\"We have designed our assistance programs with the intent that people can benefit from their full value, and we cannot control the actions or decisions of health insurers,\" McKeel said via email.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 1 million people are at high risk of contracting HIV, but Gilead says only about 167,000 people currently are receiving PrEP.\n\nBeyond the money crunch\n\nPrice is one of many barriers \u2014 alongside patients' lack of awareness and doctors' hesitation to prescribe \u2014 that threaten to exacerbate the already stark disparities in PrEP use and HIV infection rates.\n\nOne major disparity is along geographic lines. The South, for example, accounts for over half of new HIV diagnoses but only about 30 percent of new PrEP users, according to data from AIDSVu, which maps HIV disease and PrEP use. HIV rates and PrEP use also vary by race and ethnicity.\n\n\"We are not necessarily seeing that those most at risk are the ones starting PrEP,\" says Kristin Keglovitz Baker, chief operating officer of Howard Brown Health, a Chicago health center.\n\nGilead has recently gone all-in with advertising to reach people at risk, including print campaigns and TV ads that will air through the summer. Since 2012, it has spent $28 million to fund U.S. organizations that seek to raise awareness of HIV, says McKeel, the company spokesman.\n\n\"We recognize that many people who are at high risk for HIV infection still face challenges in accessing Truvada for PrEP, and we are in regular dialogue with public health officials, advocates and physicians to better understand and, where possible, help to address these challenges,\" he added.\n\nBut price is also an impediment for publicly funded programs, which have limited budgets and are now shelling out more cash for the prevention effort.\n\n\"If it was only pennies ... we would be throwing it around,\" says Joey Mattingly, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy. \"Because of how costly it is, we have to control it.\"\n\nSome states \u2014 California and Florida among them \u2014 have launched PrEP assistance programs that can help patients cover the cost of the medication, along with required lab work and medical visits.\n\nBeyond these state-based programs, some public health departments and HIV service organizations are hiring PrEP navigators to help patients traverse the maze of copays and deductibles, and to improve recruitment and retention of new PrEP users.\n\nWashington, D.C.'s health department has doubled down on prevention, and Truvada is key in that effort, says Michael Kharfen, the department's senior deputy director for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD and TB Administration.\n\nInsurance usually covers PrEP, and patient assistance programs should fill any financial gaps, he says. But when that isn't feasible, the department steps in, distributing free Truvada starter packs to at-risk patients.\n\nKharfen says the city has in the past three years spent almost a million dollars just on Truvada pills, which it purchases at a discounted rate through the federal 340B program, which benefits certain health care providers that treat low-income people. And because of new publicity efforts, he expects the department will need to buy and distribute more pills \u2014 posing a conundrum.\n\nTreating more people is net positive, he says. But \"how do we sustain this?\"\n\nMedicaid programs generally cover PrEP, so they confront a similar situation. Outreach efforts lead to more beneficiaries who take the drug, but that, in turn, could subject the states' Medicaid budgets to financial hardship.\n\nStates are spending millions of dollars on the drug. California's Medicaid program, for example, spent about $50 million in 2017 and expects the costs to continue climbing. But officials said the expense is offset by long-term savings in preventing new HIV cases.\n\nMassachusetts' Medicaid program spent about $22 million on Truvada that same year \u2014 about $18,000 per beneficiary, according to a spokeswoman for the agency's Executive Office of Health and Human Services. Those figures don't account for rebates the state receives from Gilead, which are undisclosed and considered proprietary information.\n\nA complex solution and no competition\n\nPrEP is only one part of HIV prevention, so help paying for the pill is only one piece of the puzzle.\n\nPatients also need regular HIV testing and medical care, which add to the cost borne both by patients and the health system. Some experts warn that Truvada's high price point could financially undermine such broad prevention efforts.\n\nCompetition could help.\n\nA generic version of the drug, manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals, is available abroad and gained approval for use last year from the federal Food and Drug Administration. When it becomes available in the United States, it could bring down prices, though it's unclear when that will happen. Gilead's own forecasts reflect that expectation, showing declines in future revenue from Truvada.\n\n\"When generics enter, brands lose market share,\" says David Howard, a health economist and professor at Emory University, who previously worked in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nFor now, though, Truvada is the only PrEP option available in the U.S., he says. \"From a company standpoint ... their best strategy is to make as much money as they can.\"\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service covering health issues, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

His so-called \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy has already killed at two children who were seeking asylum in the U.S., and the Jerry Falwells of the world still support him. Cohen said that Trump would \u201cnot leave peacefully\u201d if he lost in 2020, suggesting that Trump would call out his armed supporters to start a second Civil War. Thugs and autocrats around the world have been doing this for a long time, and now the President of the United States has spent two years praising them, sucking up to them, and telling them \u2014 strongmen like Bashir al-Assad, Kim Jong Un, Rodrigo Duterte, Vladimir Putin, and Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 that they should continue with their terror campaigns against their own people and their destruction of a free press and anything left of democracy in their regions. Of all the reasons to impeach this mob boss in the White House, this is the strongest, argues Thom Hartmann."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\nMore than ten years ago dozens of teachers in the Atlanta Public School system in Georgia were accused of participating in a widespread test-score cheating scandal. Most of them took plea deals but 11 educators decided to go to trial to maintain their innocence. They were charged with racketeering and conspiracy - the same charges that are brought up against those involved in organized crime. The all-black teachers were at the center of a national story that showcased educator criminality but not the failings of the educational system. Moralistic news coverage and analysis followed with lots of finger wagging.\n\n\n\nNow, years later many of the teachers insist they are innocent. Not only have they struggled to rebuild their lives, but the Atlanta Public school system has also not fully recovered. A new book aims to correct the record on the story and draw attention to the broader issue of how our system has failed both educators and students.\n\n\n\nGUESTS: Shani Robinson, Anna Simonton, co-authors of None of the Above: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Public Schools Cheating Scandal, Corporate Greed, and the Criminalization of Educators."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "The Trump administration is rapidly escalating a secretive air war in Somalia. According to the think tank New America, at least 252 people have been killed in around two dozen U.S. airstrikes in Somalia so far this year. The U.S. has already carried out more strikes in Somalia in 2019 than in any single year under President Obama. In addition to the air war, the Pentagon reportedly has about 500 U.S. troops on the ground in Somalia, including many special operations forces. For years, the U.S. has attempted to aid the Somali government by targeting members of al-Shabab, but the effort has increased dramatically under Trump, and it has come with little congressional oversight or media attention. DN! speaks with Amanda Sperber, a freelance journalist who reports from Nairobi, Kenya, and Mogadishu, Somalia. Her new article for The Nation is titled \u201cInside the Secretive US Air Campaign in Somalia.\u201d"

Claudio Rojas was apprehended on Wednesday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an annual check-in and is now being held at Krome Detention Center, where he faces immediate deportation. His lawyer says his arrest is linked to the film featuring his activism.

That came a couple weeks after he threw his hat in the ring for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders has marshaled tremendous support for his presidential bid since last month, with supporters packing his campaign rallies and pouring small-dollar financial support into his campaign coffers. But Sanders faces a far more crowded primary field than he did in 2016, when he was bested by Hillary Clinton, and some of his critics continue to object to the Vermont senator\u2019s unwillingness to officially affiliate with the Democratic Party in his capacity as a legislator. \u2014Lachlan Markay"

She has since pleaded not guilty to trespassing, interference with government agency functions and disorderly conduct. Her sentencing is scheduled for March 19, but prosecutors claim her latest protest was a violation of the terms of her bond, and she has been ordered back to court today.

  "text": "Venezuela\u2019s opposition is calling on the United States and allied nations to consider using military force to topple the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is heading to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, today to meet with regional leaders and Venezuela\u2019s self-proclaimed president, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. The meeting follows a dramatic weekend that saw the Venezuelan military blocking the delivery of so-called humanitarian aid from entering the country at the Colombian and Brazilian borders. At least four people died, and hundreds were injured, after clashes broke out between forces loyal to Maduro and supporters of the opposition. The United Nations, the Red Cross and other relief organizations have refused to work with the U.S. on delivering aid to Venezuela, which they say is politically motivated. Venezuela has allowed aid to be flown in from Russia and from some international organizations, but it has refused to allow in aid from the United States, describing it as a Trojan horse for an eventual U.S. invasion. On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Maduro\u2019s days in office are numbered. DN! speaks with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, who has recently held secret talks with Trump\u2019s special envoy Elliott Abrams."

  "text": "Get your Kleenex ready.\n\nThe median rent for a one bedroom apartment in San Francisco has reached a new peak of $3,690, according to survey data from Zumper, a home and apartment rental app. That's also a rise of nearly 9 percent from the same time last year, the survey found.\n\nNot only are those figures high enough to make your bank account cringe, but they're also nearly 30 percent higher than New York City and more than double the prices in Miami. Seattle, home to Amazon and Microsoft, rang in at $1,970 and Washington, DC, hit $2,150.\n\nOh, and by the way, while San Francisco's prices rose, the median price of one bedroom apartments across the US dropped nearly half a percent during this same time. That means while San Francisco's prices climbed, the country's prices fell.\n\n\"Though there may be a ton of cash flowing through the city and surrounding areas soon, many of these workers will not immediately invest in a home and may, instead, take their money to both travel and upgrade their rental situation,\" Zumper wrote in a blog post Thursday.\n\nThe survey data, though likely unsurprising, underscores the challenges the tech industry faces in its home turf of the San Francisco Bay Area. The shocking success that's helped make companies like Apple, Google and Facebook titans of industry has created an estimated 74 billionaires and nearly 150,000 millionaires.\n\nAdd in the fact that there isn't enough housing to go around, and prices have naturally skyrocketed. The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development said last year that a family of four earning up to $117,400 qualified as \"low income\" in the city.\n\nWith expected tech IPOs from San Francisco-based companies like Airbnb, Pinterest, Slack, Uber and Lyft, all likely to mint many more millionaires and draw even more people to the city, there's little hope for relief."

  "text": "(CNN) Protesters gathered Saturday evening outside police headquarters in Sacramento, California, after the county's top prosecutor announced she would not be filing charges against two police officers who killed Stephon Clark , an unarmed black man who was fatally shot in his grandmother's backyard last year.\n\nSacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said earlier that the investigation had to decide if officers broke the law.\n\n\"When we look at the facts and the law, and we follow our ethical responsibilities, the answer ... is no,\" Schubert told reporters, hours after meeting with the family.\n\nThe case last year became a symbol of strained relations between the police and the community as well as racial tensions in the state capital. Once again city officials and community leaders appealed for peace while bracing for protests.\n\nClark's mother, SeQuette, told reporters outside a family home in Sacramento that she was outraged.\n\n\"They executed my son,\" she said of the officers. \"They executed him in my mom's backyard and it's not right.\"\n\nSchubert described Clark as taking a shooting stance and officers firing after they saw a flash of light that one believed came from a gun being fired. A cellphone was found underneath Clark's body.\n\nMom upset by DA's description of Clark's recent troubles\n\nSchubert detailed a picture of Clark as a 22-year-old man going through a tumultuous time in his life, worried about jail time after being accused of assaulting the mother of his children days earlier.\n\nHe also had drugs in his system on the night he was shot and had searched the web on his phone for information about how a person can take his own life.\n\nSchubert would not characterize what happened as a \"suicide by cop\" but said she made the information public because it was something attorneys would have used in court to establish his frame of mind.\n\n\"There were many things weighing heavily on his mind,\" she said, adding that he also had used his smart phone to research penalties for domestic violence. Schubert said the mother of his children had responded negatively to text messages in which he attempted to reconcile.\n\nThe DA also said Clark called the woman scores of times after an incident on March 16.\n\nThat woman, Salena Manni, said what happened March 16 or March 17 didn't matter in the shooting. It was the officers' actions that were most important.\n\n\"They murdered my fianc\u00e9,\" she said as she wept before reporters.\n\nManni said the DA's decision broke her family's hearts again.\n\nSchubert focused on her son's personal problems instead of the officers' actions, Clark's mother said.\n\n\"That's not a permit to kill him,\" SeQuette Clark said. \"What matters is that those officers came around that corner on a vandalism call and killed him.\"\n\nLater a few dozen people gathered at police headquarters where they shared stories and poems on a microphone and at times chanted \"No justice, no peace!\" Some protesters burned Blue Lives Matter flags.\n\nVideo of the incident\n\nAuthorities said the two Sacramento officers who shot Clark were responding to a report that a man had broken car windows and was hiding in a backyard. The person who called 911 told police the man -- later identified as Clark -- had jumped a fence and police discovered he'd moved through two backyards into another property, Schubert said.\n\nSchubert, who opened her news conference with an apology to the Clark family, said she met with his mother Saturday morning.\n\n\"There is no question that the death of Stephon Clark is a tragedy, not just for his family but for this community,\" she said.\n\nThe prosecutor went through a lengthy presentation involving body worn cameras, helicopter surveillance video and photos. She said Clark vandalized three cars, moved to a backyard and broke a sliding glass door to a room where an 89-year-old man was watching television. He then jumped to another yard.\n\nDirected to Clark's location by the sheriff's helicopter, the officers chased him to a backyard, one that belonged to his grandmother.\n\n\"Hey, show me your hands,\" the lead officer said. \"Stop. Stop.\"\n\nClark was about 30 feet away behind a picnic table, the prosecutor said.\n\n\"Show me your hands,\" an officers said, breathing heavily. \"Gun. Gun.\"\n\nAbout 20 shots are heard in the body camera recording. An officer says, \"He is down. No movement. We're going to need additional units.\"\n\nFamily friend: 'Stephon should be alive'\n\nJamilia Land, a friend of Clark's family and member of CA Families United for Justice, in a statement said no prosecutor's \"ruling can change the most important fact -- Stephon should be alive.\"\n\n\"Stephon was unarmed and in no way a threat. Instead, they shot 20 times and hit Stephon at least eight times. Even then, they did not call for medical care even though he was bleeding profusely. Now the Sacramento district attorney says it's unjust to charge these officers with Stephon's murder. Where is Stephon's justice?\"\n\nLizzie Buchen, legislative advocate for the American Civil Liberties Union of California's Center for Advocacy and Policy, said the \"decision opens a new wound for the Sacramento community and serves as a potent reminder that California's law on the use of deadly force needs immediate reform.\"\n\n\"As a society, we give police officers the most significant power we confer on the government -- the power to take someone's life,\" she said in a statement. \"Our laws must set appropriate standards to ensure police officers use that power sparingly and with the goal of preserving human life.\"\n\nThe federal lawsuit alleges the young man was racially profiled, and the officers used excessive force in the shooting incident. The two officers failed to identify themselves or issue a verbal warning before firing approximately 20 shots, the suit said. The lawsuit also alleges the officers did not get him medical attention immediately after the shooting.\n\nThe California Attorney General's Office has said it is also conducting an independent investigation."

Ilhan Omar, who is Muslim.\n\n\"'Never forget' - you said. . .\" read a caption on the first picture. \"I am the proof - you have forgotten,\" read the caption under the picture of Omar, who is wearing a hijab.\n\nOmar tweeted about the incident later on Friday.\n\n\"No wonder why I am on the 'Hitlist' of a domestic terrorist and 'Assassinate Ilhan Omar' is written on my local gas stations,\" she wrote.\n\nThe display was set up as part of \"WV GOP Day,\" which the party advertised on Facebook as a day when \"Republicans Take the Rotunda.\"\n\nSeveral Democrats objected to the display, and reportedly got into an argument with the House's sergeant at arms, Anne Lieberman, after she allegedly made an anti-Muslim remark.\n\nDel. Mike Angelucci, D-Marion, charged Lieberman had said \"all Muslims are terrorists.\"\n\nHe said that was \"hate speech.\"\n\n\"Muslims are not terrorists. Christians have killed people. That doesn\u2019t mean Christians are terrorists. I am a Christian. I am a proud Christian. I am not a terrorist,\" he said, according to WSAZ.\n\n\"I am furious, and I don't want to see her representing the people of this great state in the House again,\" Angelucci said of Lieberman, who became the state's first female sergeant at arms last year. Speaking to West Virginia Public Broadcasting, Lieberman denied she'd made the comment. By the end of the day she had submitted her resignation \"effective immediately,\" officials said.\n\nThe outrage continued on the House floor, where Del. Mike Pushkin, a Democrat, took aim at the display.\n\n\"It's ugly, it's hateful and there's absolutely no place for it in American politics,\" Pushkin said, according to WVNews. \"Not in the country that I love. Not in the state that I love. We all give up our time during this time of year to come up here and serve our constituents because we love this state. Well, I love everybody in the state no matter what they look like, who they pray to, who they love. I'm tired of it. It disgusts me.\"\n\nPushkin, who's Jewish, added, \"I'm proud to live in a country that somebody can come into this country with absolutely nothing and wind up in the halls of Congress representing the state of Minnesota.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Roger Hanshaw issued a statement saying his office is investigating what happened.\n\n\"As we began today\u2019s floor session, we had a series of incidents occur in and outside of our Chamber that absolutely do not reflect the character and civility the people of this state demand of their public servants. Leadership of the House of Delegates is currently working to investigate these incidents to learn firsthand the factual basis of what occurred, and will respond with appropriate action,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The West Virginia House of Delegates unequivocally rejects hate in all of its forms.\"\n\nThe House is made up of 59 Republicans and 41 Democrats.\n\nIn later remarks on the floor, Hanshaw said an unidentified staffer had been injured during the confrontations, but gave no other details. \"I bluntly struggle with what even to say,\" he said. \"We have allowed national level politics to become a cancer on our state . . to invade our chamber in a way that makes me ashamed.\"\n\n\"We can do better,\" he added.\n\nAnother Republican delegate, Eric Porterfield, was hit with calls to resign last month after he called LGBTQ groups \"the closest thing to political terrorism in America\" and \"a modern day version of the Ku Klux Klan.\"\n\n\"Let me (be) very clear with my statement,\" Porterfield told NBC News then. \"The LGBTQ \u2014 not homosexuals \u2014 are the modern day version of the Ku Klux Klan.\""

  "text": "In an explosive 5-hour hearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday, President Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen accused his old boss of committing multiple criminal acts before and during his presidency. Cohen provided evidence that Trump had violated campaign finance laws by paying hush money to women, accused the Trump Foundation of committing fraud by using the tax-exempt organization for personal purposes, and said Trump lied when he said he couldn\u2019t release his tax returns because they were being audited. He also claimed that Trump had advance knowledge that WikiLeaks was preparing to publish a trove of emails to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in the run-up to the 2016 election. Cohen confirmed the president repeatedly checked in about the status of a proposed Trump Tower Moscow project well into the 2016 campaign, despite public claims to the contrary. But he said he had seen no direct evidence that Trump had colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign. The testimony came two months before Cohen is scheduled to begin a 3-year prison sentence for lying to Congress, a series of financial crimes and campaign violations.

The charges involve four women and girls, three of whom were under the age of 17 at the time of the alleged crimes. A judge set bail at a million dollars and forced the singer to surrender his passport. Almost immediately after he posted bond and pleaded not guilty on Monday, Kelly was spotted at a McDonald\u2019s in downtown Chicago\u2014a spot his accusers say he used to frequent to prey on young girls. Kelly has been accused of abuse, predatory behavior and pedophilia throughout his career but has avoided criminal conviction despite damning evidence and multiple witnesses. Last month, the explosive documentary series \u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d thrust the case back into the spotlight. DN! speaks with the documentary\u2019s executive producer, dream hampton."

She has since pleaded not guilty to trespassing, interference with government agency functions and disorderly conduct. Her sentencing is scheduled for March 19, but prosecutors claim her latest protest was a violation of the terms of her bond, and she has been ordered back to court today. She joins us just hours before her appearance."

His so-called \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy has already killed at two children who were seeking asylum in the U.S., and the Jerry Falwells of the world still support him. Cohen said that Trump would \u201cnot leave peacefully\u201d if he lost in 2020, suggesting that Trump would call out his armed supporters to start a second Civil War. Thugs and autocrats around the world have been doing this for a long time, and now the President of the United States has spent two years praising them, sucking up to them, and telling them \u2014 strongmen like Bashir al-Assad, Kim Jong Un, Rodrigo Duterte, Vladimir Putin, and Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 that they should continue with their terror campaigns against their own people and their destruction of a free press and anything left of democracy in their regions. Of all the reasons to impeach this mob boss in the White House, this is the strongest, argues Thom Hartmann."

Cohen's Wednesday hearing at the House Oversight committee was public and widely televised. During his riveting 30-minute opening remarks Cohen accused the president of being a \"racist,\" \"conman,\" and \"cheat.\"\n\n\n\nMany Democrats that questioned him afterward honed in on several of the points he raised about Trump's business practices, the hush-money payments that Trump made while in office, his charitable organization, his taxes, and more. But Republicans focused entirely on whether Cohen was to be trusted since he had been convicted of lying to Congress.\n\n\n\nHow did right wing media cover the Cohen testimony, and what, if anything, will come out of these historic hearings?"

Most of them took plea deals but 11 educators decided to go to trial to maintain their innocence. They were charged with racketeering and conspiracy - the same charges that are brought up against those involved in organized crime. The all-black teachers were at the center of a national story that showcased educator criminality but not the failings of the educational system. Moralistic news coverage and analysis followed with lots of finger wagging.\n\n\n\nNow, years later many of the teachers insist they are innocent. Not only have they struggled to rebuild their lives, but the Atlanta Public school system has also not fully recovered. A new book aims to correct the record on the story and draw attention to the broader issue of how our system has failed both educators and students.\n\n\n\nGUESTS: Shani Robinson, Anna Simonton, co-authors of None of the Above: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Public Schools Cheating Scandal, Corporate Greed, and the Criminalization of Educators."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "In an explosive 5-hour hearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday, President Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen accused his old boss of committing multiple criminal acts before and during his presidency. Cohen provided evidence that Trump had violated campaign finance laws by paying hush money to women, accused the Trump Foundation of committing fraud by using the tax-exempt organization for personal purposes, and said Trump lied when he said he couldn\u2019t release his tax returns because they were being audited. He also claimed that Trump had advance knowledge that WikiLeaks was preparing to publish a trove of emails to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in the run-up to the 2016 election. Cohen confirmed the president repeatedly checked in about the status of a proposed Trump Tower Moscow project well into the 2016 campaign, despite public claims to the contrary. But he said he had seen no direct evidence that Trump had colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign. The testimony came two months before Cohen is scheduled to begin a 3-year prison sentence for lying to Congress, a series of financial crimes and campaign violations. DN! speaks with Marcy Wheeler, an independent journalist who covers national security and civil liberties. She runs the website EmptyWheel.net."

  "authors": [
    "Zoe Tillman",
    "Buzzfeed News Reporter"
  ],
  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Roger Stone pushed back against Michael Cohen's claims that Stone told Trump in July 2016 that he had spoken to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about an email dump that would hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign, saying in a text message to BuzzFeed News: \"Mr. Cohen's statement is not true.\"\n\nStone's text, which he made clear was a \"statement,\" was just the one sentence, and he did not explain what exactly about Cohen's testimony he maintained was false. Stone, who is facing criminal charges for lying to Congress, is under a gag order not to publicly comment on his case, special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, or any \"participants\" in his case or the investigation.\n\nA spokesperson for the special counsel's office declined to comment on whether they believe Stone's statement complies with the judge's order.\n\n\n\nCohen is testifying Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee. Cohen told members in his opening statement Wednesday that Trump knew in advance that WikiLeaks planned to release emails in July 2016 that would harm Clinton's presidential bid. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released tens of thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee \u2014 emails that Mueller's office has charged Russian nationals with hacking and providing to WikiLeaks. Over the next few months leading up to the election, WikiLeaks would also release emails stolen from the chair of Clinton's campaign, John Podesta.\n\nCohen told Congress that in July 2016, shortly before the Democratic National Convention, which began on July 25, he was in Trump's office when Stone called. He later testified that he believed he learned about the upcoming WikiLeaks release of DNC emails on July 18 or 19 \u2014 but he said he did not know if Stone and Trump knew where the emails had come from.\n\n\"Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone,\" Cohen said in his statement. \"Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\"\n\nCohen said that Trump replied \"to the effect of, 'wouldn't that be great.'\"\n\nStone is charged with lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks. The indictment doesn't allege that Stone personally communicated with Assange or anyone else associated with WikiLeaks, but it accuses him of lying about directing associates to contact the group, and about telling Trump campaign officials about WikiLeaks and \"intended future releases.\"\n\n\n\nWikiLeaks and Stone have denied direct communications between Stone and Assange. In a Feb. 15 tweet responding to reports that federal prosecutors had communications between Stone and WikiLeaks, the group published a screenshot of a direct message exchange between Stone and the group in October 2016, with Stone criticizing WikiLeaks for \"attacking\" him, and WikiLeaks accusing Stone of making \"false claims of association.\""

  "text": "Venezuela\u2019s opposition is calling on the United States and allied nations to consider using military force to topple the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is heading to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, today to meet with regional leaders and Venezuela\u2019s self-proclaimed president, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. The meeting follows a dramatic weekend that saw the Venezuelan military blocking the delivery of so-called humanitarian aid from entering the country at the Colombian and Brazilian borders. At least four people died, and hundreds were injured, after clashes broke out between forces loyal to Maduro and supporters of the opposition. The United Nations, the Red Cross and other relief organizations have refused to work with the U.S. on delivering aid to Venezuela, which they say is politically motivated. Venezuela has allowed aid to be flown in from Russia and from some international organizations, but it has refused to allow in aid from the United States, describing it as a Trojan horse for an eventual U.S. invasion. On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Maduro\u2019s days in office are numbered.

The year 2018 was the fourth year in a row that the number of hate groups rose steadily. The organization lays the blame for the rise in hate groups in part on President Donald Trump. According to the report, \"Trump has activated a growing fear in many white Americans who view their power as threatened by our country\u2019s rapidly changing demographics. He is taking advantage of their rage against change.\"\n\n\n\nThe SPLC report comes just as a white supremacist man named Christopher Paul Hasson was arrested in Maryland after federal law enforcement found a massive weapons cache at his home. Hasson was apparently planning a major domestic terrorist attack aimed at politicians, journalists, and even possibly Supreme Court justices. He wanted to, \"establish a white homeland,\" and is reported to have said, \"I am dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth.\" Soon after his arrest President Trump declared the New York Times, the \"ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE,\" on Twitter, for their coverage of his potential wrongdoings. The Times retorted that his rhetoric continued to be dangerous and encourages violence against journalists.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Heidi Beirich, leads the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project, which publishes the award-winning Intelligence Report and the Hatewatch blog."

  "text": "That two leading Democratic candidates have embraced reparations \u2014 the concept that the federal government should both acknowledge the ongoing legacy of slavery and discrimination and provide compensatory payment to those affected \u2014 is a major shift from past presidential campaigns and a win for activists who have tried to push the issue into the mainstream for decades. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former cabinet secretary who is also running for president, has also indicated that he would support reparations.\n\nEven among the 2020 Democrats who stopped short of endorsing reparations, several have laid out robust policies aimed at closing the gap in wealth between black and white families. Scholars estimate that black families in America today earn just $57.30 for every $100 in income earned by white families, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey. For every $100 in white family wealth, black families hold just $5.04.\n\nSenator Cory Booker\u2019s \u201cbaby bonds\u201d policy aims to help poorer children by giving them a government-funded savings account that could total up to $50,000 for the lowest income brackets. The plan has been praised by liberal scholars, who think it could go a long way in helping lower-income Americans begin to build wealth. And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has endorsed a proposal to allow Americans without checking accounts to bank at the local post office; a disproportionate percentage of America\u2019s unbanked population are people of color.\n\nMar\u00eda Urbina, national policy director for the progressive group Indivisible, said that after years of being pushed by activists, the Democratic Party was getting closer to applying its liberal values to racial equality. Policies like reparations or \u201cbaby bonds\u201d that seek to close the racial wealth gap, she said, should be viewed similarly to idealistic programs that have been embraced by Democrats seeking the presidential nomination, including the Green New Deal and \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want folks who are being ambitious, not just working within the margins and the contours of what we had before, but sort of reimagining things on our own terms and being really aspirational,\u201d Ms. Urbina said.\n\nSandy Darity, a Duke University professor who is a leading scholar on reparations and the racial wealth gap, said he believes more black Americans may come to see reparations as a defining issue for their support.\n\n\u201cThere is a point in black Americans making a collective decision to treat a candidate\u2019s attitude toward reparations as a litmus test for supporting them,\u201d Dr. Darity said. \u201cI think if folks had paid closer attention to the fact that Barack Obama was against reparations, they would have not been as disappointed by his presidency, because they would have had more realistic expectations about what he was likely to do.\u201d"

  "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 Republican politicians across the country have for years railed against the threat of voter fraud. Some have made unproven claims about how rampant it has become in order to pass voter ID laws and open sweeping investigations. The sanctity of the vote, they have said, must be protected at all costs.\n\nBut when a hard-fought congressional election in North Carolina \u2014 in which a Republican candidate appeared to narrowly beat his Democratic opponent \u2014 was overturned this week because of election fraud by a Republican political operative, the party was measured, and largely muted, in its response.\n\nThe state party chairman, Robin Hayes, issued a statement after officials ordered a new election calling the affair \u201ca tremendously difficult situation for all involved.\u201d National Republicans have been mostly mum. President Trump, who has made election fraud one of the hallmarks of his administration, was quiet on Twitter, although on Friday, facing reporters at the Oval Office, he condemned fraud \u2014 \u201call of it, and that includes North Carolina.\u201d\n\nMark Harris, the Republican nominee, had eked out a 905-vote lead over Dan McCready. But the North Carolina Board of Elections refused to certify Mr. Harris as the winner and opened an investigation into irregularities. This week, the five-member board, made up of Republicans and Democrats, convened an evidentiary hearing in Raleigh at which witnesses described a voter-turnout effort that relied on the rogue collection of absentee ballots."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "DN! goes to Caracas, Venezuela, for an update on the escalating standoff between President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and opposition leader and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaid\u00f3. Guaid\u00f3 claims he is preparing to deliver humanitarian aid from the Colombian border Saturday. Maduro has rejected the plan, saying the effort is part of a broader attempt to overthrow his regime. This comes as Trump\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela and right-wing hawk, Elliott Abrams, is leading a U.S. delegation traveling by military aircraft to the Colombian border, supposedly to help deliver the aid. The United Nations, the Red Cross and other relief organizations have refused to work with the U.S. on delivering that aid to Venezuela, which they say is politically motivated. DN! speaks with Venezuelan sociologist Edgardo Lander, a member of the Citizen\u2019s Platform in Defense of the Constitution. \u201cThis certainly is not humanitarian aid, and it\u2019s not oriented with any humanitarian aims,\u201d Lander says. \u201cThis is clearly a coup carried out by the United States government with its allies, with the Lima Group and the extreme right wing in Venezuela.\u201d"

Amazon had announced the project in November after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio offered Amazon nearly $3 billion in tax subsidies to come to the city. But local politicians and community organizers rallied against the tech giant and won.

  "title": "The 4 Legal Challenges Facing Trump's Emergency Declaration",
  "authors": [
    "Tessa Berenson"
  ],
  "text": "Less than a week since President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to divert funds to build a border wall, multiple groups are already challenging the move in court.\n\nDuring the Rose Garden speech announcing his plan, Trump detailed in a sing-song voice the path he expected the emergency declaration to take through the court system, all the way up to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe will have a national emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the 9th Circuit, even though it shouldn\u2019t be there. And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we\u2019ll get another bad ruling. And then we\u2019ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully, we\u2019ll get a fair shake, and we\u2019ll win in the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe central issue at play is a constitutional question: whether Trump\u2019s emergency declaration violated Congress\u2019s constitutional authority to appropriate funds. But the \u201cthey\u201d in Trump\u2019s scenario\u2014 \u201cthey will sue us\u201d\u2014 turned out to be several groups with specific concerns about the effects of building a border wall.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nHere\u2019s a look at four court challenges Trump\u2019s emergency declaration will likely face.\n\n16 states have sued over the emergency declaration\n\n16 states have already sued in the federal District Court in San Francisco to stop Trump from using his emergency powers to build a border wall. The states \u2014 California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Virginia \u2014 are arguing that the declaration is unconstitutional and Trump doesn\u2019t have the power to divert funds in this way because Congress controls spending.\n\nIn particular, the states say taking military funding for the wall will hurt their economies and their military bases and that using funds from counter-drug efforts will also cause harm to their residents.\n\n\u201cContrary to the will of Congress, the president has used the pretext of a manufactured \u2018crisis\u2019 of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency and redirect federal dollars appropriated for drug interdiction, military construction and law enforcement initiatives toward building a wall on the United States-Mexico border,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nTrump has criticized the lawsuit, tweeting that it has been brought by states controlled by \u201cOpen Border Democrats and the Radical Left.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump treats the rule of law with utter contempt,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Monday. \u201cHe knows there is no border crisis, he knows his emergency declaration is unwarranted, and he admits that he will likely lose this case in court.\u201d\n\nCongress could also sue over the emergency declaration\n\nCongress could take its own action against Trump\u2019s declaration, either by suing the president or overriding his declaration.\n\nDemocratic leaders in both chambers have already called Trump\u2019s decision \u201cunlawful\u201d: \u201cThe President\u2019s unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our Constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation,\u201d House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \u201cThis is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, a district court judge allowed the House as an institution to sue the president for overstepping his constitutional authority. At that time, House Republicans were challenging President Barack Obama on his application of the Affordable Care Act, so in a bit of political irony, it may be that Republicans paved the legal way for Democrats to now sue Trump.\n\n\u201cThe theory on which the House said it had standing back then would allow the House to have standing here,\u201d says Stephen Vladeck, professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cHouse Democrats would certainly rely upon that precedent.\u201d But Vladeck cautions that the Supreme Court has never specifically addressed this question.\n\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University who served as attorney for the House of Representatives in that Affordable Care Act case, says that he thinks Trump may have better prospects in the courts than Obama did, largely because Trump will be using appropriated funds for his wall.\n\n\u201cThis is a case of the chickens coming home to roost,\u201d Turley wrote in an email. \u201cCongress passed a law with largely unfettered authority and appropriated funds with largely unconditioned uses. Federal courts are not designed to protect Congress from itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that House would be foolish to litigate this directly,\u201d Turley added. \u201cThey could easily undermine the key precedent that we won in Burwell on legislative standing.\u201d\n\nRead More: Trump\u2019s National Emergency Declaration Sets Him Up for Another Fight\n\nAnother option for Congress to challenge Trump is by introducing a joint resolution rejecting the national emergency declaration. House Democrats are likely to introduce the resolution, which would only require a simple majority in both the House and the Senate. The resolution is expected to easily pass the lower chamber before heading to the Senate floor, where the Republican-led majority would be powerless to block it. If all Senate Democrats remain united in supporting the resolution, they would only need four Republican Senators to defect from their party for it to pass.\n\nMost Republican Senators have remained mum on how they would vote, but given the fact that more than double that number voted against the spending bill last week after the White House said the President would declare a national emergency, it remains a high likelihood the Senate could pass the measure.\n\nBut even if it passes, President Trump still has veto power \u2014 something White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller implied he could use if necessary. \u201cObviously the President is going to protect his national emergency declaration,\u201d Miller said Sunday on Fox News.\n\nIf that veto occurs, the focus would turn back to Senate Republicans, and whether they can garner the necessary two-thirds of the chamber to override the veto. (The House must amass those votes as well, but it would be an easier feat because Democrats are in control).\n\nBorder landowners have started filing lawsuits too\n\nOne lawsuit has already been brought on behalf of some landowners near the border, and others are likely to follow. The first, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the nonprofit group Public Citizen, represents the Frontera Audubon Society and three Texas landowners whose property could be bisected by the border wall.\n\n\u201cUnder our Constitution, built on the principle of separation of powers, a disagreement between the President and Congress about how to spend money does not constitute an emergency authorizing unilateral executive action,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cPlaintiffs include three landowners in South Texas who were informed that the federal government would seek to build a wall on their properties if money were available in 2019 for construction of a border wall. The construction of a wall pursuant to the Declaration threatens an imminent invasion of their privacy and the quiet enjoyment of their land, both during construction and after.\u201d\n\nEminent domain gives the federal government power to take private property for public use if it justly compensates the owner. That can leave the landowners embroiled in years of lawsuits over whether they\u2019ve been fairly paid for their property.\n\nRepublican Rep. Will Hurd, whose district spans roughly 800 miles along the border, told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday that eminent domain power to take private lands for the wall could hurt his constituents.\n\n\u201cIn the great state of Texas, we care about a little thing called private property,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s going to be over 1,000 ranchers and farmers potentially impacted if the government comes in and takes their land. And this is how they do it: they say, \u2018Hey, we need this land. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to give you.\u2019 And they get to automatically take it. And then the rancher or the landowner has to go in and fight in court to make sure that they\u2019re, at a minimum, getting what they are owed because of the price of the land.\u201d\n\nEnvironmentalists are suing over the effects on wildlife\n\nAlong with the Frontera Audubon Society\u2019s involvement as a plaintiff in the Public Citizen lawsuit, another suit has been filed jointly by The Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife and Animal Legal Defense Fund in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., arguing that Trump\u2019s move is unconstitutional because it violates the separation of powers by sidestepping Congress\u2019s spending authority. This suit has wildlife in mind.\n\n\u201cBorder wall construction, and associated actions including stripping all vegetation within a 150-foot enforcement zone, road construction, and high-intensity lighting, would harm Plaintiffs\u2019 members and these protected interests in numerous ways,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThese harms would include immediate impacts, such as precluding future visitation of impacted areas, destroying wildlife habitat, and killing individual wildlife species. Border wall construction would also result in longer term harm, by blocking connectivity between wildlife populations in U.S. and Mexico, harming the long term viability of those species, and in some cases, resulting in their extirpation from the United States.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit lists \u201cjaguar, ocelot, peninsular bighorn sheep, Sonoran pronghorn, Mexican gray wolf, Quino checkerspot butterfly, and coastal California gnatcatcher\u201d as specific species that could be harmed by the border wall.\n\nThe National Butterfly Center, which would lose access to portions of its nature preserve along the Rio Grande if the wall is constructed on its property, has also vowed to fight the Trump Administration. The North American Butterfly Association sued the government in 2017 when it allegedly began clearing an area on the sanctuary for wall construction without consent. Federal Judge Richard Leon dismissed the case in February 2019, writing that the Fourth Amendment \u201coffers little refuge for unenclosed land near one of the country\u2019s external borders,\u201d and that the Department of Homeland Security has the power to waive environmental laws for construction in the area. A federal appeals court also ruled in February that the Trump Administration has the authority to bypass environmental laws to quickly complete border construction projects.\n\nExecutive director of the National Butterfly Center Marianna Trevino Wright told CNN, \u201cWe are going to appeal or refile, absolutely.\u201d\n\nWith Alana Abramson in Washington\n\nWrite to Tessa Berenson at tessa.berenson@time.com."

  "text": "New York City is still reeling since Amazon announced last week that it was scrapping plans to build a major office facility in Queens. The decision came under mounting pressure from grassroots activists and local politicians who opposed the deal. Amazon had announced the project in November after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio offered Amazon nearly $3 billion in tax subsidies to come to the city. But local politicians and community organizers rallied against the tech giant and won. The lawmakers who took down Amazon say their victory is just the beginning of a major fight against tax subsidies for huge companies\u2014which they call \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201d DN! speaks with New York State Assemblymember Ron Kim, who helped fight Amazon and introduced the End of Corporate Welfare Act to the state Legislature earlier this month."

  "text": "But Mr. Giuliani and his client had a serious problem, which they were slow to comprehend.\n\nIn April, the F.B.I. raided the Manhattan office and residences of Mr. Cohen \u2014 the president\u2019s lawyer and fixer \u2014 walking off with business records, emails and other documents dating back years. At first, Mr. Trump was not concerned.\n\nThe president told advisers that Mr. Rosenstein assured him at the time that the Cohen investigation had nothing to do with him. In the president\u2019s recounting, Mr. Rosenstein told him that the inquiry in New York was about Mr. Cohen\u2019s business dealings, that it did not involve the president and that it was not about Russia. Since then, Mr. Trump has asked his advisers if Mr. Rosenstein was deliberately misleading him to keep him calm.\n\nMr. Giuliani initially portrayed Mr. Cohen as \u201chonest,\u201d and the president praised him publicly. But Mr. Cohen soon told prosecutors in New York how Mr. Trump had ordered him during the 2016 campaign to buy the silence of women who claimed they had sex with Mr. Trump. In a separate bid for leniency, Mr. Cohen told Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors about Mr. Trump\u2019s participation in negotiations during the height of the presidential campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.\n\nMr. Trump was now battling twin investigations that seemed to be moving ever close to him. And Mr. Cohen, once the president\u2019s fiercest defender, was becoming his chief tormentor.\n\nIn a court appearance in August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty and told a judge that Mr. Trump had ordered him to arrange the payments to the women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Mr. Cohen\u2019s descriptions of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions made the president, in effect, an unindicted co-conspirator and raised the prospect of the president being charged after he leaves office. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who in January became the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over the matter, said the implied offense was probably impeachable.\n\nThe president struck back, launching a volley of tweets that savaged Mr. Cohen and his family \u2014 insinuating that Mr. Cohen\u2019s father-in-law had engaged in unexamined criminal activity. He called Mr. Cohen a \u201crat.\u201d The messages infuriated Democratic lawmakers, who claimed the president was trying to threaten and intimidate a witness before testimony Mr. Cohen planned before Congress.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s only been threatened by the truth,\u201d the president responded.\n\nAnother attorney general takes office\n\nAs the prosecutors closed in, Mr. Trump felt a more urgent need to gain control of the investigation."

  "text": "Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein plans to leave the Justice Department in mid-March, an official familiar with the matter said Monday night, and an announcement on his successor is expected imminently.\n\nRosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official who has spent nearly two years in the hot seat since appointing Robert S. Mueller III to lead an investigation into whether President Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, had made it known in recent weeks that he planned to leave if and when a new attorney general was confirmed by the Senate.\n\nWith William P. Barr\u2019s swearing in to that post last week, Rosenstein has set a more precise timeline for departure \u2014 though the official stressed his plan could shift if needed to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter said the administration also has decided to nominate Jeffrey A. Rosen, the deputy secretary of transportation, to take over the job. He will need to be confirmed by the Senate, which probably would occur after Rosenstein leaves.\n\nThe news of Rosenstein\u2019s expected departure date comes as the deputy attorney general is again facing allegations from former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe that he talked about taking steps against Trump after the president fired James B. Comey as FBI director in May 2017. McCabe said in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday that Rosenstein broached the idea of ousting Trump using the 25th Amendment, or wearing a wire to secretly record him in the White House.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I never get searched when I go into the White House. I could easily wear a recording device. They wouldn\u2019t know it was there,\u2019 \u201d McCabe said, describing what he said Rosenstein told him. \u201cHe was not joking.\u201d\n\n\n\nDeputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein testifies at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) on June 7, 2017. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nThe interview sparked an angry reaction from Trump, who said on Twitter it appeared Rosenstein and McCabe were \u201cplanning a very illegal act.\u201d The official, though, said that Rosenstein\u2019s departure was expected and that the timeline was not affected by McCabe\u2019s recent comments.\n\nIn response to the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, a Justice Department spokeswoman said: \u201cThe deputy attorney general never authorized any recording that Mr. McCabe references. As the deputy attorney general previously has stated, based on his personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment, nor was the DAG in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), has said he wants to investigate McCabe\u2019s claims."

  "text": "The West Virginia woman who grabbed national headlines in 2016 for calling Michelle Obama an \"ape\" has pleaded guilty to embezzling thousands of dollars in federal disaster relief.\n\nPamela Taylor, 57, admitted to authorities last week that she falsely registered for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster benefits after a deadly 1,000-year flood event in Clay County, West Virginia, in June 2016. Taylor had claimed that her primary residence was damaged by the floodwaters and that she was forced to stay in a rental property.\n\nBut Taylor's home was actually not damaged and she still lived there. She received more than $18,000 in FEMA benefits after submitting the fraudulent application, according to a press release from the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of West Virginia.\n\n\"The flood was a natural disaster. Stealing from FEMA is a man-made disaster,\" U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart said in a statement last Wednesday. \"FEMA dollars are critical but limited. Stealing critical FEMA dollars is a crime -- literally and figuratively. Taylor\u2019s fraud scheme diverted disaster benefits from our most desperate and vulnerable, those most in need of help.\"\n\n(Justin Michaels/The Weather Channel via AP) In this photo released by The Weather Channel, a vehicle rests in a stream after heavy rain near White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., June 24, 2016.\n\nDuring her plea agreement hearing last Tuesday, Taylor agreed to pay restitution of $18,149.04. She is scheduled to be sentenced on May 30. She faces up to 30 years behind bars and a fine of up to $500,000.\n\n\"Taking advantage of federal funds intended for disaster relief misappropriates taxpayer dollars, reduces monies available to true victims and erodes public confidence in relief programs,\" Mark Tasky, special agent-in-charge of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, said in a statement last Wednesday. \"The defendant knowingly submitted a fraudulent application for disaster relief, in order to enrich herself and divert critical funds away from true disaster victims.\"\n\nAn attorney for Taylor did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment Monday.\n\n(Jim Cole/AP, FILE) First lady Michelle Obama speaks during a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Manchester, N.H., Oct. 13, 2016.\n\nTaylor was placed on leave from her position as director of the Clay County Development Corporation in November 2016 after posting a controversial comment about then-first lady Michelle Obama on social media.\n\n\"It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House. I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels,\" Taylor wrote on Facebook after Election Day.\n\nClay County Mayor Beverly Whaling liked Taylor's Facebook post and commented, \"Just made my day Pam.\"\n\nBoth women apologized publicly, and Whaling subsequently submitted a letter announcing her resignation, according to ABC affiliate WCHS in Charleston, West Virginia."

  "text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose 2016 presidential campaign grew from a left-wing insurgency to a force that reshaped the Democratic Party, announced Tuesday that he will seek its nomination for president again in 2020.\n\nSanders wrote in an email sent to supporters Tuesday that he was building \u201can unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign\u201d that would draw on people across the country.\n\n\u201cOur campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history. It is not only about winning the Democratic nomination and the general election,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.\u201d\n\nThe senator, an independent, cited health care, climate change, student debt, the \u201cdemonization\u201d of undocumented immigrants, income inequality, gun violence and the myriad problems of America\u2019s needy as propelling him into his second presidential contest.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, this campaign is a continuation of what we did in 2016,\u201d Sanders said during an interview Tuesday on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d\n\nAsked how this bid would differ from his first run, Sanders said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nDuring an earlier interview with Vermont Public Radio, where he first announced his bid, Sanders called Trump \u201can embarrassment to our country.\n\n\u201cI think he is a pathological liar,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.\u201d\n\nSanders, who has held dozens of political rallies across the country since the 2016 election, enters the race with the biggest social media following \u2014 and biggest mailing list \u2014 of any candidate for the Democratic nomination. His decision came after a number of groups that spun out from his 2016 run, such as Our Revolution and People for Bernie, held house parties to mobilize his old supporters, and to find new ones.\n\nAfter coming a few hundred delegates short of victory in 2016, Sanders begins a 2020 race with some advantages. He is one of the best-known and most admired figures in Democratic politics, though he is not a member of the party. He built campaign operations in every primary and caucus state.\n\nBut unlike Hillary Clinton, who recovered from her 2008 primary defeat to become the party\u2019s front-runner in 2016, Sanders has not built on his support from the prior campaign. In early polls of Iowa and New Hampshire, where he won 50 percent and 60 percent of the vote, support for the senator from Vermont has ranged from the low teens to 30 percent.\n\nTwo Democrats who endorsed him in 2016, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and author Marianne Williamson, have themselves entered the race; a third, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), is considering a bid. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has long been a friend of Sanders and shared an overlapping network of supporters, announced her campaign on New Year\u2019s Eve. And some strategists and endorsers who helped Sanders in 2016 have already moved to other campaigns.\n\nSanders also faces a crowded and liberal-leaning field of candidates that bears little resemblance to the lengthy two-way race with Clinton. Most of the Democrats currently seeking the nomination back Sanders\u2019s signature legislation to turn Medicare into a universal health-care plan, and to raise the federal minimum wage to $15.\n\n\u201cThere are some really good people who have announced, and they\u2019re friends of mine,\u201d Sanders told The Washington Post last month. \u201cMy views are maybe a little bit different.\u201d\n\nBoth Sanders and Trump in 2016 argued that Americans were suffering from a rigged economy and that chunks of the country had been forgotten as Wall Street and other elites prospered. Sanders bridled at such comparisons in 2016, and on Tuesday upbraided the president in stark terms.\n\n[Listen: Bernie Sanders surprised everyone in 2016 Can he do it again?]\n\n\u201cWe are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m running for president because, now more than ever, we need leadership that brings us together \u2014 not divides us up.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s successes in 2016 capped an unlikely political ascent. He ran for multiple offices in Vermont before a stunning 1981 upset that made him mayor of Burlington, the state\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn office, Sanders became the best-known democratic socialist in American politics, bringing new development to the city while building ties to international left-wing movements. In 1990, he won the state\u2019s sole seat in the House of Representatives, as an independent, after Democrats did not field a candidate of their own \u2014 an understanding that would continue through seven more House campaigns and three for the Senate.\n\nDespite that, Sanders was not viewed as a first-tier challenger to Clinton when his 2016 bid began. Liberal groups had launched efforts to draft Warren, although she chose not to run. When he announced his campaign, Sanders parried questions about poll numbers that showed Clinton 40 or 50 points ahead, saying he was \u201cin this race to win\u201d and battling the impression of a fringe candidacy.\n\nTo Clinton\u2019s surprise, Sanders\u2019s campaign caught fire. By the summer of 2015, he was regularly speaking to crowds numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands. He stuck to the issues that animated him: universal health care, free college tuition and higher taxes on the rich. After several speeches were disrupted by protesters, he began speaking more about criminal justice reform and an end to the war on drugs.\n\n\u201cWe can live in a country where every person has health care as a right, not a privilege,\u201d Sanders said on the trail, words he repeated in Tuesday\u2019s presidential announcement.\n\nAs Sanders\u2019s campaign surged, neither candidate was comfortable making personal attacks. Sanders refused to talk about the investigation of Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while at the State Department, focusing instead on whether Clinton was too close to Wall Street; Clinton accused Sanders of making unrealistic promises, warning that his agenda would lose in a general election.\n\nSanders nonetheless won more than 13 million votes and consistently trounced Clinton among voters under 30, although he did not attract broad support among the Democratic Party\u2019s most important blocs, women and nonwhites. While the senator later endorsed Clinton and campaigned for her, some of his supporters walked out of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, and Republicans used social media to urge Sanders\u2019s voters to cast protest votes or embrace Trump as the real change candidate.\n\n\u201cHis attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump\u2019s \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 campaign,\u201d Clinton wrote in her 2017 campaign memoir.\n\nClinton\u2019s surprise defeat left Democrats leaderless. Sanders, who had never actually joined the party, began to take a bigger role in shaping it. He joined the Senate Democratic leadership for the first time and held dozens of rallies around the country \u2014 some alongside Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez \u2014 to build opposition to the Republican agenda.\n\nSanders also began recrafting and reintroducing ambitious bills to enact his agenda, starting with \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d legislation that was co-sponsored, for the first time, by more than a dozen colleagues. Through much of 2018, he worked with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to pass a war powers resolution to end America\u2019s involvement in the Saudi bombing of Yemen.\n\nIf successful, Sanders, 77, would also be the oldest nominee ever put forward by a major political party.\n\nJohn Wagner contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"

  "text": "Rapper 21 Savage remained steadfast about his intention to fight deportation threats in an interview with The New York Times published on Sunday.\n\nThe 26-year-old artist was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials earlier this month. He was held in ICE custody for 10 days before being released on a $100,000 bond. ICE officials said he was a British national who entered the U.S. legally in 2005 as a minor, but overstayed his visa, which expired a year later. ICE said he was arrested as part of a \u201ctargeted operation.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Times, the Atlanta-based rapper, legally named Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, said he was not going to leave his home of more than a decade, declaring he\u2019d rather go to jail instead of returning to the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving Atlanta without a fight. We gon\u2019 fight all the way till the last day even if that mean I sit in jail for 10 years,\u201d the rapper said.\n\nLawyers for 21 Savage have maintained that he never hid his immigration status from the U.S. government and that he was left without legal status in this country at no fault of his own. If he is deported, he could be banned from entering the United States for 10 years.\n\n\u201cMy situation is important \u2019cause I represent poor black Americans and I represent poor immigrant Americans. You gotta think about all the millions of people that ain\u2019t 21 Savage that\u2019s in 21 Savage shoes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rapper was nominated for two Grammy Awards this year, but did not attend the ceremony because he was in custody. He was slated to perform with rapper Post Malone. The pair were nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Performance for their hit single \u201cRockstar.\u201d\n\nSome artists addressed 21 Savage\u2019s situation on the Grammys red carpet, and Post Malone wore a shirt with \u201c21 Savage\u201d emblazoned on the front during the performance. But the awards show largely ignored the artist\u2019s detainment, a conclusion 21 Savage seemed to dispute."

  "text": "France on Monday said it will ignore a request from the Trump administration to repatriate hundreds of ISIS militants captured fighting alongside Syrian-born fighters and other foreign militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe country's justice minister told a local French television station on Monday that the French government is \"at this stage ... not responding to [Trump\u2019s] demands,\" according to Reuters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere is a new geo-political context, with the U.S. withdrawal. For the time being we are not changing our policy,\u201d justice minister Nicole Belloubet added.\n\nFrance began this year to repatriate captured ISIS fighters and their wives, Reuters reports, after U.S. pressure increased following the fall of most ISIS-held territory in Iraq and Syria. Hundreds of French-born fighters captured in Syria and Iraq remain in legal limbo as their fates await deciding by several countries' governments.\n\nAs many as 150 French citizens including at least 50 adults are being held by the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeastern part of the country, according to the news service. The French government will begin repatriating some French citizens captured in war-torn Syria and Iraq on a \"case-by-case\" basis, Belloubet added according to Reuters.\n\nA senior Trump administration official pushed back against France's announcement on Monday, telling The Hill in an email that the administration \"strongly believe[s] the best solution is for countries to take responsibility for their citizens.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said in January that the U.S. decision to withdraw troops from Syria \"cannot make us deviate from our strategic objective: eradicating Daesh,\" referring to an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nUpdated at 1:17 p.m."

  ],
  "text": "The Vatican on Saturday said it had defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, leveling a historic penalty against a onetime church power broker and former archbishop of Washington after the church found him guilty of sexual abuse.\n\nIt is the most significant abuse-related punishment given to a former cardinal in the modern history of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn a short statement, the Vatican said a canonical process had found McCarrick guilty of two charges: soliciting sex during confession and committing \u201csins\u201d with minors and adults \u201cwith the aggravating factor of the abuse of power.\u201d\n\nThe defrocking, which strips McCarrick of the rights of the priesthood, marks the conclusion of a closed-door Vatican proceeding and comes just days before Pope Francis plans to gather bishops from around the world for an unprecedented summit on abuse.\n\nIt also finalizes the downfall of a figure who entered the \u00adpriesthood six decades ago, climbed the ranks of the faith and earned influence and honorifics \u2014 before becoming a symbol of the church\u2019s struggle to root out abuse in its highest ranks.\n\n\u201cHe was cardinal up until a few months ago. Today, he is Mr. McCarrick,\u201d said the Rev. Davide Cito, a canon lawyer at Rome\u2019s Pontifical University of the Holy Cross. \u201cThis is a humiliation in that world such as one cannot imagine.\u201d\n\nThe decision against McCarrick is known formally as a \u201cdismissal from the clerical state.\u201d The sentence is considered by the Catholic Church to be the most severe form of canonical punishment for a cleric \u2014 worse than excommunication, which is temporary and lasts only as long as a person persists in sin.\n\n[McCarrick was just defrocked by the Vatican. But is it justice?]\n\nMcCarrick, 88, accused of sexually abusing three minors and harassing adult seminarians, probably won\u2019t face criminal prosecution because the allegations that have been made public relate to crimes that would be beyond statutes of limitations in the U.S. jurisdictions where they are said to have occurred.\n\nIn its statement Saturday, the Vatican said that its Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had found McCarrick guilty of the charges on Jan. 11. On Wednesday, the Vatican \u201cconsidered the recourse\u201d that McCarrick presented but confirmed its original decision: a determination that McCarrick was informed of on Friday. Pope Francis has affirmed the decision, meaning it is final.\n\nA Virginia man, James Grein, who has said McCarrick abused him for years, starting when he was 11, said in a statement on Saturday that \u201cnothing can give me back my childhood and I have not taken any pleasure in testifying or discussing what happened to me.\n\n\u201cWith that said, today I am happy that the Pope believed me. I am hopeful now I can pass through my anger for the last time. I hope that Cardinal McCarrick will no longer be able to use the power of Jesus\u2019 Church to manipulate families and sexually abuse children.\u201d\n\nThe accusations against McCarrick, and the notion that they languished for years, have been a central component of a renewed and painful global crisis for the church. To critics of the Vatican and of Pope Francis, McCarrick\u2019s case exemplified a persistent culture of secrecy and coverup, and a reluctance to hold church leaders accountable.\n\nMcCarrick\u2019s defrocking had been widely expected among church experts, who had said the Vatican was trying to conclude the proceedings in advance of the four-day meeting on sexual abuse. Francis has tried to tamp down expectations for that summit, but the decision on McCarrick acts as a \u201csignal moment,\u201d said Austen Ivereigh, a Francis biographer.\n\nIvereigh said it is telling that the Vatican\u2019s charges included McCarrick\u2019s alleged actions with minors but also adults.\n\n\u201cFrancis sees very clearly that sexual abuse is an abuse of power,\u201d Ivereigh said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get a clearer signal of that than this.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Archdiocese of Washington said it hoped and prayed that this \u201cdecision serves to help the healing process for survivors of abuse, as well as those who have experienced disappointment or disillusionment because of what former Archbishop McCarrick has done.\u201d\n\nCardinal Daniel DiNardo, the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the Vatican\u2019s decision showed that \u201cno bishop, no matter how influential, is above the law of the church.\u201d\n\nMcCarrick was a globe-trotting diplomat, representing the Vatican abroad, advocating for human rights and religious freedom. He was the de facto lead spokesman among U.S. cardinals when the abuse crisis first exploded in the early 2000s, and he helped draw up rules in the United States for how the church would handle abuse, rules that provided zero tolerance for predator priests but did little to improve oversight of bishops or cardinals. McCarrick served as archbishop of Washington from 2001 to 2006 and afterward regularly testified before Congress and attended White House meetings.\n\nBut abuse allegations against McCarrick exploded into public view in the summer, along with reports that some in the church hierarchy had known about his misconduct for years.\n\nMcCarrick was suspended from ministry in June after the church determined he had been credibly accused of molesting a minor when he was a priest in New York nearly 50 years ago.\n\nMcCarrick maintained he had \u201cabsolutely no recollection of this reported abuse and believe in my innocence.\u201d\n\nHe has not responded publicly to subsequent allegations, including that two New Jersey dioceses settled cases brought by men who said he harassed them when they were seminarians or young priests.\n\nIn July, under intense pressure, McCarrick became the first cardinal in nearly a century to fully resign his position. Pope Francis ordered him to a life of \u201cprayer and penance,\u201d and he moved to a friary in Kansas.\n\nThe outrage over McCarrick \u2014 coupled with additional scandals in the United States, Europe, Latin America and Australia \u2014 has damaged the reputation of Francis, who said after becoming pope in 2013 that he wanted the church to act \u201cdecisively\u201d on abuse. Advocates and abuse survivors say the pope has succeeded in acknowledging the severity and seriousness of the issue, but he hasn\u2019t backed up his words with action, either by making changes in church law or adding ways to hold bishops accountable.\n\nEven as the canonical proceeding explored the facts directly surrounding McCarrick, the Vatican has remained silent about who might have helped protect McCarrick during his long career. In the summer, a former Holy See ambassador, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, accused Francis and a litany of Vatican higher-ups of knowing about \u2014 and failing to act on \u2014 McCarrick\u2019s alleged misconduct. Francis has not responded to the accusations, and the Vatican has not released the findings of a promised investigation into its archives on McCarrick.\n\nFrancis last year defrocked several priests in Chile at the center of a nationwide scandal. Also last year, Archbishop Anthony Apuron of Guam \u2014 tried on charges that included sexually abusing minors \u2014 was found guilty on some charges, though the Vatican did not specify which ones. He is appealing his case.\n\nExperts in church law say the punishment technically does not mean McCarrick is no longer a priest, because ordination cannot be undone. But McCarrick can no longer perform priestly duties.\n\nIn an open letter released last month, Vigan\u00f2 called on McCarrick to repent publicly as a way to \u201cbring a significant measure of healing to a gravely wounded and suffering Church.\u201d\n\nStefano Pitrelli contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy the Vatican continues to struggle with sex abuse scandals\n\nVatican tries to rein in expectations for sexual abuse summit\n\nPope Benedict, in retired seclusion, looms in the opposition to Pope Francis\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"

  "authors": [],
  "text": "The new U.S. special envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, testified on Capitol Hill Wednesday on U.S. efforts to oust Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Abrams spoke three weeks after the U.S. recognized opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s new president. Since then, the U.S. has placed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company and rejected calls for an international dialogue to resolve the crisis. Elliott Abrams is a right-wing hawk who was convicted in 1991 for lying to Congress during the Iran-Contra scandal, but he was later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush. Abrams defended Guatemalan dictator General Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt as he oversaw a campaign of mass murder and torture of indigenous people in Guatemala in the 1980s. R\u00edos Montt was later convicted of genocide. Abrams was also linked to the 2002 coup in Venezuela that attempted to topple Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Democratic Congressmember Ilhan Omar of Minnesota questioned Abrams about his record on Wednesday during his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee."

  "text": "Prosecutors working in special counsel Robert Mueller Robert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE's office say they agree with a pre-sentencing report that calls for Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortTrump: 'The collusion delusion is over' Five things to watch at Trump's Michigan rally Trump: I don't want to talk about pardons now MORE to spend anywhere from 19 to 24 years in prison.\n\nManafort was convicted on eight counts of bank and tax fraud in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia last summer.\n\nProsecutors in a Feb. 15 filing said that they take no position as to the specific sentence that should be imposed, but said they agree with the guidelines analysis in the Pre-sentence Investigation Report and its calculation of the defendant\u2019s offense level, which carries a sentence of 19.5 to more than 24 years in prison.\n\nThat calculation also calls for a fine between $50,000 to $24.4 million, a term of supervised release of up to five years, restitution in the amount of $24.8 million and forfeiture in the amount of $4.4 million.\n\nProsecutors said that for more than a decade, Manafort repeatedly violated the law and chose to engage in a sophisticated scheme to hide millions of dollars from U.S. authorities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"And when his foreign income stream dissipated in 2015, he chose to engage in a series of bank frauds in the United States to maintain his extravagant lifestyle, at the expense of various financial institutions,\" prosecutors wrote in the filling.\n\n\"Manafort chose to do this for no other reason than greed, evidencing his belief that the law does not apply to him. Manafort solicited numerous professionals and others to reap his ill-gotten gains. The sentence in this case must take into account the gravity of this conduct, and serve to both specifically deter Manafort and those who would commit a similar series of crimes.\"\n\nJudge T.S. Ellis III had originally planned to sentence Manafort on Feb. 8, but canceled the sentencing hearing last month. He said a dispute in Manafort\u2019s criminal case in the District of Columbia could have an impact on his sentence.\n\nAt the time, Manafort was fighting accusations from Mueller that he had breached his plea deal by lying to federal prosecutors. He claims any misstatements were not intentional.\n\nManafort had agreed in September to plead guilty to two counts of conspiracy and fully cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigations to avoid a second criminal trial. But Mueller claimed in November that Manafort had lied in interviews about a range of topics.\n\nAfter hearing arguments from both sides in two sealed proceedings, Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Wednesday ruled that Manafort had in fact intentionally lied to the FBI, the special counsel's office and a grand jury about a payment from a company to a law firm and his interactions and communications with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former business associate who is suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nBerman Jackson also found that Manafort intentionally made false statements that were material to another DOJ investigation. But she said the government had not established sufficient evidence to prove he intentionally lied about his contacts with the Trump administration or Kilimnik\u2019s role in a scheme to tamper with witnesses.\n\nWith the dispute settled, Mueller said there is no reason to further delay sentencing in Manafort\u2019s federal criminal case in Virginia.\n\n\u201cBecause the D.C. court has determined that Manafort intentionally lied to the government, and the breach of the agreement was conceded by the defendant and found by the D.C. court, the government submits there are no outstanding issues warranting delay in proceeding to sentencing before this court,\u201d he said in a status report filed in court on Friday.\n\nManafort was convicted in August on eight counts of bank and tax fraud. The jury, however, could not reach a consensus on 10 other charges.\n\n\u2014 Updated: Feb. 25 at 10:37 p.m."

Last week, Venezuelan authorities claimed they had uncovered 19 assault weapons, 118 ammunition cartridges and 90 military-grade radio antennas on board a U.S.-owned plane that had flown from Miami into Valencia, Venezuela\u2019s third-largest city. The Boeing 767 is owned by a company called 21 Air based in Greensboro, North Carolina. The plane had made nearly 40 round-trip flights between Miami and spots in Venezuela and Colombia since January 11, the day after Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was sworn in to a second term. The flights ended after McClatchy first reported on them. Venezuela accused the U.S. government of sending the arms as part of its attempt to topple the Maduro government. While no definitive links between 21 Air and the U.S. government have been established, McClatchy reports the chairman of 21 Air, Adolfo Moreno, as well as another employee at the company have ties to Gemini Air Cargo, which was involved in the CIA\u2019s rendition program during the administration of George W.

  "authors": [],
  "text": "As teacher strikes in Denver and Los Angeles join a wave of recent labor actions bringing attention to the plight of the American public school system, DN! takes a fresh look at one of the largest public school scandals in U.S. history. Public schools in Atlanta, Georgia, were thrown into chaos in 2015 when 11 former educators were convicted in 2015 of racketeering and other charges for allegedly facilitating a massive cheating operation on standardized tests. Prosecutors said the teachers were forced to modify incorrect answers and students were even allowed to fix their responses during exams. The case has fueled criticism of the education system\u2019s reliance on standardized testing, and elicited calls of racism. Thirty-four of the 35 educators indicted in the scandal were African-American. DN! speaks with Shani Robinson, one of the 11 convicted teachers, who has written a new book on the cheating scandal with journalist Anna Simonton. It\u2019s titled \u201cNone of the Above: The Untold Story of the Atlanta Public Schools Cheating Scandal, Corporate Greed, and the Criminalization of Educators.\u201d"

  "text": "On Friday, an operation by Brazilian military police in Rio de Janeiro left at least 13 people dead after a shootout in the neighborhood of Santa Teresa. Police say they were there to investigate suspected drug traffickers but encountered gunfire when they entered the area. Last month, Rio\u2019s new governor, Wilson Witzel, said that city security forces were authorized to shoot to kill suspects. He also said Rio should have its own Guant\u00e1namo Bay to house criminals, whom he labeled \u201cterrorists.\u201d Brazil\u2019s new president, Jair Bolsonaro, has vowed to intensify the war on drugs. While running for president, Bolsonaro said a \u201cgood criminal is a dead criminal.\u201d In other news from Brazil, Brazil\u2019s first elected openly gay federal lawmaker, Jean Wyllys, recently left his post and fled Brazil, amid growing homophobic violence coinciding with the rise of Bolsonaro. He was replaced in Brazil\u2019s Congress by David Miranda, a Rio city councilmember and husband of Glenn Greenwald."

  "text": "Public school teachers in Denver, Colorado, are striking for the second day, after negotiations between the teachers\u2019 union and the school district failed to reach a contract over the weekend. The Denver Classroom Teachers Association is demanding an increase in teachers\u2019 base salaries rather than putting money in incentives and bonuses. The Denver teachers walked out Monday following 15 months of negotiations over a controversial bonus-based pay system that educators say leaves them unable to predict their salaries and guarantee financial security. The starting salary for a Denver teacher for the 2019-2020 school year is $43,255, according to The Denver Post. This is the district\u2019s first teacher strike in 25 years.\n\n\n\nDN! speaks with Henry Rom\u00e1n, a Denver elementary school teacher and president of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "Dozens of members of a white supremacist gang allegedly responsible for multiple acts of violence were charged in a superseding indictment unsealed today in the Eastern District of Arkansas.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the New Aryan Empire (NAE) is a racketeering enterprise, which committed violent acts\u2014attempted murder, kidnapping, and maiming\u2014in support of its organization and its wide-ranging drug-trafficking operation.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Cody Hiland for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Special Agent in Charge Diane Upchurch of the FBI Little Rock, Arkansas Field Office, Assistant Special Agent in Charge Justin King of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Little Rock District Office and Acting Resident Agent in Charge Warren Newman of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, & Explosives (ATF) Little Rock District Office, made the announcement.\n\n\u201cAccording to the allegations in the indictment announced today, New Aryan Empire associates maintained their criminal enterprise by engaging in multiple acts of violence \u2014 including kidnapping and attempting to murder one informant, and stabbing and maiming two others suspected of cooperating with law enforcement,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. \u201cI want to thank our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners for vigorously investigating this vicious criminal organization.\u201d\n\nThe case, named \u201cTo The Dirt,\u201d which is in reference to the NAE slogan referring to the rule that members must remain in the NAE until they die, began in 2016 when ATF assisted the Pope County Sheriff\u2019s Office in a murder investigation. The murder involved members of the NAE, a white supremacist organization that began as a prison gang and has since expanded beyond the prisons. Investigators learned that several members of the NAE conducted meetings in Pope County and became involved in methamphetamine distribution.\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2017, the grand jury handed down an indictment charging 44 people from the Pope County area with numerous gun and drug violations. Since that indictment, one defendant\u00ad\u2014Daniel Adame, 32, of Russellville, Arkansas \u2014has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. The superseding indictment, which was returned by a federal grand jury on Feb. 5, 2019, named 11 additional defendants and added charges for the defendants\u2019 involvement in acts involving attempted murder, kidnapping, maiming, and conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine.\n\nThirty-five defendants are in either state or federal custody, while 16 were previously released on federal bond. Troy R. Loadholt, 37; Jeffrey G. Howell, 34; and Amos Adame, 46, all from Russellville, remain fugitives. April Howell, 29, and Amanda Rapp, 37, both of Russellville, and Courtney Talley, 32, of Dardanelle, Arkansas, were arrested Tuesday morning. Most of the defendants are residents of Pope and Yell Counties, Arkansas.\n\n\u201cThe violence and hatred alleged in this superseding indictment have no place in society,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Hiland. \u201cWe are committed to helping our communities remain free from these types of crimes using every resource available, including the powerful RICO statutes when appropriate. The significant charges in this case represent the hard work of our state and federal law enforcement agencies, and this office\u2019s commitment to removing violent, repeat offenders from the streets.\u201d\n\nThe superseding indictment alleges that between May 2014 and May 2016, NAE associates Marcus Millsap, 51, of Danville, Arkansas, and James Oliver, 47, of Russellville, as well as NAE President Wesley Gullett, 29, of Russellville, solicited several NAE members and associates to murder the confidential informant responsible for Millsap being charged with drug trafficking. According to the indictment, NAE members believed this informant had provided information about Millsap to law enforcement. In January 2016, two known members of NAE attempted to murder the confidential informant, but were unsuccessful. The superseding indictment further alleges that between May 28, 2017 and June 6, 2017, members and associates of NAE kidnapped, stabbed and maimed two individuals in retaliation for the individuals providing information to law enforcement about another NAE member. During the kidnapping, the victims were forced to write apology letters to the NAE member and his girlfriend.\n\nThe indictment charges 17 of the 54 defendants with crimes under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering statute (VICAR). These racketeering-based statutes provide criminal penalties up to life imprisonment for acts performed as part of a criminal organization, and support charges for those who only ordered or assisted others to carry out the illegal acts. The superseding indictment alleges that from 2014 to the present, the New Aryan Empire functioned as a criminal enterprise to achieve its objectives, including illegal activities that affect interstate commerce.\n\nThe charges in the superseding indictment include conspiracy to violate RICO, kidnapping in aid of racketeering, maiming in aid of racketeering, assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering, and attempted murder in aid of racketeering, as well as multiple methamphetamine and firearm violations (see attachment for complete list of charges and penalties).\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s superseding indictment of over 50 people reflects the FBI\u2019s firm resolve to root out criminal organizations who espouse hate and bigotry, and whose members sell drugs and commit violent acts such as attempted murder, kidnapping, and aggravated assault,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Upchurch. \u201cWe appreciate and applaud the steadfast efforts of our partners at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas, the ATF, DEA, Pope County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Fifth Judicial District Drug Task Force, Russellville Police Department, Arkansas State Police, Conway Police Department, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and FBI in arresting these individuals who are determined to destroy our communities.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the violent acts, law enforcement officials investigated the NAE\u2019s methamphetamine trafficking organization. During the coordinated federal and state investigation, law enforcement agents made 59 controlled purchases of methamphetamine, seizing more than 25 pounds of methamphetamine, as well as 69 firearms and more than $70,000 in drug proceeds.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Aryan gang members and associates are a source of drugs, violence, and crime throughout this region,\u201d said DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge King. \u201cSeveral members and associates of these gangs are charged in a RICO conspiracy as a result of law enforcement collaboration and a determined goal of making our communities safer from gang violence and drug trafficking. This effort, as part of Operation To The Dirt, is a promise to our citizens of the continued commitment of law enforcement at the federal, state and local levels to keep our streets safe.\u201d\n\nWesley S. Gullett, 29, and Kevin M. Long, 23, both of Russellville, Arkansas; Lesa A. Standridge, 54, of Dover, Arkansas; and Christopher S. Helms, 35, of Dardanelle, Arkansas are charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm. Among the 69 guns seized, include handguns, rifles, shotguns, and several high-capacity assault-style rifles.\n\n\u201cThese indictments are the result of an unprecedented collaboration by the ATF, FBI, and DEA Little Rock Field Offices, Pope County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Russellville Police Department and 5th Judicial Drug Task Force,\u201d said ATF Acting Resident Agent in Charge Newman. \u201cThis case reflects a major disruption of the New Aryan Empire organization that affected the whole Arkansas River Valley area. As a result of this collaborative effort, we have effectively dismantled this violent, drug-dealing organization and sent a clear message that the ATF and our law enforcement partners have an unwavering commitment to hold those individuals accountable who insist on creating an atmosphere of violence and fear in our communities.\u201d\n\nThe three arrested today will be arraigned at 3 p.m. CST in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas before U.S. Magistrate Judge Beth Deere.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by FBI, ATF, and DEA, in partnership with the Pope County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Fifth Judicial District Drug Task Force, Russellville Police Department, Arkansas State Police, Conway Police Department and U.S. Postal Inspection Service. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Marianne Shelvey of the Criminal Division\u2019s Organized Crime and Gang Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Liza Jane Brown of the Eastern District of Arkansas.\n\nAn indictment is merely an accusation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."

  "text": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nEver since he campaigned for the White House, Donald Trump has attacked news outlets for negative reporting, singled out individual journalists for scorn, and turned his battle cry against \u201cfake news\u201d\u2014a.k.a. reporting he dislikes\u2014virtually into a personal brand. His hostility has only escalated with scrutiny of his presidency. Whipping up crowds as he points at the press gallery has been a set piece of his political rallies. He describes journalists as \u201cdishonest,\u201d \u201ccorrupt,\u201d and \u201csick.\u201d And Trump has repeatedly echoed the language of 20th century despots, demonizing the American media as \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d\n\nPresidential disdain for the press is nothing new. Still, political and media experts have long worried that Trump\u2019s uniquely broad and bitter war of words wouldn\u2019t just corrode public trust in reported facts, but could also produce other dangerous effects.\n\nNow there is strong evidence it has. According to half a dozen law enforcement and security leaders I spoke with in recent weeks, the targeting of journalists has steadily intensified in the Trump era, from organized campaigns of personal harassment to bomb threats and vows of assault, rape, and mass shootings. Two sources told me they\u2019ve repeatedly seen explicit evidence of threats directly channeling the president\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had multiple cases of people using the same rhetoric as the president,\u201d says a top security official, noting that the bulk of threats against his news network are aimed at correspondents who cover the White House and the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nAn example surfaced at the end of August with news the FBI had arrested a California man, Robert Chain, for allegedly threatening to travel to the offices of the Boston Globe and commit a mass shooting. His menacing communications came just after the Globe announced a coordinated editorial effort among newspapers nationwide to denounce Trump\u2019s attacks on the press as anti-American and dangerous.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the enemy of the people, and we\u2019re going to kill every fucking one of you,\u201d Chain said in one of several anonymous calls to the Globe, according to the FBI. In another, he vowed, \u201cWe are going to shoot you motherfuckers in the head.\u201d According to the Globe\u2019s own reporting on the case, authorities found 20 firearms in Chain\u2019s home, including a semi-automatic rifle he\u2019d purchased in May.\n\nIt was not the first glimpse of the potential danger. Earlier in August, a reporter shared an anonymous threat called into the Los Angeles bureau of the Associated Press: \u201cAt some point we\u2019re just gonna start shooting you fucking assholes.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta recently publicized a video of an angry swarm of people taunting him as he broadcast from a Trump rally in Florida. And MSNBC anchor Katy Tur, who covered Trump and was openly ridiculed by him on the 2016 campaign trail, spoke on-air about some of the vicious harassment she has faced: \u201c\u2019I hope you get raped and killed,\u2019 one person wrote to me just this week,\u201d Tur said. \u201cAnd in case you want to argue that this has nothing to do with the president, the most recent note I got ended with \u2018MAGA.\u2019\u201d\n\nThreats and harassment are an age-old problem for news organizations, stemming from all manner of grievances and often marked by incoherent or empty bluster. But the veteran law enforcement and security leaders I spoke with, including top officials at two major media companies, conveyed sobering levels of concern about the Trump-fueled phenomenon. (The officials asked not to be identified in order to discuss sensitive subject matter.) Both the frequency and the temperature have been rising, they said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very troubling,\u201d said a senior US law enforcement agent with expertise in threats against public figures. \u201cI do think it\u2019s dangerous for the president to walk this line of basically inciting violence,\u201d the agent said. \u201cMost people won\u2019t act on it, but sooner or later, someone will\u2014a person who can\u2019t distinguish from the political message. We\u2019ve been seeing some prospects of this. People could get injured or killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe volume has definitely picked up,\u201d said a security director for a major television news network, describing bombing and other death threats. \u201cWe\u2019ve had multiple cases of people using the same rhetoric as the president,\u201d he told me. He shared language from a recent suspect: \u201cI swear allegiance to my leader, and he says you\u2019re fake news, you\u2019re the enemy. I must rid the country of you because you\u2019re the enemy of the people.\u201d\n\nThe network has consistently faced a spike in threatening activity after Trump has disparaged it by name, according to the security director. The bulk of the threats, he said, have been aimed at correspondents who cover the White House and the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nThere has been no indication of concern about the problem from the Trump White House. On August 30, as initial excerpts from journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s book on the Trump presidency commanded wide media attention, Trump reiterated his disdain: \u201cI just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the Media is,\u201d he said. \u201cTruth doesn\u2019t matter to them, they only have their hatred & agenda\u2026Enemy of the People!\u201d\n\nThe news of Chain\u2019s arrest broke later that morning, sparking renewed media discussion about Trump\u2019s rhetoric. The president himself said nothing about the threats to the Globe. But that night, at a campaign rally in Evansville, Indiana, he was right back at it with his familiar jeremiad against the \u201cfailing\u201d New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN. \u201cThese are just dishonest, terrible people,\u201d Trump said emphatically, waving a finger at the press gallery as the crowd jeered. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that. Terrible people.\u201d\n\nI asked former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci\u2014who has said he doesn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s war on the media\u2014if he would urge the president to cease the incitement. Scaramucci replied that he had already done so. He did not reply to follow-up questions I sent asking about how Trump responded. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also did not reply to my requests for comment.\n\nAfter the FBI disclosed violent threats against the Boston Globe that cited \u201ctreasonous and seditious\u201d coverage of the president, Trump said of an op-ed published by the New York Times, \u201cReally what they\u2019ve done is, virtually\u2026treason.\u201d\n\nChain\u2019s threatening calls in August included him condemning the Globe\u2019s reporting on Trump as \u201ctreasonous and seditious.\u201d But even after that disclosure from the FBI, Trump went on to use such rhetoric. During a live interview with Fox News on September 6, as Trump stood among thousands of supporters assembling for a rally in Billings, Montana, he responded to a question about the recently published New York Times op-ed from an anonymous official claiming to \u201cresist\u201d Trump\u2019s agenda from within the administration. As Fox & Friends co-host Pete Hegseth brought up the Times piece, the crowd booed. Trump smiled.\n\n\u201cI think this audience would say that an attack on you is an attack on the people that voted for you,\u201d said Hegseth, who has himself referred to \u201cthe failing New York Times\u201d and made a conspicuously false claim about the paper\u2019s coverage. \u201cYeah,\u201d Trump nodded. The crowd\u2019s booing morphed into cheering. Hegseth then asked Trump what should be done about the op-ed.\n\n\u201cThe Times should never have done that,\u201d Trump replied, \u201cbecause really what they\u2019ve done is, virtually, you know, it\u2019s treason.\u201d\n\nEarly on in the Trump presidency, Washington Post editor Marty Baron responded to Trump\u2019s aggression with a shrewd bit of verbal judo, redirecting attention toward the public service of the American press: \u201cWe\u2019re not at war,\u201d Baron said, \u201cwe\u2019re at work.\u201d Recent polling suggests a majority of Americans trust the media more than Trump to tell the truth on important issues. However, another recent survey showed that people distrustful of the media often cite Trumpian parlance like \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201calternative facts.\u201d\n\nAccording to the security leaders at the two media companies, there has also been a surge in recent months in so-called doxxing, or publicizing journalists\u2019 personal information on social media and organizing harassment of them. One security director described intense activity targeting reporters who have exposed members of white supremacist groups emboldened by Trump. The other described a wave of threats against journalists at several news organizations that pursued information about the non-sequestered jurors seated in the trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort: \u201cThey said, \u2018Okay, because you\u2019re trying to get the private information of citizens that are jurors, we\u2019re gonna put out all your private information.\u2019\u201d Some of the journalists received threatening material mailed to their home addresses, he said, and in some cases, strangers threatened to show up at journalists\u2019 homes.\n\n\u201cIf you want to know who this gutless loser is, call the opinion desk of the failing NYT at 212-556-1234 and ask them,\u201d said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cThey are the only ones complicit in this deceitful act.\u201d\n\nThis summer, fans of a bizarre pro-Trump conspiracy theory known as QAnon began to turn up at Trump rallies, raising further questions about what might happen when fringe online activity moves into the real world. In light of one violent case already, said the TV news network\u2019s security director, there is danger from \u201cthe Pizzagate and QAnon types who may actually show up in person\u2014the ones that get it in their heads that all of that stuff is true\u2014and they\u2019re going to act on it. Most of the time those are few and far in between, but they\u2019re concerning.\u201d\n\nRecent comments from the Trump White House seemed to gesture approvingly toward doxxing tactics. Shortly after the anonymous op-ed was published in the Times, press secretary Sanders put out a statement responding to questions from reporters: \u201cIf you want to know who this gutless loser is, call the opinion desk of the failing NYT at 212-556-1234 and ask them. They are the only ones complicit in this deceitful act.\u201d (The Times got flooded with a mix of calls.)\n\nAfter the mass shooting in late June at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, concerns among security leaders ratcheted up further, according to those I spoke with. No known evidence has emerged that the perpetrator of that attack, who harbored a deep personal grudge against the paper, was motivated by Trump. The president offered no comments about the shooting that day; speaking at a public event at the White House about 24 hours later, he called the attack \u201chorrific\u201d and recited a couple prepared remarks from a teleprompter: \u201cJournalists, like all Americans, should be free from the fear of being violently attacked while doing their job.\u201d\n\nSome Trump political allies waved off renewed criticism of his anti-media rhetoric, insisting it was irrelevant to the carnage at the Capital Gazette. Yet the shooting set a harrowing precedent for an assault on a newsroom: As I\u2019ve reported over the past several years, there is evidence that aspiring mass shooters often take a keen interest in such high-profile attacks.\n\n\u201cOne particularly devout anti-Trump fake journalist over at fake news CNN is so openly concerned the president\u2019s rhetoric could endanger members of the media,\u201d Sean Hannity scoffed.\n\nA few weeks after the shooting, a widely circulated piece by conservative Times columnist Bret Stephens highlighted a warning that has long been on the minds of many: \u201cTrump Will Have Blood on His Hands.\u201d Stephens detailed his own recent experience with a menacing caller who promised to shoot him and others and said \u201cthe press is the enemy of the United States people.\u201d\n\nA dark irony of this phenomenon is that anyone who hates the media for its alleged mission against Trump can find nightly affirmation from one of the largest news networks in America. After CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta appealed recently for the White House to stop calling the press \u201cthe enemy,\u201d Fox News anchor and close Trump ally Sean Hannity opened his primetime show with obligatory invective:\n\nOne particularly devout anti-Trump fake journalist over at fake news CNN is so openly concerned the president\u2019s rhetoric could endanger members of the media. But we\u2019re going to show you how the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, absolutely decimated this person\u2026during today\u2019s very tense briefing. Plus, we\u2019re going to help remind the anti-Trump fake news CNN network why so many Americans chant at you that you suck. Americans don\u2019t trust your abusively biased coverage.\n\nIt is evident that Trump, by way of Fox News, political surrogates, and the power of the presidential bully pulpit, has ingrained a toxic political narrative. There is also no denying its trajectory: The more Trump decries an alleged media conspiracy bent on destroying him, the more he sets the stage for a grim conclusion."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "The last time U.S. coal consumption was this low, Jimmy Carter was president.\n\nDespite campaigning on a pledge to save the dirtiest of fossil fuels, President Donald Trump has presided over a faster rate of coal plant retirements in his first two years than President Barack Obama saw in his entire first term.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that while 15 gigawatts of coal-fired plants were shut down in Obama\u2019s first four years, Trump\u2019s first two years have seen some 20 gigawatts retired (with more than two thirds of those occurring last year).\n\nAs a result, U.S. coal use dropped 4 percent in 2018 to a level not seen since 1979, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\nU.S. coal use. CREDIT: EIA.\n\nIn fact, the EIA now projects that the decline in coal consumption will speed up in 2019 \u2014 with power sector coal use forecast to drop a whopping 8 percent this year.\n\nSo what went wrong? After all, Trump had said he would end Obama\u2019s supposed \u201cwar on coal.\u201d\n\nThe answer is there never was any such war. The fundamental problem for coal was \u2014 and still is \u2014 economics, not politics. Indeed, as one leading industry analyst explained back in May, \u201cthe economics of coal have gotten worse\u201d under Trump.\n\nCoal power plants have simply become too expensive to operate compared to natural gas and renewable energy. Indeed, building and running new wind and solar farms is now cheaper than just running existing coal plants in many places.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust last month, for instance, PacifiCorp, one of the biggest U.S. coal-burning utilities, reported that most of its 22 coal-fired plants are not economical.\n\nThe Trump administration itself is slowly waking up to this reality. Back in August, Trump traveled to West Virginia to tell supporters he had a \u201cmilitary plan\u201d to save coal power plants. But by mid-October, Politico was reporting that \u201cthe White House has shelved the plan amid opposition from the president\u2019s own advisers on the National Security Council and National Economic Council.\u201d\n\nApparently they had no idea how to pay for the multi-billion dollar plan, and the most likely source of money was inevitably going to be U.S. ratepayers, especially in the red states that had the most uneconomic coal plants.\n\nIn terms of coal mining jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports there were 51,000 when Trump took office, and 53,000 as of November 2018. Mining jobs have gone up slightly because the loss in domestic consumption was offset by a surge in coal production for export in the past two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut export growth may be threatened by Trump\u2019s trade war with China \u2014 and seems unlikely to offset the EIA\u2019s projected 8 percent decline in domestic use for power in 2019. So the outlook for coal jobs this year is not bright. To help, some companies, such as EnerBlu in Kentucky, are starting to train former coal workers to work in the renewable technology industry.\n\nBut coal also has another problem. While the administration is run by climate science deniers, including the president himself, the utility industry is increasingly reality-based.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the utilities have embraced a carbonless future and proposed drastic emissions reductions,\u201d coal industry expert Matt Preston told E&E News recently. Preston, who works for leading analytical firm Wood MacKenzie added, \u201cThat is a huge turnaround in thinking.\u201d\n\nIn December, Xcel Energy became the first major U.S. utility committed to delivering 100 percent carbon-free power by 2050. It also promised an 80 percent reduction in carbon pollution (from 2005 levels) by 2030.\n\nAs Xcel\u2019s chief executive, Ben Fowke, told reporters at the time, \u201cThis risk of climate change isn\u2019t going away and we want to be the company that does something about it and hopefully inspire others to do something about it too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bottom line is that U.S. coal power\u2019s steady decline isn\u2019t slowing down under Trump and, if anything, is speeding up.\n\nThis post has been updated."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nick Kwek toured the border dividing the US state of Arizona and Mexico's Sonora\n\nUS congressional talks over a border security deal have stalled, raising the chances of another government shutdown.\n\nNegotiators were hoping for a deal by Monday to give Congress time to pass legislation by Friday, when the federal funding agreement runs out.\n\nThey remain divided on how many undocumented immigrants can be detained and funding for President Trump's promised border wall with Mexico.\n\nThe previous shutdown, lasting 35 days, was the longest in US history.\n\nHundreds of thousands of workers were furloughed while others in essential services, such as hospital care, air traffic control and law enforcement, worked without pay.\n\nThe cost to the US economy was estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn).\n\nIt was unclear how the negotiators would try to reach a deal, but a meeting has been scheduled for later on Monday, congressional aides said.\n\nWhat is the latest impasse about?\n\nThe 17 Republican and Democratic negotiators from the Senate and the House have been holding talks to reach a border security agreement that can be accepted by Congress.\n\nThe latest impasse seems to be centred on a Democratic demand to limit the number of undocumented migrants already in the US who can be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nDemocrats planned to cap the number of beds at detention centres reserved for those cases at 16,500.\n\nBy doing that, they hoped to force ICE to focus on detaining irregular migrants with criminal records instead of those who have overstayed their visas and, Democrats say, are productive and offer no threat.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump?\n\nThey were also looking at between $1.3bn and $2bn in funding for Mr Trump's proposed border wall, a long way off the $5.7bn the president has been demanding.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Trump said that Democrats needed to \"loosen up\", adding that their latest demand relating to the detention of migrants was \"crazy\".\n\nThe president had earlier said the Democrats were \"behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally\".\n\nLead Republican negotiator Sen Richard Shelby told Fox News: \"I'll say 50-50 we get a deal... The spectre of a shutdown is always out there.\"\n\nHowever, one of the Democratic negotiators, Jon Tester, said there was still hope that a deal could be reached in time. Also speaking to Fox News, he said: \"Negotiations seldom go smooth all the way through.\"\n\nAs wall discussions labour on, Mr Trump plans on sending over 3,700 active troops to the US-Mexico border to help agents with security efforts this month. With over 2,000 troops already at the border, the new deployment would top November's election-time numbers of 5,900.\n\nMeanwhile, pushing back against the Trump administration's call for border states to help with security, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom says he will recall hundreds of the state's national guard from the border.\n\nGov Newsom's move follows his Democratic colleague, Gov Michelle Grisham of New Mexico, who pulled her state's troops from the border last week.\n\nBoth governors have cited the withdrawal as a retaliation against Mr Trump's \"fear-mongering\".\n\nWhy is there a risk of another shutdown?\n\nOn 25 January, President Trump agreed to a three-week spending deal to end the shutdown and allow Congress to reach an agreement.\n\nThat funding ends at midnight on Friday. Another short-term deal could prevent a new shutdown, according to the New York Times.\n\nMr Trump - who has suggested the talks are a \"waste of time\" - made building a wall on the border with Mexico one of his key promises in the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe president has backed away from his calls to make Mexico pay for a concrete wall but during his State of the Union speech last Tuesday - delayed because of the previous shutdown - he insisted on a \"smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Just why has the US government partially shut down?\n\nHe has previously threatened to declare a national emergency and fund the wall without Congress. But this idea is disliked even by some fellow Republicans and Democrats are likely to challenge it in courts.\n\nMr Trump said on Saturday the wall would \"get built one way or the other!\" He is set to hold a rally in the border city of El Paso, in Texas, later on Monday to gather support for his wall.\n\nAhead of his visit, local officials denounced the president's remarks that a fence built there more than a decade ago reduced criminality.\n\nWhat would happen in a shutdown?\n\nFederal agencies including the departments of Homeland Security, State, Agriculture and Commerce could lose access to money and begin to close down again, affecting about 800,000 federal employees, who would go unpaid.\n\nDuring a shutdown, essential services continue to operate, with workers being required to show up. Last time, some employees continued to work unpaid but many others called in sick."

  "text": "Minneapolis (CNN) Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced her presidential bid at a snowy, freezing outdoor event on Sunday, vaulting the three-term senator from Minnesota into the crowded field of Democrats angling to take on President Donald Trump in 2020 .\n\nKlobuchar, with snow piling up around her and blanketing the thousands of people before her, cast herself as the product of working-class roots who can win bipartisan support and help Democrats win back the Midwestern cities and towns that drifted toward President Donald Trump in 2016. Throughout her speech , she pledged to take on issues like money in politics, climate change and election reform, and leaned heavily into her Minnesota roots.\n\n\"On an island in the middle of the mighty Mississippi, in our nation's heartland, at a time when we must heal the heart of our democracy and renew our commitment to the common good, I stand before you as the granddaughter of an iron ore miner, the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman, the first woman elected to the United States Senate from the state of Minnesota, to announce my candidacy for president of the United States,\" Klobuchar said.\n\nThe snowstorm featured heavily throughout Klobuchar's announcement.\n\n\"I'm asking you to join us on this campaign. It's a homegrown one,\" she said. \"I don't have a political machine. I don't come from money. But what I do have is this: I have grit.\"\n\nShe added: \"I have all of you who are willing to come out in the middle of the winter, all of you who took the time to watch us today from home, all of you who are willing to stand up and say people matter.\"\n\nThe senator also used the snow and freezing temperature to set herself apart from a crowded field of Democrats running in 2020.\n\nAsked by CNN's Suzanne Malveaux after the speech what set her apart from others running, Klobuchar looked around, \"What makes me unique is I did this announcement speech in the middle of a blizzard and I think we need people with grit -- I have that grit.\"\n\nAnd when another reporter asked whether she was tough enough to take on Trump, she laughed and sad, \"I am tough enough to take on Donald Trump. I would have liked to seen him sitting here in the snow for an hour giving this speech.\"\n\nIn her speech, Klobuchar also took a swipe at officials in Washington, promising that her honesty will set her apart from them.\n\n\"I promise you this: As your president, I will look you in the eye. I will tell you what I think. I will focus on getting things done. That's what I've done my whole life. And no matter what, I'll lead from the heart,\" she said.\n\nThe senator also went after Trump without mentioning him by name, criticizing the President's foreign policy and use of Twitter.\n\n\"We need to stand strong \u2014 and consistently \u2014 with our allies. We need to be clear in our purpose. We must respect our front line troops, diplomats and intelligence officers ... who are out there every day risking their lives for us ... they deserve better than foreign policy by tweet,\" she said.\n\nIt was clear early in Klobuchar's remarks that her campaign will be centered on making inroads in the Midwest, an area of the country that has been wooed by Trump in recent years. Minneapolis and the nearby Mississippi River, which rolled slowly down the hill from where Klobuchar spoke, played a central role in the senator's pitch.\n\n\"The Mississippi River, all our rivers connect us, to one another. To our shared story,\" she said. \"For that is how this country was founded, with patriots who saw more that united them than divided them.\"\n\nThe setting also provided a clear example of how the senator hopes to run for president as a Minnesotan and Midwesterner.\n\nKlobuchar's uncovered head was covered in light snow by the end of her speech and snowflakes blanketed everything in front of her, from her eyelashes to the microphone she used to the pages of her speech that were enclosed in plastic covers.\n\nAhead of the event, snow blowers cleared the stage multiple times and volunteers were frantically working to shovel walkways for people. The skyline of Minneapolis was barely visible behind the stage and the banks of the freezing Mississippi River were covered in snow.\n\nKlobuchar's team planned for the event by ordering 100 gallons of hot cocoa and 100 gallons of apple cider. Volunteers handed out small American flags and packs of Little Hotties hand warmers as people entered the park. A small covered area to the side of the event had a roaring fire and a number of event attendees either cross-country skied or snow-shoed to the speech.\n\nMost attendees were unfazed by the weather -- and gave Klobuchar credit for announcing outside in February.\n\n\"It just truly represents Minnesota,\" said Renee Anderson, a 22-year old from Bloomington. \"If somebody doesn't want to come to an event that is outside in Minnesota, do they really live here? Are they really excited?\"\n\nScott Herzog, a 50-year-old manufacturer from West St. Paul, said the same as he stood in front of the stage two hours before the event started: \"This is true Minnesota: Snow and Amy Klobuchar.\"\n\nAnd Lauren Noyes, who came to the event with her husband, David, and their twins Gabriel and Kiera, said the fact that Klobuchar kept the event on showed \"grit.\"\n\n\"She's tough! She is showing her grit,\" she said as her 9-month-old twins sat in sleds at her feet. \"This tells me we are made from tough stuff.\"\n\nKlobuchar will follow her event in Minnesota with a trip to Iowa and Wisconsin next weekend and then another trip to Iowa on February 21, where she will speak at the Ankeny Area Democrats Winter Banquet and Fundraiser.\n\nKlobuchar's presidential aspirations have not been a secret to many in her home state and around Washington.\n\n\"She's going to do it,\" Minnesotan and former Vice President Walter Mondale told KFGO on Thursday. \"I'm very positive that she will run and announce on Sunday. I think she's got a real shot here.\"\n\nAnd Klobuchar told reporters in early January that she was \"getting close to a decision\" about running for president in 2020.\n\n\"I'm continuing to talk to people about it,\" she said.\n\nPeople close to Klobuchar told CNN she plans to run as a deal maker who is able to get things done when things need to get done. She will cast herself throughout the campaign as the granddaughter of rural America, someone whose life was helped by a grandfather who saved money in a coffee can to send her father, who would go on to become a journalist, to college.\n\nKlobuchar's team believes there is an opening in the Democratic primary for someone who is able to relate to voters in Iowa because of her local ties, but is also able to talk to Democrats eager to beat Trump in 2020 as well as win back Trump voters.\n\nThat is where Democrats believe Klobuchar's electoral record will factor in: The senator has consistently overperformed against other Democrats in Minnesota, winning her three terms in office by an average of 26 percentage points.\n\n\"All Amy Klobuchar does is win,\" said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz when he introduced Klobuchar.\n\nKlobuchar won re-election in 2018 with 60% of the vote. She visited all 87 Minnesota counties during the campaign, including 42 that went for Trump in 2016. This win helped burnish Klobuchar's credibility with rural and lean-Republican voters and will likely be the backbone of her campaign.\n\n\"She could surprise pundits here,\" said Matt Paul, Hillary Clinton's Iowa state director during the 2016 caucus. \"She's a neighbor, has long been working to elect Democrats in Iowa and established herself as a Democrat who gets things done.\"\n\nKlobuchar has a liberal voting record but is not considered as liberal as other candidates running for president or considering a 2020 run. Klobuchar does not support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill -- instead pushing to lower the age when people are allowed to buy into the government health care program.\n\nSome Democrats question whether her more moderate voting record -- she supported, for example, Trump's nominations of Wilbur Ross, Mike Pompeo and John Kelly and a host of other nominees -- is left enough to succeed in a Democratic primary. According to FiveThirtyEight's congressional vote tracker, Klobuchar voted with Trump's interests 31% of the time since he took office.\n\nKlobuchar has also been dogged in the days leading up to her campaign launch by a series of headlines about how she treats her staff poorly and creates a hostile work environment.\n\nIn a not-so-subtle nod to those stories, one of the first things Klobuchar did from the stage was thank her staff for putting on the event.\n\nAnd when asked about the stories after the event, the senator admitted that she can be tough on people.\n\n\"Yes, I can be tough. And yes, I can push people. I know that.\" she said. \"But in the end, there are so many great stories of our staff that have been with me for years who have gone on to do incredible things. I have high expectations for myself. I have high expectations for the people who work for me, but I have high expectations of this country. And that is what we need.\"\n\nBorn in Plymouth, Minnesota, Klobuchar returned to her home state after attending Yale University and getting her law degree at the University of Chicago. She began her career in private practice before being elected narrowly as Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was re-elected with no competition in 2002."

The committee, which is now headed by Democrat Adam Schiff of California, hopes Mr. Mueller will be able to prosecute instances of perjury among some of President Donald Trump's current and former colleagues that have come under the investigation's crosshairs.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the same Committee launched a new probe into Trump's foreign business deals to determine if the President's decisions on Russia might have been influenced by his desire for personal financial gain. Trump took great umbrage at the announcement, lashing out at Schiff and calling him a, \"political hack.\" Trump has claimed that no other president has ever faced such scrutiny.

  "text": "As teachers in the Denver Public Schools district prepare to go on strike Monday for the first time in 25 years, parents and students have had a lot questions about what a walkout could mean for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to look like typical school,\u201d DPS Superintendent Susana Cordova said recently. \u201cWe want to be honest about that. School will not look and feel the same way. It\u2019s never normal when you go into a school and your teacher isn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nAs everyone tries to understand what a strike might mean for students, teachers, families, the school district and substitute teachers, The Denver Post has answered some of the frequently asked questions about the planned walkout.\n\nIf you have more questions, please email them to reporter Saja Hindi at shindi@denverpost.com.\n\nWill schools remain open during the strike?\n\nDistrict officials say they do not plan to close any schools \u2014 as of now. However, all early childhood education classes will be canceled, and there currently are no district plans for alternate pre-school programs.\n\nThe city of Denver offered its city recreation centers and public libraries as locations for families who need somewhere for their children to go in the event of a strike.\n\nDPS spokeswoman Anna Alejo said the district will make an assessment each day as to whether there are enough licensed teachers and unlicensed substitute teachers, as well as supervisors from the central office, to keep each school open.\n\n\u201cIf we come to the conclusion that we can\u2019t keep kids safe, then we will consider closing schools. But that right now is not in the plan,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat about preschool classes?\n\nAlejo said DPS will have to cancel its early childhood education classes because \u201cwe are not confident we have sufficient supports needed to keep their classrooms open during the strike.\u201d\n\nThe district has 4,714 students enrolled in its early education programs. Alejo said there are no plans in place for interim preschool programs as the district does not have the capacity. However, other organizations and the city are in discussions on possible partnerships if the strike takes place.\n\nWill there be any resources for parents who have to, or decide to, keep their kids home?\n\nAccording to a news release from the city, Denver\u2019s 30 recreation centers will open at 8 a.m. during strike days and access is free for ages 5 to 18 with a My Denver card. The after-school programs will be fully staffed. Library locations will open at 10 a.m., and will have additional programming and snacks for children.\n\nThose who are on free and reduced lunch still will be able to access those services at their schools with a parent or guardian, regardless of whether that school was to close or if early childhoood education classes are not offered.\n\nThe city\u2019s Free Healthy Meals program will also have extended hours and increased capacity for kids who are at the Denver rec centers.\n\nThe Boys & Girls Clubs plan to continue operating in neighborhoods and schools that are open, according to a city news release.\n\nLocal churches are also stepping up to offer services. On Sunday, the Highlands United Methodist Church in Denver posted on Facebook that the church hopes to offer services to 30 early childhood education students, pending state approval.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Human Services is also accepting requests for emergency child waivers to allow providers to accommodate more kids than typical during a strike, according to an email from the agency. To find licensed care providers, call 1-877-338-2273 or text \u201cchild care referral\u201d to 898-211.\n\nShould I send my kids to school? If I do, am I supporting the teachers on strike?\n\nSome union members are encouraging parents to send their kids to school to show the district the value of its educators and increase pressure, but Denver Classroom Teachers Association President Henry Roman has only gone so far as saying it\u2019s a personal decision that parents need to make \u201cbased on what they believe to be in the best interest and wellbeing of their children.\u201d\n\nAccording to district officials, regular attendance policies will apply, and they ask any parents who aren\u2019t sending their kids to school to make sure to call the schools and let them know.\n\nWhat happens if there aren\u2019t enough substitutes?\n\nThe school district has hired 300 new substitute teachers in addition to the 1,200 on its \u201cactive roster\u201d list of substitute teachers, Alejo said. The district is also planning to move 1,400 employees from its central office into the schools.\n\nIf the district finds it does not have enough paraprofessionals, substitute teachers and district employees to staff a school, officials will have to assess whether to close schools.\n\nWhat are the substitutes going to do? Will they be \u201cglorified babysitters?\u201d\n\nDistrict officials have stressed that the schools will have high-quality lesson plans for all grades and subjects and that students will not be watching movies all day. They already have spent more than $130,000 on lesson plans and curriculums.\n\nHowever, some schools have alerted parents that the classrooms may not look the same, with many classes being combined. Specialized courses, such as AP classes, will also have modifications.\n\nAre there repercussions if teachers who are part of the union don\u2019t strike?\n\nThe union said on its website that though the strike is a \u201ccollective effort,\u201d each member can make their own decision. \u201cThis decision cannot be made in a vacuum; one must consider moral, political and financial implications when deciding whether \u2014 and how \u2014 to support a strike,\u201d the union\u2019s website said.\n\nStill, the union noted that \u201ccrossing the picket line\u201d undermines the efforts of others to create better working conditions.\n\nAre there repercussions for the teachers who do strike?\n\nThe union said on its website that its \u201cunlikely\u201d that a union member would lose his or her job if that person strikes. The law has a special protection for teachers, so dismissals would have to be based on performance, not participation in a strike.\n\nThe school district previously has said in a statement that it is not DPS\u2019 policy to fire employees who legally participate in a strike.\n\nWill teachers be paid during the strike? Will they get health benefits?\n\nThe school district can withhold teachers\u2019 pay during the strike, according to the union, but the group, in any eventual settlement, could negotiate \u201cmake-up\u201d days for teachers to recover lost pay.\n\nHealth benefits are paid a month in advance, so teachers will be covered for the duration of the month, the union said on its website. However, if the strike continues for more than a month, teachers will be able to continue their own insurance, but they would have to pay for it out of pocket.\n\nThe school district said it would lose $400,000 a day if teachers strike. What is that number based on?\n\nAlejo said Denver\u2019s teachers and specialized service providers collectively are paid $2 million per day in compensation. A teacher who is on strike would lose about $400 per day in pay, on average.\n\nAccording to Alejo, DPS estimates losing more than $400,000 per day if a strike takes place based on the amount it will have to pay for substitute teachers, strike curriculum and materials, and the loss of revenue from the closed early childhood education program.\n\nWhat will happen to specialized classes, such as special education?\n\nAlejo said special education programs will be \u201cwell-supported.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn all the planning, meeting the needs of special needs students was the No. 1 priority,\u201d she said.\n\nWill after-school programs be canceled? What about sports?\n\nAlejo said each school will have to make its own determination about after-school programs and sports. However, aside from the early childhood education component, DiscoveryLink programming will continue.\n\nCan district administrative employees be fired for not filling in during the strike?\n\nThe school district has told its administrative employees that if they don\u2019t cross the picket line in the event of a strike, they could be fired. A memo from the superintendent said all non-essential district operations would be suspended until the end of a strike, so employees will be expected to work in schools.\n\nWhat happens after the strike? Will teachers and the DPS administration be able to work together?\n\nThe union said on its website that any settlement reached after a strike will include a \u201cno reprisals clause,\u201d ensuring that no one can be retaliated against for participating in a strike. This also includes feedback on any performance evaluations."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "During a meeting with state lawmakers on Tuesday, one of the highest-ranking National Guard officers said they won\u2019t abide by Trump\u2019s ban.\n\nOne of the highest-ranking officers in the California National Guard told lawmakers on Tuesday that the state will not discharge transgender soldiers from its ranks \u2014 even as President Trump\u2019s administration makes strides in doing so.\n\n\u201cAs long as you fight, we don\u2019t care what gender you identify as,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers, who serves as assistant adjutant general for the California National Guard. \"Nobody's going to kick you out.\u201d he said.\n\nThe official's remarks to the Assembly Veterans Affairs Committee come only a month after the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that Trump\u2019s ban on transgender service members can proceed while lower courts weigh its legality.\n\nBeevers believes that even with this ruling, the ban will never take effect, even stating, \"I believe the ban (on transgender troops) will be lifted again.\u201d The official went on to share that he personally knows at least two transgender airmen who serve in the National Guard, and assumes there are many others, but the agency doesn\u2019t officially track numbers.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we're not compelled to measure it, so we don't,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nAn estimated 13,763 transgender service members currently face dismissal across the nation, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\nThe Advocate reached out for comment from the California National Guard on how they plan to ignore any federal policy changes in the near future, but did not hear back at time of publishing.\n\nService members who have been diagnosed with \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d will be grandfathered in and allowed to continue service if the ban comes into full-effect. Other active members who have medically transitioned at least three years prior to enlisting or who have no plans to transition medically while in service will also not be impacted.\n\nAaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center, told The Advocate that just 937 transgender service members currently meet these exemptions that would clear them for service.\n\nThe ban was originally announced on Twitter in late-2017 and many states immediately filed suits challenging the ban \u2014 California being one of the first. Currently, an appeal in Maryland is the sole challenge delaying the Trump administration from fully enacting its new trans policies.\n\nCalifornia civil rights organizations celebrated the bold statement from the official, saying it echoes their recent challenges to Trump.\n\n\u201cWhat the California National Guard said, and what we've said in our lawsuit, is that the military ought to treat them just like every other servicemember,\u201d Samuel Garrett-Pate, communications director of Equality California, told The Advocate. The LGBTQ organization has worked with California attorney general Xavier Becerra to sue the president over his ban.\n\n\u201cCalifornia will always champion the values of freedom, equality and fairness \u2014 even when the president fails to,\u201d he continued."

  "text": "Photo via Facebook\n\nThe man who opened fire on a group of Muslim worshippers in Quebec City, killing six, will serve a life sentence and won\u2019t be eligible for parole for 40 years.\n\nAlexandre Bissonnette was driven by a \u201cvisceral hatred\u201d of Muslims, Quebec Superior Court Justice Francois Huot told a courtroom packed with 250 onlookers Friday morning, essentially declaring the massacre a hate crime. However, the judge did not consider the killings an act of terrorism, and in his reading of the decision did not specify why.\n\nHuot spend a significant portion of his sentencing decrying a 2011 sentencing law brought in by the Harper government which forces 25-year blocks of parole eligibility per committed murder to be stacked. In order to get around this Huot amended the law to allow for another 15 years of parole ineligibility.\n\nDressed in a white shirt and navy jacket, Bissonnette, 29, who had pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and six of attempted murder, remained silent as he listened to his fate. Bissonnette will be 67 when he is first eligible for parole.\n\nOn January 29, 2017, Bissonnette walked into the the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City and opened fired on the congregation. He walked throughout the mosque and shot and killed six men and severely injured five more\u2014including one man who is now paralyzed after being shot seven times. When the firing stopped, Bissonnette fled the mosque but eventually surrendered himself to police later in the night.\n\nAlexandre Bissonnette, a suspect in a shooting at a Quebec City mosque, arrives at the court house in Quebec City on Tuesday, February 21, 2017. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Mathieu Belanger\n\nWith his guilty plea, Bissonnette received an automatic life sentence. What was up in the air on Friday was his parole eligibility. While the Crown asked the judge for 150 years (25 years for each of the six men he killed) without parole\u2014which would have been the longest sentence in Canadian history\u2014Huot said he found it unreasonable to sentence someone longer than their life expectancy and that a country needs to trust its parole system. Bissonnette\u2019s defence argued that a 150 year sentence was tantamount to sending the 29-year-old to death\u2014execution by incarceration\u2014and described it as \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d His lawyer requested 25 years, but Huot said he didn\u2019t find this reasonable either. The judge said he felt a suitable punishment would fall between 35 and 42 years without parole but was forced to choose between 25 years, which he felt was too lenient, and 50, which he felt was too excessive.\n\nShortly before announcing the sentence, the judge read out several aggravating factors which led to the punishment being longer than the minimum, such as the premeditation of the massacre, his targeting of a place of worship, the number and vulnerability of the victims, the fact their were children in the mosque at the time of the shooting, and Bissonnette\u2019s \u201cvisceral hatred\u201d of Muslims.\n\nBissonnette initially pleaded not guilty to the the charges against him for killing Azzeddine Soufiane, Aboubaker Thabti, Abdelkrim Hassane, Ibrahima Barry, Khaled Belkacemi, and Tanou Barry but reversed it to guilty in March 2018, saying he didn\u2019t want to drag the families of those he killed through a long trial. One Crown prosecutor called Bissonnette\u2019s killings \u201ca black eye, a scar on our Canadian values.\u201d\n\nJustice Huot said in his 246 page decision\u2014the reading of which lasted about six hours\u2014that the day Bissonnette walked into the mosque with a .223-calibre rifle and a 9-mm Glock pistol will be one \u201cwritten in blood.\u201d During the reading he described, in detail, how each man murdered by Bissonnette died, causing some of the family members to leave the room in tears. The judge also stated that, when speaking to a psychiatrist after the killings, Bissonnette said that he regretted not killing more people.\n\nBissonnette\u2019s murders are one of the deadliest connected to the far-right in Canada\u2019s history. Alongside an obsession with mass killers like Dylann Roof and Elliot Rodger, Bissonnette had a fixation on Muslim immigration and refugees coming to Canada. In an interview with police after the shooting, Bissonnette claimed he was protecting his family because he was scared of Canada becoming \u201clike Europe\u201d\u2014referring to the far-right idea that Europe is overrun by refugees. He was convinced there was at least one Islamist terrorist in the mosque.\n\nThese ideas were seemingly the result of spending hours on far-right websites and frequently listening to right-wing or far-right pundits like Ben Shapiro, Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars, or Tucker Carlson of Fox News, and members of what\u2019s colloquially known as the alt-right or new-right like Baked Alaska, Stefan Molyneux, and Richard Spencer. What allegedly triggered Bissonnette to take action was media coverage of Trudeau\u2019s much-maligned tweet welcoming refugees.\n\n\u201cI was listening to TV and I learned that the Canadian government was going to take more refugees, you know, who couldn\u2019t go to the United States, and they were coming here,\" Bissonnette said in the interview, according to The Globe and Mail.\n\n\u201cI saw that and I like lost my mind. I don\u2019t want us to become like Europe. I don\u2019t want them to kill my parents, my family.\u201d\n\nSign up for the VICE Canada Newsletter to get the best of VICE Canada delivered to your inbox.\n\n\n\nFollow Mack Lamoureux on Twitter."

The committee, which is now headed by Democrat Adam Schiff of California, hopes Mr. Mueller will be able to prosecute instances of perjury among some of President Donald Trump's current and former colleagues that have come under the investigation's crosshairs.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the same Committee launched a new probe into Trump's foreign business deals to determine if the President's decisions on Russia might have been influenced by his desire for personal financial gain. Trump took great umbrage at the announcement, lashing out at Schiff and calling him a, \"political hack.\" Trump has claimed that no other president has ever faced such scrutiny. Of course, there has been no other President with as many conflicts of interest as Trump.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Craig Holman, Government Affairs Lobbyist for Public Citizen."

  "text": "Special counsel Robert Mueller Robert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE\u2019s references to \u201cuncharged individuals\u201d in recent court filings that aim to restrict certain evidence are being read by some as an indication more people could be indicted in his sprawling investigation.\n\nDespite rampant speculation that Mueller is close to finalizing his report, the language used in court documents over the past few months offers clues that suggest his probe might ensnare more individuals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe latest example came last week, when Mueller said sensitive files in the case involving a Russian troll farm identified \u201cuncharged individuals\u201d suspected of engaging in operations \u201cthat interfere with lawful U.S. government functions.\u201d Mueller\u2019s filing sought to keep the evidence restricted from defendants in Russia.\n\nHe has also referenced \u201cuncharged individuals\u201d and \u201congoing investigations\u201d in the case involving former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortTrump: 'The collusion delusion is over' Five things to watch at Trump's Michigan rally Trump: I don't want to talk about pardons now MORE.\n\nLegal analysts say those moves indicate federal prosecutors are investigating other subjects linked to the troll farm and Manafort cases who could ultimately be charged if government attorneys obtain evidence of criminal wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThat implies they\u2019re still working to indict somebody,\u201d said Jack Sharman, who was a special counsel to Congress for the Whitewater investigation during the 1990s. \u201cIt also may essentially mean that they want to keep their methods and their approach held close to the vest until they are done with this defendant.\u201d\n\nMany are hoping Mueller\u2019s report \u2014 slated for submission to the Justice Department at the conclusion of the probe \u2014 will answer the central question of whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nBut the timing of the report is an open question.\n\nLast February, Mueller charged 13 Russians and three Russian firms with conspiracy to defraud the United States. The Russians allegedly ran the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm that used social media to serve divisive content to U.S. audiences before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTwo Washington-based lawyers are now defending the alleged funder of the troll operation, Concord Management and Consulting, in D.C. federal court. Some court watchers suspect that development is an effort by Russia to obtain sensitive discovery documents from the U.S. government.\n\nMueller last week objected to the company\u2019s request that \u201csensitive\u201d discovery files be disclosed to its employees for the purpose of trial preparation, and in doing so he revealed that some evidence had already been used in an apparent disinformation campaign to discredit the investigation.\n\nThe special counsel also wrote that lifting restrictions on the files \u2014 currently subject to a protective order issued by a federal judge in June \u2014 would expose information about \u201cuncharged individuals and entities\u201d suspected of engaging in operations \u201clike those activities charged in the indictment.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSecond, information within the sensitive discovery identifies sources, methods, and techniques used to identify the foreign actors behind these interference operations,\u201d Mueller wrote.\n\nIn a January filing, he also acknowledged an active grand jury probe tied to that case.\n\n\u201cMy hunch is that we are going to see more indictments of Russians,\u201d said Glenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe special counsel has charged more than two dozen Russians and six Trump associates in connection with the investigation. Mueller has separately indicted a dozen Russian intelligence officers for allegedly hacking the Democratic National Committee and U.S. election infrastructure.\n\nNone of the charges have alleged any conspiracy involving both the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\n\nIn Manafort\u2019s case, Mueller last month asked for permission to redact certain evidence regarding the former Trump aide\u2019s alleged lies to federal officials, noting that \u201cthe redactions relate to ongoing law enforcement investigations or uncharged individuals, and public disclosure of certain information in the submission could unduly risk harming those efforts.\u201d\n\nManafort pleaded guilty last year to charges stemming from his Ukraine lobbying work and agreed to cooperate in the probe. Mueller later accused him of lying to investigators in breach of his plea deal. Manafort has contested that allegation.\n\nIt is possible that the reference to potential targets in Manafort\u2019s case falls out of the scope of Mueller\u2019s investigation. Manafort is accused of lying about an unknown Justice Department probe run out of another district, and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are said to be investigating other lobbying firms that did work for Manafort, though it is unclear whether Manafort has cooperated with that inquiry.\n\nWhile Mueller appears to be investigating unnamed potential targets, that does not guarantee future charges.\n\n\u201cI think that oftentimes in a federal criminal investigation, things just get left,\u201d Sharman said. \u201cIn other words, they simply don\u2019t get acted upon because prosecutors decide there is not enough probable cause or there is a strategic reason for not moving things forward.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment for this story.\n\nMueller has faced mounting pressure from the White House to wrap up his investigation, which is also said to be exploring whether Trump has obstructed the probe. The president has maintained his campaign did not collude with Russia and regularly derides the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nLast month Mueller unveiled charges against longtime Trump ally Roger Stone Roger Jason StoneTrump: 'The collusion delusion is over' Fox's Tucker Carlson attacks CNN: 'It's a super PAC' Tucker Carlson: Flynn, Papadopoulos, Stone deserve pardons 'now' MORE for allegedly lying to the House Intelligence Committee about his interactions regarding WikiLeaks, the organization that disseminated troves of Democratic emails before the election, with U.S. intelligence agencies later saying Russia was responsible for obtaining the hacked documents. Stone, who has pleaded not guilty, is also charged with witness tampering and obstructing a congressional investigation.\n\nDays later, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said he believed the Mueller investigation to be \u201cclose\u201d to completion. Some have questioned that assertion.\n\n\u201cAll outward signs \u2026 suggest that Mueller\u2019s investigation is still active and ongoing,\u201d said Randall Eliason, a George Washington University law professor. \u201cI think there is reason to believe something else is coming.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see any outward signs this investigation is close to wrapping up,\u201d added Eliason, a former assistant U.S. attorney in D.C.\n\nThe Justice Department said they obtained a significant amount of electronic evidence in searches of Stone\u2019s residences, and prosecutors recently requested more time to bring the case to trial. Mueller and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in D.C. are jointly handling Stone\u2019s case.\n\nMueller is also locked in at least two subpoena battles with witnesses, including a mystery foreign government-owned company that is petitioning to take the case to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn addition, Mueller has repeatedly sought to delay former Trump campaign aide Richard Gates\u2019s sentencing, citing his cooperation with several ongoing investigations.\n\nFurthermore, a federal court in D.C. extended Mueller\u2019s grand jury before it expired in January. A grand jury can be extended for up to six months, though there was no timeline given with the extension.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can draw from that alone that there\u2019s six months\u2019 worth of additional investigating to be done,\u201d said Kirschner. \u201cIt could be that he\u2019s got 30 days\u2019 worth.\u201d"

  "text": "President Trump called Democratic investigations into his administration and business \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cpresidential harassment.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in turn accused the president of delivering an \u201call-out threat\u201d to lawmakers sworn to provide a check and balance on his power.\n\nThe oversight wars officially kicked into high gear this week as House Democrats began investigating the Trump administration in earnest. With Thursday hearings scheduled on presidential tax returns and family separations at the Mexican border, and a Friday session to question acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker, the lights are about to shine brightly on a president who had faced little examination from a Republican Congress.\n\nBut Democrats are moving carefully after spending weeks forming their committees, hiring staff and laying the groundwork for coming probes \u2014 mindful that Trump is eager to turn their investigations into a political boomerang as his critics demand swift action to uncover various alleged misdeeds.\n\nIn his State of the Union address Tuesday, Trump lambasted \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d and built a case that undue Democratic oversight would impede progress for the American people.\n\n\u201cIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\nPelosi (D-Calif.) reacted sharply to Trump\u2019s insinuation that there could be no progress on legislation while lawmakers pry open the doors of his administration.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump, in front of Vice President Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday before members of Congress in the House chamber. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cPresidents should not bring threats to the floor of the House,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not investigation; it\u2019s oversight. It\u2019s our congressional responsibility, and if we didn\u2019t do it, we would be delinquent in our duties.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump dismissed a new probe launched by the House Intelligence Committee into his foreign business entanglements, calling its chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), a \u201cpolitical hack.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo other politician has to go through that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s called presidential harassment. And it\u2019s unfortunate. And it really does hurt our country.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats show no sign of being cowed by Trump, leaders are trying to walk a deliberate line \u2014 wary of being seen as haphazardly tilting at presidential windmills or being too timid in uncovering potential misdeeds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our homework first,\u201d said House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), whose panel is scheduled to receive testimony from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross next month. \u201cWhat [Republicans] would do is, they would go out and make headlines a week or two before the hearing and then look for some facts to prove the headlines. We\u2019re not doing that.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s hearings offer a snapshot into the different approaches committees could ultimately take as they plumb the Trump orbit.\n\nOn Thursday, a House Ways and Means subcommittee is set to examine the disclosure of presidential tax returns \u2014 a subject clearly aimed at Trump\u2019s failure to disclose his own returns.\n\nWhile Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) is empowered under federal law to inspect any federal tax return, he has not yet moved to invoke that authority and request Trump\u2019s returns \u2014 citing the need to build a factual record justifying the request in the expectation that Trump will sue to block it.\n\nThe hearing, Democratic aides say, is part of the effort to build that record, but it has frustrated some lawmakers and activists who believe Trump will resist the request whether it comes sooner or later.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have a legal fight about it, better to start sooner rather than later,\u201d said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), reflecting a pervasive sentiment among many Democrats.\n\nBut Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.), another Ways and Means member who has spearheaded the effort to publicize Trump\u2019s taxes, said it was prudent to move deliberately to avoid the perception of a politically tainted process. He said he expected Neal to request the returns \u201cwithin the next two or three months or sooner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis needs to be done methodically,\u201d he said. \u201cThere cannot be an ounce of \u2018let\u2019s go get him.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA House Democratic leadership aide said the go-slow approach on the tax returns was part of a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to investigating Trump\u2019s finances \u2014 one that involves not only Ways and Means but also at least five other House committees.\n\n\u201cThe tax returns are only one evidentiary piece of the larger puzzle about Trump\u2019s finances,\u201d said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy. \u201cIn the end, we\u2019ll likely need greater visibility into his finances beyond his tax returns to get the American people the answers they deserve.\u201d\n\nA White House spokesman declined to comment on the potential request for Trump\u2019s tax returns or the larger spate of House oversight requests. A department spokesman said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u201cwill review any request with the Treasury general counsel for legality.\u201d\n\nBut other Republicans were not shy about criticizing Democrats and preemptively accusing them of overreaching.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called the effort \u201cpolitical\u201d Wednesday and urged Neal and Democrats to focus on strengthening the economy. Rep. Kevin Brady (Tex.), the top Ways and Means Republican, said it would be an \u201cabuse of power in weaponizing the tax code to seek any individual\u2019s private taxpayer returns\u201d and publicize them.\n\nThe comments ignored the multiple investigations by Republicans into the Obama administration and the hours of testimony from Hillary Clinton before her presidential bid.\n\nOther Democratic investigators are adopting more-aggressive tactics. In one sign of potential conflict, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) plans to have his panel preapprove a potential subpoena on Thursday for Whitaker, who is set to voluntarily give testimony Friday.\n\nNadler said in a statement that the subpoena was being arranged out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d to prevent Whitaker from improperly refusing to answer questions at Friday\u2019s hearing, in which Democrats are expected to ask questions about the irregular circumstances that led to Whitaker\u2019s appointment as former attorney general Jeff Sessions\u2019s replacement.\n\nMeanwhile, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) last week publicly threatened to issue a subpoena for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen if she did not agree to testify voluntarily.

  ],
  "text": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Tuesday that she was sorry that she identified herself as a Native American for almost two decades, reflecting her ongoing struggle to quiet a controversy that continues to haunt her as she prepares to formally announce a presidential bid.\n\nHer comments more fully explain the regret she expressed last week to the chief of the Cherokee Nation, the first time she\u2019s said she was sorry for claiming American Indian heritage.\n\nThe private apology was earlier reported as focusing more narrowly on a DNA test she took to demonstrate her purported heritage, a move that prompted a ferocious backlash even from many allies. Warren will be vying to lead a party that has become far more mindful of nonwhite voters and their objections to misuse of their culture.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go back,\u201d Warren said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cBut I am sorry for furthering confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and harm that resulted.\u201d\n\nWarren has been trying for the past year to get past the lingering controversy over her past assertion that she is Native American.\n\nIn addition to the DNA test, she released employment documents over the summer to show she didn\u2019t use ethnicity to further her career. And in a speech a year ago she addressed her decision to call herself a Native American, though she didn\u2019t offer the apology that some wanted at the time.\n\nBut as Warren undergoes increased scrutiny as a presidential candidate, additional documents could surface to keep the issue alive.\n\nUsing an open records request during a general inquiry, for example, The Post obtained Warren\u2019s registration card for the State Bar of Texas, providing a previously undisclosed example of Warren identifying as an \u201cAmerican Indian.\u201d\n\nWarren filled out the card by hand in neat blue ink and signed it. Dated April 1986, it is the first document to surface showing Warren making the claim in her own handwriting. Her office didn\u2019t dispute its authenticity.\n\nFor Warren, putting this chapter behind her is key to calming the nerves of Democrats who want a nominee who can move beyond any problems in their past and present a strong challenge to President Trump.\n\nFor the Democratic electorate, roiled by Trump\u2019s racially insensitive comments, it\u2019s become more important for a Democratic standard-bearer to show an understanding of issues related to race and identity.\n\nThe nascent 2020 Democratic field is already the most diverse in history, with two black senators, five women, a gay man and an Asian entrepreneur among the announced or potential candidates.\n\nNonwhite voters have a significant voice in the Democratic primaries. Blacks made up 25 percent of the electorate in the 2016 Democratic primary, according to exit polls. Hispanics made up 7 percent, but that rose to 19 percent in Nevada, a critical early primary state.\n\nIt was previously reported that Warren called Bill John Baker, the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, and apologized for sharing the results of a DNA test which showed she had a distant relative who was Native American.\n\nJulie Hubbard, a spokeswoman for the Cherokee Nation, declined to address the scope of the conversation between Warren and the chief.\n\nWarren, asked in a brief interview Tuesday if she\u2019d intended the apology to include labeling herself as Native American when at the University of Pennsylvania and at Harvard University, replied \u201cyes.\u201d She gave the same response when asked if it included labeling herself as a minority in the Association of American Law Schools directory.\n\n\u201cI told him I was sorry for furthering confusion about tribal citizenship,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI am also sorry for not being more mindful about this decades ago. We had a good conversation.\u201d CNN reported her broader apology on Monday.\n\nThe apology has met with mixed reactions. Several tribal members applauded her. \u201cThis closes the matter,\u201d tweeted Keith Harper, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council. \u201cOnward.\u201d\n\nBut not all were pleased.\n\n\u201cI want to see it in writing,\u201d said David Cornsilk, a historian and genealogist who is also a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. \u201cI want her to go on national TV. I want her to do a video like she did to announce her DNA results. It just seemed very lacking.\u201d\n\nIn October, Warren released the DNA results showing she had a Native American ancestor six to 10 generations ago. The move backfired, with Cherokee leaders outraged that she used the test to show any connection to the tribe, a process they control. It also dredged up uncomfortable issues about defining race via bloodlines.\n\nThe test was an attempt to quell the criticism \u2014 and occasional mockery \u2014 she\u2019s faced for years. President Trump has frequently called her \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Allies of former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown, whom Warren ousted in 2012, referred to her as \u201cFauxcahontas.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have charged that Warren claimed Indian ancestry to advance her career, though an investigation by the Boston Globe showed that Warren was considered a white woman when hired as a law professor by the University of Pennsylvania and then by Harvard University.\n\nThe Texas bar registration card is significant, among other reasons, because it removes any doubt that Warren directly claimed the identity. In other instances Warren has declined to say whether she or an assistant filled out forms.\n\nThe card shows her name, her gender and the address for the University of Texas law school in Austin, where she was working at the time.\n\nOn the line for \u201crace,\u201d Warren neatly printed, \u201cAmerican Indian.\u201d She left blank lines for \u201cNational Origin\u201d and \u201cPhysical handicap\u201d and signed the document.\n\n\u201cShe is sorry that she was not more mindful of this earlier in her career,\u201d said Kristen Orthman, a Warren campaign spokeswoman.\n\nWarren filled out the card after being admitted to the Texas bar. Warren was doing legal work on the side, but nothing that required bar admission in the state, according to her campaign.\n\nThe date coincided with her first listing as a \u201cminority\u201d by the Association of American Law Schools. Warren reported herself as minority in the directory every year starting in 1986 \u2014 when AALS first included a list of minority law professors \u2014 to 1995, when her name dropped off the list.\n\nWarren also had her ethnicity changed from white to Native American in December 1989 while working at the University of Pennsylvania. The change came two years after she was hired there.\n\nSeveral months after Warren started working at Harvard Law School in 1995, she okayed listing her ethnicity as Native American. Harvard listed Warren as Native American in its federal affirmative action forms from 1995 to 2004, records show.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication Warren had anything to gain by reporting herself as Native American on the Texas bar card. Above the lines for race, national origin and handicap status, the card says, \u201cThe following information is for statistical purposes only and will not be disclosed to any person or organization without the express written consent of the attorney.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Warren\u2019s candidate financial disclosure report was released Tuesday showing that she and her husband have a net worth between $5.2 million and $9.1 million, in line with other reports of her wealth.\n\nWarren, who made a career in academia with research on how debt leads to personal bankruptcy, reported no mortgage on homes in Cambridge, Mass., and Washington. The couple also reported no credit card debt.\n\nAnu Narayanswamy contributed to this report."

Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault has retained the Washington law firm that represented Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of assaulting her when the two were in high school.\n\nA source close to the legal team for Fairfax\u2019s accuser confirmed Tuesday that she has hired Katz, Marshall and Banks, a law firm that lists sexual harassment law as one of its areas of expertise. The source said the woman is consulting with her legal team about next steps and that her team will have more to say later Tuesday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNPR first reported the hiring.\n\nThe allegation against Fairfax stems from a sexual encounter in a Boston hotel room in 2004 that both parties have acknowledged took place. It first surfaced Sunday on the right-wing website Big League Politics in the form of a cryptic Facebook post by the woman.\n\nFairfax has fiercely denied the accusations, insisting that the encounter was consensual and calling the allegation an \u201cuncorroborated smear.\u201d He\u2019s also questioned the timing of the accusation and who is pushing it because his profile has risen dramatically in recent days amid the controversy surrounding a medical-school yearbook photo, also published by Big League Politics, that appears to show Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam either in blackface or wearing Ku Klux Klan robes.\n\nNortham has denied that he is in the photo, but has admitted to wearing blackface as part of a Michael Jackson costume at a 1984 talent show. The controversy has prompted widespread calls for Northam\u2019s resignation, a step that would elevate Fairfax to the governorship.\n\nLike Fairfax, Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations against him when they surfaced last fall amid his Senate confirmation process. Ford, a California professor, wound up testifying about her allegations before the Senate Judiciary Committee, as did Kavanaugh.\n\nFairfax has defended himself in part by pointing out that the woman took her accusation to The Washington Post before his inauguration last year and that the newspaper, after looking into the claims, did not publish them.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/3856/1155968404_5999305016001_5984636044001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThe Post on Monday acknowledged investigating the woman\u2019s claims as Fairfax said, but said he \u201cincorrectly\u201d stated they found \u201csignificant red flags and inconsistencies within the allegations.\u201d\n\nInstead, the Post found that \u201cFairfax and the woman told different versions of what happened in the hotel room with no one else present.\u201d The newspaper said it \u201ccould not find anyone who could corroborate either version.\u201d\n\nIn an article published Monday detailing the woman\u2019s account, the Post also said it \u201cfound no similar complaints of sexual misconduct against\u201d Fairfax and that the woman had not told anyone about the alleged assault until shortly before she came forward in November 2017 and January 2018. As a result, they initially declined to publish the woman\u2019s account until Monday."

The Southern Poverty Law Center filled the suit in January to address the fact that about 10,000 undocumented children are being held in detention and, it appears that the federal government is delaying their release in order to lure in sponsors to come forward. If sponsors are found to be undocumented themselves, they are often arrested and entered into deportation proceedings.\n\n\n\nIn its complaint, SPLC said, \"As revealed by a recently leaked memorandum, the Trump administration decided to deter illegal immigration by enacting a policy to use detained immigrant children as bait to arrest immigrants who come forward to sponsor them, even while explicitly acknowledging that this would prolong the detention of immigrant children. To do this, they twisted the sponsorship process from its Congressionally mandated purpose of ensuring children\u2019s safety while placing them in the least restrictive setting as quickly as possible, introducing steps counterproductive to that goal that were instead designed to facilitate civil immigration enforcement against sponsors.\""

However, on Saturday, he reversed course and claimed neither of the men in the racist yearbook photo was him as he initially thought. As Northam resisted growing calls for his resignation, he admitted to a separate instance of blackface: darkening his face to imitate Michael Jackson in a 1984 dance contest. Meanwhile, a separate 1981 yearbook from the Virginia Military Institute has surfaced revealing Northam was known by the racist nickname \u201cCoonman\u201d as an undergraduate student there.

  "text": "Washington (CNN) Recent Trump administration moves on civil rights bring into sharper focus its efforts to reverse the Obama era and curtail decades-old laws designed to shield blacks, Latinos and other racial minorities from discrimination.\n\nLast week, the Justice Department retreated from a prior position and said Texas' record of voter discrimination did not justify requiring prior approval for any new redistricting maps. The Obama administration had argued that a provision of the Voting Rights Act empowering judges to intervene should cover Texas, which has been mired in minority-voter disputes for years.\n\nThe administration is also apparently considering retrenchment against policies that appear neutral but have the effect of discriminating against minorities. In December, a federal commission convened by the White House recommended the rescission of Obama policy intended to ensure that African-American students are not disproportionately targeted under school discipline rules.\n\nThe Washington Post reported in January that the administration is considering a \"far-reaching\" curtailment of such regulations against practices that -- although not intentionally discriminatory -- have a \"disparate impact\" on minorities, whether at schools, on the job, or in the pursuit of housing. (The Justice Department would not comment on the report.)\n\nAt the same time, the administration is also engaged in a lawsuit against Harvard's affirmative action admissions practices that have traditionally benefited blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. It is siding with a group that says Asian-American applicants are held to a higher standard for admissions, compared especially to black students.\n\nAll told, the Trump team continues to demonstrate that despite an atmosphere of disarray, its lawyers have kept a singular focus on transforming racial-bias laws -- alarming civil rights activists and gratifying veteran conservative advocates.\n\n\"Since the 1960s, when these major laws were first enacted, we've never seen an administration so intensely focused on dismantling civil rights protections across the board,\" Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said Friday.\n\n\"They have been more effective so far than two Bush administrations,\" said Roger Clegg, president and general counsel of the Virginia-based Center for Equal Opportunity, who supports the Trump agenda and has advocated for reversal of racial policies since the early 1980s.\n\nTrump's lawyers, to be sure, are proceeding as previous Republican administrations have, but their efforts are more concentrated and likely emboldened by the newly solidified conservative Supreme Court.\n\nIn a case involving the Fair Housing Act of 1968, for example, the justices in 2015 endorsed litigation against mortgage lending and other practices that, despite no proof of intentional bias, disproportionately hurt minority homeowners. The case was decided by a single vote, that of Justice Anthony Kennedy (who joined the court's four liberal justices) and who retired last summer to be succeeded by Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe policy reversals arise in the context of a president known for his racially charged rhetoric, for example, disparaging a \"Mexican judge\" who ruled against Trump University in 2016 and declaring in August 2017 that \"very fine people\" were among the white supremacist mobs that descended on Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\"This administration is more likely to be accused of having bad racial motives than other Republican administrations,\" said Clegg, who argues that classifying people by race, even to enhance diversity or provide other benefits, is \"bad for the country.\"\n\nNarrowing the reach of the Voting Rights Act\n\nThis week's filing in the Texas redistricting battle adds to a pattern of actions attempting to restrict the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Soon after Trump took office in 2017, the administration withdrew the US government's opposition to a Texas voter identification law and an Ohio voter-roll purge law, both of which challengers contended would make it more difficult for minorities and poor people to vote.\n\nThe Ohio dispute, Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, went to the Supreme Court last year, and the justices, by a 5-4 vote, upheld the law that allows voters' names to be eliminated under a process that begins when a person fails to cast a ballot for two years.\n\nOhio officials said the law would help keep voter rolls up to date. Once a person fails to vote for two years, the state sends a postcard asking for verification that the voter is still at the same address. People who do not return the pre-paid card and then fail to vote for four more years are removed from the rolls.\n\nThe Obama administration had objected to the Ohio statute, just as it had weighed in against Texas in a protracted dispute over voting-district lines and whether Texas should be subject to federal oversight for new maps.\n\nIn the newest chapter, Latino and African-American advocates have asked a three-judge federal panel in San Antonio to require Texas to submit for pre-approval any statewide redistricting plans enacted for the next decennial redistricting cycle.\n\n\"This litigation ... has made it abundantly clear that absent some form of federal oversight and pre-enforcement review under the Voting Rights Act, minority voters in Texas will once again be confronted with ... persistent systemic racial discrimination,\" the advocates contend, seeking judicial supervision under so-called Section 3 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nTexas had previously been covered by a Voting Rights Act Section 5 preclearance rule, but in the 2013 case of Shelby County v. Holder the Supreme Court struck down the Section 5 formula, freeing Texas and other designated jurisdictions with a history of discrimination from a mandate that they obtain federal approval for any proposed electoral changes.\n\nThe Justice Department contends that Section 3 coverage cannot be justified because Texas has alleviated past voter discrimination. Explaining its reversal of Obama DOJ sentiment, the Trump administration said federal court decisions favoring Texas, including at the Supreme Court last June, contradict the challengers' assertions of voter discrimination.\n\nDOJ spokeswoman Kelly Laco defended the switch on Friday, contending, \"There is currently no reason to subject Texas to federal court oversight.\" More broadly, she added \"the Justice Department remains committed to enforcing the law and protecting all Americans from all forms of illegal race-discrimination.\"\n\nBut the Latino and African-American voter advocates note that the next round of redistricting will be the first since the Shelby County v. Holder decision lifting the preclearance rule and warn that unless judges can intervene, Texas would be able to redraw state legislative and congressional lines \"without any up-front, comprehensive federal oversight.\"\n\nAustin lawyer Renea Hicks, representing some of the Texas plaintiffs, said of the new DOJ approach, \"It's not just a retreat in the present from fair enforcement of the [Voting Rights Act]. I believe that they're actually looking toward the future. They are giving states freer rein than they have had since enactment of the Voting Rights Act to aggressively gerrymander against the interests of minority voters.\"\n\nHe added, \"Any active protection of minority rights will be left to the local level and piecemeal, battle by battle, slow-paced litigation.\""

But some of this year\u2019s marches were steeped in controversy. In November, Teresa Shook, one of the founders of the Women\u2019s March movement, called for the removal of the four national co-chairs: Bob Bland, Tamika Mallory, Carmen Perez and Linda Sarsour. She accused them of allowing \u201canti-Semitism, anti-LBGTQIA sentiment and hateful, racist rhetoric to become a part of the platform.\u201d Much of the criticism focused on links between some of the co-chairs and the Nation of Islam\u2019s Minister Louis Farrakhan, who has been widely accused of being anti-Semitic. A new documentary premiering at the Sundance Film Festival captures how Mallory and the movement handled the crisis. It\u2019s called \u201cThis Is Personal.\u201d On Monday, Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour joined Rebecca Walker, author of the autobiography \u201cBlack, White, and Jewish,\u201d and Nancy Kaufman, CEO of the National Council of Jewish Women, to discuss the controversy."

Woodard portrays prison warden Bernadine Williams as she prepares to oversee what would be her 12th execution as warden in the aftermath of one that was horribly botched. As her life seems to unravel, Williams, for the first time, grapples with what it means to be part of a system of state-sanctioned murder, as the execution date for Anthony Woods, played by Aldis Hodge, gets closer. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. DN! speaks with Nigerian-American writer-director Chinonye Chukwu, who says she was inspired to take on the subject after the execution of Troy Anthony Davis, who was put to death by the state of Georgia on September 21, 2011. Davis\u2019s execution was carried out despite major doubts about evidence used to convict him of killing police officer Mark MacPhail, and his death helped fuel the national movement to abolish the death penalty."

  "authors": [
    "Rebecca Buck"
  ],
  "text": "(CNN) Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat who rose to prominence as Newark's charismatic and ambitious mayor, announced Friday that he is running for president.\n\nBooker chose the first day of Black History Month to launch his campaign, timing that nods to Booker's own heritage and suggests he will put it at the center of his pitch to voters.\n\n\"The history of our nation is defined by collective action; by interwoven destinies of slaves and abolitionists; of those born here and those who chose America as home; of those who took up arms to defend our country, and those who linked arms to challenge and change it,\" Booker narrates in a video released on Friday morning, which features him walking through his Newark neighborhood.\n\n\"I'm Cory Booker and I'm running for president of the United States of America,\" he says in the video.\n\nBooker joins a crowded and growing Democratic field that is already the most diverse in history -- with multiple women, one gay candidate, a Latino and, with Booker now in the mix, two black candidates.\n\nHis announcement comes nearly a year to the day from the Iowa caucuses and the start of the primary calendar. Booker plans to head to Iowa February 8-9 and then to South Carolina on February 10. He also intends to visit New Hampshire over Presidents Day weekend.\n\nBooker is one of several senators running for president or seriously considering it. At 49, he is the youngest among his Senate colleagues in the race. His age is not all that sets him apart: Booker is unmarried and vegan, two unique qualities among the emerging Democratic field.\n\nIn his announcement video, Booker also notes that he is \"the only senator who goes home to a low-income, inner city community\" in Newark, \"the first community that took a chance on me.\"\n\nIn the Senate, Booker has at times favored a pragmatic approach, teaming up with like-minded Republicans on issues like criminal justice. But he has also emerged as a passionate interrogator of President Donald Trump's nominees -- including Justice Brett Kavanaugh, at whose confirmation hearing Booker memorably unloaded in a heated \"Spartacus moment.\"\n\nPublic polling suggests Booker is unknown to many Americans. But in a field where there is no clear front-runner, he brings a raw political talent that some Democrats believe could make him a powerful contender.\n\nThe campaign message of Booker, who's a gifted orator on the stump, will center on his signature themes of finding \"common purpose\" and a bringing about a \"revival of civic grace\" in American society, drawing a stark, if implicit, contrast with President Donald Trump's harsh rhetoric.\n\nWhile Booker has been reluctant to attack the President directly, not wanting to emulate his tactics, Trump has not hesitated to target the senator -- saying during a White House event in October that Booker \"ran Newark, New Jersey, into the ground.\"\n\nIt's unclear how Booker's record as mayor will play in the Democratic primary or beyond. Critics say Booker did not meet his lofty promises to reshape the city, with some progressives faulting his support for school choice, among other issues. But Booker's allies believe this chapter of his story will be an asset, affording Booker some distance from Washington and demonstrating his executive chops.\n\nAs a senator, Booker has sought to sand off some of his rough political edges ahead of 2020, burnishing his progressive credentials by signing on to policies such as \"Medicare-for-all.\" Last year, he announced he would no longer accept corporate PAC money; some progressives have been skeptical of Booker for the support he has received from Wall Street donors. Booker will also oppose super PACS supporting his candidacy or others.\n\nReflecting its central place in Booker's story, Newark will be the headquarters for his campaign. Logistically, that home base will offer the candidate and his team easy access to the power hubs of Washington and New York, plus proximity to three major airports to facilitate travel to key primary states and fundraising hotspots around the country.\n\nHis campaign manager will be Addisu Demissie, a veteran of Booker's 2013 Senate race, who most recently ran Gavin Newsom's successful bid for California governor. Demissie also boasts experience on the ground in Iowa, having cut his teeth as a field organizer for John Kerry's 2004 caucus campaign, returning in the 2008 cycle on behalf of Hillary Clinton.\n\nOther top campaign officials announced Friday include Jenna Lowenstein, who formerly ran Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy's 2018 re-election campaign, as deputy campaign manager; Booker's Senate chief of staff Matt Klapper as senior adviser; and Modia Butler, a longtime Booker adviser dating back to his days in Newark, as senior strategist.\n\nBooker's path to the nomination would almost certainly run through South Carolina, where African-American voters compose a majority of the Democratic primary electorate. But Booker has also aggressively cultivated a network in Iowa, recognizing that a strong performance there would build valuable momentum for later contests.\n\nTo steer his Iowa operation, Booker has already lined up a team of sought-after operatives: Michael Frosolone, who led Iowa Democrats' statehouse campaigns in 2018; Joe O'Hern, who ran the Democratic coordinated campaign in Ohio during the midterms and oversaw Martin O'Malley's 2016 caucus efforts; Haley Hager, most recently the Iowa director for Tom Steyer's NextGen group targeting young voters; and Tess Seger, outgoing communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party.\n\nComparisons to Obama\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is Cory Booker? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is Cory Booker? 01:18\n\nBorn in 1969 in Washington, Booker enjoyed a comfortable upbringing in the post-civil rights era, a lot he ascribes to a \"conspiracy of love\" that enabled his parents to break barriers. Cary and Carolyn Booker were among the earliest black executives at IBM and, because of anti-discrimination laws, they were able to buy a home and raise their children in the affluent, mostly white community of Harrington Park, New Jersey.\n\nBooker attended Stanford as a star football recruit, playing for four years but, by his own admission, never breaking through at the college level. Booker's interests were broad, however: He also served as student body president and ran a crisis hotline for students. He would go on to attend Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and later graduate from Yale Law School.\n\nWith an elite law degree in hand, Booker bypassed more lucrative opportunities and moved into an affordable housing complex in one of Newark's poorest neighborhoods, planning to lend his skills to a nonprofit. He soon turned to local politics, however, unseating a longtime incumbent on the City Council.\n\nIn 2002, Booker once again took on an uphill political battle, mounting a challenge to Newark Mayor Sharpe James, an avatar of old-school political corruption. Although Booker fell short by a few thousand votes, he won in losing -- becoming a media and political darling in the process.\n\nFour years later, Booker ran again and won, cementing his status as a rising star in the Democratic Party.\n\nAs a talented and ambitious black politician, Booker has elicited predictable comparisons to former President Barack Obama, whom he endorsed during the 2008 primary and campaigned for in 2012.\n\nBooker has acknowledged the trope and jokes about it, but he doesn't neatly fit the mold. Whereas Obama often was guarded and serious, Booker is an extrovert whose unbridled enthusiasm and brimming energy can seem almost comical.\n\nBooker also did not take the express lane to a presidential bid, as Obama did. Instead, he served nearly eight years as mayor, passing on an opportunity to lead Obama's Office of Urban Affairs in 2009, before successfully running for Senate in 2013 in a special election following the death of Sen. Frank Lautenberg.\n\nBooker will be up for re-election in New Jersey in 2020; state law would permit him to run for Senate and president simultaneously.\n\nBooker's core message has remained consistent over many years in politics -- with a focus on love and unity that undergirds everything else.\n\nIn some ways, Booker is a political heir to former President Jimmy Carter, who in the aftermath of the Nixon administration pledged a government \"as good and honest and decent and compassionate and filled with love as are the American people.\" Booker recently described Carter as a \"moral (giant) in America\" and a model for \"what I want my message to be in leadership.\" Carter, for his part, had urged Booker to run for president.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris of California, who seems poised to be one of Booker's chief rivals, also embraced some of Carter's signature themes in her debut rally last week, repeatedly invoking the Carter-esque term \"truth.\"\n\nBut Booker makes a distinctly emotional appeal, with soaring, often sermon-like oratory. Last year, he said he doesn't know if he has tapped into \"a winning political message or not, but I will always be talking about trying to unify this country, trying to bring us together.\"\n\nAnd he has not been cowed by steep political odds before.\n\n\"He's a person who operates between instincts, gut and faith,\" said Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat who's the most recent former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. \"What he did when he decided to take on an incumbent mayor, I think he's driven more by faith and purpose than politics.\""

But some of this year\u2019s marches were steeped in controversy.

  "authors": [

    "Gerald S. Dickinson Is A Constitutional Law",
    "Property Professor At The University Of Pittsburgh School Of Law."
  ],
  "text": "Gerald S. Dickinson is a constitutional law and property professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.\n\nWith the federal government now reopened, President Trump is threatening to invoke the National Emergencies Act as a lever to find money for the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 a policy that Congress very clearly does not support. Soon after announcing Friday that he would sign legislation to fund the government for three weeks, Trump declared, \u201cIf I don\u2019t get a fair deal from Congress \u2026 I will use the powers afforded to me \u2026 to address this emergency.\u201d He says he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to declare a national emergency and order the military to build the wall to stop the threat of \u201cillegal immigration\u201d in the country. But the real threat is the specter of a sitting president wielding emergency powers to implement a public policy he can\u2019t persuade Congress, let alone the public, to support. The law Trump is threatening to use was never meant to allow something like this.\n\nThroughout the mid-1970s, Congress debated whether to terminate certain authorities given to the president to declare a national emergency. In particular, U.S. involvement in Vietnam and Cambodia piqued the interest of several members of Congress, who demanded a special study of the consequences of terminating a 1950 national emergency proclamation regarding the Vietnam War. At the time, the nation had technically been under a state of emergency for more than 40 years. Those emergency powers were extraordinary: The president could, among other things, restrict travel, seize property, organize and control the means of production and assign military forces abroad.\n\nFor example, Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a national emergency to combat the Great Depression days after he took office. Harry S. Truman attempted to seize steel mills amid a strike during the Korean War. Richard Nixon invoked the power amid a postal workers' strike. A year later, Nixon declared a national emergency again to impose controls on foreign trade. Although Truman\u2019s exercise of the emergency power was thwarted by the Supreme Court in Youngstown Steel v. Sawyer, the substance of the majority and concurring opinions offer useful insight into today\u2019s debate about circumventing Congress to achieve a policy goal.\n\n[I voted for Trump. Now his wall may destroy my butterfly paradise.]\n\nJustice Robert Jackson, for example, wrote an extraordinary concurring opinion in Youngstown. He looked to history as a road map for why restraints on executive emergencies powers were crucial to our constitutional republic. Germany\u2019s Weimar constitution, Jackson wrote, was designed to secure civil liberties in the Western tradition, yet \u201cthe President of the Republic, without concurrence of the Reichstag, was empowered temporarily to suspend any or all individual rights if public safety and order were seriously disturbed or endangered \u2026 in 13 years suspension of rights was invoked on more than 250 occasions. Finally, Hitler persuaded President von Hindenburg to suspend all such rights, and they were never restored. \u2026\u201d\n\nLikewise, Jackson noted that Britain went through both world wars under a \u201csort of temporary dictatorship created by legislation.\u201d This, some argued, was the \u201chigh-water mark in the voluntary surrender of liberty.\u201d But as Winston Churchill noted, the parliamentary regime \u201cstands custodian of these surrendered liberties, and its most sacred duty will be to restore them in their fullness when victory has crowned our exertions and our perseverance.\u201d In other words, Jackson was comforted by \u201cparliamentary controls [that] made emergency powers compatible with freedom . . . only when control [of emergency powers] is lodged elsewhere than in the Executive who exercises them.\u201d\n\nEven the French Republic, which operated under a similar emergency regime called the \u201cstate of siege,\u201d was cited as an example of why executive restraints are necessary. Jackson noted that the French had essentially secured limitations in that the emergency powers \u201ccould not be assumed at will by the Executive\u201d but, instead, permitted only by parliamentary action.\n\nTo temper the potentially dictatorial powers available to the president, Congress stepped in to enact the National Emergencies Act to ensure that proper safeguards were in place to allow for congressional review when the president declared an emergency.\n\n[Why Congress and the courts can't let Trump declare a national emergency to build the wall]\n\nSens. Frank Church (D-Idaho) and Charles Mathias (R-Md.) were especially interested in getting the act passed as soon as possible. Their bipartisan efforts stand in sharp contrast to today\u2019s hyperpartisan political climate over the border wall fight.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) recently called for Trump to invoke the powers no matter how the shutdown was resolved. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-S.C.) said, \u201cObviously, a national emergency declaration is an option but it should be the last option used.\u201d Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) supports declaring an emergency to build an international wall simply because the \u201cUnited States code says so.\u201d\n\nAs co-chairs of the Special Committee on the Termination of National Emergencies, Church and Mathias led a bipartisan effort to study the history of national emergencies. They reported grave concerns about the powers granted to the executive before then. Their objection to granting \u201cabsolute\u201d power was founded on legitimate principles of limiting executive powers and, at the very least, giving Congress oversight authority when the president invoked the powers.\n\nIt\u2019s clear from the congressional record that Church and Mathias were acutely aware of and sought to prohibit a future president from taking advantage of the emergency powers for partisan and policy purposes. They worked for several years to persuade colleagues to insert provisions into the bill to ensure that Congress would exercise continuing oversight of any future emergencies. Although congressional testimony and legislative history is not binding law, they serve as a useful window to peer into statements made long ago by those who once debated the very law that has generated so much controversy among members from Congress \u2014 and the public \u2014 today.\n\nPerhaps most enlightening is Church\u2019s testimony during a hearing before the Committee on Government Operations on Feb. 25, 1976. There, he explained that the president \u201cshould not be allowed to invoke emergency authorities or in any way utilize the provision of [the National Emergencies Act] for frivolous or partisan matters, nor for that matter in cases where important but not \u2018essential\u2019 problems are at stake.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s threat to declare an emergency is an arguably \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cpartisan\u201d matter unconnected and unrelated to defending the country from an \u201cessential\u201d problem. Illegal immigration across the southwest border is an \u201cimportant\u201d problem to address \u2014 and Congress has already given, in the Secure Fence Act of 2006, the secretary of Homeland Security the power to take action that is \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d to secure the border with fencing and patrol. In fact, the offer from Democrats during negotiations to reopen the government to approve additional funding for border security advances prior efforts by Congress under the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nBut the situation along the border arguably does not rise, in the words of Church, to an \u201cessential\u201d problem now, nor is the construction of a physical contiguous border wall a necessary solution. (It\u2019s hard to take seriously the idea that a years-long construction project is an emergency action, if only because it wouldn\u2019t have any effect until well into the future.) Illegal crossings are at the lowest ebb since the Clinton administration. Although Trump cites migrant caravans as evidence of an emergency, those caravans are not crossing the border illegally but, rather, arriving at legal ports of entry to request asylum, as the law permits. Half of the undocumented immigrants in the United States arrive legally through airports but then overstay their visas. Likewise, there is simply no empirical evidence to suggest that thousands of terrorists are crossing the border illegally.\n\nAll this strongly suggests that threatening to invoke an emergency to build the wall is a \u201cfrivolous\u201d decision influenced by partisanship, not by responding to an essential problem.\n\nChurch\u2019s parting words in his 1976 testimony are noteworthy: \u201cCongress should be forewarned that it is inherent in the nature of modern government that the Executive will seek to enlarge its power in small ways and large.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what Trump is trying to do today."

It\u2019s about the rise and fall of a movie titan who once used Sundance as a hunting ground: movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of rape, sexual assault or misconduct by more than 75 women. The film \u201cUntouchable\u201d takes on Harvey Weinstein\u2019s decades of predatory behavior and the system that allowed it to happen, through the stories of survivors of his abuse, from his time as a young music promoter in Buffalo in the 1970s all the way until a series of investigations toppled Weinstein in 2017. The stories of accusers, from Gwyneth Paltrow to Salma Hayek to Angelina Jolie, rocked Hollywood, sparking the Me Too movement. More than a year after this public reckoning, Weinstein now faces five charges that could land him in prison for life, including rape and predatory sexual assault. Weinstein has just hired the former lawyers of one of his most public accusers, actor Rose McGowan, who says Weinstein raped her here at Sundance in 1997. His trial is expected to begin in May. Just two years after Harvey Weinstein joined the Women\u2019s March in Park City, \u201cUntouchable\u201d premiered here on Friday.

  "authors": [
    "Jan"
  ],
  "text": "This week, thousands of civil servants and contractors are back at work at NASA\u2019s various centers throughout the country following a record 35-day government shutdown \u2014 but it will be a while before it\u2019s work as usual again at the agency. These first few days back on the job will be consumed with practical matters, such as figuring out employee backpay and how to dive back into projects. The shutdown will undoubtedly result in delays for some of NASA\u2019s long-term programs, too, but it\u2019ll be a while before the space agency can fully assess the extent of the damage.\n\nOne way to think of it is that NASA was just closed for one-tenth of the year, says Casey Dreier, chief advocate and senior space policy adviser at The Planetary Society. \u201cYou can\u2019t just turn off and on the US space program like a flashlight,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to warm it up and get it back into a coherent and functioning system that involves tens of thousands of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just turn off and on the US space program like a flashlight.\u201d\n\nTo explain how NASA is adjusting in the wake of the shutdown, the space agency\u2019s administrator Jim Bridenstine addressed employees during a town hall meeting this afternoon at NASA\u2019s headquarters in Washington, DC. \u201cWelcome to 2019,\u201d he said during the meeting, which was live-streamed on NASATV. \u201cNASA is now open and we\u2019re very thankful for that.\u201d The comment was met by applause from those in attendance, while Bridenstine went on to acknowledge that it\u2019s been a rough start to the year for the agency. \u201cI want to say thank you for your patience and for your commitment to this agency and to the mission we all believe in so dearly.\u201d\n\nBridenstine told the room that some NASA employees did leave during the shutdown, though it wasn\u2019t a substantial amount. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a mass exodus,\u201d he said. \u201cI think had this gone on longer, we would have. But we did lose people \u2014 onesies and twosies \u2014 across the agency and even here at headquarters. That is absolutely true.\u201d\n\nPerhaps those hit hardest at NASA were the agency\u2019s contractors. Ultimately, there are two types of employees at NASA \u2014 civil servants, or those directly employed by the government, and commercial contractors, who are employed by companies funded by government contracts to do work for NASA. Under federal law, NASA employees are entitled to backpay once a government shutdown has ended. And Bridenstine mentioned that NASA\u2019s financial office worked through the weekend to make sure everyone received their backpay this week. But for the tens of thousands of NASA contractors, the situation is more complicated.\n\nEach company funded by NASA has its own contract with the agency, and the provisions of those agreements differ from contract to contract. Some contractors were paid their funding in advance of the shutdown, allowing them to continue working mostly unfazed. However, the employees of contractors who did not receive funding in advance were unable to bill for the hours that they worked during the shutdown. And it\u2019s possible they\u2019ll never receive compensation for that time. \u201cAs you go about working, if you\u2019re a civil servant working for NASA, remember that that person sitting next to you, who could be a contractor, may or may not get retroactive pay,\u201d Bridenstine said.\n\n\u201cOne day of shutdown does not equal one day of getting back into business.\u201d\n\nThis uncertainty led to some personnel changes that will make it difficult for NASA to move forward easily. When some contractors didn\u2019t get paid, they reassigned their employees to other non-NASA projects. And it\u2019s not a simple matter of these employees just coming back to work at NASA. \u201cThat human capital does not come back to NASA,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cIt stays on those other projects.\u201d He added that this prolongs the recovery process. \u201cNow when we get back open, we have to hire new people and / or figure out how to get people back on the contracting side,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it is not a one-for-one delay. One day of shutdown does not equal one day of getting back into business.\u201d\n\nOne NASA employee at the town hall asked Bridenstine if it was possible for NASA\u2019s civil servants to set up GoFundMe accounts for the contractors hit hardest by the shutdown. Bridenstine and other NASA officials noted that such campaigns would be complicated, because employees could run into legal conflicts. But employees were told to speak with their ethics counselors at each center to see what was possible. \u201cJust know this, I\u2019m proud to be at the helm of an agency where people ask that kind of question,\u201d Bridenstine said.\n\nOther NASA officials at the town hall addressed issues like NASA\u2019s cybersecurity during the shutdown. Renee Wynn, NASA\u2019s chief information officer, said that the agency\u2019s cybersecurity was \u201cin the most part, fully functional,\u201d but that some employees still lost their devices during the shutdown. The team did have to take down more than 35 public-facing NASA websites, too, because leaving them up could have jeopardized security and the information on them was not considered critical.\n\nWelcome back, I missed you! Such a good feeling to have the #NASAScience headquarters team all in one place again. Thank you for your endurance over the past few weeks and returning with such passion. You are essential to this team. I\u2019m happy we\u2019re all back! pic.twitter.com/nbmhCUjCj5 \u2014 Thomas Zurbuchen (@Dr_ThomasZ) January 28, 2019\n\nOverall, the shutdown\u2019s long-term impact on NASA still remains to be seen. NASA originally estimated that 95 percent of its employees were furloughed during the shutdown, but Bridenstine said that the true number was less than that. And ultimately, many of NASA\u2019s critical programs \u2014 such as maintaining the International Space Station and the ongoing planetary missions \u2014 continued without delay. Work still progressed on NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, the agency\u2019s initiative to send astronauts to the International Space Station on private vehicles made by SpaceX and Boeing.\n\nBut many of NASA\u2019s multi-year projects weren\u2019t considered so critical, and have suffered delays. NASA is in the middle of selecting new planetary missions to pursue, as part of its New Frontiers and Discovery programs \u2014 and the shutdown may have delayed that process, says Dreier. Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA\u2019s associate administrator for science, pushed back the date for when the agency would accept applications for new science research proposals. And there\u2019s uncertainty surrounding the new giant rocket NASA is working on to take astronauts to the Moon and beyond, called the Space Launch System. While most of the construction of the rocket is done by Boeing, NASA still oversees the entire program. And Boeing told Politico that the shutdown delayed testing of the rocket\u2019s hardware.\n\n\u201cHow do you ask NASA to pursue the most ambitious space exploration program in the world and give them three weeks of guaranteed funding?\u201d\n\nAdditionally, NASA is in the middle of developing plans for a new space station around the Moon, called the Gateway. The first module for the station is supposed to launch as early as 2022, but NASA hasn\u2019t even released concrete details of what it wants the modules of the Gateway to look like. It\u2019s possible that the shutdown could delay those development plans even further. \u201cNASA is trying to identify, set out, and create this broad agreement about what this program needs to be,\u201d says Dreier. \u201cIt has this goal to launch the first element of the Gateway by 2022. That\u2019s three years away now, and NASA needs to put out what it even wants. And it\u2019s been unable to continue working on those aspects of it during this period.\u201d\n\nThough NASA is open for now, it\u2019s possible the agency could be facing yet another shutdown in February. The continuing resolution currently funding the government is set to expire after February 15th. And the dispute that drove the most recent shutdown \u2014 funding for President Trump\u2019s border wall \u2014 has not been resolved. It\u2019s possible NASA could be back in the same situation soon. That makes things difficult for the agency, especially since many of NASA\u2019s initiatives take multiple years to develop.\n\n\u201cHow do you ask NASA to pursue the most ambitious space exploration program in the world and give them three weeks of guaranteed funding?\u201d asks Dreier. \u201cYou just can\u2019t. It undermines the entire effort.\u201d"

Lawmakers in the House where the Democrats hold a decisive majority, have introduced at least 8 bills on healthcare that critics are casting as \"Medicare-for-some.\" Among them are Senator Sherrod Brown who is considering a run for President and has introduced a bill allowing only retiring police and firefighters access to the Medicare system before they hit retirement age. Brown said, \"It\u2019s easy to say \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 and make a good speech, but see no action.\" According to Politico, the bills, \"range from modest Medicare reforms to more ambitious restructurings that would extend government-run care to millions of new patients \u2014 an array of options that fall short of campaign trail promises for full Medicare for All.\"\n\n\n\nA lobby group named Protect Our Care, which is invested in strengthening Obamacare has been developing messaging for Democrats on the issue. Also deeply concerned about Medicare-for-All is the health insurance industry that sees an existential threat from a government-run system. Meanwhile there is greater public support for a fully government-run Medicare-for-All system than ever before. A new Kaiser poll found that 71% of Americans support guaranteed health insurance as a right for all.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Margaret Flowers, Pediatrician, advocate for single payer health care and justice.

  "text": "\n\nJulia Quintanilla, 55, has cleaned the Agriculture Department building and the Department of Housing and Urban Development building for 27 years. She is pictured on her first day back to work after the government shutdown in the time between her two work shifts. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nHer debt was mounting: $156 for the gas bill, $300 for electricity, $2,000 for the mortgage. She could no longer afford her blood pressure pills. But what stung Audrey Murray-Wright most was rationing the groceries.\n\n\u201cI never, ever want to tell my son, \u2018Don\u2019t drink all that milk so you can save your brother some,' \u201d she said, choking up.\n\nMurray-Wright, a cleaning supervisor at the National Portrait Gallery, is one of more than a million federal contract workers nationwide whose income halted when the government partly shuttered for 35 days.\n\nUnlike the 800,000 career public servants who are slated to receive full back pay over the next week or so, the contractors who clean, guard, cook and shoulder other jobs at federal workplaces aren\u2019t legally guaranteed a single penny.\n\nThey\u2019re also among the lowest-paid laborers in the government economy, generally earning between $450 and $650 weekly, union leaders say.\n\nAnd even as they began returning to work Monday, they were bracing for more pain. President Trump\u2019s new deadline for Congress to earmark funding for his proposed border wall is Feb. 15. Agencies could close again if no deal is reached.\n\n[Federal contractors who lost health insurance during the shutdown remain in limbo]\n\nMurray-Wright, who lives in Maryland and has worked at Smithsonian properties for 15 years, said seeing her name back on the schedule has brought little relief.\n\nShe clocks in again Tuesday but doesn\u2019t expect a paycheck for at least another week. After her husband died last year of a heart attack, she has struggled to support her sons, ages 12 and 15.\n\n\u201cI did have a little money in the bank \u2014 now that\u2019s all gone,\u201d she said, crying. \u201cI don\u2019t have any help. My electricity might be turned off any day now.\u201d\n\nH\u00e9ctor Figueroa, president of 32BJ SEIU, a labor union that represents 170,000 service workers on the East Coast, said reopening the government is a temporary fix for people on such shaky ground.\n\n\u201cContracted workers are still in limbo,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThe men and women who clean and secure federal buildings have been living on the edge of disaster for five weeks. Many of these workers are facing eviction, power shut-offs, hunger and even going without lifesaving medications. And unlike direct federal employees, they may never be made whole.\u201d\n\nAfter the 16-day shutdown in 2013, approximately 850,000 federal workers collected compensation. About 1,200 cleaners, security guards and food-service workers in the Washington area, however, received no makeup pay.\n\nA group of Democratic senators introduced a bill last month aimed at changing that. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) have proposed legislation that would repay contractors up to $965 per week with public money and restore sick days used during the shutdown. (It\u2019s unclear whether the bill will advance.)\n\nThe push for compensation comes at a time when 4 in 10 Americans say they could not cobble together $400 when faced with an emergency expense, according to the latest Federal Reserve data.\n\nJulia Quintanilla, 55, who has worked for the past 27 years as a janitor at the Agriculture Department and other federal agencies, said she cashed in the last of her sick days during the shutdown to keep some income flowing.\n\nNow she\u2019s worried she won\u2019t be able to care for her elderly mother with dementia without risking her job security.\n\n\u201cHer mental abilities are failing,\u201d she said. \u201cShe needs my help.\u201d\n\nQuintanilla lost about $1,000 in savings during the shutdown, tumbled into a similar amount of debt and relied on churches for free meals. Her boss told her she\u2019s not eligible for back pay, she said.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u201cSince you are contract workers, when the government shuts down, you\u2019re going to stay home,' \u201d she said. \u201cThere is no work.\u201d\n\n[Skilled workers face a critical shutdown choice: Stay or quit?]\n\nSuch was also the case for De\u2019von Russell, 30, a security guard at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. He applied for unemployment checks in early January, which fell a couple hundred dollars short of his usual wages \u2014 about $600 weekly \u2014 and did not arrive until last week.\n\nHe\u2019s thrilled to return to work Wednesday, he said, but it\u2019s hard to celebrate with a month\u2019s worth of income gone. Russell, who has a 3-year-old daughter, estimates he\u2019s down $2,000.\n\n\u201cI was living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen all the funds stopped coming in, it just was like: \u2018What do I do now?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLoniece Hamilton, 25, another Smithsonian guard, said she watched about $1,000 disappear from her bank account during the budget stalemate. She\u2019d started her job in May, figuring a government-tied position would be more stable.\n\n\u201cI thought it\u2019d be better,\u201d she said.\n\nShe borrowed money from her grandfather and cousin. She didn\u2019t drive unless she was taking her 5-year-old son to school. And when he asked for his favorite cookies and juice at the store, she said: Next month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m late on all of my bills,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single last one of them.\u201d\n\nCatching up, she estimates, could take two months.\n\ncorrection: A previous version of this report misstated the findings of Federal Reserve data, which said 4 in 10 Americans say they could not cobble together $400 when faced with an emergency expense."

The president suggested he may also declare a national emergency to bypass Congress to build his wall, a move which would likely trigger legal challenges.\n\n\u201cAlthough this shutdown has ended, little agreement on Capitol Hill will likely weigh on business confidence and financial market sentiments,\u201d S&P said in a news release.\n\nTrump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said earlier this week that he didn\u2019t expect the shutdown to do lasting damage to the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cWhen the government reopens \u2014 and I'm not here to negotiate; I\u2019m not going to make a prediction, that's up to the president \u2014 you will see an immediate snapback,\u201d Kudlow told reporters.\n\nKudlow faced backlash during the shutdown when he said that thousands of federal employees were \u201cvolunteering\u201d to work due to their \u201callegiance to President Trump.\u201d\n\n\"They honor us and they do it because of their love for their country and the office of the presidency and presumably their allegiance to President Trump,\" Kudlow said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it.

The justice was criticised for providing inaccurate definitions to slang terms included in his yearbook that may have cast the Republican judge in a negative light. He was also alleged not to have provided accurate details about his tenure serving in former President George HW Bush\u2019s White House.\n\nMr Kavanaugh has defended the answers he provided throughout his confirmation hearings as truthful and accurate to the best of his recollection.\n\nMr Neguse is not the only Democrat on the panel to have openly discussed the possibility of impeaching Mr Kavanaugh.\n\nDuring an Acela train ride from New York City to Washington, Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, was reportedly overheard by a journalist discussing what could happen if the latest Supreme Court justice was impeached.\n\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario \u2014 or best case depending on your point of view \u2014 you prove he committed perjury, about a terrible subject and the Judicial Conference recommends you impeach him,\u201d Mr Nadler said. \u201cSo the president appoints someone just as bad.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

  "text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\nA terrifying new study about Greenland's ice sheet has found that the rate of melting is four times greater than it was 16 years ago. If all of Greenland's ice sheet melts - a clear result of global warming - it will mean a 23 foot rise in sea levels, submerging Florida's southern tip.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that a record number of Americans now believe human-caused global warming is a thing. A Yale University poll found that 72% of Americans acknowledge the reality of climate change - a large swing from previous years. Perhaps it is because the evidence is all around us from wildfires in California to deadly hurricanes multiple times a year.\n\n\n\nBut what if this collective realization has come too late? We have lost precious decades due to inaction fueled by well-funded efforts to deny climate change. Today we'll examine who has led those efforts and why.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Amy Westervelt, audio and print reporter covering climate and gender. Her podcast Drilled is about the creation and spread of climate denial and her first book \"Forget 'Having It All'\" was published by Seal Press in November 2018."

  "text": "White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has pressed agency leaders to provide him with a list of the highest-impact programs that will be jeopardized if the shutdown continues into March and April, people familiar with the directive said.\n\nMulvaney wants the list no later than Friday, these people said, and it\u2019s the firmest evidence to date that the White House is preparing for a lengthy funding lapse that could have snowballing consequences for the economy and government services.\n\nThe request is the first known request from a top White House official for a broad accounting of the spreading impact of the shutdown, which has entered its fifth week and is the longest in U.S. history. So far, top White House officials have been particularly focused on lengthening wait times at airport security, but not the sprawling interruption of programs elsewhere in the government.\n\nAnd the request startled some agency officials, who had been struggling to manage the fallout from the shutdown so far. Many of them are simply trying to determine how to keep some agency functions operating at a time when a growing number of workers are refusing to show up because they aren\u2019t getting paid.\n\nNow, in addition to dealing with the daily problems caused by the shutdowns, Mulvaney is forcing them to comprehend how to run parts of their bureaucracies without money for an extended period of time. The impact is expected to spread to at least tens of millions of people, who rely on government services that are impacted.\n\nThe people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose Mulvaney\u2019s demand.\n\nA senior White House budget official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the request, said \u201cprudent management means planning and preparing for events without known end-dates.\u201d These requests will be first presented to the White House\u2019s budget office and then sent to Mulvaney. The official said the request does not signal whether the administration believes the shutdown will last to March.\n\nThe shutdown has already caused the federal government to stop paying 800,000 employees, but the impact is expected to become exponentially broader in the coming weeks. The federal court system is likely to halt major operations after Feb. 1, and the Department of Agriculture does not have funding to pay food stamp benefits in March to roughly 40 million people.\n\nThe White House also faces a backlash from many federal workers, who face missing a second consecutive paycheck in the coming days. Some workers have balked at continuing without being paid, and their unions are filing legal action against the administration.\n\nAnd there were new signs on Wednesday that federal agencies are still trying to comprehend the scope of their growing problems.\n\nThe U.S. General Services Administration, an agency that manages many of the government\u2019s leases and contracts, notified a number of departments that it is likely to need new flexibility from Congress in order for it to make utility and lease payments in the coming days. It has asked Congress for the ability to redirect $520 million so that it doesn\u2019t fall behind on these costs. The request is still pending.\n\nMany federal agencies lease space in commercial buildings around the country, and if the GSA can\u2019t make rental payments for these departments the government could incur major fees and other costs. This could also have a big impact on the property owners, which rely on large government payments for their income. GSA has stressed to agencies that they will not be evicted if the payments are missed, but it is unclear what precisely would happen.\n\nIn a notice to companies leasing space to the federal government, GSA acknowledged their concerns \u201cregarding GSA\u2019s ability to make timely rent payments.\u201d It told them it was awaiting word from Congress as to whether it would be given new flexibility.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House Office of Management and Budget has tried to take multiple steps to blunt the impact of the shutdown, and this week it sent guidance to agencies that would make it easier for some federal contractors to receive payments.\n\nSenior OMB officials have tried to serve as a clearinghouse for agency leaders as they work to deal with the repercussions of the shutdown, but Mulvaney\u2019s direct involvement reflects how the White House is now attempting to understand the longer-term implications."

  "authors": [
    "Nidhi Prakash",
    "Buzzfeed News Reporter"
  ],
  "text": "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is asking the Trump administration for answers after recent reports that the White House has considered limiting or cutting off disaster relief funding to Puerto Rico.\n\nIn a letter obtained by BuzzFeed News, Warren asked Office of Management and Budget head and Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson about the administration's plans for disaster relief funds in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, she asked whether the president has ever demanded that disaster relief funds to Puerto Rico should be cut off, and about what the administration plans to do with disaster relief funds already authorized and appropriated for Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\"These new reports and Administration actions appear to reveal that President Trump either does not care about or does not understand the needs of the Puerto Rican people and the federal laws that govern assistance to the US citizens who live on the island,\" Warren wrote in the letter, sent to Mulvaney and Carson on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe letter follows an OMB statement in which the White House called a $600 million grant for disaster nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico \"excessive and unnecessary,\" as well as a recent Washington Post report that President Donald Trump told Mulvaney and then-chief of staff John Kelly in September that he did not want any further disaster relief funding to go to Puerto Rico, after hearing an unsubstantiated claim that Puerto Rico was using disaster relief funds to pay off its debt.\n\nNBC also reported Wednesday that the disbursement of HUD funds for recovery projects on the island is being held up by the partial government shutdown. HUD allocated $1.5 billion to Puerto Rico last February, and an additional $18.5 billion in April 2018.\n\n\n\n\"Given the President\u2019s reported orders to his senior staff to eliminate Puerto Rico\u2019s disaster recovery funding, this failure to provide congressionally approved funds raises serious concerns that HUD is using the shutdown as a pretext for withholding funds from Puerto Rico,\" Warren wrote in her letter.\n\nMore than a year after Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico, the island is still struggling to recover, with some Puerto Rican families still living under temporary blue tarps instead of roofs. Roughly 100,000 people are estimated to have fled to the mainland United States since the disaster.\n\n\n\nIn November, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 wrote a letter to congressional leaders asking for additional disaster relief funding, including money for the food stamp program, citing the territory's \"inability to provide food security to those in need.\"\n\n\n\nIn her letter, Warren asked on what basis the White House had concluded that the emergency food stamp funding is \"excessive and unnecessary.\"\n\n\n\n\"Has OMB or have any other Administration officials conducted an analysis of current needs, or changes in the need for nutrition assistance post-Maria?\" she asked.\n\nWarren, who announced her candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination this month, is traveling to Puerto Rico on Tuesday and is scheduled to hold a town hall\u2013style event there to discuss the island's hurricane recovery."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "On Friday, thousands took part in the Indigenous Peoples March in Washington, D.C. The next day, video went viral of an interaction that took place soon after the march ended between an indigenous elder and a group of Catholic high school students from Kentucky who had attended a March for Life protest the same day. In the video, Omaha elder Nathan Phillips is seen peacefully playing his drum and singing while being encircled by the students\u2014some of whom were wearing red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats. The video appears to show the students taunting and mocking Phillips. Some of the students are seen making a tomahawk-chop motion with their arms. One student wearing a red MAGA hat is seen standing directly in front of Phillips while grinning and smirking. The videos sparked widespread outrage, but some commentators walked back their critique of the students after more videos were posted online. DN! speaks to Nathan Phillips about what happened. He is a Vietnam-era veteran and previous director of the Native Youth Alliance."

But near the end of his short life Dr. King took on the project of economic inequality and led the \"Poor People's Campaign.\" There has always been a racial wealth gap in the US but that gap has not closed. In fact since the 1980s it has doubled.\n\n\n\nA new report by the Institute for Policy Studies, titled Dreams Deferred, has found that, \"Between 1983 and 2016, the median Black family saw their wealth drop by more than half after inflation, compared to a 33% increase for the median White household. Meanwhile, the number of households with $10 million or more skyrocketed by 856%.\" The report links the ever-rising fortunes of the obscenely wealthy with the on-going racial wealth gap.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Dedrick Asante-Muhammad, Associate Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, co-author of the report Dreams Deferred: How Enriching the 1% Widens the Racial Wealth Divide."

  "text": "\n\nU.S. troops patrol in Afghanistan. (Omar Sobhani/Reuters)\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nKABUL \u2014 A former interpreter for U.S. troops in Afghanistan was detained Friday after arriving at a Houston airport with his family and was threatened with deportation back to Kabul, a legal service advocacy group said, a move that could jeopardize his life.\n\nMohasif Motawakil, 48, was detained by Customs and Border Protection. The agency allowed his wife and five children to be released at 10 p.m. Friday following pressure from lawmakers, said William Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. An attorney for RAICES is representing the Afghan man.\n\nMotawakil served as an interpreter for U.S. troops from 2012 to 2013 and later as a U.S. contractor, Fitzgerald said. He and his family likely had been granted special visas allotted for Afghans and Iraqis who supported U.S. war efforts and who are endangered because of their work, usually by the Taliban and other militants who consider them traitors and prize their capture. The process of obtaining special immigrant visas takes years for many applicants, who must get letters of support from U.S. officials vouching for them and must demonstrate that their lives have been imperiled.\n\nSomeone, possibly in the family, opened sealed medical records, prompting CBP to detain the family over concerns that the records could have been \u201cfaked,\u201d Fitzgerald told The Washington Post. \u201cThen [CBP] said they would be deported,\u201d he said, adding that the family is \u201cconfused and traumatized\u201d over the ordeal.\n\nCBP said the family was detained after a routine inspection but, citing privacy laws, declined to provide more details.\n\n\u201cThe father remains detained and his wife and children were allowed into the U.S. pending the outcome of his proceedings,\u201d the agency said in a statement Saturday.\n\nA State Department information page instructs immigrants not to open their sealed document packet, but it does not suggest why or warn immigrants about potential consequences. It was not clear why or how the packet was opened.\n\nThe State Department referred questions to CBP and declined to comment, citing the government shutdown. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul did not return a request for comment.\n\n[They risked their lives to help U.S. troops. Now they\u2019re driving for Lyft to get by.]\n\nAn attorney for RAICES has not been able to meet with Motawakil, Fitzgerald said.\n\n\u201cHow unjust that this Afghan family, who helped our military, is in same airport as counsel \u2014 & yet have been walled off from one another,\u201d Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) said on Twitter.\n\nDoggett made calls to CBP, and Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee and Al Green, both Texas Democrats, went to the airport in support of Motawakil, Fitzgerald said.\n\nThousands of Afghans and their families have received special immigrant visas and resettled in the United States since 2009, when the program began. There were 2,410 principal applicants who arrived with family members in 2018 \u2014 a 50 percent decline compared with the previous year.\n\nThe number of visa approvals fell by 60 percent in 2018 compared with the previous year, according to State Department data.\n\nNo One Left Behind, an advocacy group for former interpreters, has said heightened vetting measures by the Trump administration are to blame. Waiting years for approval places immigrants in \u201cseverely dangerous situations,\u201d said Kirt Lewis, the group\u2019s director of programs.\n\nAbout 19,000 Afghan principal applicants are in some part of the vetting process for the visas, according to the State Department. They are waiting as a resurgent Taliban controls swaths of Afghanistan, prompting former interpreters to go into hiding.\n\nMotawakil\u2019s family members were taken in for the night by the Afghan Cultural Center in Houston, though their fate in the United States, along with that of Motawakil, has yet to be determined, Fitzgerald said.\n\n\u201cThe Afghan SIV (Special Immigrant Visa) program offers protection to people who served faithfully along U.S. government personnel and who are in danger because of that service,\u201d said Betsy Fisher, the policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project. \u201cSurely the U.S. government can resolve a trivial issue with an opened envelope to protect someone who faces persecution as a U.S. wartime partner.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAfghan government, struggling with war fronts and peace bids, forms new team of rivals and loyalists\n\nIn war-weary Kabul, burning coal and tires keeps residents warm \u2014 and the city choked by smog\n\nTrump backs off national emergency to build border wall as shutdown is set to become longest ever"

  "authors": [],
  "text": "North Carolina is set to lose more business because pieces of its hateful HB 2 remain on the books.\n\nNorth Carolina has lost Netflix\u2019s business for the time being because portions of the state\u2019s anti-LGBTQ House Bill 2 remain on the books. The streaming giant had initially wanted to shoot its coming-of-age series OBX, set in North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks, in the show\u2019s creator Jonas Pate\u2019s town of Wilmington, N.C. But South Carolina is being considered instead while any remnants remain of the hateful HB 2, which barred trans people from using the restroom that coincided with their gender identity and restricted municipalities' ability to enact antidiscrimination laws, the Wilmington Star News reports.\n\nHouse Bill 2, which became law in 2016, was partially repealed the following year and replaced with HB 142, but opponents say the latter leaves the door open for discrimination. HB 142 repealed the portion of HB 2 requiring trans people to use the restrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate, not their gender identity, when in government buildings, including public schools and state colleges and universities. But it left the question of restroom access in the hands of the state legislature instead of cities and counties, leaving open the option that a law similar to HB 2 could be passed.\n\nHB 142 also prevents municipalities from enacting nondiscrimination ordinances that cover any group not included in state law, including LGBTQ people, until 2020. HB 2 had prevented this indefinitely.\n\nAnd it\u2019s that piece of HB 142 that has Netflix and Pate, who also made the series Surface with his brother Josh, looking elsewhere to shoot.\n\n\u201cThis tiny law is costing this town [Wilmington] 70 good, clean, pension-paying jobs and also sending a message to those people who can bring these jobs and more that North Carolina still doesn\u2019t get it,\u201d Pate said, adding that the production was set to spend $60 million in the state where it films.\n\nMeanwhile, Pate has been scouting locations near Charleston, S.C., the Star News reports. But considering that his series is about young people coming of age with the very specific experience of living in the Outer Banks, Pate has some hope that North Carolina legislators can push to repeal the clause that is set to expire in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe have a tiny window where this could be pulled out of the fire,\u201d Pate said. \u201cIf I get any sense that there is any effort to move the sunset date up, I think I could convince Netflix to change course.\u201d\n\nIncoming North Carolina Sen. Harper Peterson, a Democrat from Hanover, said he\u2019d like to see the matter addressed at the start of the General Assembly\u2019s session this week.\n\n\u201cThat is a decision the legislature has to make and realize that it is one more opportunity we are losing if we don\u2019t,\u201d Peterson told the Star News. \u201cWe have to get back and be competitive with other states. It just hurts to see a production about North Carolina go to South Carolina.\u201d"

It was the first time Trump has made a televised address from the Oval Office during his presidency. The nine-and-a-half-minute-long speech was rife with claims of rampant drug trafficking, criminals pouring over the border and assaulting and violently killing Americans \u2014 none of which is true.\n\nHis speech was so riddled with lies and exaggerations, as was expected, that media outlets spent more time fact-checking it than analyzing it.

  "text": "A federal judge has spoken out against a sharp increase in Northern Virginia in the prosecution of immigrants who reenter the country after deportation.\n\n\u201cI hope this is not the start of a pattern for this year,\u201d Judge Leonie M. Brinkema said in Alexandria federal court last week, noting that there were six such cases scheduled for the first Friday in January. \u201cI think this is not the best use of judicial or Justice Department resources to keep seeing these types of cases.\u201d\n\nShe added that she would like that message to be relayed to G. Zachary Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nThe defendant before her that morning, Ramon Adrian Ochoa Paz, ended up in federal court after serving time in Prince William County for aggravated sexual battery of a child, a felony. But in federal court, his only alleged crime was coming back into the country after being deported in 2000. He is something of an outlier; in the majority of the 224 cases of felony reentry after deportation that were filed in the Eastern District last year, initial arrests involved misdemeanor offenses, most commonly drunken driving. Arrests for misdemeanor assault and public intoxication are also common.\n\nFormer attorney general Jeff Sessions made immigration cases a national priority, and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Alexandria is one of many that responded to the call. U.S. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. noted in his 2018 review that there was a 40 percent increase nationally in defendants charged with illegal reentry last year. After drug crimes, immigration offenses are the most common federal charge, and most are illegal reentries.\n\nThe vast majority of these cases are prosecuted at the border, where immigrants are caught crossing illegally. The Eastern District of Virginia ranked sixth among non-border districts in illegal reentry prosecutions last fiscal year.\n\n\n\nThe federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Eastern District, a large and high-profile office led by a prosecutor who worked under Sessions, has seen a particularly sharp rise in such cases, from 78 filed in 2017 to nearly three times that number the following year.\n\nThe numbers were as high or higher under President Barack Obama through the end of 2014, when the White House took unilateral action to change national deportation priorities. After that move, the number of cases dropped sharply in Alexandria, along with several other districts across the country.\n\nTerwilliger declined to comment, but in recent months, he has been highlighting cases in which defendants have repeatedly come into the country illegally and committed other crimes while here. They included a Salvadoran man who was arrested for his fifth drunken driving offense and who already had a felony reentry conviction and a Mexican man with a sexual assault and drug record who had previously been deported.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to criminal immigration enforcement and will continue to prioritize these cases,\u201d the U.S. attorney wrote in a news release.\n\nTerwilliger has simultaneously emphasized his support for legal immigration, regularly taking part in the Alexandria courthouse\u2019s monthly naturalization ceremonies. In his first-ever tweet, he wrote, \u201cThese individuals exemplify that we are both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws.\u201d\n\n\n\nU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia G. Zachary Terwilliger. (Department of Justice)\n\nMost undocumented immigrants convicted of coming back into the country after deportation do not have previous felony or extensive misdemeanor records and are usually not sentenced to any incarceration beyond time served awaiting judgment before they are handed over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to federal court records. The average sentence in fiscal 2018 for those who did get prison time was five months, according to data from Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse \u2014 on the low end nationally and a decline from previous years.\n\nIn many cases, the initial charges are dropped or left hanging because the defendant is already in ICE custody. When the initial crime is more serious, a defendant is more likely to be prosecuted on federal charges after completing a local sentence.\n\nAlthough the Salvadoran gang MS-13 is a serious problem in Northern Virginia and many of the undocumented immigrants are from that country, only four of the 224 defendants prosecuted last year on a reentry charge have been alleged in public court filings to have ties to the gang.\n\nOnly a few of those prosecuted were not arrested for any reason other than returning to the country after deportation. For example, a contractor was arrested when he was working on a house where FBI agents were serving a search warrant.\n\nOften, defense attorneys in these cases ask to skip as much of the standard court process as possible, hoping to move a case quickly to sentencing. Undocumented immigrants rarely have the money to hire attorneys; most of these cases are handled by taxpayer-funded public defenders.\n\n\u201cThe court, prosecutors, and defense lawyers spend considerable time and resources, particularly to hire interpreters, on illegal reentry cases. Yet these defendants almost all face, in addition to prosecution, detention in ICE custody and deportation,\u201d Geremy Kamens, lead public defender for the Eastern District, said in a statement. \u201cParticularly for defendants who have little or no criminal record, ICE detention and removal already amount to a significant punishment.\u201d\n\nBrinkema has challenged the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies before. She issued a preliminary injunction against the White House\u2019s travel ban on seven majority-Muslim countries in 2017, saying there was \u201cunrebutted evidence\u201d that the order was motivated by \u201creligious prejudice.\u201d\n\nBut in immigration cases involving a pattern of bad conduct, she has not shied from imposing relatively long sentences.\n\nGiving one man with a history of domestic violence and drunken driving a 14-month sentence for recrossing the border illegally, she told him, \u201cYou\u2019re a menace when you\u2019re in this country.\u201d"

  "text": "It\u2019s been a hell of a week at the White House, between the president blindsiding government officials by abruptly deciding to remove 7,000 troops from Afghanistan, resulting in yet another cabinet departure, and the ongoing dramatic slide in the stock market. It\u2019s almost easy to get distracted from the fact that Donald Trump is angling for a partial government shutdown to get funding for his signature campaign promise, a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Amidst the turmoil on Friday though, the chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s offered a small slice of good news \u2014 there is such a thing as free lunch, at least on his watch.\n\nIn a Friday morning tweet, the president blamed Democrats for the possible shutdown ahead of an anticipated afternoon Senate vote on the funding. If a shutdown is not averted, hundreds of thousands of federal employees would be put on furlough until a new spending bill is passed. Enter Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s: Shortly after Trump\u2019s tweet, the chef, humanitarian, and frequent critic of the Trump administration pledged to offer free sandwiches to federal government employees for lunch throughout the duration of a shutdown.\n\nAnd I will offer again Free Sandwiches to the poor men and women of the federal government, republicans and democrats, at every restaurant of mine in DC for lunch until they get paid again! https://t.co/hHUnPrqhsF \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) December 21, 2018\n\nThe offer of a free lunch is similar to one Andr\u00e9s made in 2013 to government workers in DC during the last government shutdown.

  "text": "The furloughing of hundreds of Food and Drug Administration inspectors has sharply reduced inspections of the nation\u2019s food supply \u2014 one of the many repercussions of the partial government shutdown that are making Americans potentially less safe.\n\nThe agency, which oversees 80 percent of the food supply, has suspended all routine inspections of domestic food-processing facilities, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview. He is working on a plan to bring inspectors back as early as next week to inspect facilities considered high-risk because they handle sensitive items such as seafood, soft cheese and vegetables, or have a history of problems.\n\n\u201cWe are doing what we can to mitigate any risk to consumers through the shutdown,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit advocacy group, described the inspection reductions as unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThat puts our food supply at risk,\u201d said Sarah Sorscher, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the group. \u201cRegular inspections, which help stop foodborne illness before people get sick, are vital.\u201d\n\nFoodborne illnesses are a major problem in the United States, sickening 48 million people each year and killing 3,000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates.\n\nFood inspections are just one of the public health and safety efforts that have been cut or curtailed during the shutdown, now deep into its third week. The federal government also keeps airplanes from colliding, inspects pharmaceutical drugs, pursues criminals and defends against possible terrorist and cyberattacks. It is a 24-7-365 effort to make Americans safer.\n\nBut a shutdown upends the calculus of risk management as agencies including the FBI, Coast Guard, Secret Service, FDA, Federal Aviation Administration and Agriculture Department face drastically reduced resources.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t shut down the United States government at this magnitude and expect that everything\u2019s going to be hunky-dory,\u201d said Bruce McIndoe, founder and president of WorldAware, a risk management firm with corporate clients around the globe. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a much higher risk of a failure in the system.\u201d\n\nEvery federal agency has to make a judgment call about what to go without. Who is essential? Who is not? This is not simply about people, but also about functions. The government has operational mandates.\n\nSome of the results are clearly visible, as in the much-publicized cases of trash piling up in national parks. But there are subtler and more significant effects involving government functions that are unseen by most Americans but have far greater effects.\n\nThe FDA, for example, typically conducts about 160 routine food inspections a week in the United States, with about a third involving high-risk processing facilities, Gottlieb said.\n\nThe agency\u2019s inspectors look for problems such as unsanitary conditions, insect infestations, and salmonella and E. coli contamination \u2014 as it did, for instance, in the recent investigations of romaine lettuce.\n\nGottlieb said that legal guidance from the 2013 shutdown said the agency could not conduct regular food inspections during a funding shortfall. But after canceling more than 50 high-risk inspections, he said he has sought authority to call back about 150 furloughed inspectors to focus on high-risk facilities.\n\nThe agency is continuing to inspect foreign manufacturers, imports and domestic producers involved in recalls or outbreaks, and places where inspectors suspect there may be a problem.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture operates in parallel with the FDA, inspecting meat, poultry and egg products, and those inspections have continued, according to a shutdown plan forwarded by a USDA representative.\n\nAbout 60 percent of the FDA\u2019s activities are funded by user fees, which enable the agency to continue many operations, at least for now, including drug and device reviews. About 40 percent of the agency\u2019s activities, including most of its food-related work, are paid for by appropriations, which have not been approved by Congress.\n\nEven by the standards of previous shutdowns, this event has been chaotic. It came on quickly, amid false expectations that a political deal over the budget was close. The Trump administration was not fully prepared for the cascading effects of closing major departments and halting the gears of the bureaucracy.\n\nThe Secret Service is mostly at work. But even there, according to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s shutdown plan approved last year, 1,242 of the 7,222 employees are deemed nonessential.\n\nIn DHS\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, 1,523 of the 3,531 employees are considered nonessential.\n\nDHS\u2019s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office is two-thirds unstaffed. The DHS shutdown guide states that only 65 of the 204 employees of the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office will remain on the job during a funding shortfall. The rest go home.\n\nMcIndoe, the WorldAware president, listed multiple areas of concern for his clients who rely on commercial aviation, including stress on the Transportation Security Administration, where employees may quit if not paid and where there have been media reports of workers calling in sick in unusually large numbers \u2014 reports denied by TSA.\n\nAnother concern is air traffic control, a system that McIndoe said was chronically underfunded before the FAA ran out of money during the shutdown. He noted that the FAA\u2019s functions are highly specialized and that if workers quit, they cannot quickly be replaced.\n\nAs the shutdown continues, questions about safety and security issues are drawing more attention. On Tuesday, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, issued 10 questions for DHS, all touching on security.\n\nHe asked whether the office charged with countering weapons of mass destruction is still able to share bioterrorism and nuclear-threat information with state and local officials.\n\nHe also wanted to know whether the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is still inspecting high-risk chemical facilities.\n\nDHS officials did not immediately respond to Thompson\u2019s questions. The bulk of the department\u2019s legislative affairs team has been furloughed.\n\nBut Tyler Q. Houlton, the department\u2019s press secretary, said that most of the agency remains on duty and is \u201cfully prepared to protect the homeland and keep Americans safe during this lapse in government funding.\u201d\n\nUnions representing federal workers, and nonprofit organizations aligned with progressive causes, are less sanguine. The Air Line Pilots Association, International, the union representing pilots, sent a letter to President Trump saying the FAA has fewer inspectors on duty than are required \u201cto ensure the air traffic control infrastructure is performing at its peak levels of performance.\u201d\n\nThe letter, signed by Capt. Joe DePete, president of the union, urged Trump to \u201cimmediately end the shutdown of government agencies that is affecting the safety, security and efficiency of our national airspace system.\u201d\n\nNew York University political scientist Paul Light noted that the federal government does a great deal of risk monitoring, ideally to anticipate major problems and be prepared to react to them. That work is compromised during a shutdown, he said.\n\n\u201cShutdowns are a perfect way to force a breakdown,\u201d Light said. He has spent much of his career studying these breakdowns, which include the U.S. failure to anticipate the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the country\u2019s slow response to the 2014 Ebola crisis.\n\n\u201cThey have to be totally alert. This shutdown is producing enormous distraction even for agencies that are open,\u201d Light said.\n\nThat thought was echoed by David Berteau, president and chief executive of the Professional Services Council, which represents about 400 companies that have contracts with the federal government.\n\n\u201cUnder the shutdown, the government is forced to shift from detection and prevention to after-the-fact response \u2014 which more than likely is going to be too little, too late,\u201d Berteau said.\n\nOne government function that does not seem imperiled at the moment is asteroid monitoring. NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is operated by the California Institute of Technology under a contract and remains open for now. The JPL\u2019s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies \u2014 which tracks objects that might slam into the Earth \u2014 is still keeping tabs on space rocks. Paul Chodas, manager of the center, said his operation \u201cshould be able to continue working for several more months.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nIn shutdown, national parks transformed into Wild West\n\nConsequences of government shutdown are striking the private sector\n\nU.S. towns with federal workers brace for impact as shutdown continues"

  "authors": [

  ],
  "text": "The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission unanimously approved its final report last week, with hundreds of pages\u2019 worth of investigation and recommendations now going to the governor\u2019s office and the Florida legislature for action.\n\n\u201cWe will not wait,\u201d the 439-page report reads in part. \u201cWe will be vigilant and we, like the legislature, expect compliance and change with urgency.\u201d\n\nThe report is an in-depth analysis of the Parkland shooting in February 2018 that left 17 students and staff members dead. It documents extensive shortcomings in the school\u2019s security measures prior to the shooting, and outlines deficiencies in the police response. It offers a searing critique of the school and sheriff department\u2019s ability to stymie the bloodshed.\n\nThe commission was formed in March by the Florida legislature, and its 16 members include sheriffs, school board members, academics and parents of students murdered in the shooting. Its report offers dozens of recommendations about how the high school \u2015 and school districts around the state \u2015 could improve safety. It calls for increased funding for school police officers and training teachers to carry firearms.\n\nThe suggested solutions, though, are not an adequate response to the questions raised by the shooting, some Parkland students say.\n\nSome students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas \u2015 particularly those of color \u2015 told HuffPost that the suggested changes, like heightened security and armed teachers, would make the school feel less safe.\n\nThe MSD Commission recommended that teachers should be armed. My teacher has one job and that is to love and educate his/her students. The job to protect and serve is someone else\u2019s job description. Bet it won\u2019t take long for a teacher to \u201cfeel threatened\u201d. \u2014 Mei-Ling Ho-Shing (@MeilingIts) December 20, 2018\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily trust police. We have a lot of reasons to not trust them,\u201d said Aalayah Eastmond, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas who survived last year\u2019s shooting. \u201cSo having them at school makes it ten times worse and heightens the problem.\u201d\n\nEastmond told HuffPost the school has already started to feel less welcoming for students of color with an increase in police presence. She describes seeing \u201cnew people on campus every day with really big guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them are really nice, but not all of them are nice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know them. It\u2019s uncomfortable for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been a handful of instances where police officers prevented or mitigated school shootings, there is no comprehensive research suggesting that school police officers deter school shootings overall.\n\nHowever, there is evidence suggesting that having cops in schools can help perpetuate the school-to-prison pipeline \u2015 the cycle in which students, particularly students of color, are pushed out of school and into the criminal justice system when school authorities criminalize student misbehavior. A HuffPost investigation found that schools with police officers are significantly more likely to refer their students to law enforcement for incidents involving theft, vandalism and alcohol.\n\nStoneman Douglas employed a school-based police officer at the time of the shooting. Instead of confronting the shooter, he hid, according to the public safety commission\u2019s report.\n\nStill, research has shown that schools with police officers are more likely to have emergency plans in place in case of a shooting. These schools also receive more regular safety inspections.\n\n\u201cI think that increasing the police presence at the school doesn\u2019t serve any long-term effects other than helping to increase racial profiling at school, particularly for minority students,\u201d Kai Koerber, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and a survivor of the shooting, told HuffPost. \u201cFor me that doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense because the fact of the matter is, most of the time, it\u2019s not minority students carrying out these acts of mass murder.\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy of Kai Koerber Kai Koerber, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, is opposed to the idea of arming teachers.\n\nKoerber also said he\u2019s deeply uneasy with the idea of his teachers carrying guns.\n\n\u201cIt would not make me feel comfortable being a black young man in the South, in a mostly white neighborhood, with my teachers being armed,\u201d said Koerber, who has started an organization to promote mental health education in schools.\n\nIssues like gun control fell outside the scope of the commission\u2019s report, notwithstanding the high-profile political activism from Parkland students in the past year. Instead, the commission tackled ideas like arming teachers.\n\nBut even within the commission\u2019s ranks, there was disagreement over the recommendation. At least one member, Max Schachter, who lost his son Alex in the shooting, has said he doesn\u2019t believe in arming teachers. In recent days, two members of the commission have caused controversy by going on NRA-TV to promote the idea of teachers carrying weapons.\n\nOverall, though, Schachter praised the report for its thoroughness."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nJan. 6, 2019, 12:10 PM GMT By Lisa Riordan Seville, Hannah Rappleye and Andrew W. Lehren\n\nThe 22 immigrants who died in the nation's sprawling network of detention centers over the past two years came to the United States from countries as far-flung as Vietnam, and as close as Mexico. Some had been longtime legal residents, arriving as refugees or students. Others were recent asylum seekers. Many were young \u2014 half were not yet 45 years old.\n\nRoxana Hernandez was one. Hers was among the most high-profile of the deaths in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody during the Trump administration.\n\nThe 33-year-old transgender woman from Honduras arrived at the U.S. border seeking asylum as part of a migrant caravan. She died within two weeks of entering ICE custody. Hernandez's death, along with the recent deaths of two young children held by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has brought renewed scrutiny to immigrants in the federal government's custody.\n\nRoxana Hernandez, right, a transgender woman who was part of the caravan of Central American migrants, died in ICE custody at a hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico on May 25, 2018. Annie Rose Ramos\n\n\"One death is too many,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen during testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Dec. 20, in the wake of the first child's death.\n\nNielsen's agency oversees both CBP, which apprehends unauthorized migrants at the border and holds them for short stints, and ICE, which arrests immigrants in the interior of the country, and operates a large network of longer-term detention centers. The DHS detention centers, said Nielsen, have \"some of the highest standards in the world.\"\n\nBut an NBC News review of dozens of government reports, death reviews and audits of ICE detention centers reveals a system long riddled with problems. Within the last year, the DHS Office of Inspector General has issued three reports finding poor treatment and spotty oversight in ICE facilities.\n\nWhile the issues predate President Donald Trump, his administration has expanded ICE's enforcement priorities. Advocates said the rollback of discretion as detention expands puts vulnerable immigrants at risk.\n\n\"You'll see someone who is clearly an asylum seeker who came into custody with a serious medical condition, whether a heart condition or otherwise, and you have to ask, 'Why is this person in jail?'\" said Heidi Altman, director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center. \"There's no reason for it.\"\n\nTwo years into the Trump administration, 22 immigrants have died in ICE detention, according to an NBC News analysis of 188 detainee deaths since 2003, when the Department of Homeland Security was formed in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nThis remains below the peak of 32 deaths in 2004, the first full calendar year records were kept. Deaths rose and then fell during the Obama administration, from 10 in 2008 to five in 2012, a period in which ICE implemented policies to improve detention conditions and oversight. But deaths then ticked up to 12 in President Obama's last full year in office, 2016, as the number of detainees grew.\n\nUnder Trump, as the immigrant detainee population has surged still higher, the annual number of deaths was 10 in 2017 and 12 in 2018.\n\nICE has said deaths in detention are \"exceedingly rare,\" involving a fraction of those detained by the agency.\n\nThe tally does not include the recent deaths of two Guatemalan children in CBP custody. Jakelin Caal Maquin, 7, and Felipe Alonzo-Gomez, 8, died within weeks of each other in December. Nor does it include the March death of a 20-month old girl, Mariee Ju\u00e1rez, nearly two months after she was held at an ICE family detention center in Texas with her mother. Her mother is now suing the government, alleging neglect.\n\nAlonzo-Gomez's death on Christmas Eve prompted DHS to order increased medical screenings of children and look into bringing in medical staff from other federal agencies.\n\nIn a tweet last week, Trump foisted responsibility for the children's deaths onto Democrats as he remained firm in maintaining the government shutdown until Congress approved funding for the border wall. Nielsen also pointed to politics and failures in the courts for the problems at the border.\n\nAny deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They can\u2019t. If we had a Wall, they wouldn\u2019t even try! The two..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2018\n\n\"The system is clearly overwhelmed and we must work together to address this humanitarian crisis and protect vulnerable populations,\" Nielsen said in a statement released after meeting with officials in El Paso. \"We know that if Congress were to act, or the courts were to enforce the law as written, we could address this crisis tomorrow.\"\n\nAudits question medical care\n\nICE held an average of about 42,000 people a day in its network of more than 200 detention centers and jails last fiscal year. This is a 30 percent increase over the average in the Obama years, DHS data shows, and more than double the average under Bush. In its most recent budget, the Trump administration pushed to expand the number of beds to more than 51,000.\n\nA significant piece of that recent jump in those detained came not from a flood of migrants crossing the border, but from increasing ICE arrests in communities across the U.S. Since Trump signed an executive order nearly two years ago broadening the types of immigrants considered priories for ICE enforcement, \"administrative\" arrests for violations of civil immigration law have risen 44 percent.\n\nA boy carries a picture Jakelin Caal while her coffin is carried to the cemetery in San Antonio Secortez, Guatemala, on Dec. 25, 2018. Johan Ordonez / AFP - Getty Images\n\nTroubles with medical care in ICE detention began long before Trump's election. In the late 2000s, a series of exposes led the agency to overhaul detention standards and set up more rigorous oversight.\n\nDora Schriro helped put those in place as the founding director of ICE's Office of Detention Policy and Planning, formed under Obama. The standards focused on increasing transparency and oversight and ensuring that only those who presented an immediate risk were detained. She said the changes lowered the risk of harm in detention, too. It was \"good policy and good practice,\" she said.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to curtail and even shutter the office she founded as it pushed for a quick expansion of detention, which Schriro highlights as a pattern within the agency.\n\n\"There are these whiplash changes in policy and practice but without any of the planning and preparation,\" Schriro said. Whatever one thinks of the detention policies of a given administration, she said, \"it's the lack of readiness\" that poses the greatest risks.\n\nFelipe Gomez Alonzo on Dec. 12, 2018 near his half-sister's home in Yalambojoch, Guatemala. Catarina Gomez / via AP\n\nPoor planning and oversight can prove fatal, according to a string of reports from both advocates and DHS's own watchdog.\n\nA report released this summer by a group of human-rights advocates asserted that ICE provided \"dangerously substandard care in immigration detention.\" The problems included delays, incompetence and botched emergency care that they believe contributed to the deaths of 15 immigrants between December 2015 and April 2017.\n\n\"We uncovered a pretty shocking picture of inadequate, substandard care,\" said Clara Long, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch who co-authored the report.\n\nIn late 2017, the DHS inspector general found \"problems that undermine the protection of detainees' rights, their humane treatment, and the provision of a safe and healthy environment\" at four facilities. A second audit said that ICE failed to adequately inspect and monitor the more than 200 federal, local and private facilities it uses across the country. Some problems \"remained unaddressed for years,\" according to the report, in which some within ICE described higher-ups as \"reluctantly responsive\" to addressing issues.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen is sworn in before testifying to the House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Department of Homeland Security on Capitol Hill on Dec. 20, 2018. Joshua Roberts / Reuters\n\nAn ICE spokesperson told NBC News in a statement that it is ramping up its \"already robust inspections program,\" and plans to do follow-up inspections to address \"areas of concern.\"\n\nThe agency said it is \"confident in conditions and high standards of care at its detention facilities,\" and that immigrants get medical, dental and mental health screenings upon arrival, follow-ups within two weeks, and access to round-the-clock emergency care.\n\nThe spokesperson added that many detainees arrive with medical conditions, and may never have received treatment before being detained.\n\nNew details emerging\n\nThis summer, Hernandez's death brought renewed scrutiny to ICE's detention facilities, spurring a group of Democratic lawmakers to demand that the agency comply with a Congressional mandate to release information within 90 days of any death.\n\nOn Dec. 19, the agency released reports on six people who died in 2018, including Hernandez.\n\nDocuments show she requested asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego on May 9, and was taken into CBP custody. Four days later she was transferred to ICE.\n\nIn the week prior to her death, she was moved four times: from California to Arizona, then to Texas and finally to New Mexico, where she was rushed to the hospital upon arriving on May 17. She was dehydrated, starving and feverish, according to details released by ICE. Doctors discovered that, in addition to untreated HIV, she was in septic shock. She died on May 25.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly 200 days since Roxsana Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s death and we still don\u2019t have any answers. That\u2019s why Senators @tomudall, @MartinHeinrich and I are demanding her full and complete death review be released. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) December 12, 2018\n\nAn independent autopsy disputed the initial determination that Hernandez died from cardiac arrest, finding that she likely died from complications due to severe dehydration and HIV \u2014 and that her body showed evidence of \"physical abuse.\"\n\nAdvocates, including the attorney representing the families of Hernandez and three other immigrants who died in custody, said the newly released documents lack important details and a critical analysis about the deaths.\n\nThis summer, NBC News submitted a records request for the death reviews of all detainees who have passed away in the past two years. ICE has not yet fulfilled that request, making it difficult to get a complete picture of the deaths.\n\nThe following details of the deaths come from publicly released reports, autopsies, investigation files obtained by NBC News, as well as documents obtained by advocates. In some cases, documents show troubling delays in providing care to detainees with serious medical conditions, from diabetes and hypertension to mental illness. ICE's own internal reviews found that the agency fell short in providing adequate medical attention to immigrants in its care.\n\nSince January 2017, five men have taken their lives while in ICE custody. Three of the men were mentally ill and had spent days or weeks in segregation or solitary confinement.\n\nIn March 2017, Osmar Epifanio Gonzalez-Gadba fashioned a noose from a bedsheet and hung himself in a cell at the Adelanto Detention Center in California. Leading up to his death, the 32-year-old Nicaraguan asylum seeker was in a segregation cell, and had become withdrawn and began hallucinating, according to an ICE detainee death review, which found the facility failed to follow proper protocols in his care.\n\nAn unannounced visit to Adelanto by the inspector general a year later found nooses in cells, harsh use of segregation and \"untimely and inadequate medical care.\"\n\nWeeks after Gonzalez-Gadba's death, Jeancarlo Jimenez-Joseph was in solitary confinement at the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia when a fellow detainee heard him tell officers \"I'm suffering from psychosis,\" according to a state death investigation obtained by NBC News. In May 2017, the day before the 27-year-old was scheduled to see a doctor, he hung himself in his cell with a bedsheet.\n\nA year later at the same facility, Efrain Romero De La Rosa, a 40-year-old with schizophrenia, had been in solitary confinement for three weeks when he began to hear voices. He claimed he was the \"Anti-Christ,\" according to ICE records. He was transferred to a treatment facility for a month and a half. A week after returning to Stewart, De La Rosa was put again into isolation as punishment for making \"sexual proposals.\" On July 10, three weeks into isolation, he took his own life.\n\nA sixth detainee died in an apparent suicide in the Cairo airport, according to ICE, while being deported back to Eritrea. An ICE spokesperson said the agency did count it as an in-custody death because he had been handed over to Egyptian officials.\n\nSeveral others died of cardiac issues.\n\nHuy Chi Tran, 47, arrived from Vietnam in 1984 and became a legal permanent resident. ICE records show Tran also suffered from schizophrenia. After being convicted of assault, he was stripped of his green card and ordered deported in the mid-2000s.\n\nVietnamese immigrants like Tran who arrived before 1993 have been considered protected from deportation since 2008, when the U.S. and Vietnam signed a repatriation agreement. Over the last year the Trump administration has moved to reverse those protections, detaining Vietnamese regardless of when they arrived amid a wider effort to deport immigrants whose countries would not previously take them back.\n\nICE picked Tran up in May 2018 from an Arizona prison where he was serving time for disorderly conduct. He was slated to be deported before he died of a heart attack in June.\n\nIn a statement, ICE said, \"The U.S. position is that every country has an international legal obligation to accept its nationals that another country seeks to remove, expel, or deport.\"\n\nSome suffered from drug withdrawals.\n\nWhen Sergio Alonso Lopez, 55, entered Adelanto in February 2017, he had been undergoing methadone treatment for 17 years.\n\nA doctor at Adelanto ordered him to taper off methadone over 12 days, an ICE review shows. Staff failed to administer several doses of methadone. A nurse told investigators there was little direction about prioritizing patients and too few staff.\n\nOn April 1, Lopez was rushed to the hospital. Officers cuffed his swollen leg to a hospital bed. Doctors treated him for cirrhosis, sepsis and serious internal bleeding. On the afternoon of April 13, he began vomiting blood. One officer with the Geo Group, a private prison company, guarding him tipped Lopez's head so he would not choke, while another ran into the hall to yell \"Code Blue,\" according to the report. Lopez died three hours later of massive internal bleeding, cirrhosis, and substance abuse.\n\nThe Geo Group did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSeven months later, at a facility 1,000 miles away in Denver, the Geo Group would receive another detainee with a history of methadone use, an Iranian-born father of two named Kamyar Samimi.\n\nIn November 2017, ICE agents arrested the 64-year-old outside his suburban Denver home. He had lived in the U.S. since 1976.\n\nTwelve years earlier, Samimi was convicted of a possession of a gram or less of cocaine, a low-level felony that stripped him of his green card. Soon after his arrest, he was taken to the Aurora Detention Facility, which has a history of substandard medical care.\n\nIn 2012, a 46-year-old Gabon man died from a heart attack after medical staff failed to immediately call 911. An ICE investigation of his death found he \"did not have access to appropriate medical care\" at the facility. This summer, two immigration groups filed a complaint with DHS claiming Aurora's \"inadequate medical and mental health care\" threatened the \"health and well being of its detainees.\"\n\nSamimi had been taken off methadone upon arriving in detention, according to records reviewed by NBC News. His autopsy stated that Samimi \"had been 'clean' for two weeks in the ICE facility and was being watched for withdrawal, dehydration, nausea and vomiting.\" He was also on suicide watch.\n\nOn the morning of Dec. 2, he began spitting up blood, according to the autopsy. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. While rare, \"methadone withdrawal cannot be ruled out as the cause of death,\" the coroner noted in his report.\n\nSoon after his death, the ACLU of Colorado began looking into what happened to Samimi. \"Mr. Samimi's arrest, detention, and death in custody display the inhumanity of our current federal immigration policies,\" said ACLU Attorney Arash Jahanian.\n\nOne year has passed since Samimi died. \"We are still looking for answers,\" Jahanian said."

(Dec. 26) AP\n\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left, speaks with Border Patrol agents near a newly fortified border wall structure on Oct. 26, 2018, in Calexico, Calif. (Photo: Gregory Bull, AP)\n\nAn 8-year-old boy from Guatemala died in government custody early Tuesday, the second immigrant child to die in detention this month.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said the boy, identified by the Guatemalan consul in Phoenix as Felipe Gomez Alonzo, died shortly after midnight after almost a week in custody.\n\nThe boy showed \u201csigns of potential illness\u201d Monday morning and was taken with his father to a hospital in Alamogordo, New Mexico, CBP said. There, he was diagnosed with a cold and a fever, prescribed amoxicillin and Ibuprofen and released Monday afternoon after being held 90 minutes for observation, the agency said.\n\nThe boy was returned to the hospital Monday evening with nausea and vomiting and died hours later, CBP said. The hospital \u2013 the Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center \u2013 declined to comment, citing privacy regulations.\n\n\u201cThis is a tragic loss,\" said CBP Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan in a statement. \"On behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, our deepest sympathies go out to the family.\"\n\nThe official cause of death is not known, and in accordance with CBP policy, the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility will conduct a review. CBP notified the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general and the Guatemalan government.\n\nOscar Padilla, the Guatemalan consul in Phoenix, said the boy's father told him the two were traveling from their home in Nent\u00f3n, a village about 280 miles from Guatemala City. They planned to go to Johnson City, Tennessee. The consul identified the father as 47-year-old Agustin Gomez, and said he remains in U.S. Border Patrol custody.\n\nBorder patrol apprehended the father and son on Dec. 18 for illegal entry, 3.29 miles west of the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry in El Paso, Texas. Agents detained them at that port's processing center, logging six welfare checks until Thursday when they moved them to the El Paso Border Patrol Station. There, the agency said it logged another 17 welfare checks before transferring them to Alamogordo Station on Sunday to finalize processing because of capacity levels at El Paso.\n\nAgents did several welfare checks at Alamogordo before a processing agent noticed Gomez Alonzo's symptoms at 9 a.m. local time Monday. At all three places they were detained, CBP said it gave the father and son food and drinks, as well as showers or personal hygiene products at the last two stations.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, Border Patrol said it is doing secondary medical checks on all children in custody and reviewing its policies on detaining children under age 10. CBP is also looking to relieve capacity issues in Border Patrol stations and checkpoints in El Paso Sector.\n\nThe incoming chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, gave his condolences to the family and called for an investigation in a statement.\n\n\"The Administration\u2019s policy of turning people away from legal ports of entry, otherwise known as metering, is putting families and children in great danger,\" Castro said. \"With two deaths that we know about just in the last few weeks, Congress will continue to press the Department of Homeland Security until we get answers to all our questions.\u201d\n\nAlamogordo, where the boy died, is about 90 miles from the U.S.-Mexican border at El Paso, Texas. Ruben Garcia, director of El Paso\u2019s Annunciation House, said Tuesday that he had no reason to believe his shelter had served the family but was waiting for further details about what happened.\n\nA spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., whose district along the U.S.-Mexican border includes Alamogordo, could not be reached Tuesday.\n\nXochitl Torres Small, a Democrat who will represent the district starting in January, called for a thorough and transparent investigation into the children\u2019s deaths and more medical resources along the border.\n\n\u201cThis is inexcusable,\u201d she said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cInstead of immediately acting to keep children and all of us safe along our border, this administration forced a government shutdown over a wall.\u201d\n\nJakelin Caal Maquin, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl, died this month in El Paso after being apprehended by border agents.\n\nMore: 7-year-old Guatemalan migrant girl in Border Patrol custody dies from high fever, seizures; feds fault father\n\nMore: Body of Jakelin Caal, who died in US Border Patrol custody, arrives in Guatemala\n\nMore: Girl who died in Border Patrol custody fled impoverished Guatemala village\n\nJakelin and her father crossed the border in New Mexico on Dec. 6, along with 161 other migrants. They were set to travel by bus to the Lordsburg Border Patrol station in New Mexico when her father, Nery Gilberto Caal, told Border Patrol agents she was sick. She was transported to a children's hospital in El Paso where she died Dec. 8.\n\nThe White House said it had no responsibility in the \"horrible, tragic\" situation.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection, which did not inform Congress about Jakelin's death for days, said it would follow a list of procedures when someone dies in its custody. The procedures include notifying lawmakers within 24 hours of a death.\n\n@SecNielsen this is the second child in a month. What is going on at @DHSgov? Does @HouseHomeland have to start subpoenaing you to get the truth? \u2014 Rep. Lou Correa (@RepLouCorrea) December 25, 2018\n\nRep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., expressed dismay at the death of the 8-year-old boy Tuesday afternoon. He tweeted to Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, \u201cThis is the second child in a month. What is going on at @DHSgov? Does @HouseHomeland have to start subpoenaing you to get the truth?\u201d\n\nOther Democrats responded with criticism of border policies, including Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.\n\n\"Heartbroken and sickened by this news,\" Heinrich said on Twitter. \"I am urgently demanding more details, but the Trump administration must be held accountable for this child\u2019s death and all the lives they have put in danger with their intentional chaos and disregard for human life.\"\n\nSeveral critics said the death was especially troubling given the Christmas holiday.\n\n\"The news of another child death in CBP custody is heartbreaking, especially on Christmas,\" Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., tweeted. \"We must demand a full and thorough account of what happened to this 8-year-old boy.\"\n\n\"Tragic news this Christmas Day,\" Rep. Nanette D. Barrag\u00e1n, D-Calif., remarked on Twitter. \"Another death of a child in CBP custody? This is unacceptable. It is not ok that children are dying, that they are separated from their parents and don\u2019t receive proper medical screenings and treatment. Congress must act. Real oversight coming 1/3.\"\n\nContributing: Kristin Lam and The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/12/25/border-death-guatemalan-boy-8-dies-government-custody/2411523002/"

  "text": "The Trump administration has proposed selling 70 acres of an important wildlife conservation area adjacent to California\u2019s San Bernardino National Forest to a limestone mining company after it dumped mineral waste materials on a portion of the federal land without permission. The Bureau of Land Management is looking to sell the public lands to Omya Inc., a multinational corporation that operates a large limestone quarry in the Lucerne Valley. The land is part of a designated area that protects bighorn sheep and other wildlife. In December 2005, the federal agency issued a notice of trespass after discovering that the quarry operation placed waste rock, known as overburden, on some 9 acres of federal land. The BLM says the planned sale would fulfill a settlement it reached with Omya in 2011 over the unauthorized use of the land, allowing the company to continue mining calcium carbonate in the area through 2055. But conservationists view the proposal as the Trump administration rewarding a company for bad behavior. And the proposal raises obvious questions about the seriousness of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s repeated assurances that he would not pawn off federal lands. \u201cWe are seeing a troubling pattern developing: Ryan Zinke says one thing to the public and does another for special interests and corporations,\u201d Chris Saeger, executive director of the liberal environmental group Western Values Project, said in an email. \u201cWhen the Interior Secretary repeatedly states that he will not sell public lands, the American public expects him to keep his word.\u201d This is at least the third time the BLM has eyed selling federal land under Zinke\u2019s watch. The former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL has painted himself as a fierce advocate of public lands, repeatedly saying that he opposes disposing of them, either by sale or transferring control to states. In August, facing widespread public outrage, Interior scrapped a proposal to sell more than 1,600 acres that until recently were protected as part of Utah\u2019s Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. The agency claimed in a statement to The Salt Lake Tribune that Zinke \u201cdid not see the proposal before it went out and was not happy about it.\u201d Still on the table, however, is a BLM plan to unload 200 acres in Emery County, Utah, that power company PacifiCorp hopes to incorporate into its Hunter power plant.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke speaks at a press conference at the Environmental Protection Agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe land the BLM is looking to part with in California sits just north of Omya\u2019s White Knob Quarry and about 8 miles northwest of Big Bear Lake. The area is part of a 39,000-acre chunk of public land called the Granite Mountain Wildlife Linkage Area of Critical Environmental Concern, which connects another designated ACEC to the north with the San Bernardino National Forest to the south. ACECs protect important historical, cultural or natural resources and require special management. In its environmental assessment for the proposed sale, the BLM notes that the Granite Mountain Wildlife Linkage ACEC is \u201ccritical for bighorn sheep, golden eagles, desert tortoise, prairie falcons and several other species\u201d and home to \u201cnumerous rare and sensitive plants.\u201d But these plants and animals have not been documented in the acres targeted for sale, according to the draft plan. Paul Malsch, director of sustainability for Omya, said in an email that the encroachment onto public lands occurred adjacent to where the company was placing excavated rock and soil on its own private property and that at no time was critical habitat affected. \u201cWe see this resolution and sale as a non-political 13-year process that has been moving forward under three different administrations,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a formality perspective, we\u2019ve dotted every \u2018I\u2019, crossed every \u2019T, and met the requirements asked of us by every layer of government involved, which included public hearings and extended comment periods.\u201d Malsch noted that biological surveys an environmental consultant conducted on behalf of Omya in 2012 indicate that the area does not contain any of the species protected by the Granite Mountain Wildlife ACEC. \u201cWe understand the need to protect critical habitat, which is why our area of purchase is outside of the critical areas,\u201d he said. The BLM proposal would amend the 70-acre area\u2019s designation from a protected site to general public land. The agency has the authority to consider selling public land under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, but only if the land meets certain criteria, including: being \u201cdifficult and uneconomic to manage\u201d; if the land is \u201cno longer required\u201d for the specific purpose for which it was acquired; and if its sale would \u201cserve important public objectives,\u201d including the \u201cexpansion of communities and economic development.\u201d The agency noted in a release last month that the Omya\u2019s mining operation employs 50 people and generates more than $800,000 annually in county taxes. \u201cThe BLM strives to be a good neighbor in the communities we serve, and part of that is listening to what the public has to say about this proposed land sale and what it could mean for the area,\u201d said Beth Ransel, manager of the BLM California Desert District. The BLM\u2019s draft plan outlines two other alternatives. One is to take no action, a move that would leave Omya responsible for submitting a mining operation plan for the full area. The other calls for selling 45 acres, which would allow the federal government to maintain ownership of three wetlands and other sensitive habitat within the 70-acre parcel. In addition to the wetland areas, which total about three-fourths of an acre, there are roughly 3.4 acres of ephemeral stream habitat, that is, streams that flow only after precipitation.\n\nThese are important conservation lands. They belong to the American public. Nada Culver of the BLM Action Center at The Wilderness Society"

Discouraged by the long wait to apply for asylum through official ports of entry, many migrants from recent caravans are choosing to cross the U.S. border wall and hand themselves in to border patrol agents. (AP Photo/Daniel Ochoa de Olza)\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Mexico\u2019s foreign affairs ministry has formally asked the United States government to conduct a thorough investigation into a Jan. 1 incident in which U.S. agents fired tear gas into Mexico to stop crossing migrants.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the ministry said through its embassy that it lamented any violent acts along its border. It reiterated its commitment to the safety of migrants.\n\nIn the first hours of the new year, about 150 migrants attempted to breach the border fence in Tijuana. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that agents fired gas at migrants throwing rocks. It said it was investigating.\n\nBut an Associated Press photographer at the scene only saw rocks thrown after agents fired gas as migrants scaled the fence.\n\nThe confrontation was at least the second time in a little over a month that U.S. authorities have fired tear gas into Tijuana. The action drew sharp criticism from politicians and activists on both sides of the border and raised questions about the use of force against migrants."

  "text": "\n\nThe \"Black Girl Magic\" campaign was designed, managed and funded by the Harris County Democratic Party. It included 19 African American women on the ballot, including the 17 sworn in Tuesday. (Harris County Democratic Party)\n\nDemocratic candidates unseated more than 50 incumbent Republican judges in the largest jurisdiction in Texas during last November\u2019s elections.\n\nOn Tuesday, the newly elected judiciary for Harris County was sworn in, including the 17 African American women who were part of the \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brand new day in Harris County!\u201d the local Democratic Party posted Tuesday on social media.\n\nHarris County, which includes Houston, is one of the most diverse counties in the nation, according to Harris County Democratic Party Chair Lillie Schechter.\n\nWith a population exceeding 4 million, it is also the third most populous county in the United States.\n\nSchechter called Tuesday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony \u201cfitting.\u201d The county \u201cfinally has a judiciary that truly reflects the different faces of the people that come before it,\u201d she said in a statement to The Washington Post.\n\nIt\u2019s a brand new day in Harris County! Swearing in of the Newly Elected County Officials and Judges. Today we usher in a new era of representative government and progressive leadership in Harris County. Posted by Harris County Democratic Party on Tuesday, January 1, 2019\n\nToday marks a new era in #HarrisCounty government.\n\n\n\nI congratulate Harris County Judge @Lina4HC, Commissioner @AdrianGarciaHTX, and all other officials, including a record number of newly elected judges, who were sworn-in. pic.twitter.com/FbEbrHqCgC \u2014 Sylvester Turner (@SylvesterTurner) January 1, 2019\n\nThe \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d campaign \u2014 designed, managed and funded by the Harris County Democratic Party \u2014 came to fruition after the primary election, once the women were all on the ballot.\n\n\u201cWe looked around the room one day and thought: This is something special,\u201d criminal court Judge Erica Hughes said, dubbing it \u201cdivine intervention.\u201d\n\nThe women then came together hoping to inspire individuals to get out the vote.\n\n\u201cMost people see our photograph and think, \u2018Hmm, that\u2019s not what I was expecting,\u2019 \u201d Judge Lori Chambers Gray, another \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d candidate, told The Post. \u201cYou don\u2019t think of African American women as making up the U.S. judiciary.\u201d\n\nThe barriers that may once have been in place for women are no longer as prominent, Gray said, adding the new judges bring knowledge of the law and also of the citizenry.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about a constitution that truly includes everyone, that\u2019s really important,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso among newly sworn-in is Lina Hidalgo, the first Latina and first woman sworn in as Harris County\u2019s chief executive, which is referred to as county judge.\n\nHidalgo defeated incumbent Republican Ed Emmett, who served as county judge more than 10 years. The 27-year-old Colombian American voiced the importance of diversity throughout her campaign.\n\n\u201cWe made history in Harris County on Nov. 6 by electing a talented group of individuals who reflect the people and communities we serve,\u201d Hidalgo said in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nThe demographics in Harris County have shifted dramatically in recent years. According to recent census data, nearly 20 percent of Harris County\u2019s population is African American, and more than 40 percent is Hispanic.\n\n\u201cYou had a judicial bench that did not look like the community. People who had been there for a long time were basically living in a bubble,\u201d Judge Dedra Davis said during an interview with The Post. Davis unseated Brent Gamble (R) in the November election after he spent two decades on the bench.\n\nSome Republican members of the judiciary have been critical of the freshman judges, the Houston Chronicle reported. Many campaigned on criminal justice reform platforms, causing the judges to worry about lax rulings coming from the bench.\n\nAfter one Houston juvenile court judge lost his reelection bid, he released a handful of defendants who appeared in his courtroom. Why? \u201cThis is obviously what the voters wanted,\u201d an attorney heard him say.\n\nOther ousted judges chimed in, noting the \u201cmental torment\u201d that accompanies professional decision-making. Republican Judge Marc Carter, a former Army military intelligence officer, highlighted the emotional toll of serious felony cases.\n\nHughes, who also has a military background, said her peers bring wide-ranging life and professional experience to the bench.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re mindful of and ready for,\u201d she said.\n\n[What Texas primary voting tells us about November]\n\nThe 17 women \u2014 who began their four-year terms Wednesday in the county\u2019s civil, criminal, family and probate courts \u2014 were part of a broader Democratic Party success in Harris County.\n\nAccording to Schechter, of the 75 elected Harris County judgeships, all but one opening unseated a Republican. Several Democratic candidates also defeated incumbents for top county leadership positions, as well as state representative and congressional seats.\n\nThe county clerk\u2019s office recorded November voter turnout at its highest for a nonpresidential election. Democratic early voting surged statewide, too.\n\nWhile the party enjoyed successes locally, other races went to Republicans. Texas voters narrowly reelected incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz (R) over Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), but incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott (R) won reelection by a wide margin.\n\nRead more\n\nU.S. military tweets, then deletes, a New Year\u2019s Eve joke about dropping bombs\n\nFamily of American arrested in Russia on spy charges fears for his safety\n\nAn armed man was headed to church to \u2018fulfill a prophecy.\u2019 Police stopped him."

  "text": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nOn the seventh day of the partial shutdown of the federal government, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will make life even harder for federal workers. On Friday, Trump issued a new rule that freezes a planned 2.1 percent raise for federal workers that was scheduled to kick in at the start of 2019. Now, federal workers\u2019 salaries will remain flat next year.\n\nTrump\u2019s new executive order comes as 800,000 federal employees are not receiving paychecks\u2014some because they\u2019ve been sent home on furlough, but many required to still be working their jobs as normal, just without receiving an income. Also on Friday, the Trump administration offered federal workers a sample letter to send to their landlord if they have trouble paying rent thanks to the shutdown.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to freeze the pay increase predates the shutdown, with the administration announcing its opposition to the raises earlier this year. Still, the timing of the change during the middle of the shutdown might make life harder for employees who had planned for that promised raise. \u201cIt is shocking that federal employees are taking yet another financial hit,\u201d Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said of Trump\u2019s latest move. \u201cAs if missed paychecks and working without pay were not enough, now they have been told that they don\u2019t even deserve a modest pay increase.\u201d"

  "text": "\n\nBree Newsome of Charlotte, N.C., climbs a flagpole to remove the Confederate battle flag at a Confederate monument in front of the Statehouse in Columbia, S.C., on Saturday, June, 27, 2015. She was taken into custody when she came down. The flag was raised again by capitol workers about 45 minutes later. Newsome joined a long history of female activists who used disobedience to further their causes. (Bruce Smith)\n\nConnie Hassett-Walker is associate professor of criminal justice at Kean University and author of \" Guns on the Internet: Online Gun Communities, First Amendment Protections .\"\n\nSmash! Smash! Smash!\n\nPatrons of the Carey Hotel bar in Wichita, Kansas may well have heard that sound on Dec. 27, 1900 as Prohibition activist Carrie Nation smashed up liquor bottles and glasses with a hatchet, causing several thousand dollars\u2019 worth of damage before she was arrested. Nation didn\u2019t stay in jail long, but the incident made her famous as a one-woman anti-alcohol wrecking crew. Her actions remind us how central disobedience has been to women\u2019s quest throughout history to be heard.\n\nNation was part of a larger movement, the Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union, founded in 1874 by women concerned over the damage that alcohol caused both to their families and society at large. Because women at the time had far fewer rights than men did \u008d\u2014 they could not vote, easily divorce or control how many children they had, for instance \u2014 a wife with a husband who drank too much was vulnerable to having her life ruined.\n\nAnd so, Nation and her fellow activists mobilized. The Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Movement joined forces with other organizations \u2014 the Independent Order of Good Templars and the Kansas State Temperance Union \u2014 to push for state-wide prohibition. The state\u2019s temperance movement gained steam, and in 1880, Kansas adopted a constitutional provision prohibiting the sale or manufacture of \u201cintoxicating liquors,\u201d the first state in the country to do so. The state\u2019s legislature followed suit, passing a law that went into effect the following year making the manufacture of alcohol a misdemeanor.\n\nBut implementation and enforcement were inconsistent, with some bar owners simply ignoring the new laws. Frustrated with slow enforcement of the state\u2019s new alcohol prohibition, Nation took matters into her own hands \u2014 literally, with a hatchet \u2014 and entered the Carey Hotel bar to smash things up. After her release from jail, she continued to travel around smashing up saloons and speaking out about temperance. She passed away in 1911, before nationwide prohibition was enacted in 1920.\n\nProhibition was enacted the same year that the suffrage movement won the right for women to vote in the 19th Amendment. And it wasn\u2019t just timing that the suffragists shared with prohibitionists. The Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union also pushed for other social causes, including women\u2019s suffrage, where civil disobedience played a role. Alice Paul and other suffragists brought their protest about the lack of women\u2019s voting rights to the sidewalk in front of the White House, which got them harassed, arrested and ultimately incarcerated. In 1916, women\u2019s rights activist and social justice crusader Emma Goldman, a mentor to birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger, was arrested in New York City for distributing materials and lecturing about birth control, in violation of the 1873 federal Comstock Act.\n\nThis legacy of disobedience has remained central to women\u2019s political activism. In the mid-1950s, Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks both refused to give up their bus seats to white passengers in violation of state segregation laws, and were subsequently arrested. Parks\u2019s arrest famously kicked off the year-long Montgomery Bus Boycott. And who can forget Bree Newsome, who in 2015 scaled a 30-foot flagpole in front of the South Carolina Statehouse to personally remove its Confederate flag. She was subsequently arrested and charged with defacing a monument.\n\nGloria Steineim once said, \u201cDon\u2019t think about making women fit the world \u2014 think about making the world fit women.\u201d (Steinem has also been arrested for protesting for her beliefs). The lesson modern women and feminists (of all genders) can take from Carrie Nation is that in the fight for what you believe in, sometimes you have to smash things to propel change."

  "text": "The president\u2019s attempts to blame Democrats for the shutdown has gained little traction with the public. About 47 percent of adults hold Mr. Trump responsible for the shutdown, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday. In contrast, about 33 percent blame the Democrats in Congress. The poll was conducted Dec. 21 through 25, mostly after the shutdown went into effect.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions to the contrary, most Democrats support increased funding for border security. Many Senate Democrats, for instance, voted to allocate tens of billions of dollars for security enhancements in 2013, including roughly doubling the size of the border patrol, creating new electronic monitoring systems and even some additional physical barriers at certain points along the border.\n\nBut that money was in the context of a comprehensive immigration overhaul that would have tried to address systemic problems. By contrast, they view Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall as a costly and ineffective proposal. What is more, they have pointed to government accounting documents that show the Trump administration has spent only a fraction of the money allocated by Congress last year for a physical barrier along the border.\n\nWith no endgame in mind, Mr. Trump appears to be boxed in between Democrats who will control the House and have key votes in the Senate and his supporters on the hard right, who have grown more vocal in criticizing him. After administration officials signaled this month that the president was willing to back off his demands for wall funding, the conservative personalities Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh accused the president of being \u201cgutless\u201d and surrendering to Democrats.\n\nTo avoid an immediate hit from his base, Mr. Trump appeared to embrace a short-term strategy, celebrating a premature victory when the House passed a short-term funding bill last week that included the money he wanted for more border security.\n\nTypically in spending negotiations, lawmakers join the president in hammering the opposition party over their position. But other than Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who is a close ally of the president, and a handful of arch-conservative House members, most Republican lawmakers have stayed out of the fray. Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has held off, saying last week that it was up to Democrats and Mr. Trump to reach a deal and only when they did would he hold a vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that we on the Republican side do not want to vote for a bill that the president won\u2019t sign,\u201d Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, told reporters on Thursday after presiding over a minutes-long Senate session."

This year, he was the first president since Bill Clinton to spend Christmas at the White House. Former President George W.

  "text": "One thing of which you can be absolutely sure in this convoluted world is that Donald Trump, American president, does not give a single airborne fuck about you. It doesn't particularly matter who you are, so long as your last name is something other than Trump. (Soon, even that caveat might be tested.) Any fleeting moment's thought he gave to you and your well-being and your future almost certainly popped into his head in relation to how you might best serve his interests. All the world may be a stage, but all its people are just various means to various ends.\n\nSo it's gone with the 800,000-odd federal workers who have been furloughed, or are working without pay, thanks to the government shutdown Trump caused single-handedly. Once upon a time, he readily accepted full responsibility for this\u2014until he realized that was a big-old self-own and, inevitably, attempted to shove that televised event down the memory hole. Now, it's \"the Democrat Shutdown,\" and he, Donald Trump, is the Brave Man of Principle left \"all alone\" in the White House this Christmas. \"(Poor me)!\"\n\nThe Washington Post Getty Images\n\nThe World's Most Powerful Man took a break from offering unusual Christmas greetings this holiday season to suggest \"many\" furloughed federal workers want him to hold out and keep the government shut down until he gets funding for his Big, Beautiful Wall. No serious person believes the wall will halt undocumented immigration or the flow of illegal drugs. It stretches credulity, to say the least, that some significant number of ordinary people are willing to go without pay for weeks at a time\u2014and often have their lives and financial futures pulled to the brink\u2014to help the president build White America's Giant Middle-Finger to the World.\n\nTrump himself seconded this notion by, one day later, suggesting the same group of people were mostly Democrats:\n\nHave the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking,Gang Members & Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2018\n\nSo now they don't support shutting down the government for The Big, Beautiful Wall, and the president is just using their lives as bargaining chips after enraged resentment-mongers on talk radio and Fox News came after him for failing to build The Giant Middle Finger. It's almost like he does not care at all about these people, an idea his administration seems eager to drive home. The Office of Personnel Management published some advice for furloughed federal workers, flagged by CNN's Bill Weir, that can only be described as Let Them Eat Paint.\n\nTrump Administration tweets out advice to furloughed federal workers who can\u2019t afford to pay their bills. Among the tips: Offer to do painting or carpentry for your landlord in lieu of rent. https://t.co/xAJTI0Nea4 \u2014 Bill Weir (@BillWeirCNN) December 28, 2018\n\nHere's the form letter in question:\n\nDear (Name of Company or individual with whom you have spoken)\n\nThis is to confirm our conversation of (date) in which we discussed a temporary reduction in my monthly rent.\n\nAs we discussed, I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency. Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my rent, along with my other expenses. \u00b7\n\nAs we had agreed in our conversation, I will be able to make regular payments in the amount of $_______. I realize that I will be responsible to pay the remainder of the payments and, when I return to work, I will contact you immediately to work out a plan to take care of the reduced payments. I will keep in touch with you to keep you informed about my income status and I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments.\n\nI appreciate your willingness to work with me and your understanding during this difficult time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Pawn in King Lear's Parlour Game\n\nApparently, these letters were first sent out by OPM during the Obama administration. That's a stunning indictment of Beltway decision-makers' detachment from rank-and-file employees, although President Obama did not single-handedly cause a shutdown as Trump is now.\n\nSAUL LOEB Getty Images\n\nIt must be so gratifying to work for the United States federal government for years only to be thrown under the bus and, when you peek out from under the wheels, be told you should work out an indentured-servitude agreement with your landlord to play your part in the president's Big, Beautiful Con. But the suggestion public servants take a second job as pro-bono contractors wasn't necessarily the most detached prescription. The OPM also repeatedly advised employees who are struggling to make ends meet to retain a personal attorney. And who, exactly, is going to pay for that? Maybe these folks can repaint the offices at Dewey, Cheatem and Howe.\n\nThere are legitimate questions around whether Trump even really wants to build The Wall at all, or whether he merely enjoys talking about The Wall because he feels like it's a Winning Issue with The Base. Certainly, no one's told him it would actually serve its purported function\u2014unless you count the lucky souls who, in a tradition dating back to those heady days filming The Apprentice, are tasked with reverse-engineering reality to conform to the delusory visions of the world continually belching forth from Donald Trump's gut.\n\nNo, The Wall is mostly just a circus act to get the people going. Unfortunately, more and more of us are getting pulled out of the audience and onto the stage every day.\n\nThis post has been updated to reflect that OPM first published the letters under the Obama administration."

Additionally, all travel is canceled for furloughed employees, according to the notice.\n\nCongress adjourned over the weekend, meaning the partial government shutdown will extend into next week. Members were initially slated to return to Capitol Hill on Thursday to continue funding negotiations. However, the House announced Thursday there will be no votes this week and the Senate isn\u2019t slated to meet for votes until Jan. 2.\n\nThe Interior and Energy departments have already shuttered due to the funding lapse.\n\nIn the past, a shutdown at the EPA meant the closure of 134 facilities across the country.\n\nNearly 14,000 employees would be furloughed under a shutdown, according to the EPA\u2019s contingency plan. Only national security and emergency staff will remain on under a shutdown.\n\nActivities that are likely to be halted in the case of a shutdown include hazardous waste cleanup efforts at Superfund sites, on-site inspections at power plants, reviews of toxic substances and pesticides, and responses to Freedom of Information Act requests."

  "text": "President Trump is planning on cutting The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which will take food out of the mouths of his most loyal supporters \u2014 white men.\n\n\u201cAt the direction of President Donald J. Trump,\u201d U.S. Department of Agriculture chief, Sonny Perdue, said in a press release issued last Thursday, \u201cwe are taking steps to restore integrity to SNAP and move people toward self-sufficiency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIf you recall, the president received 62 percent of the white male vote back in 2016 \u2014 as he paraded around from rally to rally in his floppy red ball cap promising to return the country to them, or, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d His followers, mostly white, salivated at their chance to experience social mobility while Trump was in office. Now, many may be taking a huge step backwards: How can you work hard and advance your life on an empty stomach? And who knew white men relied on food stamps more than any other group?\n\nI grew up in a low-income neighborhood in Baltimore \u2014 where the population is mostly black \u2014 and lived both in and around public housing most of my life, so I\u2019m very familiar with food stamps.

  "text": "President Trump is planning on cutting The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which will take food out of the mouths of his most loyal supporters \u2014 white men.\n\n\u201cAt the direction of President Donald J. Trump,\u201d U.S. Department of Agriculture chief, Sonny Perdue, said in a press release issued last Thursday, \u201cwe are taking steps to restore integrity to SNAP and move people toward self-sufficiency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIf you recall, the president received 62 percent of the white male vote back in 2016 \u2014 as he paraded around from rally to rally in his floppy red ball cap promising to return the country to them, or, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d His followers, mostly white, salivated at their chance to experience social mobility while Trump was in office. Now, many may be taking a huge step backwards: How can you work hard and advance your life on an empty stomach?

  "text": "(CNN) As the government shutdown loomed over the holidays, heads of federal agencies and departments overseeing health and public assistance services tweeted that, regardless of what was happening in Washington, they were attending, as much as possible, to business as usual.\n\nIn a statement over the holiday weekend, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said, \"There may be a lapse in funding for the federal government, but that will not relieve USDA of its responsibilities for safeguarding life and property through the critical services we provide.\"\n\nAccording to the statement, 61% of the Department of Agriculture's employees would continue to work through the first week of the shutdown, but that number would decrease the longer the shutdown continues.\n\nSome of the agency's offices to be hit hardest by the closure include the office of Food and Nutrition Services that oversees the Child Nutrition, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program forWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC). By the end of the fifth day of the shutdown , staffing will be cut by 95%.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the department website displayed a message stating, \"Due to a lapse in federal funding, this USDA website will not be actively updated. Once funding has been re-established, online operations will continue.\"\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nEligible households will still receive monthly SNAP benefits for January. But other domestic nutrition assistance programs such as the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, WIC, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations will only be operational based on available resources. Additional federal funds and commodities will not be provided during the shutdown.\n\nChild nutrition programs including School Lunch, School Breakfast, Child and Adult Care Feeding, Summer Food Service and Special Milk will continue through February.\n\nDuring a lapse in government funding, we will be providing as many of our core services as we can using existing resources. We're keeping up our duty to \"Do Right and Feed Everyone,\" as @SecretarySonny says.\n\n\n\nMore info here: https://t.co/jAI9UJDhlg \u2014 Dept. of Agriculture (@USDA) December 22, 2018\n\nAs the government enters a lapse in funding, we will be maintaining key services we provide to keep people safe. That includes meat, poultry, and processed egg inspection services. Part of our mission to protect the U.S. food supply.\n\n\n\nHere's more: https://t.co/jAI9UJDhlg \u2014 Dept. of Agriculture (@USDA) December 22, 2018\n\nThe Department of Agriculture will maintain meat, poultry and processed egg inspection services. Inspections of food imports and exports will also continue throughout the shutdown.\n\nAn end to the shutdown didn't appear to be in sight Tuesday, as President Trump dug his heels in over the budget. After a call with US Troops, the President said, \"I can't tell you when the government is going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they would like to call it.\"\n\nProtecting and enhancing the well being of Americans\n\nMost of the department is funded through the fiscal year, and those positions and divisions that are being placed on leave are funded through Agriculture and Interior appropriations.\n\nFor the Department of Health and Human Services, among the activities that would continue are Indian Health Service clinics, response efforts from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and specific activities under the Food and Drug Administration, including responding to emergencies and managing high-risk recalls.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar reassured the country that the department's public health missions are being maintained, despite the holiday and shutdown.\n\n\"Thousands of my @HHSGov colleagues routinely work weekends and holidays, and many are tasked with working through shutdowns, to fulfill our mission to protect and enhance the health and well-being of all Americans. I'm grateful for their commitment & proud to be their colleague,\" Azar said on Twitter.\n\nThousands of my @HHSGov colleagues routinely work weekends and holidays, and many are tasked with working through shutdowns, to fulfill our mission to protect and enhance the health and well-being of all Americans. I'm grateful for their commitment & proud to be their colleague. \u2014 Secretary Alex Azar (@SecAzar) December 24, 2018\n\nAccording to the Department, the FDA's missions that are critical to public health, such as tracking and responding to outbreaks related to foodborne illness and the flu, supporting high-risk food and medical product recalls, pursuing criminal and certain civil investigations when public health may be at risk, screening food and medical products imported into the United States, and addressing other critical public health issues will continue through the shutdown.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb expressed his gratitude to FDA employees who were continuing to work through the closure. \"I'm so proud to lead an agency driven by so many dedicated people. Working on a holiday, and through a government shutdown, to fulfill their commitment to America,\" Gottlieb said on Twitter.\n\nMore pictures from front lines of #FDA work today to protect consumers and advance critical public health activities.

The message says, in part, that \"agency operations continue to the extent permitted by law, such as activities necessary to address imminent threats to the safety of human life and activities funded by carryover user fee funds.\"\n\nAccording to HHS, about 41% of the FDA's staff would be furloughed as of Wednesday, December 26.\n\nThe Department said that approximately 65% of staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry will not be returning to work that day either."

  "text": "FILE - In this Jan. 25, 2017, file photo, an agent from the border patrol, observes near the Mexico-US border fence, on the Mexican side, separating the towns of Anapra, Mexico and Sunland Park, N.M. An 8-year-old boy from Guatemala died in government custody early Tuesday, Dec. 25, 2018, U.S. immigration authorities said. (AP Photo/Christian Torres, File)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. Customs and Border Protection ordered medical checks on every child in its custody Tuesday after an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala died, marking the second death of an immigrant child in the agency\u2019s care this month.\n\nThe death came during an ongoing dispute over border security and with a partial government shutdown underway over President Donald Trump\u2019s request for border wall funding.\n\nThe boy, identified by Guatemalan authorities as Felipe G\u00f3mez Alonzo, had been in CBP\u2019s custody with his father, Agustin Gomez, since Dec. 18. CBP said in a statement late Tuesday that an agent first noticed the boy had a cough and \u201cglossy eyes\u201d at about 9 a.m. Monday. He was eventually hospitalized twice and died just before midnight, the agency said. CBP earlier said that the boy died just after midnight.\n\nCBP said in the statement it needs the help of other government agencies to provide health care. The agency \u201cis considering options for surge medical assistance\u201d from the Coast Guard and may request help from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nA CBP spokesman could not immediately answer how many children are currently in the agency\u2019s custody. But with border crossings surging, CBP processes thousands of children \u2014 both alone and with their parents \u2014 every month.\n\nImmigration advocates and human rights groups sharply criticized CBP in the wake of Felipe\u2019s death. The body of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal , who died earlier this month, was returned this week to her village in Guatemala for burial.\n\nMargaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpolicies of cruelty toward migrants and asylum-seekers at the border must cease immediately before any more children are harmed.\u201d\n\nThe White House referred questions about the latest case to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, CBP\u2019s parent agency. CBP officers and the Border Patrol remain on the job despite the shutdown.\n\nCBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in a statement that the child\u2019s death was a \u201ctragic loss.\u201d The agency said it has notified the DHS inspector general.\n\nCBP issued a timeline of what it said happened before Felipe\u2019s death.\n\nFelipe was taken with his father to a hospital in Alamogordo, New Mexico, where he was diagnosed with a common cold, according to the timeline.\n\nThe boy was released just before 3 p.m., about 90 minutes after he had been found to have a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 Celsius), CBP said. He was prescribed amoxicillin and ibuprofen, and taken with his father to a holding facility at a highway checkpoint.\n\nAt about 7 p.m., agents helped clean up the boy\u2019s vomit. CBP said the father \u201cdeclined further medical assistance\u201d then.\n\nBut at about 10 p.m., the boy \u201cappeared lethargic and nauseous again,\u201d the agency said, and agents decided to have taken to the hospital. The boy died at 11:48 p.m. Monday, the agency said.\n\nThe hospital, the Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center, declined to comment, citing privacy regulations.\n\nFelipe and his father were detained by CBP for about a week, an unusually long time that the agency did not fully explain Tuesday.\n\nCBP typically detains immigrants for no more than a few days when they cross the border before either releasing them or turning them over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for longer-term detention.\n\nAgency guidelines say immigrants generally shouldn\u2019t be detained for more than 72 hours in CBP holding facilities, which are usually smaller and have fewer services than ICE detention centers.\n\nCBP said it apprehended Felipe and his father on Dec. 18 about 3 miles away from an official port of entry, the Paso del Norte bridge connecting El Paso and Juarez, Mexico. They were held at a processing center for almost two days, then taken to the El Paso Border Patrol station on Thursday.\n\nCBP said it moved them to Alamogordo, New Mexico, at about 1 a.m. Sunday \u201cbecause of capacity levels at the El Paso station.\u201d Alamogordo is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) from El Paso.\n\nThe agency didn\u2019t say why it held Felipe and his father for so long, but said its officers repeatedly conducted welfare checks on them.\n\nOscar Padilla, the Guatemalan consul in Phoenix, said he was told by the boy\u2019s father in a telephone interview that the two had been traveling from their home in Nent\u00f3n, a village about 280 miles (450 kilometers) from Guatemala City. They were planning to go to Johnson City, Tennessee.\n\nCBP promised \u201can independent and thorough review of the circumstances,\u201d and the Guatemalan foreign ministry called for an investigation \u201cin accordance with due process.\u201d\n\nDemocratic members of Congress and immigration advocates sharply criticized CBP\u2019s handling of Jakelin Caal\u2019s death and questioned whether border agents could have prevented it by spotting symptoms of distress or calling for an evacuation by air ambulance sooner.\n\nCBP has said that it took several hours to transport Jakelin and her father from a remote Border Patrol facility to a larger station, where her temperature was measured at 105.7 degrees Fahrenheit (40.9 degrees Celsius). Emergency medical technicians had to revive her twice. She was ultimately flown to an El Paso hospital, where she died the next day.\n\nXochitl Torres Small, a Democrat who will represent the district starting in January, called for a thorough and transparent investigation into the children\u2019s deaths and more medical resources along the border.\n\n\u201cThis is inexcusable,\u201d Torres Small said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cInstead of immediately acting to keep children and all of us safe along our border, this administration forced a government shutdown over a wall.\u201d\n\n___\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press journalists Mary Hudetz in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Sonia Perez D. in Guatemala City; and Mark Stevenson in Mexico City."

But more on that in the video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is grounds for impeachment, we will have to wait and find out, but it is becoming clearer and clearer that the president who wants so badly to build walls is doing nothing but tearing down walls separating government and the private sector. Now wasn\u2019t the merger of corporate and government power the very definition of fascism?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think, is this illegal, should it be, did Donald Trump violate the Hatch Act, and in doing so, is he merging his corporate power with his political power and being very literally a fascist, or is Thom just reaching at bundled straw?"

  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With the angry departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the United States and its shaken allies are about to discover the true meaning of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d\n\nMr. Mattis, a retired four-star general, prided himself on spending four decades preparing for war while nurturing the alliances needed to prevent conflict. He was more than the competent grown-up in the Situation Room, quelling talk of unilateral strikes against North Korea. In fact, he was the last senior official in the administration deeply invested in the world order that the United States has led for the 73 years since World War II, and the global footprint needed to keep that order together.\n\nThe breaking point was Syria, where Mr. Trump decided over his defense secretary\u2019s objections to pull out all American troops, and Afghanistan, where the president seems determined to reduce the American presence by half in the next few months. By the time Mr. Trump made clear he would delay those actions no longer, Mr. Mattis was isolated.\n\nHe was not alone: Most of the advisers Mr. Trump once called \u201cmy generals\u201d also believed in the worldview that Mr. Trump has long rejected. And now, headed into his third year in office and more convinced than ever that his initial gut instincts about retreating from a complex world of civil wars and abstract threats was right, Mr. Trump has rid himself of the aides who feared the president was undercutting America\u2019s long-term national interests."

  "text": "Fewer than 40 percent of Americans expect the stock market to grow in the next year, according to a survey of 1,300 households by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That is the gloomiest outlook for stocks in the Trump era. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump has kept an almost obsessive watch on the stock market as it has lurched lower in recent weeks, tuning in to Fox Business and checking in with Lou Dobbs, a host on the network.\n\nThe president has complained to aides about how unfair it is that he is blamed for the market\u2019s slide and for growing unease about an economic slowdown in the months to come, say current and former officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAnd he has needled Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell about the pace at which the central bank has raised short-term interest rates.\n\n[Federal Reserve cuts its outlook for U.S. economy; stocks plunge]\n\nThe lower the market drops, the more the president worries that he is losing his most potent argument for reelection, several of the officials said.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average sank to the lowest point of the year Thursday, shedding nearly 500 points after Trump repeated threats to shut down part of the U.S. government if Congress doesn\u2019t give him $5 billion for a border wall.\n\n\u201cAny measure that funds the government has to include border security,\u201d Trump said as the market tumbled.\n\nUnless a miracle \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d emerges, this is going to be the worst year for U.S. stocks since 2008.\n\nSince the 2016 election, Trump has pointed to market gains as proof that his economic policies are working and that the country is thriving under his leadership. Now a favored talking point is crumbling.\n\nBefore the market downturn, Trump would take prepared remarks and add comments about the economy, officials say. But lately he has tweeted less about the economy.\n\nThe Dow\u2019s performance since Trump took office is now significantly less than what was achieved at the same point in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. The Dow is up 18 percent under Trump, compared with 45 percent at this point under Obama, according to Bespoke Investments.\n\nTrump has repeatedly faulted the Federal Reserve for the market slide. But on Wall Street, many say Trump\u2019s recent actions are also to blame.\n\n\u201cThe market has lost confidence in the narrative coming out of the White House on the economy and trade,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a multinational network of accounting firms.\n\nTrump has publicly berated Powell, accusing him of raising short-term interest rates too quickly.\n\nOn Wednesday, Powell announced another rate increase \u2014 the fourth this year \u2014 and he said the Fed is lowering its economic outlook for 2019. U.S. markets pitched into a sell-off, extending losses that have piled up over the fall.\n\nBut the big sell-off this month was triggered when investors realized that the president had oversold his trade truce with China. Trump\u2019s claims that China had agreed to reduce its tariffs on cars to zero and cut the U.S.-China trade deficit were never substantiated.\n\nAnd just as the market seemed to stabilize, Trump and top Democratic leaders engaged in an Oval Office dust-up over border security that was broadcast live, raising fears of a government shutdown and of stalemate in Washington over the next two years.\n\n\u201cI am proud to shut down the government for border security,\u201d Trump said as the Dow gave up a gain of more than 350 points and fell into the red.\n\nThe verbal brawl made for an unprecedented live television broadcast, and it showcased Trump\u2019s struggles to reach agreements at home and abroad. Republican Senators, members of his own party, passed a bill to avert a shutdown that has no additional funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cThe president may get the \u2018art of the deal,\u2019 but the art of the sale is to under-promise and over-deliver,\u201d said Michael K. Farr, president of investment firm Farr, Miller and Washington. \u201cU.S. investors understand they have to raise the verify part of the \u2018trust but verify\u2019 equation. Frustration is building.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials say Trump\u2019s rhetoric on China, particularly the tweet describing himself as \u201cTariff Man,\u201d rattled the confidence of U.S. investors and business leaders and caused the Dow to shed more than 1,100 points in a week.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 are expected to notch their worst December performances since 1931, a sign of how rapidly Wall Street sentiment is shifting on the businessman president and his ability to steer the economy.\n\n[U.S. stocks sought higher ground. Then Trump detoured \u2018to crazy town.\u2019]\n\n\u201cI think \u2018Tariff Man\u2019 was really a blunder. Even if it was just a negotiating tactic, the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse on that,\u201d said Stephen Moore, who worked on economic policy for Trump\u2019s campaign and remains close to the president.\n\nThe deeper worry for Trump is whether stock market jitters will spill over into the broader economy. The economy is still showing many signs of strength, with a low unemployment rate, rapid hiring, robust consumer spending, and high business and consumer confidence. But if the market doesn\u2019t rebound, that probably would cause investors and families to lower their expectations for the future and scale back spending.\n\nFewer than 40 percent of Americans expect the stock market to grow in the next year, according to a survey of 1,300 households by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That is the gloomiest outlook for stocks in the Trump era.\n\nAnd almost half of chief financial officers think the economy will be in a recession in a year, according to the Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook survey released this month.\n\nThere is widespread agreement among economists outside the White House that the economy will grow more slowly in 2019 as Trump\u2019s tax cuts and extra government spending wear off. The debate is over how steep the decline will be.\n\n[The benefits of this \u2018strong economy\u2019 have not reached all Americans]\n\n\u201cThe U.S. economy can withstand interest rate increases and tariffs, just not at the same time,\u201d said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. He blamed the deteriorating outlook chiefly on man-made problems: tariffs, Brexit and monetary policy.\n\nThe president often says China has more to lose than he does, and the Chinese are feeling the pressure. He is not going to back off the tariffs, several people said, and actually takes joy in how much Republicans dislike them.\n\n\u201cHe knows it\u2019s going to sting, it\u2019s going to hurt,\u201d said Doug Deason, a prominent donor with close ties to the White House. \u201cBut China is feeling the heat at this point. He knows if you don\u2019t ask for much, you aren\u2019t going to get much.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top economic adviser Larry Kudlow have expressed concerns about the tariffs privately. But although Kudlow doesn\u2019t like them, he has adopted the viewpoint that they are part of a broader strategy to target China.\n\nTrump\u2019s top economic and trade advisers blanketed the airwaves in recent days in an attempt to increase confidence in the U.S.-China trade talks and to play down any concerns about the market decline, but a lot remains to be bridged between the two sides in the next 90 days.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in our data other than the financial market jitteriness that suggests the fundamentals are changing,\u201d Kevin Hassett, Trump\u2019s top economist, said recently.\n\nThe president has blamed a number of his officials for the sentiment shift on Wall Street, but he rants continually about Powell. At Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida over Thanksgiving, the president complained about Powell extensively, guests said.\n\nPowell took over the top Fed job in early February and has raised interest rates one percentage point since then, to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, the highest rates in a decade, although still modest by historical standards.\n\nPeter Navarro, who is one of Trump\u2019s top trade advisers and pushes a hard stance against China, has tried to pin the entire market downturn on Powell.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a false narrative in terms of the impact of the tariffs on the stock market. My view is that this is strictly an interest rate effect,\u201d he said recently on Fox News Channel. \u201cI think the Fed went too far, too fast. And what we saw basically was a little asset reallocation from the stock to the bond market.\u201d\n\nBut many economists and analysts said Trump could help limit market and economic declines if he finalized a deal with China by spring.\n\n\u201cWall Street would applaud a terrible deal just to get it passed and have the uncertainty gone,\u201d said Timothy Anderson, a trader and managing director of MND Partners.\n\nDamian Paletta contributed to this report."

  "text": "The Senate passed the First Step Act on Tuesday night in an 87-12 vote after vigorous debate over legislative amendments that would have gutted much of the bill. The legislation now moves to the House for a vote later this week, where it is expected to pass.\n\nThe sentencing reform legislation, shaped in large part by Jared Kushner and Koch Industries attorney Mark Holden, expands job training and other rehabilitation-oriented programming designed to reduce recidivism rates among federal prisoners deemed \u201clow-risk.\u201d It also expands early-release programs and somewhat reins in sentencing laws, including mandatory minimums for drug offenses.\n\nThe legislation\u2019s changes to sentencing laws include allowing judges more flexibility to pass sentences below mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders and reducing mandatory minimums associated with the three-strikes law. The legislation also prohibits the shackling of pregnant prisoners and the use of solitary confinement for juveniles.\n\nThe latest version, which came to the Senate floor via another, unrelated bill, advanced Monday with stripped-down provisions and additional measures demanded by law enforcement groups, including the National Sheriff\u2019s Association and \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d Republicans.\n\nSenators voted against a set of amendments to the bill Tuesday that reform advocates deemed \u201cpoison pill\u201d amendments ahead of the legislation\u2019s passage. Republican Senators Tom Cotton and John Kennedy authored three amendments that advocates say would have unacceptably whittled down the already feeble legislation.\n\nThe amendments would have excluded felons from early release, prerelease custody and supervised release; notified victims before a prisoner is allowed to transfer out early; and tracked the effectiveness of the anti-recidivism programs. Advocates, however, say the amendments would have led to further stigmatization of incarcerated people, risked re-traumatizing victims of crime, and discouraged the neediest prisoners from participating in recidivism-reduction programming.\n\nIn a stunning reversal, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated last week that he would bring the bill to the Senate floor after Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley expressed frustration over McConnell\u2019s inaction. President Trump, the Fraternal Order of the Police, and for-profit prison corporations GEO Group and CoreCivic all support the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe can look at this legislation as immediate relief for a very small number of people, but what are [Black and Brown] communities going to look like in 20 years?\u201d\n\nSome conservative senators are already touting the bill\u2019s passage in the Senate as a legislative victory after Congress\u2019s previous effort at bipartisan prison reform in the wake of the Ferguson uprising in 2014-15 largely stalled. Others, like Senators Cotton and Kennedy, have decried the bill as weakening the Republican Party\u2019s \u201claw-and-order\u201d identity.\n\nThe bill is limited to federal prisons, which only constitute about 13 percent of the overall US prison system, or about 180,000 of 2.1 million incarcerated people in US jails and prisons. Further, prison reform advocates argue the bill systematically excludes casualties of the war on drugs, since the legislation does not make any sentence reductions retroactive other than those under the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which somewhat reduced the disparity between crack and powdered cocaine sentences.\n\nThe legislation could liberate several thousand prisoners hit with harsh drug sentences prior to the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, and represents the most significant blow to mandatory minimums since the 2010 legislation was passed.\n\nStill, the modest sentence reductions in the bill are so narrow that veteran reform advocates say the long-term, harmful provisions of the legislation \u2014 including its reliance on racist risk assessment mechanisms and expansion of electronic monitoring and other forms of privatized surveillance \u2014 outweigh its benefits. For instance, the bill contains no measures that would prevent private prison corporations from charging those they place on electronic monitors from paying fees associated with the devices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to focus on the long-term impacts of any legislation that we put in place,\u201d said Vivian Nixon, a formerly incarcerated person and director of College and Community Fellowship. \u201cWe can look at this legislation as immediate relief for a very small number of people, but what are [Black and Brown] communities going to look like in 20 years when \u2026 there\u2019s a huge percentage of people with criminal justice histories in very targeted, under-resourced communities who are bogged down with these electronic monitors and payments that they can\u2019t make?\u201d\n\nCoreCivic and GEO Group, the nation\u2019s largest for-profit prison corporations, strongly back the bill, and have urged representatives not to adjourn before passing it. Both companies are expanding heavily into reentry and post-prison rehabilitation services, and the legislation presents new opportunities to boost their profits, authorizing a $375 million expansion of post-prison services. Moreover, Koch Industries, whose attorney Holden helped shape First Step, has worked to privatize reentry services through funding the Texas Public Policy Foundation\u2019s \u201cRight on Crime\u201d operation.\n\n\u201cThis is like a \u2018Get Out of Jail Free\u2019 card for extremely low-risk, well-resourced people who find their way into federal prison.\u201d\n\nNixon points out that because of the way risk assessments measure static factors like a person\u2019s income, work history or where they lived at the time of their offense, many poor people of color will not even be eligible for early release under electronic monitoring, while those deemed low-risk, such as white-collar criminals, will likely be able to go free without any electronic surveillance. \u201cThis is like a \u2018Get Out of Jail Free\u2019 card for extremely low-risk, well-resourced people who find their way into federal prison,\u201d Nixon said.\n\nMoreover, she worries that the bill sets a precedent for expanding \u201ce-carceration\u201d strategies that could spread beyond the federal prison system. \u201cWhatever the federal system does, there are many states [that] are likely to follow suit, which means we\u2019re not only talking about the small number of federal prisoners, we\u2019re talking about 2 million people in jails and prisons around the country,\u201d she said.\n\nNixon argues the bill was conceived of and drafted predominantly by \u201cgrasstops\u201d nonprofit staffers, lawyers and people in government, not the communities of color most directly impacted by policing and the prison system. Further, the bill\u2019s prioritizing of low-risk, well-resourced prisoners is a reflection of Kushner\u2019s familial experiences with the prison system: His father Charles was released from prison in 2006 after serving two years for illegal campaign contributions.\n\nA real reform bill, she says, would have made the 2015 Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act retroactive, focused less on risk assessments and more on \u201cneeds assessments\u201d to provide adequate programming for incarcerated people, and would have included provisions to limit public-private partnerships.\n\n\u201cWhat is in this federal bill that says we will not double the current federal population on community supervision?\u201d\n\nDeAnna Hoskins, president of JustLeadershipUSA, which seeks to reduce the carceral population in the US, agrees, telling Truthout that static factors disproportionately affect risk assessments for Black and Brown communities. For instance, over-policing of predominantly Black and Brown schools can result in early criminal records for young people of color. Criminal records resulting from civil rights violations such as stop-and-frisk and racial profiling can, and often do, play into risk assessments.\n\n\u201cWhat is in this federal bill that says we will not double the current federal population on community supervision, especially when the cost is shifted from the government to the individual?\u201d Hoskins said.\n\nShe also points out that it\u2019s not just casualties of the war on drugs who are systematically carved out of the bill, but also prisoners with many disabilities, since the bill only outlines screenings for prisoners with learning or cognitive impairments. The bill also carves out undocumented immigrants, who constituted more than half of federal criminal prosecutions in 2016 and make up about a third of all people sent to federal prisons annually.\n\n\u201cI think what will happen at the end of the day is that the arc of all these exclusions will kind of cement these problematic policies around immigrants.\u201d\n\nParomita Shah, who is associate director at the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, argues that the way the legislation singles out migrants\u2019 unauthorized reentry into the US as one of the most serious classes of offenses is troubling, and that the legislation gives the administration the tools to exacerbate the problems caused by the administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which has led to separations of thousands of migrant families at the border.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an immigrant, the presumption under our laws is that, [immigrants] shouldn\u2019t have access to these [rehabilitation] services because [they\u2019re] just not going to be here,\u201d Shah told Truthout. \u201cI think what will happen at the end of the day is that the arc of all these exclusions will kind of cement these problematic policies around immigrants.\u201d\n\nShe also points out that the legislation funnels anyone presumed to be \u201cdeportable\u201d into what\u2019s known as the \u201cInstitutional Hearing Program,\u201d which holds deportation hearings for immigrants while they are still in federal prison. Shah says the program undermines due process protections and remains inaccessible in many federal prisons. The legislation forces people to undergo the program as a condition for applying for time credits, ultimately pushing more immigrants toward the likelihood of deportation.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s draconian immigration policies have also proved lucrative to these private prison profiteers as well, and Shah worries the bill will likewise only further cement GEO Group and CoreCivic\u2019s ability to profit from the federal detention system in how it singles out unauthorized reentry.\n\n\u201cThere may not be an immediate impact right now, but I feel like it\u2019s a tradeoff,\u201d Shah said. \u201cPushing out a bill like this while federal prosecutions of [unauthorized reentries] remain one of the highest prosecuted offenses in our criminal justice system, it just seems like a real disconnect.\u201d\n\nNixon, Hoskins and Shah all hope to see Democrats take a shot at deepening reforms the Senate just passed, while putting accountability measures in place, when they take control of the House in January.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a baby step. If they want a true first step,\u201d Hoskins says, Congress would have had a real debate. \u201cIf this is true bipartisanship, then what are [lawmakers] scared of, and why the need to push this bill through? Because it protects them, [white-collar criminals] and not the most marginalized.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Truthout. May not be reprinted without permission."

  "text": "Outrage is mounting over the death of a 7-year-old indigenous Guatemalan girl in Border Patrol custody, as lawmakers demand answers for the conditions that led Jakelin Caal Maqu\u00edn to die after being detained at the U.S.-Mexico border. Maquin died on December 8, two days after she and her father presented themselves at the border alongside 161 other Central American asylum seekers. She had been held in detention for more than eight hours when she began to have seizures. Border Patrol agents brought the girl to the hospital after her body temperature spiked to 105.7 degrees. The 7-year-old died of dehydration, shock and liver failure at an El Paso hospital less than 24 hours later.

Lynching is part of the dark and despicable aspect of our country's history that followed slavery and many other outrages in our country,\" Harris said from the floor on Wednesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn addition to Harris, Booker and Scott, 35 other senators formally co-sponsored the bill, which was introduced in July and cleared the Judiciary Committee unanimously in October. It passed the full Senate by voice vote.\n\nCongress has tried but failed to pass anti-lynching legislation roughly 200 times since 1918, according to Harris's office. In 2005, the Senate passed a resolution apologizing to lynching victims.\n\nBut, addressing the 2005 vote, the Senate legislation says that while an apology \"moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become central to a new understanding, on which improved racial relations can be forged,\" legislation criminalizing lynching is still \"wholly necessary and appropriate.\"\n\nBooker added on Wednesday that the Senate's passage of the bill is \"a very long time coming.\"\n\n\"For over a century members of Congress have attempted to pass some version of a bill that would recognize lynching for what it is, a bias, motivated act of terror. ... We do know the passage of this bill, even though it cannot reverse irrevocable harm that lynching was used as a terror of suppression, the passage of this bill is a recognition of that dark past,\" Booker said."

  "text": "Facebook\u2019s agreement with regulators is a result of the company\u2019s early experiments with data sharing. In late 2009, it changed the privacy settings of the 400 million people then using the service, making some of their information accessible to all of the internet. Then it shared that information, including users\u2019 locations and religious and political leanings, with Microsoft and other partners.\n\nFacebook called this \u201cinstant personalization\u201d and promoted it as a step toward a better internet, where other companies would use the information to customize what people saw on sites like Bing. But the feature drew complaints from privacy advocates and many Facebook users that the social network had shared the information without permission.\n\nThe F.T.C. investigated and in 2011 cited the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials stopped mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into the consent agreement.\n\nUnder the decree, the social network introduced a \u201ccomprehensive privacy program\u201d charged with reviewing new products and features. It was initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, their lofty title an apparent sign of Facebook\u2019s commitment. The company also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess its privacy practices every two years.\n\nBut the privacy program faced some internal resistance from the start, according to four former Facebook employees with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s efforts. Some engineers and executives, they said, considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth. And the core team responsible for coordinating the reviews \u2014 numbering about a dozen people by 2016 \u2014 was moved around within Facebook\u2019s sprawling organization, sending mixed signals about how seriously the company took it, the ex-employees said.\n\nCritically, many of Facebook\u2019s special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, two of the former employees said. Executives believed that because the partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of those data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.\n\nFacebook officials said that members of the privacy team had been consulted on the sharing agreements, but that the level of review \u201cdepended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.\u201d"

  "text": "Michael Flynn\u2019s sentencing took a stunning turn on Tuesday after a \u201cdisgusted\u201d judge questioned whether he could have been charged with treason and then postponed a decision about how much time he should serve.\n\n\u201cArguably, this undermines everything this flag over here stands for,\u201d U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan told Flynn, President Trump\u2019s short-lived national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russian officials and work for the Turkish government.\n\n\u201cArguably, you sold your country out.\u201d\n\nThe judge\u2019s tongue-lashing added high drama to a proceeding that had been expected to be cut-and-dry because of Flynn\u2019s plea deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office and Mueller\u2019s endorsement of a no-jail sentence. The final decision rests with Sullivan, and Flynn\u2014who led chants of \u201cLock Her Up!\u201d against Hillary Clinton at the Republican National Convention\u2014could face up to six months in prison on the lying charge.\n\nThe mood in the Washington, D.C., courtroom turned dark when Sullivan unleashed. Flynn, who had come in smiling and back-slapping, left with his jaw clenched for a half-hour recess to decide whether he should ask for a postponement of the sentencing.\n\nWhen he returned, his lawyers said they wanted a delay. Sullivan agreed to it, but noted that he was making no guarantees Flynn would not be jailed at a later date. All parties will return March 13 for a status conference.\n\nThe first inkling that things might not go as planned Tuesday morning came when Sullivan announced that he had concerns about the circumstances of the FBI interview in which Flynn admits he lied about his contacts with Russian officials\u2014issues that Flynn\u2019s lawyers also had raised in recent court filings, suggesting he might have been trapped by the feds.\n\nSullivan offered Flynn the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea or to delay the sentencing until he was done cooperating.\n\nFlynn attorney Robert Kelner said his client \u201cstands by his guilty plea\u201d and accepts \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for his falsehoods and did not want to back away from his plea agreement with Mueller.\n\nAnd a prosecutor on a Mueller's team told the judge that Flynn may \u201cpossibly\u201d continue to cooperate with their ongoing investigations and had helped them bring charges against a former business partner accused of acting as a foreign agent for Turkey.\n\nBut Sullivan wasn't done. After raising questions about the FBI\u2019s questioning of Flynn, he now focused on Flynn\u2019s own actions.\n\nHe told Flynn his crime\u2014lying to federal agents as a high-ranking government official while sitting in the White House\u2014was a \u201cserious offense\u201d and that he could not say guarantee a no-prison penalty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to hide my disgust, my disdain,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThen, in an extraordinary moment, Sullivan asked Mueller\u2019s prosecutor, Brandon Van Grack, if Flynn\u2019s actions rose to the level of treason.\n\n\u201cIn terms of evidence, treason is not something we have considered,\u201d Van Grack said.\n\nThe judge asked if a charge of treason could have been considered. After a long pause, Van Grack said he would not answer the hypothetical question.\n\nThe judge called a recess so Flynn could huddle with his lawyers. When Flynn came back, Sullivan backtracked a bit on his earlier comments, saying he did not to mean suggest that the general had committed treason. In fact, Flynn was accused of acting as a foreign agent on behalf on Turkey before he assumed his White House post.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty just over a year ago to making false statements to federal investigators, which he called in court papers \u201ca serious error in judgement.\u201d\n\nAs part of his deal with Mueller, he sat for almost 63 hours of interviews and turned over thousands of documents, his lawyers noted in a sentencing memo. Flynn also met with other Justice Department officials conducting separate investigations.\n\nFlynn served as Trump\u2019s national security adviser for just 24 days before he was pushed out, but he previously served as an adviser to the campaign and is the highest-ranking member of the administration to be charged in the Russia probe.\n\nAs Mueller\u2019s team pointed out in a court filing earlier this month, Flynn flipped soon after prosecutors approached him about a cooperation agreement. \u201cThe defendant deserves credit for accepting responsibility in a timely fashion and substantially assisting the government,\u201d they wrote to the judge, asking for a lenient sentence.\n\nFlynn also touted his cooperation. Defense attorneys wrote in their sentencing memo: \u201cHaving made a serious error in judgment, for which he has shown true contrition, he recognized it was consistent with the values by which he has led his life simply to provide the facts to those charged with enforcing our laws.\u201d\n\nThe ever-outspoken military veteran couldn\u2019t help taking a dig at the FBI, however, suggesting he had been duped into a perjury trap by FBI officials with their own baggage\u2014namely Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was accused of leaks, and agent Peter Strzok, who was fired over texts that criticized Trump.\n\n\u201cEven when circumstances later came to light that prompted extensive public debate about the investigation of General Flynn, including revelations that certain FBI officials involved in the January 24 interview of General Flynn were themselves being investigated for misconduct, General Flynn did not back away from accepting responsibility for his actions,\u201d the defense attorneys wrote.\n\nThat clearly annoyed Mueller\u2019s team, who retorted that Flynn had no one to blame but himself, noting that he lied to the White House weeks before he spoke to the FBI agents.\n\n\u201cNothing about the way the interview was arranged or conducted caused the defendant to make false statements to the FBI on January 24,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. \u201cThe Court should reject the defendant\u2019s attempt to minimize the seriousness of those false statements to the FBI.\u201d\n\nOn the eve of the sentencing, prosecutors filed a redacted version of the FBI notes of their interview with Flynn that detailed the various lies he told about his contacts with then-Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak."

One continuing Russian campaign, for instance, seeks to influence opinion on Syria by promoting Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president and a Russian ally in the brutal conflict there.\n\nThe New Knowledge report is one of two commissioned by the Senate committee on a bipartisan basis. They are based largely on data about the Russian operations provided to the Senate by Facebook, Twitter and the other companies whose platforms were used."

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke will resign as he faces at least 17 federal investigations into suspected ethics violations. A former fossil fuel industry lobbyist, David Bernhardt, will become the interim interior secretary. Meanwhile, Trump has tapped Mick Mulvaney to become acting chief of staff to replace Gen. John Kelly. Mulvaney already holds two posts in the administration: White House budget director and acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And in Texas, a federal court has declared the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate unconstitutional, setting up a likely challenge at the Supreme Court. We are joined by longtime consumer advocate and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader. He is author of the new book \u201cTo the Ramparts: How Bush and Obama Paved the Way for the Trump Presidency, and Why It Isn\u2019t Too Late to Reverse Course.\u201d"

  "text": "In a historic vote, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution on Thursday calling for an end to U.S. military and financial support for the Saudi-led war on Yemen. This represents the first time in U.S. history the Senate has voted to withdraw military forces from an unauthorized war using the War Powers Resolution. The Saudi-led war in Yemen has created what the U.N. calls the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, with 14 million of Yemen\u2019s 28 million people on the brink of famine. A remarkable piece in this week\u2019s New York Times Magazine traces how bombs built by Raytheon in Tucson, Arizona, made its way into the Saudi arsenal and then were dropped on Yemeni villages. The article centers on what happened in the remote village of Arhab when U.S.-backed Saudi warplanes carried out a series of bombings on September 10, 2016. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 31 civilians were killed, three of them children; 42 people were injured. We speak to journalist Jeffrey Stern."

  "authors": [
    "Will Sommer"
  ],
  "text": "It may, on the surface, seem like a harmless way to trivialize special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nBut to the actual community of witches, President Donald Trump\u2019s constant invocation of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d is deeply problematic and, frankly, a bit hurtful.\n\n\u201cMany are mad, and the rest are rolling their eyes,\u201d said David Salisbury, a lead organizer at Washington-based witch community Firefly House.\n\nWitches are not a constituency with which politicians normally concern themselves. And there\u2019s little sense in the community that Trump actually cares about what they truly think. But for those who practice witchcraft, the president\u2019s words bring up a painful period in history, when men and women were accused of being witches and murdered, both in the American colonies and in Europe.\n\nActual witch hunts have left what witchcraft author Kitty Randall, who uses the name \u201cAmber K.\u201d in the witching world, calls a \u201ctraumatic emotional imprint\u201d on modern-day witches.\n\n\u201cTo have him compare his situation to the worst period in our history is just infuriating,\u201d Randall said.\n\nOn Twitter, Trump has called the Mueller investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d more than 60 times, including four times on Sunday alone. Trump\u2019s supporters have adopted the nomenclature as well, with former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich saying Friday that the Mueller investigation is both a witch hunt and a modern return of the Inquisition.\n\nWitches view the use of the phrase as more than just a pejorative rhetorical device. They place it, rather, in the larger context of the president demonizing and marginalizing minority groups. According to witches who spoke to The Daily Beast, most contemporary witches are feminists and support other marginalized groups. Salisbury called Trump\u2019s witch hunt tweets \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d especially because of Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants and women.\n\n\u201cIt is particularly horrifying because many modern practitioners of witchcraft devote their lives to seeking compassion and justice,\u201d Salisbury said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFaced with a barrage of \u201cwitch hunt\u201d slurs, some witches have chosen to raise the stakes, resorting to spell-casting. A group of witches organized on the internet casts a monthly \u201cbinding\u201d spell on Trump, while another group attempted to hex Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nBut Trump doesn\u2019t need to be worried about a plague of toads showing up at the White House any time soon. Randall said most witches have opted not to use magic against Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to attack Trump with spells,\u201d Randall said. \u201cHe\u2019s in the middle of a process of self-destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is safe from any \u2018witch hunt\u2019 because no self-respecting coven would have him,\u201d Randall added.\n\nInstead, the witches just want Trump to stop comparing himself to the victims of anti-witch persecutions.\n\n\u201cIf Mueller\u2019s investigation were truly a \u2018witch hunt,\u2019 then Donald Trump would be hanging naked from chains in a cold barn somewhere, being tortured into admitting his pact with Satan, before being burned at the stake,\u201d Randall said. \u201cInstead he\u2019s golfing at Mar-a-Lago.\u201d"

The number of poor Americans receiving assistance dipped to a low in 2014 and has remained there. The report concludes that, \"TANF\u2019s work requirements and block grant structure exacerbate, rather than reduce, deep poverty.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a time when the idea of welfare was not anathema in the US. But decades of demonizing the poor and blaming them for their plight has deeply skewed US government policy, ensuring that there is always money for militarism, corporate subsidies, and tax cuts for the rich, and never enough for the most vulnerable Americans. Now, a new book suggests that a feminist perspective is needed to right this wrong.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Felicia Kornbluh, Associate Professor of History and Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies at the University of Vermont.

  "authors": [],
  "text": "Late Friday, a federal judge in Texas ruled the entire Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, putting things like coverage for pre-existing conditions, access to care for poor people, and free cancer screenings at perhaps their greatest risk since Obamacare was passed in 2010.\n\n\n\nObamacare, which currently insures almost 12 million people through marketplace plans and made Medicaid expansion possible, was struck down by U.S. District Court Judge Reed O\u2019Connor. He wrote that Congress\u2019 decision last year to remove the individual mandate \u2014 a tax penalty lodged against those who fail to carry health coverage as required by law \u2014 invalidated the act. The lawsuit to dismantle the program was led by political leaders from 20 conservative-leaning states that filed a complaint in February, arguing the law couldn\u2019t constitutionally stand without the tax.\n\n\n\nDemocratic attorneys general are likely to file appeal. In the meantime, the ruling won't go into effect \u2014 people can continue to sign up for Obamacare plans, and the health care marketplace should function normally. The sign-up period known as open enrollment, which allows people to choose their Affordable Care Act coverage for 2019, closes at midnight on Saturday.\n\n\"As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!,\u201d President Donald Trump said in a tweet Friday night.\n\nSince Democrats took back control of the House in November after an election in which they campaigned heavily on protecting pre-existing conditions, there\u2019s little chance that the court\u2019s decision will go without a bitter fight. In all likelihood, the Affordable Care Act will wind up back in the Supreme Court for the third time. The bench is now skewed conservatively after the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department made the unusual decision to not defend existing federal law, siding with the states instead. California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, is leading the defense of the health care law.\n\nCover: Isabel Diaz Tinoco and Jose Luis Tinoco speak with Otto Hernandez, an insurance agent from Sunshine Life and Health Advisors, as they shop for insurance under the Affordable Care Act at a store setup in the Mall of Americas on November 1, 2017 in Miami, Florida.

  "text": "Democracy Now! is broadcasting from the U.N. climate summit in Katowice, Poland, this week, where world leaders gathered to negotiate climate solutions were confronted last week by a teenage climate activist who says they are not doing enough to turn back the clock and prevent catastrophic climate change. Fifteen-year-old Greta Thunberg stunned the world last week when she denounced world leaders for inaction and told them: \u201cchange is coming whether they like it or not. The people will rise to the challenge. And since our leaders are behaving like children, we will have to take the responsibility they should have taken long ago.\u201d She has made international headlines since launching a school strike against climate change in her home country of Sweden earlier this year. Every Friday, she protests outside the parliament building in Stockholm instead of attending school, and her actions have inspired thousands of students across the globe to do the same. Before DN! speaks with Thunberg in person, we play an excerpt of her speech that went viral. \u201cI like school, and I like learning,\u201d said Greta, who plans to end her strike when Sweden starts cutting carbon emissions by 15 percent a year. \u201cBut why should we be studying for a future that soon may be no more? This is more important than school, I think.\u201d"

    "December"
  ],
  "text": "Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, said in a television interview Friday that Trump knew it was wrong to make hush-money payments to women who alleged they had affairs with him, directly contradicting claims from the president.\n\nCohen, who has admitted facilitating payments to two women in violation of campaign finance laws, told ABC News that he knew what he was doing was wrong.\n\nAsked whether the president also knew it was wrong to make the payments, Cohen replied, \u201cOf course.\u201d He added that the purpose was to \u201chelp [Trump] and his campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was very concerned about how this would affect the election,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nHis comments, in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d are at odds with those of Trump on Thursday in tweets and in a television interview.\n\n[Trump denies directing Michael Cohen to break the law to buy the silence of Playboy playmate and porn star]\n\nTrump denied that he directed Cohen to break the law during the 2016 campaign by buying the silence of former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal and adult-film star Stormy Daniels. He also said that Cohen, as his lawyer, bore responsibility for any campaign finance violations.\n\n\u201cI never directed him to do anything wrong,\u201d Trump told Fox News on Thursday. \u201cWhatever he did, he did on his own . . . I never directed him to do anything incorrect or wrong.\u201d\n\nIn his interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, Cohen, who once vowed that he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump, flatly disputed the president\u2019s assertion. He said Trump was well aware of important decisions involving his business.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anybody that believes that,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cFirst of all, nothing at the Trump Organization was ever done unless it was run through Mr. Trump. He directed me to make the payments. He directed me to become involved in these matters.\u201d\n\nThe former lawyer and Trump fixer added: \u201cHe knows the truth. I know the truth. Others know the truth. And here is the truth: People of the United States of America, people of the world, don\u2019t believe what he is saying. The man doesn\u2019t tell the truth. And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds.\u201d\n\nCohen\u2019s comments were his first since being sentenced to three years in prison Wednesday for what U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III called a \u201cveritable smorgasbord of criminal conduct\u201d \u2014 crimes that include tax violations, lying to a bank and lying to Congress, as well as those related to the hush-money payments.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Friday that by reporting Cohen\u2019s claims, the media \u201cis giving credence to a convicted criminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a self-admitted liar,\u201d Gidley told reporters. \u201cYou guys all know that, and for him to say . . . \u2018I\u2019m going to stop lying, starting now,\u2019 is somewhat silly.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors contend Trump directed the payments in a bid to help his election prospects. Trump has denied the affairs, and initially denied knowing anything about the payments, but has since shifted his story.\n\nCohen is scheduled to report to prison March 6.\n\nIn the ABC interview, Cohen said a $150,000 payment to McDougal was negotiated directly between Trump and David Pecker, the chief executive of the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company. Cohen said his role was limited to reviewing papers.\n\nOn Wednesday, federal prosecutors announced a cooperation deal with the company, American Media Inc. (AMI), in which it acknowledged paying McDougal to \u201csuppress the woman\u2019s story\u201d and \u201cprevent it from influencing the election.\u201d\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, a Trump lawyer, has acknowledged that Trump reimbursed Cohen for a $130,000 payment to Daniels. He said Trump wanted to quash false rumors that could hurt his family.\n\nIn the interview, Cohen declined to answer specific questions about the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into possible coordination between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t want to jeopardize any of their investigations,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked whether he thinks Trump is telling the truth about the Russia investigation, Cohen replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nTrump has denied any \u201ccollusion\u201d with Russia and has repeatedly attacked Mueller and his lawyers, accusing them of conducting a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nCohen acknowledged that he \u201cdidn\u2019t display good judgment\u201d in lying on Trump\u2019s behalf and that his family was disappointed in him.\n\n\u201cI am done with the lying,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI am done with being loyal to President Trump.\u201d\n\nAsked why people should believe him now, Cohen cited a statement by Mueller\u2019s office that he has been helpful to its investigations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a substantial amount of information that they possess that corroborates the fact that I am telling the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nCohen said he remains available to answer additional questions from Mueller\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cIf they want me, I\u2019m here,\u201d he said."

  "authors": [
    "Senior White House Correspondent"
  ],
  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Having run through his first choices for his chief of staff vacancy without any luck, President Donald Trump is considering his own son-in-law for the job.\n\nJared Kushner, the husband of Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and already an official White House adviser, met with Trump Wednesday about the job, a top Republican close to the White House told HuffPost. He and two others close to Trump or the White House who confirmed Kushner\u2019s interest in the position did so on condition of anonymity to discuss the president\u2019s staffing considerations freely.\n\nKushner has been pushing his own candidacy with Trump, citing his work on a criminal justice reform package and a claimed ability to work with Democrats, one person said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he thinks that, when the Democrats are mainly going to be coming after Trump,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s queries about Kushner\u2019s prospects for the job.\n\nTrump told reporters Thursday that he is down to five finalists. \u201cWe are interviewing people now for chief of staff,\u201d he said at a photo opportunity with newly elected governors who were visiting the White House.\n\nTrump announced on Saturday that current chief of staff John Kelly would leave \u201ctoward the end of the year.\u201d Nick Ayers, the current chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, was thought to be the likely favorite to succeed Kelly. But Ayers announced on Twitter on Sunday that he was withdrawing from consideration.\n\n\u201cThank you @realDonaldTrump, @VP, and my great colleagues for the honor to serve our Nation at The White House. I will be departing at the end of the year but will work with the #MAGA team to advance the cause,\u201d he wrote.\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images President Donald Trump is reportedly considering son-in-law Jared Kushner for his chief of staff position.\n\nOne source said Ayers, the father of young triplets, wanted to take the job on a short-term basis to see whether he could manage it, but then grew less interested the more time he spent with Trump.\n\nThe president \u2015 who came into office after starring in a reality television show and running a closely held family business using wealth largely inherited from his father \u2015 is known for temper tantrums and making demands that are illegal or impossible to carry out.\n\n\u201cSo often, the president would say here\u2019s what I want to do and here\u2019s how I want to do it and I would have to say to him, \u2018Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can\u2019t do it that way. It violates the law,\u2019\u201d former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said at a fundraising event for the MD Anderson Cancer Center last week.\n\nKelly, a retired Marine general, was expected to bring order and discipline to the West Wing when he took the job in mid-2017. Despite this, the unscripted chaos that marked Trump\u2019s first six months under his initial chief of staff, Reince Priebus, largely continued unchanged.\n\nIt is unclear who the five finalists Trump claimed he was looking at are. Former deputy campaign manager David Bossie is scheduled to have lunch with Trump Friday at the White House. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is also thought to be under consideration, while Trump is soliciting names from the legal community in New York City, where he lived his entire life before winning the presidency in 2016.\n\nAfter Ayers turned the job down, Trump tried to recruit Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, top economic adviser Larry Kudlow and North Carolina Republican Congressman Mark Meadows, all of whom declined, one source said.\n\nKushner and his wife Ivanka \u2015 known derisively by White House critics as \u201cJavanka\u201d \u2015 face considerable opposition from both inside and outside the West Wing because of concerns about nepotism as well as worries about Kushner\u2019s judgment. He has had to repeatedly file addendums to his financial disclosure forms since joining the White House. More recently, he has become a strong advocate for the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman \u2015 who U.S. intelligence agencies believe ordered the murder of U.S. resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi after luring him to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October."

    "Vann R. Newkirk Ii"
  ],
  "text": "That strategy is newly relevant now, as the Republican Party looks to complete lame-duck-session power grabs in state legislatures in Wisconsin and Michigan, preemptively stripping power away from incoming Democratic governors. Those moves are characterized by Democrats as brazen and unprecedented \u201ccoups\u201d by a party that was soundly beaten in the midterms but, through anti-democratic means, has managed to exert undue power.\n\nBut those midwestern power grabs are not necessarily shocking or unpredictable. Rather, they are an extension of the underlying strategy that had already been the major organizing principle of the GOP even as Priebus wrote his report. For decades, the Republican Party prepared to keep power even as it represented a coalition that became the minority. Now, the plan is in full effect.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint the exact moment when this became the destiny of the Republican Party. One could go all the way back to when the 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater broke the Democratic stranglehold on the Jim Crow South, picking up Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas on an anti-civil-rights agenda, initiating the proto \u201csouthern strategy\u201d and sparking a realignment of white conservatism with the GOP. Or the story could start just a year later, when the Voting Rights Act ushered in the first era of anything resembling true democracy in the country\u2019s history, and also set in motion an anti-voting-rights insurgency in the South.\n\nCloser still, the gerrymandering and geographic polarization that have become so critical to modern Republican plans might not have been possible without the \u201cwhite flight\u201d in the 1960s and \u201970s associated with that conservatism, and with the nascence of white suburban evangelicals as a political force under Ronald Reagan. The deep partisan differences creating unbridgeable policy divides in swing states might not have been so deep without the scorched-earth politics of the 1990s, and the power of technocratic tinkering at the margins of elections and voting rights might not have been so apparent without the infamous presidential election in Florida in 2000.\n\nAdam Serwer: America\u2019s problem isn\u2019t tribalism\u2014it\u2019s racism\n\nEven nearer to the modern moment, perhaps Wisconsin and Michigan are the end results of a chain of events that only became inevitable with the dawn of technologically sophisticated GOP redistricting campaigns in 2000 and 2010, with the reality-warping corporate bonanza of the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision, or with 2013\u2019s Shelby County v. Holder, which defanged federal enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAny one of these moments could be a viable starting point for assessing just what happened in the 2018 election, when Republicans lost the popular-vote margins at just about every level of politics, but still managed to limit Democratic power in some meaningful ways. There\u2019s Wisconsin, where\u2014relying on surging turnout across the board, and a spike in black and Latino voters\u2014the Democratic challenger Tony Evers defeated the GOP incumbent Scott Walker to claim the governor\u2019s mansion. Republican state legislators moved quickly to handcuff Evers\u2019s office."

  "text": "Gutting the IRS Who Wins When a Crucial Agency Is Defunded\n\nWhen Natassia Smick, 28, filed her family\u2019s taxes in January, she already had plans for the refund she and her husband expected to receive. Mainly, she wanted to catch up on her credit card debt. And she was pregnant with their second child, so there were plenty of extra expenses ahead.\n\nSince Smick, who is taking classes toward a bachelor\u2019s degree, and her husband, a chef, together earned around $33,000 in 2017, about $2,000 of that refund would come from the earned income tax credit. It\u2019s among the government\u2019s largest anti-poverty programs, sending more than $60 billion every year to families like Smick\u2019s: people who have jobs but are struggling to get by. Last year, 28 million households claimed the EITC.\n\nSmick, who lives outside Los Angeles, thought she\u2019d get her refund in a month or so, as she had the year before. But no refund came. Instead, she got a letter from the IRS saying it was \u201cconducting a thorough review\u201d of her return. She didn\u2019t need to do anything, it said. Smick waited as patiently as she could. She called the IRS and was told to wait some more.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until four months later, in July, that she got her next letter. The IRS informed her that she was being audited. She had 30 days to provide \u201csupporting documentation\u201d for basically everything. As she understood it, she needed to prove that she and her husband had earned what they\u2019d earned and that her child was her child.\n\nStay Informed Get ProPublica\u2019s Daily Digest.\n\nBy this point, Smick was home with her baby. She set about rounding up W-2s, paycheck stubs, bank statements and birth certificates. Proving that her 4-year-old had lived at the family\u2019s address for most of the year, as the EITC requires, was the hardest thing, but she did her best with medical records, some papers from his day care, and whatever else she could think of.\n\nShe sent it all off and hoped for a quick resolution, but the next IRS letter quashed that hope. The IRS said it would review her response by Feb. 16, 2019 \u2014 six months away. Collectors were calling about the credit card bills. She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d make it that long.\n\nSmick couldn\u2019t understand why this was happening. All she had done was answer the questions on TurboTax. Isn\u2019t it rich people who get audited? \u201cWe have nothing,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s just frustrating knowing that we have nothing.\u201d\n\nIt seemed there was nothing she could do. And when she called the IRS to ask how it could possibly take so long to review her documents, she remembers being told that there was nothing they could do, either: The IRS was \u201cextremely short staffed,\u201d the person said.\n\nBudget cuts have crippled the IRS over the past eight years. Enforcement staff has dropped by a third. But while the number of audits has fallen across the board, the impact has been different for the rich and poor. For wealthy taxpayers, the story has been rosy: Not only has the audit rate been cut in half, but audits now tend to be less thorough.\n\nSince 2011, Audit Rates for the Wealthy Have Dropped More Steeply Than for EITC Recipients The median EITC recipient has annual income under $20,000. Here's the percentage drop in audit rates by annual income, from 2011 to 2017. $10M and up -52% $5M to $10M -62% $1M to $5M -70% $500K to $1M -71% $200K to $500K -74% EITC Recipients -36% Source: ProPublica analysis of IRS data.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story for people who receive the EITC: The audit rate has fallen less steeply and the experience of being audited has become more punishing. Because of a 2015 law, EITC recipients are now more likely to have their refund held, something that can be calamitous for someone living month-to-month.\n\nIRS computers choose people to audit, but if those taxpayers respond, a person must review the documents. With fewer employees to do that, delays have mounted in a process that was already arduous, according to several attorneys who represent taxpayers through the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic program. It regularly takes more than a year to get a taxpayer\u2019s refund released, they said, even for those who are represented.\n\n\u201cIf the service doesn\u2019t have the personnel to evaluate evidence submitted in a timely manner, then they should not be initiating the exams in the first place,\u201d said Mandi Matlock, an attorney with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid.\n\nGenerally, the more money you make, the more likely you are to be audited. EITC recipients, whose typical annual income is under $20,000, have long been the major exception. That\u2019s because many people claim the credit in error, and, under consistent pressure from Republicans in Congress to curtail those overpayments, the IRS has kept the audit rate higher. Meanwhile, there hasn\u2019t been similar pressure to address more costly problem areas, like tax evasion by business owners.\n\nThe budget cuts and staff losses have made this distortion starker. The richest taxpayers are still audited at higher rates than the poorest, but the gap is closing.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is you have people at the very top being prioritized and people at the very bottom being prioritized, and everyone else is sort of squeezed out,\u201d said John Dalrymple, who retired last year as deputy commissioner of the IRS. In 2017, EITC recipients were audited at twice the rate of taxpayers with income between $200,000 and $500,000. Only households with income above $1 million were examined at significantly higher rates.\n\nPut another way, as the IRS has dwindled in size and capability, audits of the poor have accounted for more of what it does. Last year, the IRS audited 381,000 recipients of the EITC. That was 36 percent of all audits the IRS conducted, up from 33 percent in 2011, when the budget cuts began.\n\n\u201cThose struggling to make ends meet are being unfairly audited while the fortunate few dodge taxes without consequence,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, told ProPublica. \u201cThe IRS needs more manpower to go after tax cheats of all sizes, and working Americans need a simpler way of obtaining a tax credit they\u2019ve earned.\u201d\n\nThe IRS declined to answer questions about its EITC audits.\n\nThe EITC has bipartisan roots. Conceived as a \u201cwork bonus\u201d for low-income wage earners in the 1970\u2019s and an alternative to welfare, the program has grown over the decades with the support of Republicans and Democrats. These days, the average credit is for about $2,500, but for larger families, the amount can exceed $6,000. The Census Bureau recently estimated that the EITC and the child tax credit together boost millions of children out of poverty every year, more than any other government program.\n\nSend Us Tips How Are Things at the IRS? Help Us Get the Real Story. ProPublica would like to hear from people who have worked at the Internal Revenue Service or are otherwise knowledgeable about tax enforcement.\n\nUnlike Social Security or food stamps, the EITC has no application process. Instead, taxpayers simply claim the credit on their tax returns. Millions of people get it wrong in both directions, according to IRS estimates. About a fifth of eligible taxpayers don\u2019t seek the EITC. And almost a quarter of the $74 billion paid out this year was issued \u201cimproperly.\u201d\n\nThat estimate of \u201cimproper payments,\u201d about $17 billion, is the reason the EITC is such a focus for the IRS. Some tax experts \u2014 including the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent office within the IRS \u2014 argue the estimate is way too high. One reason is that it is based on the outcome of audits, and low-income taxpayers are much less likely to have competent representation to dispute the IRS\u2019 conclusions.\n\nRegardless of the precise error rate, the IRS acknowledges the primary cause of the problem is not fraud: It is the law itself. It is too complex, too easy for someone to think themselves eligible when they are not. The same child might be a \u201cdependent,\u201d for example, but not a \u201cqualifying child\u201d under the EITC, and the IRS\u2019 instructions for claiming the credit run to 41 pages.\n\n\u201cMy third-year law students, they sit down and study this material, and sometimes they still don\u2019t get it,\u201d said Michelle Lyon Drumbl, a professor at Washington and Lee School of Law.\n\nSince the 1990s, Republicans in Congress have focused on these improper payments as a major problem and harshly criticized the IRS for failing to stop them. In 2015, the Republican Congress passed, and President Barack Obama signed, a bill that required the IRS to hold EITC refunds until Feb. 15 each year. The purpose was to give the IRS more time to match tax returns with the corresponding W-2s to avoid misstatements of income. But it also meant people who are audited are more likely to see their refund held \u2014 instead of receiving the credit and then undergoing audit. That\u2019s a crucial difference for low-income taxpayers.\n\n\u201cYou expect this money during tax season and you don\u2019t get it\u2026 It tears you down,\u201d said Paul McCaw, a forklift operator in Rock Island, Illinois. He had refunds held for several years in a row because the IRS doubted that his niece\u2019s three young children lived with him. For years, the family struggled. Bills piled up and eviction was a constant threat. Finally, this year, with the help of a legal aid attorney at Prairie State Legal Services, Macaw, 50, was able to convince the IRS to release the refunds.\n\n\u201cI was just beside myself,\u201d he said of finally getting his refunds, adding, \u201cI caught everything all up, and I also paid a month in advance.\u201d\n\nStopping faulty refunds from going out, rather than trying to recoup them through an audit is \u201calways the better option\u201d because it is more effective, said Jesse Solis, a spokesperson for House Ways and Means Committee chair Kevin Brady, R-Texas. Congress should continue to look for ways to reduce improper payments, he said.\n\nRead More How the IRS Was Gutted An eight-year campaign to slash the agency\u2019s budget has left it understaffed, hamstrung and operating with archaic equipment. The result: billions less to fund the government. That\u2019s good news for corporations and the wealthy.\n\nTaxpayers of all kinds cheat. And IRS studies have found that EITC recipients aren\u2019t close to the worst offenders. For certain kinds of business income, for instance, people pay only about 37 percent of the tax they owe because they simply don\u2019t report the income. Hundreds of billions of dollars in government revenue is lost. But people who have their own businesses are audited at about the same rate as EITC recipients.\n\nThe IRS\u2019 disproportionate focus on stopping EITC \u201cimproper payments\u201d is misguided, said Nina Olson, the national taxpayer advocate. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between an erroneous EITC dollar being sent out and a dollar attributed to unreported self-employment income not collected?\u201d she asked. Unreported business income is \u201cwhere the real money is,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen EITC cheating does occur, the culprits are usually tax preparers, said Chi Chi Wu of the National Consumer Law Center. \u201cThey know the system, they game the system and ultimately the taxpayer ends up on the hook if there\u2019s an audit,\u201d she said. In undercover investigations by the NCLC and the Government Accountability Office, multiple preparers advised taxpayers to file bogus EITC claims.\n\nAbout 60 percent of taxpayers use a preparer, but in most states, preparers are not required to be licensed, and the IRS\u2019 ability to oversee them is limited. After the agency launched a program to certify preparers and subject them to regular compliance checks, a federal appeals court ruled in 2014 that the IRS doesn\u2019t have that power. Congress could pass a bill to confer such authority on the agency, but it has not done so, despite some bipartisan support for the idea.\n\nThe IRS has a difficult task in auditing taxpayers who claim the EITC. Low-income families are often complicated; they\u2019re more likely to be multi-generational than more affluent filers, for instance, or to add or subtract household members from year to year. A study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that only about 48 percent of low-income households with children were married couples, while for other households it was 75 percent.\n\nBut advocates for taxpayers say the IRS makes the situation needlessly worse. Virtually all the EITC audits are conducted by correspondence, and the computer-generated letters are far from simple. A survey by the Taxpayer Advocate Service found that more than a quarter of EITC recipients who were audited didn\u2019t even understand that they were under audit.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got audited, I couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on,\u201d said Denise Canady, 62, of West Memphis, Arkansas, who at the time was earning $8.50 an hour as a home health aide. The audit sent her on a scramble to get documents from her granddaughter\u2019s doctor, pharmacy, hospital and school that would demonstrate that the toddler had lived at her address. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t want to give you old records,\u201d she said.\n\nShe eventually found her way to Legal Aid of Arkansas, where an attorney helped bolster her case, but, a year after her audit began, she is still awaiting the outcome.\n\n\u201cI pray and hope,\u201d she said."

The GOP-dominated state government engaged in a brazen power grab this week working feverishly over several days and into the night on Tuesday to pass a sweeping set of bills by early Wednesday curbing the power of incoming Democratic elected officials. They faced thousands of protesters who marched, chanted, rallied, and denounced the GOP's moves outside the State Capitol.\n\n\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the measures, \"limit early voting, require lawmaker approval for the attorney general to settle certain lawsuits, and give lawmakers, not the governor, the majority of appointments on an economic development board. They also prevent [Governor Elect] Tony Evers from banning guns in the Wisconsin Capitol without permission from legislators.\" But Republican lawmakers are justifying their move saying it's simply a way to balance power.\n\n\n\nWisconsin's current Governor Scott Walker was shocked by his loss to Mr. Evers. He is expected to sign the bills into law as one of his last major acts as Governor.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Mary Bottari, Director of the Center for Media and Democracy's Real Economy Project."

  "text": "There was an awful lot of smock swirling around last Friday (And where there's smock, there's liar. I know where the door is, thanks.), so partly obscured in it was James Comey's appearance before a closed-door session of the House Intelligence Committee. In it, Comey, probably secure in the knowledge that his fingerprints on this presidency* are now thoroughly obscured by those of various bagmen and those of bad actors from many lands, finally admitted clearly that his inexcusable meddling in the campaign was prompted by an insubordinate New York field office that was leaking like a rotten bucket to the likes of Rudy Giuliani, a fairly rotten old bucket himself.\n\nWant unlimited access to Charlie? Join the fight against stupid HERE\n\nIn the transcript released by the committee, Comey is as explicit as he's ever been about his inability to discipline the FBI's New York office, which had an obsession with the Clintons bigger than the one Maureen Dowd has been toting around since 1991.\n\nI was concerned that there appeared to be in the media a number of stories that might have been based on communications reporters or nonreporters like Rudy Giuliani were having with people in the New York field office. In particular, in I want to say mid October, maybe a little bit later, Mr. Giuliani was making statements that appeared to be based on his knowledge of workings inside the FBI New York. And then my recollection is there were other stories that were in the same ballpark that gave me a general concern that we may have a leak problem -- unauthorized disclosure problem out of New York, and so I asked that it be investigated.\n\nThe rest of the transcript is nothing we haven't heard before. It largely is Trey Gowdy's Last Ride across the plains of fantasy, with the lopheaded Javert from South Carolina summoning all the conjuring words\u2014Fusion GPS! Strzok! Dossier!\u2014like an aging band playing the summer shed tour, and it's also a chance for Comey burnish his dented reputation one more time.\n\nBut it is good to have clearly on the record the fact the former director of the FBI believes that it wasn't just the Russians who were trying to monkeywrench the Democratic candidate for president, and that the former director of the FBI was so incapable of managing his subordinates that he let it happen. Historians of the future are going to be amazed, and then they are like to drink very heavily.\n\nRespond to this post on the Esquire Politics Facebook page here."

USA TODAY\n\nUSOC chief of sport performance Alan Ashley speaks during the U.S. Olympic Team media summit in Park City, Utah, on Sept. 25, 2017. (Photo: Jerry Lai-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nU.S. Olympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland fired USOC chief of sport performance Alan Ashley on Monday morning after she was made aware of the contents of the Ropes & Gray report revealing that he failed to take action for 13 \u00bd months after learning about sexual abuse allegations against Larry Nassar.\n\n\u201cI made the determination late yesterday evening that our organization simply could not be successful going forward with Alan in the important leadership role he was in and thus first thing this morning, we terminated Alan\u2019s employment,\" Hirshland told USA TODAY in a call Monday afternoon. \"I was very specifically briefed on the report contents as it related to Alan Ashley in particular, and upon reviewing those components and those findings, I made the determination that we needed to take the action we took.\u201d\n\nAshley, whose high-profile presence within the USOC was highlighted in February with his appearance on stage at the organization\u2019s closing news conference at the Olympics, oversaw the USOC's divisions that provide resources and support to the national governing bodies and top athletes competing internationally. The support includes funding services in the areas of coaching, sport science, sports medicine and on-site operations in support of performance at the Olympics.\n\nRelated: New report details how USOC, USAG failed to protect athletes in Nassar case\n\nColumn: USOC official Alan Ashley rightly fired after staying silent in Nassar case\n\nAshley was one of the highest paid USOC employees. Like many top executives, he earned bonuses based on the performance of American athletes at the Olympics.\n\nAccording to the organization\u2019s 990 tax forms, his compensation ranged from $426,000 to $459,000 annually from 2014-16. The USOC paid Ashley $720,000 in 2017, making him the organization\u2019s second highest paid employee besides Blackmun, who received $1.3 million in compensation that year.\n\nThe law firm Ropes & Gray was hired in February by the USOC to investigate when USA Gymnastics and USOC officials first became aware of evidence of Nassar\u2019s abuse and what they did with that information. It reviewed more than 1.3 million documents and interviewed more than 100 people, including gymnasts and employees and board members of the USOC, USAG and the U.S. Center for SafeSport.\n\nContributing: Rachel Axon"

  "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s legacy can be summed up in just one number: $343 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s the increase between the deficit for fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2018 \u2014 that is, the difference between the fiscal year before Ryan became speaker of the House and the fiscal year in which he retired.\n\nIf the economy had fallen into recession between 2015 and 2018, Ryan\u2019s record would be understandable. But it didn\u2019t. In fact, growth quickened and the labor market tightened \u2014 which means deficits should\u2019ve fallen. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what happened in each of the five years preceding Ryan\u2019s speakership; from 2011 to 2015, annual deficits fell each year.\n\nAs he prepares to leave office, Ryan says that debt reduction is one of those things \u201cI wish we could have gotten done.\u201d Ryan, the man with the single most power over the federal budget in recent years, sounds like a bystander, as if he watched laws happen rather than made them happen.\n\nTo understand the irony and duplicity of that statement, you need to understand Ryan\u2019s career. After the profligacy of the George W. Bush years and the rise of the Tea Party, Ryan rocketed to the top ranks of his party by warning that mounting deficits under President Obama threatened the \u201cmost predictable economic crisis we have ever had in this country.\u201d Absent the fiscal responsibility that would accompany Republican rule, we were facing nothing less than \u201cthe end of the American dream.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s reputation was built on the back of his budgets: draconian documents that gutted social spending, privatized Medicare, and showed the Republican Party had embraced the kinds of hard fiscal choices that Bush had sloughed off. And Ryan presented himself as the wonkish apostle of this new GOP, rolling up his sleeves and running through the charts, graphs, and tables that made his case.\n\n\u201cI admit that in recent years Republicans abandoned these principles,\u201d Ryan wrote in the book Young Guns, the 2010 GOP manifesto he co-authored with Reps. Kevin McCarthy and Eric Cantor. \u201cWe lost the true path and suffered electoral defeats. But we have not returned from this experience empty handed.\u201d\n\nWhat Republicans had returned with, according to Ryan, was a willingness to make hard choices. \u201cIt\u2019s time politicians in Washington stopped patronizing the American people as if they were children,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s time we stop deferring tough decisions and promising fiscal fantasies.\u201d\n\nFor this, Ryan was feted in Washington society; the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget gave him a \u201cFiscy\u201d award for budget bravery; he was a member of the Simpson-Bowles commission (which he ultimately voted against); he became Mitt Romney\u2019s vice presidential candidate. His reputation was so towering that when John Boehner stepped down as speaker, he told Ryan, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do this job.\u201d\n\nI was among the reporters who took Ryan\u2019s reboot seriously. \u201cTo move us to surpluses,\u201d I wrote of his 2010 proposal, \u201cRyan\u2019s budget proposes reforms that are nothing short of violent. Medicare is privatized. Seniors get a voucher to buy private insurance, and the voucher\u2019s growth is far slower than the expected growth of health-care costs. Medicaid is also privatized. The employer tax exclusion is fully eliminated, replaced by a tax credit that grows more slowly than medical costs.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t agree with Ryan\u2019s policies, but at least he was making the trade-offs of his vision clear. Here was a Republican who said what he was going to do, who admitted his health care plan included \u201crationing,\u201d who offered something specific to argue with. That was progress.\n\nBut to critics like the New York Times\u2019s Paul Krugman, Ryan was an obvious con man weaponizing the deficit to hamstring Obama\u2019s presidency, weaken the recovery, and snooker Beltway centrists eager to champion a reasonable-seeming Republican. Ryan, after all, had voted for Bush\u2019s deficits \u2014 he was a yes on the tax cuts, on the wars, on Medicare Part D. He proposed a Social Security privatization scheme so pricey that even the Bush administration dismissed it as \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\n\nAnd his budgets, for all the hard choices, didn\u2019t actually add up. They included massive tax cuts with underestimated costs and unspecified financing \u2014 which is what led Krugman to call him a charlatan back in 2010. Ryan waved this away as nitpicking. \u201dIf needed,\u201d his office said, \u201cadjustments can be easily made to the specified rates to hit the revenue targets.\u201d But his critics predicted he would lose his appetite for hard choices the moment his party returned to power. He hadn\u2019t changed; he had merely rebranded.\n\nThe numbers proved them right. Ryan was elected speaker of the House on October 29, 2015. Over the next three years, annual deficits increased by almost 80 percent. The added debt is Ryan\u2019s legacy, not his circumstance. It is entirely attributable to policy choices he made.\n\nTo Ryan\u2019s supporters, this is unfair. \u201cBeing speaker of the House is the most Faustian job in history,\u201d Arthur Brooks, president of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s done the best he can under these circumstances. Because he did one thing but didn\u2019t do another, to say he never cared about the first thing is to misunderstand the choices, and to commit ad hominem arguments.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s too kind. As speaker, Ryan had tremendous power. He could have, for instance, brought immigration compromises to the floor of the House but enforced congressional PayGo rules to bar any bills that increased the deficit from coming to a vote. Instead, he refused to bring immigration compromises to the floor while personally shepherding bills that betrayed the ideas that won him power. We are the choices we make \u2014 and Ryan made his.\n\nTo be clear, I am not particularly concerned about deficits right now, just as I wasn\u2019t in 2010. But I took Ryan seriously when he said he was. I covered the arguments Ryan made, the policies he crafted, and I treated them as if they offered a guide to how Republicans would govern. I listened when Ryan said things like, \u201cIn Europe, generations of welfare-dependent citizens are hurling Molotov cocktails because their governments can no longer fund their entitlement programs. We can\u2019t let that happen here.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s office did not grant my request for an interview for this piece. But now, as Ryan prepares to leave Congress, it is clear that his critics were correct and a credulous Washington press corps \u2014 including me \u2014 that took him at his word was wrong. In the trillions of long-term debt he racked up as speaker, in the anti-poverty proposals he promised but never passed, and in the many lies he told to sell unpopular policies, Ryan proved as much a practitioner of post-truth politics as Donald Trump.\n\nPaul Ryan\u2019s three betrayals\n\nThree bills in particular stand out in assessing Ryan\u2019s record.\n\nThe first is the 2017 tax cut Ryan passed but didn\u2019t pay for. His defenders note that early drafts of the tax cut bill included a border adjustment tax that would\u2019ve made the package revenue-neutral, fulfilling Ryan\u2019s promises. But that policy fell out of the legislation early on, and rather than replace it, Ryan pushed a plan that added $1.5 trillion to the national debt over 10 years, and used accounting gimmicks to hide vastly larger increases tucked into the legislation\u2019s long-term design. Now House Republicans, still under Ryan\u2019s leadership, are agitating to make the tax cuts permanent, with a 20-year cost estimated at $4 trillion.\n\nThis is particularly galling given that Ryan\u2019s initial star turn in Republican politics came through a misleading presentation accusing the Obama administration of using gimmickry to hide Obamacare\u2019s true cost. (In reality, Obamacare was paid for and its costs have been even lower than promised.)\n\nThe second is the spending Ryan passed but didn\u2019t pay for. Years of fiscal irresponsibility have sometimes permitted Republicans to be graded on a curve, where tax cuts can be charged to the national credit card and spending cuts are the true measure of policy steel. But even on this diminished measure, Ryan\u2019s record betrayed his promises.\n\nIn March, Ryan pushed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill through the House, which included almost $300 billion in spending increases. New spending, it turned out, only had to be paid for so long as it was a Democratic president proposing or signing it.\n\n\u201cWhen you have power and need to make choices, those choices do reveal something about you,\u201d says Yuval Levin, editor of the conservative policy journal National Affairs. \u201cI think what they reveal is where the least common denominator is in the Republican Party. I think there\u2019s no question that what Republicans do when we get power is supply-side tax cuts. That\u2019s the wall I and others have been banging our heads into for years now.\u201d\n\nThe third is the expansion of the earned income tax credit Ryan proposed but never even tried to pass. After the 2010 election, he went on a much-vaunted tour of American poverty, racking up positive press for expanding the boundaries of the possible under conservatism, and arguing for an enlarged EITC that would help childless adults.\n\nThe Obama administration quickly spied a possible compromise with Ryan, and sought to capitalize on it. But Ryan proved more interested in the praise than the policy.\n\n\u201cWhen we tried to get it into a negotiation, he refused,\u201d says Jason Furman, who served as Obama\u2019s chief economist. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t in his tax plan. In $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, he somehow couldn\u2019t find space for this $60 billion item. It\u2019s just amazing.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the House actually is a powerful position in American politics\n\nRyan\u2019s defenders portray him as a principled legislator trapped by the coalition he managed.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump was president of the United States, and that circumscribed Paul Ryan\u2019s choices,\u201d says Brooks. \u201cYou can dispute what he did, but he got as much of the loaf as he thought he could get given the factions of his caucus and Trump\u2019s peculiarities. Did he like being speaker of the House? The results speak for themselves: He\u2019s leaving.\u201d\n\nIn this telling, Ryan\u2019s principled vision was foiled by Trump\u2019s ascendancy. Faced with a Republican president he had never expected, and managing a restive majority that mostly agreed on being disagreeable, Ryan defaulted to the lowest common denominator of Republican Party policy: unpaid-for tax cuts for the rich, increases in defense spending, and failed attempts to repeal Obamacare.\n\nThis is more or less the defense Ryan has offered of his tenure. \u201cI think some people would like me to start a civil war in our party and achieve nothing,\u201d he told the New York Times. Trump had no appetite for cutting entitlements, so Ryan got what he could, and he got out.\n\nBut would it have started a civil war in the Republican Party if the most publicly anti-deficit politician of his generation had simply refused to pass laws that increased the deficit? And even if it had, isn\u2019t that the war Ryan had promised?\n\nThe question here is not why Ryan didn\u2019t live up to a liberal philosophy of government; it\u2019s why he didn\u2019t live up to his own philosophy of government.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump was clearly flexible when it came to policy. On the campaign, Trump repeatedly promised he wouldn\u2019t cut Medicaid; as president, he endorsed legislation Ryan wrote that did exactly that. After winning the election, Trump promised he\u2019d replace Obamacare with a plan that offered \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d with \u201cmuch lower deductibles,\u201d but he ultimately backed Ryan\u2019s bill to take Obamacare away from millions and push the system toward higher-deductible plans. For Ryan to claim he was not driving the policy agenda in the Trump years is ridiculous.\n\nRyan proved himself and his party to be exactly what the critics said: monomaniacally focused on taking health insurance from the poor, cutting taxes for the rich, and spending more on the Pentagon. And he proved that Republicans were willing to betray their promises and, in their embrace of Trump, violate basic decency to achieve those goals.\n\nPaul Ryan, Donald Trump, and post-truth politics\n\nRyan clearly wishes Donald Trump had lost the primary, and his early exit from the speakership reflects it. As such, a lot of the narrative around Ryan\u2019s retirement has emphasized his discontinuities with Trump, and whether he did enough to voice them. In the New York Times, for instance, Mark Leibovich wrote:\n\nAs has been strenuously noted, Trump and Ryan are stylistic and philosophical opposites: Trump the blunt-force agitator vs. Ryan the think-tank conservative. Trump lashes out while Ryan treads carefully. Ryan still fashions himself a \u201cpolicy guy\u201d and a man of ideas: In high school, he read the conservative philosopher Ayn Rand and was captivated by her signature work, \u201cAtlas Shrugged.\u201d He bills himself as a guardian of the free-trading, debt-shrinking notions that Republican-led governments used to stand for before Trump crashed the tent.\n\nBut more important than the differences between Ryan and Trump are the similarities. Yes, Ryan is decorous and polite where Trump is confrontational and uncouth, but the say-anything brand of politics that so outrages Trump\u2019s critics is no less present in Ryan\u2019s recent history. How else can we read a politician who rose to power promising to reduce deficits only to increase them at every turn? Or a politician who raked in good press for promising anti-poverty policies that he subsequently refused to pass?\n\nAnd as ridiculous as some of Trump\u2019s claims have been, his baldfaced lies that his inauguration was better-attended than Obama\u2019s was a less consequential violation of the truth than what Ryan said when asked about the tax bill: \u201cI don\u2019t think it will increase the deficit.\u201d Note that the tax bill is already increasing the deficit.\n\nRyan\u2019s campaign for his failed Obamacare repeal bill was thick with similarly brazen deceptions, like that the legislation would strengthen protections for preexisting conditions, when in fact it would gut them.\n\n\u201cWhat made Ryan attractive to analysts and journalists across the spectrum was that he\u2019d engage in a thoughtful dialogue with you,\u201d says Bob Greenstein, president of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \u201cbut that didn\u2019t mean that 10 minutes later, in front of the cameras, he wouldn\u2019t say something that was at best misleading and at worst invalid.\u201d\n\nIn important ways, Trump is not a break from the Republican Party\u2019s recent past but an acceleration of it. A party that acculturates itself, its base, and its media sphere to constant nonsense can hardly complain when other political entrepreneurs notice that nonsense sells and decide to begin marketing their own brand of flimflam.\n\nUltimately, Ryan put himself forward as a test of a simple, but important, proposition: Is fiscal responsibility something Republicans believe in or something they simply weaponize against Democrats to win back power so they can pass tax cuts and defense spending? Over the past three years, he provided a clear answer. That is his legacy, and it will haunt his successors.\n\nSooner or later, Trump\u2019s presidency will end, and there will come a new generation of Republicans who want to separate themselves from the embarrassments of their party\u2019s record. As Ryan did, they will present themselves as appalled by both their party\u2019s past and the Democrats\u2019 present, and they will promise to lead into a more responsible future. The first question they will face, and the hardest one to answer, will be: Why should anyone believe they\u2019re not just another Paul Ryan?"

  "title": "Trump is losing the trade war with China based on his favorite report card, and it's probably going to keep getting worse",
  "authors": [
    "Bob Bryan"
  ],
  "text": "Shrinking the US trade deficit has been a key goal of President Donald Trump's trade war.\n\nBut the US Census Bureau announced Thursday that the US trade deficit grew to $55.5 billion in the month of October, the highest in exactly 10 years. That was a 1.7% jump from September, as imports rose by 0.2% and exports fell by 0.1%.\n\nTrump has long been focused on the trade deficit as a signal that his administration's tariffs on Chinese goods and metals are working, despite the fact that most economists discount the measure as a sign of effective trade policy.\n\nLooking at the main target of the trade war, China, the trade deficit was similarly dismal. The unadjusted goods trade deficit hit $43.1 billion in October, the highest level ever.\n\nWhile Trump may not like the results, there are good reasons the trade deficit is expanding. And part of the blame lies in the president's own policies.\n\nOn the import side of the ledger:\n\nThe US economy is stronger, and US consumers' appetite is outpacing the country's ability to produce the goods they want.\n\nThis means the US needs goods from other countries to satisfy consumer demand, leading to import growth.\n\nThe increase in demand is in part because of the significant amount of fiscal stimulus injected into the economy by Trump's tax cuts and the massive bipartisan budget deal.\n\nGoosing the economy, while helping Trump claim victories on things like a stronger GDP, also means the president's trade report card looks worse.\n\nAt the same time, exports are cooling because of retaliatory tariffs on US products:\n\nFor example, soybean exports to China\u2014 a major chunk of US agricultural exports \u2014 have collapsed as a result of the trade war.\n\nThe trade policy exacerbates the existing issues that were already causing weak export growth, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote Thursday.\n\n\"The stronger dollar and slower growth in China and Europe are hurting exports, and the tariffs are a real problem too; exports of soybeans fell by $0.8 billion to a four-year low, down 43% year-over-year,\" Shepherson said.\n\nRead more: The US-China trade war might still rage on despite a breakthrough deal between Trump and Xi\n\nThose existing drags on exports \u2014 the strong US dollar and slowing economic growth in foreign countries \u2014 and the tariffs combine to make the perfect recipe for weakness on that side of the deficit ledger.\n\n\"Moderating global momentum, the stronger dollar, and protectionist trade policies will keep weighing on exports in the near-term, while sturdy domestic demand and limited spare capacity keep import growth healthy \u2014 further widening the deficit,\" said Jack McRobie and Gregory Daco, economists at Oxford Economics.\n\nA few things could turn around the deficit situation. If the US economy were to cool off, as many economists expect, it could slow the pace of import growth. At the same time, if Trump is able to strike a trade deal with China, a prospect of which economists and experts are more skeptical, export growth could rebound and close the gap."

  "text": "FILE - In this Nov. 27, 2018, file frame from video, April Pipkins holds a photograph of her deceased son, Emantic \"EJ\" Bradford Jr., during an interview in Birmingham, Ala. Bradford, who was licensed to carry a gun, was killed Thanksgiving night by an officer responding to a report of gunfire at a shopping mall in Hoover, Ala. The recent shootings of Bradford Jr. and Jemel Roberson amplified long-held worries that bad things can happen when a black man is seen with a gun. (AP Photo/Jay Reeves, File)\n\nODENTON, Md. (AP) \u2014 Gun-rights advocates like to say, \u201cThe only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.\u201d Some black gun owners, though, are not so sure it\u2019s a wise idea for them to try to be the good guy and pull out a weapon in public.\n\nTwice in the span of 11 days last month, a black man who drew a gun in response to a crime in the U.S. was shot to death by a white police officer after apparently being mistaken for the bad guy.\n\nSome African-Americans who are licensed to carry weapons say cases like those make them hesitant to step in to protect others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an advocate of open-carry if you\u2019re black,\u201d said the Rev. Kenn Blanchard, a Second Amendment activist and host of the YouTube program \u201cBlack Man With a Gun TV,\u201d a gun advocacy show. \u201cWe still have racism. ... We still scare people. The psychology of fear, it\u2019s bigger than the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe recent shootings of Jemel Roberson and Emantic Bradford Jr. amplified long-held fears that bad things can happen when a black man is seen with a gun.\n\nRoberson was working security at a Robbins, Illinois, bar when he was killed Nov. 11 while holding at gunpoint a man involved in a shooting. Witnesses said the officer ordered the 26-year-old Roberson to drop his gun before opening fire.\n\nTap to unmute\n\nBut witnesses also reportedly shouted that Roberson, who had a firearms permit, was a guard. And a fellow guard said Roberson was wearing a knit hat and sweatshirt that were emblazoned \u201cSecurity.\u201d\n\nBradford, 21, was killed Thanksgiving night by an officer responding to a report of gunfire at a shopping mall in Hoover, Alabama. Police initially identified Bradford as the gunman but later backtracked and arrested another suspect.\n\nBen Crump, a lawyer for the dead man\u2019s family, said witnesses claimed Bradford was trying to wave people away from the shooting. Crump said Bradford was licensed to carry a weapon but was presumably seen as a threat because he was a black man.\n\nThe two shootings have brought up some of the same questions about racist assumptions and subconscious fears that were asked after the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida.\n\nTrevor Noah, host of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d lamented Bradford\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they always say, right? \u2018The good guy with a gun stops the crime,\u2019\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut then if the good guy with a gun turns out to be a black good guy with a gun, they don\u2019t get any of the benefits.\u201d\n\nIn some other cases involving black men killed by police: Philando Castile was shot in a car in 2016 in Minnesota, seconds after informing the officer he had a gun. The officer was acquitted of manslaughter. And John Crawford III was shot in a Walmart in Ohio in 2014 while holding a BB gun he had picked up in the sporting goods section. Security footage showed he never pointed it at anyone.\n\nAccording to the advocacy group Mapping Police Violence, 1,147 people were killed by police in 2017, 92 percent of them in shootings. While blacks made up 13 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for 27 percent of those killed by police, 35 percent of those killed by police while unarmed, and 34 percent of those killed while unarmed and not attacking, the organization said.\n\nAndre Blount of Tomball, Texas, once pulled out his shotgun to help a neighbor who was being attacked by an armed white man. The police eventually arrived and defused the situation, he said.\n\n\u201cFor me, being a legally registered owner and having a concealed weapon permit, I feel like I have to be more careful than the next person,\u201d Blount said. \u201cBecause if not, the only thing anyone sees is a black man with a gun.\u201d\n\nBlount said he tells younger black gun owners to really consider whether it\u2019s worth risking their lives in coming to someone\u2019s aid with a weapon.\n\n\u201cYou want your kids to help someone, but you don\u2019t want them to be shot trying to help someone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad thing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJesse J.

Trump\u2019s bed, cleaned his toilet and dusted his crystal golf trophies. When he visited as president, she was directed to wear a pin in the shape of the American flag adorned with a Secret Service logo.\n\nBecause of the \u201coutstanding\u201d support she has provided during Mr. Trump\u2019s visits, Ms. Morales in July was given a certificate from the White House Communications Agency inscribed with her name.\n\nQuite an achievement for an undocumented immigrant housekeeper.\n\nMs. Morales\u2019s journey from cultivating corn in rural Guatemala to fluffing pillows at an exclusive golf resort took her from the southwest border, where she said she crossed illegally in 1999, to the horse country of New Jersey, where she was hired at the Trump property in 2013 with documents she said were phony.\n\nShe said she was not the only worker at the club who was in the country illegally.\n\nSandra Diaz, 46, a native of Costa Rica who is now a legal resident of the United States, said she, too, was undocumented when she worked at Bedminster between 2010 and 2013. The two women said they worked for years as part of a group of housekeeping, maintenance and landscaping employees at the golf club that included a number of undocumented workers, though they could not say precisely how many. There is no evidence that Mr. Trump or Trump Organization executives knew of their immigration status. But at least two supervisors at the club were aware of it, the women said, and took steps to help workers evade detection and keep their jobs."

  "text": "Global emissions of carbon dioxide are reaching the highest levels on record, scientists projected Wednesday, in the latest evidence of the chasm between international goals for combating climate change and what countries are doing.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, emissions remained largely flat, leading to hopes that the world was beginning to turn a corner. Those hopes appear to have been dashed. In 2017, global emissions grew 1.6 percent. The rise in 2018 is projected to be 2.7 percent.\n\nThe expected increase, which would bring fossil fuel and industrial emissions to a record high of 37.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, is being driven by a nearly 5 percent growth of emissions in China and more than 6 percent in India, researchers estimated, along with growth in many other nations. Emissions by the United States grew 2.5 percent, while those of the European Union declined by just under 1 percent.\n\nAs nations continue climate talks in Poland, the message of Wednesday\u2019s report was unambiguous: When it comes to promises to begin cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change, the world is well off target.\n\n\u201cWe are in trouble. We are in deep trouble with climate change,\u201d United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said this week at the opening of the 24th annual U.N. climate conference, where countries will wrestle with the ambitious goals they need to meet to sharply reduce carbon emissions in the coming years.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate the urgency of our situation,\u201d he said. \u201cEven as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteam rises from the brown coal-fired power plant Neurath, center, and Niederaussem, left, operated by RWE in Bergheim, Germany, on Tuesday.

(Sascha Steinbach/EPA-EFE)\n\nGuterres was not commenting specifically on Wednesday\u2019s findings, which were released in a trio of scientific papers by researchers with the Global Carbon Project. But his words came amid a litany of grim news in the fall in which scientists have warned that the effects of climate change are no longer distant and hypothetical, and that the effects of global warming will only intensify in the absence of aggressive international action.\n\nIn October, a top U.N.-backed scientific panel found that nations have barely a decade to take \u201cunprecedented\u201d actions and cut their emissions in half by 2030 to prevent the worst consequences of climate change. The panel\u2019s report found \u201cno documented historic precedent\u201d for the rapid changes to the infrastructure of society that would be needed to hold warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving, the Trump administration released a nearly 1,700-page report co-written by hundreds of scientists finding that climate change is already causing increasing damage to the United States. That was followed by another report detailing the growing gap between the commitments made at earlier U.N. conferences and what is needed to steer the planet off its calamitous path.\n\nCoupled with Wednesday\u2019s findings, that drumbeat of daunting news has cast a considerable pall over the international climate talks in Poland, which began this week and are scheduled to run through Dec. 14.\n\nNegotiators there face the difficult task of coming to terms with the gap between the promises they made in Paris in 2015 and what\u2019s needed to control dangerous levels of warming \u2014 a first step, it is hoped, toward more aggressive climate action beginning in 2020. Leaders at the conference also are trying to put in place a process for how countries measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions to the rest of the world in the years ahead.\n\nBut while most of the world remains firmly committed to the notion of tackling climate change, many countries are not on pace to meet their relatively modest Paris pledges. The Trump administration has continued to roll back environmental regulations and insist that it will exit the Paris agreement in 2020. Brazil, which has struggled to rein in deforestation, in the fall elected Jair Bolsonaro, a president-elect who has pledged to roll back protections for the Amazon.\n\nThe biggest emissions story in 2018, though, appears to be China, the world\u2019s largest emitting country, which grew its output of planet-warming gases by nearly a half-billion tons, researchers estimate. (The United States is the globe\u2019s second-largest emitter.)\n\nThe country\u2019s sudden, significant increase in carbon emissions could be linked to a wider slowdown in the economy, environmental analysts said.\n\n\u201cUnder pressure of the current economic downturn, some local governments might have loosened supervision on air pollution and carbon emissions,\u201d said Yang Fuqiang, an energy adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. environmental organization.\n\nChina\u2019s top planning agency said Wednesday that three areas \u2014 Liaoning in the northeast Rust Belt and the big coal-producing regions of Ningxia and Xinjiang in the northwest \u2014 had failed to meet their targets to curb energy consumption growth and improve efficiency last year.\n\nBut Yang said that these areas were not representative of the whole country and that China was generally on the right track. \u201cThere is still a long way ahead in terms of pollution control and emissions reduction, but we expect to see more ambitions in central government\u2019s plans and actions,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch changes \u2014 in all large-emitting nations \u2014 have to happen fast.\n\nScientists have said that annual carbon dioxide emissions need to plunge almost by half by 2030 if the world wants to hit the most stringent \u2014 and safest \u2014 climate change target. That would be either keeping the Earth\u2019s warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2014 when it is already at 1 degrees \u2014 or only briefly \u201covershooting\u201d that temperature.\n\nBut emissions are far too high to limit warming to such an extent. And instead of falling dramatically, they\u2019re still rising.\n\nWednesday\u2019s research makes clear the intimidating math behind the fundamental shift that scientists say is required. While some nations continue to grow their emissions and some are shrinking them, overall there are still more additions than subtractions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing declines in wealthy countries that outpace the increases in other parts of the world,\u201d said Rob Jackson, a researcher at Stanford University who contributed to the research as part of the Global Carbon Project.\n\nThe problem of cutting emissions is that it leads to difficult choices in the real world. A growing global economy inevitably stokes more energy demand. And different countries are growing their emissions \u2014 or failing to shrink them \u2014 for different reasons.\n\n\u201cIndia is providing electricity and energy to hundreds of millions of people who don\u2019t have it yet,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThat\u2019s very different than in China, where they are ramping up coal use again in part because their economic growth has been slowing. They\u2019re greenlighting coal-based projects that have been on hold.\u201d\n\nThe continuing growth in global emissions is happening, researchers noted, even though renewable energy sources are growing. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re still far too small as energy sources.\n\n\u201cSolar and wind are doing great; they\u2019re going quite well,\u201d said Glen Peters, director of the Center for International Climate Research in Oslo and another of the Global Carbon Project research\u2019s authors. \u201cBut in China and India, the solar and wind are just filling new demand. You could say if you didn\u2019t have solar or wind, emissions could be higher. But solar and wind are nowhere near big enough yet to replace fossil fuels.\u201d\n\n\n\nA worker unloads a bowl of charcoal onto a wire mesh filter at a coal wholesale market in Mumbai on Nov. 10. India is making a gradual shift away from fossil fuels to make its growth more sustainable and offer relief to its cities choked with air pollution. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe figures the researchers provided are an estimate based on available energy and cement industry data through the first nine months of the year, and projections based on economic trends and the amount of carbon tied to economic activity in different countries. The estimated growth could change a bit, Jackson said \u2014 it\u2019s possible the final number could be between an increase of 1.8 percent and 3.7 percent. But either way, there\u2019s little doubt that 2018 hit a record high for global emissions.\n\nIn the United States, emissions in 2018 are projected to have risen 2.5 percent, driven in part by a very warm summer that led to high air conditioning use and a very cold winter in the Northeast, but also by a continued use of oil driven by low gas prices and bigger cars. U.S. emissions had been on a downturn, as coal plants are being replaced by natural gas plants and renewable energy, but that momentum ground to a halt this year, at least temporarily. In Europe, cars also have been a major driver of slower-than-expected emissions reductions.\n\nAs for China, coal accounts for about 60 percent of China\u2019s total energy consumption, but the government hopes to bring it down to 10 percent by 2050.\n\nThanks to increased investment in green energy, China\u2019s carbon intensity, or the amount of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP, declined by 46 percent by 2017 from 2005 levels, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment reported earlier this week. It had expected it would take until 2020 to reach the targeted 40 to 45 percent reduction.\n\n\u201cWith these goals met, a very solid foundation has been laid for meeting the target of halting the increase of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and even accomplishing that sooner than planned,\u201d Xie Zhenhua, China\u2019s special representative for climate change affairs, told the state-owned news agency Xinhua ahead of the meeting in Poland.\n\nChina will remain steadfast and active in addressing climate change and implementing the Paris agreement, Xie said.\n\nBut officials and analysts alike point out that the United States is not doing its part to combat global warming. \u201cWe would also love to see the United States embrace its responsibilities by returning to the Paris climate deal,\u201d said Yang of the NRDC.\n\nDespite the overwhelming challenges, Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, still holds high hopes for the talks in Poland.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an optimist because of human nature,\u201d Espinosa said in an interview. She suspects the spate of ominous climate news might have prompted a tipping point at which societies begin demanding aggressive actions from their leaders to stave off the most disastrous effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cI think we have kind of reached the limit,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we are facing the limit, I think we need to come up with something more creative, more ambitious, stronger and bolder.\u201d\n\nLyric Li in Beijing contributed to this report."

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)\n\nA top White House appointee at the Department of Veterans Affairs sought to silence the agency\u2019s chief diversity officer, who \u2014 in the aftermath of last year\u2019s racially charged violence in Charlottesville \u2014 pushed for a forceful condemnation that was at odds with President Trump\u2019s response, newly disclosed emails show.\n\nThe tense exchange between Georgia Coffey, a nationally recognized expert in workplace diversity and race relations, and John Ullyot, who remains VA\u2019s chief communications official, occurred during a low point in Trump\u2019s presidency: when he blamed \u201cmany sides\u201d for the deadly clash in Charlottesville without singling out the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who rallied there.\n\n[Trump condemns Charlottesville violence but doesn\u2019t single out white nationalists]\n\nOne woman was killed and dozens were injured in the August 2017 protest, which began over the city\u2019s plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a local park and ended when a car plowed into a crowd of anti-racism protesters.\n\nVA\u2019s secretary at the time, David Shulkin, made headlines that week when he appeared to break with Trump, telling reporters the violence in Charlottesville \u201coutraged\u201d him. Coffey, a career senior executive at VA, pressed the agency\u2019s leaders to issue a statement making it clear that VA stood against such a \u201crepugnant display of hate and bigotry by white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d according to the emails.\n\nThe emails were provided to The Washington Post by the nonprofit watchdog group American Oversight, which obtained them via the Freedom of Information Act. The correspondence sheds new light on the politically delicate decisions federal agencies faced as officials sought to balance the need to address employee concerns with a desire not to upset the White House.\n\n\n\nVeterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin is seen beside President Trump during a Cabinet meeting in March, not long before he was forced from his position. (Michael Reynolds/Pool/Epa-Efe/Shutterstock)\n\n[Veterans Affairs secretary says he\u2019s \u2018outraged\u2019 by what he\u2019s seen from Nazis and white supremacists]\n\nA statement from VA leaders was necessary, Coffey wrote in one email to Ullyot, because the agency\u2019s workforce was unsettled by the uproar caused by the Charlottesville violence. Minorities make up more than 40 percent of VA\u2019s 380,000 employees, the federal government\u2019s second-largest agency.\n\nUllyot told Coffey to stand down, the emails show. A person familiar with their dispute, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The Post that Ullyot was enforcing a directive from the White House, where officials were scrambling to contain the fallout from Trump\u2019s comments, and they did not want government officials to call further attention to the controversy.\n\nVA spokesman Curt Cashour said the agency received no such guidance from the White House.\n\nCoffey, who declined to comment, retired from VA shortly after the dust-up, frustrated with what she felt was a lack of support from the Trump administration, according to her former colleagues. She now works as senior manager for diversity and inclusion at Lockheed Martin.\n\nUllyot, a seasoned media professional who worked on Trump\u2019s campaign, is VA\u2019s assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs. His exchange with Coffey was respectful, and he noted that he was acting at Shulkin\u2019s direction, according to his emails. Shulkin, whom Trump forced out of the Cabinet post in March, and other officials were copied on the messages.\n\n[Top aide to VA chief Shulkin is said to have advocated his ouster]\n\nAt VA, the fallout from Charlottesville remains a sensitive subject. In response to a request seeking comment for this report, VA\u2019s current secretary, Robert Wilkie, issued a statement affirming that \u201cJohn Ullyot is on the VA team because he is committed to veterans and has spent a lifetime of exceptional service as a Marine and public servant.\u201d\n\nUllyot referred questions to VA\u2019s public affairs office.\n\nOn Aug. 17, days after the Charlottesville violence, Coffey \u2014 then deputy assistant secretary for diversity and inclusion \u2014 emailed public affairs. She shared a draft of her statement and accompanying remarks, and requested help disseminating it to employees and the public.\n\nHer remarks said the incident served \u201cas a tragic reminder that our work in civil rights and inclusion is not finished.\u201d She called on VA employees to be mindful of federal anti-discrimination policies and the agency\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe response from a staffer in public affairs said, \u201cJohn Ullyot does not want to post the message, as the Secretary previously made statements in the news media on this topic earlier this week.\u201d\n\nIn an emotional statement the day before, at Trump\u2019s private golf club in Bedminster, N.J., Shulkin said he gave \u201cmy personal opinions as an American and as a Jewish American. . . . And for me in particular, I think in learning history, that we know that staying silent on these issues is simply not acceptable.\u201d\n\nOther top administration officials echoed his sentiments.\n\nCoffey urged expediency, telling Ullyot that she had sent the statement to Shulkin and his chief of staff for their review, according to their email exchange.\n\nUllyot then indicated that after consulting with Shulkin, the secretary said that \u201cwe should all feel free to share our own personal views on the recent events . . . as he did.\u2019\u2019 Ullyot wanted to remove the statement\u2019s more incendiary language but told Coffey she could keep the part that reminded employees of VA\u2019s \u201cstrong commitment\u201d to equal employment opportunity and diversity, their emails show.\n\nCoffey told Ullyot that she worried his edits would \u201cdilute my message and fail to convey the sense of condemnation that I hope we all feel,\u201d the emails show. She offered to remove Shulkin\u2019s name from the statement, but Ullyot told her that he and Shulkin had agreed not to use it.\n\nShulkin said in an interview that he does not recall his conversations with Ullyot about how VA should respond to the incident. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty public about my opinions on the Charlottesville events . . . and of course I think all Americans should express their views,\u201d he said.\n\nCoffey\u2019s staff worried that she would get in trouble if she disregarded Ullyot\u2019s guidance, according to other emails obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group that first publicized the episode last year. The staff suggested that she should tone down her remarks, but Coffey declined. She posted the full remarks under her name in the monthly newsletter posted online by VA\u2019s diversity office. Agency officials removed it and reprimanded her. She retired soon after.\n\nCashour said Shulkin had \u201cdictated explicitly to John how he wanted this particular issue handled.\u201d The secretary, Cashour said, was \u201cadamant that VA employees keep their personal views on the Charlottesville issue out of official VA communications, as Shulkin had done himself in public comments two days beforehand. John was simply ensuring that Coffey understood and followed Shulkin\u2019s guidance.\u201d\n\n[\u2018I thought it was very nice\u2019: VA official showcased portrait of KKK\u2019s first grand wizard]\n\nThe agency has grappled with issues surrounding race in recent years.\n\nVA has long had an Office on Diversity and Inclusion to help improve race relations internally, and during the Obama administration appointed a senior official to travel around the country to set up conversations on race. The official, John Fuller, retired last year, citing a lack of support from the Trump administration.\n\nIn October, a senior official in VA\u2019s Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization was forced to remove a portrait of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general and the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s first grand wizard, from his office in Washington after offending employees. The official said he was unaware of Forrest\u2019s affiliation with the hate group.\n\nThe same month, VA took down a placard outside a conference room in the same office that employees had named for Stonewall Jackson, another Confederate general. Cashour said officials were unaware the room had been named for Jackson and blamed a contractor employed by VA and the contractor\u2019s supervisor. The contractor was instructed to take down the placard but had failed to do so, Cashour said."

  "text": "Global emissions of carbon dioxide are reaching the highest levels on record, scientists projected Wednesday, in the latest evidence of the chasm between international goals for combating climate change and what countries are doing.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, emissions remained largely flat, leading to hopes that the world was beginning to turn a corner. Those hopes appear to have been dashed. In 2017, global emissions grew 1.6 percent. The rise in 2018 is projected to be 2.7 percent.\n\nThe expected increase, which would bring fossil fuel and industrial emissions to a record high of 37.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year, is being driven by a nearly 5 percent growth of emissions in China and more than 6 percent in India, researchers estimated, along with growth in many other nations. Emissions by the United States grew 2.5 percent, while those of the European Union declined by just under 1 percent.\n\nAs nations continue climate talks in Poland, the message of Wednesday\u2019s report was unambiguous: When it comes to promises to begin cutting the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change, the world is well off target.\n\n\u201cWe are in trouble. We are in deep trouble with climate change,\u201d United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said this week at the opening of the 24th annual U.N. climate conference, where countries will wrestle with the ambitious goals they need to meet to sharply reduce carbon emissions in the coming years.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate the urgency of our situation,\u201d he said. \u201cEven as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteam rises from the brown coal-fired power plant Neurath, center, and Niederaussem, left, operated by RWE in Bergheim, Germany, on Tuesday. The Rhenish Brown Coal Field is Europe's largest carbon dioxide source. (Sascha Steinbach/EPA-EFE)\n\nGuterres was not commenting specifically on Wednesday\u2019s findings, which were released in a trio of scientific papers by researchers with the Global Carbon Project. But his words came amid a litany of grim news in the fall in which scientists have warned that the effects of climate change are no longer distant and hypothetical, and that the effects of global warming will only intensify in the absence of aggressive international action.\n\nIn October, a top U.N.-backed scientific panel found that nations have barely a decade to take \u201cunprecedented\u201d actions and cut their emissions in half by 2030 to prevent the worst consequences of climate change. The panel\u2019s report found \u201cno documented historic precedent\u201d for the rapid changes to the infrastructure of society that would be needed to hold warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving, the Trump administration released a nearly 1,700-page report co-written by hundreds of scientists finding that climate change is already causing increasing damage to the United States. That was followed by another report detailing the growing gap between the commitments made at earlier U.N. conferences and what is needed to steer the planet off its calamitous path.\n\nCoupled with Wednesday\u2019s findings, that drumbeat of daunting news has cast a considerable pall over the international climate talks in Poland, which began this week and are scheduled to run through Dec. 14.\n\nNegotiators there face the difficult task of coming to terms with the gap between the promises they made in Paris in 2015 and what\u2019s needed to control dangerous levels of warming \u2014 a first step, it is hoped, toward more aggressive climate action beginning in 2020. Leaders at the conference also are trying to put in place a process for how countries measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions to the rest of the world in the years ahead.\n\nBut while most of the world remains firmly committed to the notion of tackling climate change, many countries are not on pace to meet their relatively modest Paris pledges. The Trump administration has continued to roll back environmental regulations and insist that it will exit the Paris agreement in 2020. Brazil, which has struggled to rein in deforestation, in the fall elected Jair Bolsonaro, a president-elect who has pledged to roll back protections for the Amazon.\n\nThe biggest emissions story in 2018, though, appears to be China, the world\u2019s largest emitting country, which grew its output of planet-warming gases by nearly a half-billion tons, researchers estimate. (The United States is the globe\u2019s second-largest emitter.)\n\nThe country\u2019s sudden, significant increase in carbon emissions could be linked to a wider slowdown in the economy, environmental analysts said.\n\n\u201cUnder pressure of the current economic downturn, some local governments might have loosened supervision on air pollution and carbon emissions,\u201d said Yang Fuqiang, an energy adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. environmental organization.\n\nChina\u2019s top planning agency said Wednesday that three areas \u2014 Liaoning in the northeast Rust Belt and the big coal-producing regions of Ningxia and Xinjiang in the northwest \u2014 had failed to meet their targets to curb energy consumption growth and improve efficiency last year.\n\nBut Yang said that these areas were not representative of the whole country and that China was generally on the right track. \u201cThere is still a long way ahead in terms of pollution control and emissions reduction, but we expect to see more ambitions in central government\u2019s plans and actions,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch changes \u2014 in all large-emitting nations \u2014 have to happen fast.\n\nScientists have said that annual carbon dioxide emissions need to plunge almost by half by 2030 if the world wants to hit the most stringent \u2014 and safest \u2014 climate change target. That would be either keeping the Earth\u2019s warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2014 when it is already at 1 degrees \u2014 or only briefly \u201covershooting\u201d that temperature.\n\nBut emissions are far too high to limit warming to such an extent. And instead of falling dramatically, they\u2019re still rising.\n\nWednesday\u2019s research makes clear the intimidating math behind the fundamental shift that scientists say is required. While some nations continue to grow their emissions and some are shrinking them, overall there are still more additions than subtractions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing declines in wealthy countries that outpace the increases in other parts of the world,\u201d said Rob Jackson, a researcher at Stanford University who contributed to the research as part of the Global Carbon Project.\n\nThe problem of cutting emissions is that it leads to difficult choices in the real world. A growing global economy inevitably stokes more energy demand. And different countries are growing their emissions \u2014 or failing to shrink them \u2014 for different reasons.\n\n\u201cIndia is providing electricity and energy to hundreds of millions of people who don\u2019t have it yet,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThat\u2019s very different than in China, where they are ramping up coal use again in part because their economic growth has been slowing. They\u2019re greenlighting coal-based projects that have been on hold.\u201d\n\nThe continuing growth in global emissions is happening, researchers noted, even though renewable energy sources are growing. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re still far too small as energy sources.\n\n\u201cSolar and wind are doing great; they\u2019re going quite well,\u201d said Glen Peters, director of the Center for International Climate Research in Oslo and another of the Global Carbon Project research\u2019s authors. \u201cBut in China and India, the solar and wind are just filling new demand. You could say if you didn\u2019t have solar or wind, emissions could be higher. But solar and wind are nowhere near big enough yet to replace fossil fuels.\u201d\n\n\n\nA worker unloads a bowl of charcoal onto a wire mesh filter at a coal wholesale market in Mumbai on Nov. 10. India is making a gradual shift away from fossil fuels to make its growth more sustainable and offer relief to its cities choked with air pollution. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe figures the researchers provided are an estimate based on available energy and cement industry data through the first nine months of the year, and projections based on economic trends and the amount of carbon tied to economic activity in different countries. The estimated growth could change a bit, Jackson said \u2014 it\u2019s possible the final number could be between an increase of 1.8 percent and 3.7 percent. But either way, there\u2019s little doubt that 2018 hit a record high for global emissions.\n\nIn the United States, emissions in 2018 are projected to have risen 2.5 percent, driven in part by a very warm summer that led to high air conditioning use and a very cold winter in the Northeast, but also by a continued use of oil driven by low gas prices and bigger cars. U.S. emissions had been on a downturn, as coal plants are being replaced by natural gas plants and renewable energy, but that momentum ground to a halt this year, at least temporarily. In Europe, cars also have been a major driver of slower-than-expected emissions reductions.\n\nAs for China, coal accounts for about 60 percent of China\u2019s total energy consumption, but the government hopes to bring it down to 10 percent by 2050.\n\nThanks to increased investment in green energy, China\u2019s carbon intensity, or the amount of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP, declined by 46 percent by 2017 from 2005 levels, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment reported earlier this week. It had expected it would take until 2020 to reach the targeted 40 to 45 percent reduction.\n\n\u201cWith these goals met, a very solid foundation has been laid for meeting the target of halting the increase of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and even accomplishing that sooner than planned,\u201d Xie Zhenhua, China\u2019s special representative for climate change affairs, told the state-owned news agency Xinhua ahead of the meeting in Poland.\n\nChina will remain steadfast and active in addressing climate change and implementing the Paris agreement, Xie said.\n\nBut officials and analysts alike point out that the United States is not doing its part to combat global warming. \u201cWe would also love to see the United States embrace its responsibilities by returning to the Paris climate deal,\u201d said Yang of the NRDC.\n\nDespite the overwhelming challenges, Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, still holds high hopes for the talks in Poland.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an optimist because of human nature,\u201d Espinosa said in an interview. She suspects the spate of ominous climate news might have prompted a tipping point at which societies begin demanding aggressive actions from their leaders to stave off the most disastrous effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cI think we have kind of reached the limit,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we are facing the limit, I think we need to come up with something more creative, more ambitious, stronger and bolder.\u201d\n\nLyric Li in Beijing contributed to this report."

  "text": "Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin are orchestrating an unprecedented power grab to weaken incoming Democratic Governor Tony Evers before he takes office. In an extraordinary move that some are calling a \u201clegislative coup,\u201d Republican legislators worked throughout Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning to pass a sweeping package of lame-duck bills to give power to the Republican-controlled Legislature before Republican Governor Scott Walker leaves office in January. The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate passed a measure to limit the power of the Democratic governor and attorney general-elect and restrict early voting periods. Earlier Wednesday morning, the Wisconsin Senate and Assembly passed a bill enacting a Medicaid work requirement and limiting the incoming governor\u2019s ability to change state laws requiring able-bodied adults without children to work in order to receive public benefits.

  "authors": [],
  "text": "Special counsel Robert Mueller Robert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE has told a federal judge that Michael Flynn should face no prison time, revealing that President Trump Donald John TrumpSaudi King 'absolutely rejects' Trump measure on Golan Heights Five things to watch as 2020 Dems release their tax returns Baldwin returns to SNL to summarize Mueller report: 'Daddy won' MORE\u2019s one-time national security adviser and campaign surrogate has provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d in the Russia investigation.\n\nMueller disclosed Flynn\u2019s extensive cooperation in a memo filed late Tuesday that, while heavily redacted in some areas, provides fresh details about the value and breadth of information Flynn has provided to prosecutors in the year since he agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe filing also raises new questions about the status and scope of an investigation that has stretched into its 18th month amid growing attacks from the president and his allies.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Mueller\u2019s new disclosure in Flynn\u2019s case.\n\nFlynn appears to have given Mueller valuable information\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know exactly what Flynn provided to Mueller, but the special counsel said Tuesday that Flynn provided valuable \u201cfirsthand\u201d information in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nLegal analysts say the \u201cfirsthand\u201d disclosure is a sign Flynn\u2019s testimony could be key to bringing charges against other individuals should Mueller uncover evidence of criminal wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThere are basically two kinds of witnesses. The firsthand witness is the guy who is in the room,\u201d said Elie Honig, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\u201c[Then] there are cooperators who just kind of have second-hand stuff.\u201d\n\nAccording to the memo, Flynn assisted the Russia investigation on a \u201crange of issues,\u201d including offering details on the \u201ccontent and context\u201d of interactions between unnamed members of the presidential transition team and the Russian government.\n\n\u201cHis early cooperation was particularly valuable because he was one of the few people with long-term and firsthand insight regarding events and issues under investigation by the [special counsel\u2019s office],\u201d the memo states.\n\nThe special counsel asked U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan for a more lenient sentence for Flynn, who faces up to six months in prison for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the former Russian ambassador to the U.S. This is another tell that Mueller received valuable information.\n\n\u201cGen. Flynn is involved, apparently, with significant aspects of that core charge to the special counsel\u2019s office,\u201d said Jack Sharman, a former special counsel to Congress for the Whitewater investigation. \u201cThat by itself makes him significant, and the special counsel\u2019s office is to some degree putting its money where its mouth is.\u201d\n\n\u2018Several ongoing investigations\u2019\n\nFlynn\u2019s assistance was not limited to the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nMueller revealed Tuesday that Flynn assisted with \u201cseveral ongoing investigations,\u201d sitting for 19 interviews with the special counsel\u2019s office and other Justice Department attorneys. The redacted document indicates that Flynn has helped with an ongoing criminal investigation and at least one other matter beyond the core Russia probe, though the details are heavily redacted.\n\nThe mere mention of the criminal probe suggests the existence of a case in which individuals could be charged in the future. The case could be entirely separate from the original Russia investigation, but more likely is related.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that Flynn was cooperating or is cooperating in multiple aspects of the investigation that seem to go to different areas and individuals,\u201d said Seth Waxman, a former federal prosecutor with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in D.C. \u201cLike all federal cooperators, they are required to cooperate in all matters, whether that relates to Trump, the Russians or anyone else, and it seems he\u2019s doing so.\u201d\n\nMore is likely to come\n\nThere\u2019s a lot the public memo doesn\u2019t include and that only the judge is seeing, which is meant to protect ongoing investigations.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mueller concealed details about \u201cseveral\u201d probes in which Flynn has cooperated, leading some analysts to predict that more shoes are going to drop.\n\n\u201cIt may be something we already know about, it may be something brand new and shocking,\u201d Honig said.\n\nGlenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor in D.C., said it also remains an \u201copen question\u201d whether Flynn will be a testifying witness at any upcoming trials. While Mueller\u2019s decision to move forward with Flynn\u2019s sentencing suggests his prosecutors are finished debriefing the former national security adviser, it does not preclude Mueller from calling him for future testimony.\n\nFlynn's cooperation is a warning sign for Trump\n\nLegal analysts say the substance and value of Flynn\u2019s cooperation will not be welcome news to the president or his team of lawyers.\n\nFlynn was a key confidant to Trump throughout the campaign, serving a brief stint as national security adviser before he was forced to resign in February 2017. His decision to cooperate turns a top Trump adviser into a Mueller witness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a warning sign when your national security adviser and a person who was a prime contact or intermediary between the campaign and the Russians has been deemed to give substantial assistance to federal law enforcement,\u201d said Waxman. \u201cIf I were the president, I would take great discomfort in that notion.\u201d\n\nStill, nothing definitive can be gleaned from the new filing about how Flynn\u2019s testimony might impact Trump. Indeed, Mueller\u2019s prosecutors have said nothing in public filings or court proceedings to indicate Trump is the focus of their investigation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly substantive, as shown by 19 interviews,\u201d observed Sharman. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can take from that or from the breadth of the redactions exactly what significance that holds for the president.\u201d\n\nNo signs of whether Mueller is close to wrapping up\n\nDespite press reports that Mueller is close to wrapping up, the new filing offers few clues about whether that\u2019s true.\n\nWhile Flynn\u2019s upcoming sentencing on Dec. 18 will represent a milestone, Mueller is scrutinizing longtime Trump ally Roger Stone Roger Jason StoneTrump: 'The collusion delusion is over' Fox's Tucker Carlson attacks CNN: 'It's a super PAC' Tucker Carlson: Flynn, Papadopoulos, Stone deserve pardons 'now' MORE and his allies and only recently secured a formal cooperation deal with Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nThe revelation that Flynn has assisted additional inquiries has led some to believe the investigation could extend well into 2019.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to infer that Mueller might not be as far along as we hoped,\u201d Kirschner said.\n\nStill, others say it\u2019s impossible to conclude from the latest memo where the Mueller probe stands. It is also possible that any offshoot probes referenced in the filing are being undertaken by other Justice Department officials and will continue even after Mueller issues his final report on the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cThe redactions can detail historical events that Mr. Flynn has cooperated on or they could focus on ongoing efforts and what we call proactive cooperation that is still taking place today,\u201d Waxman said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can get any certainty on where the Mueller investigation stands or whether it is close to concluding.\u201d"

  "text": "Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump\u2019s aides and advisers have tried to convince him of the importance of tackling the national debt.\n\nSources close to the president say he has repeatedly shrugged it off, implying that he doesn\u2019t have to worry about the money owed to America\u2019s creditors\u2014currently about $21 trillion\u2014because he won\u2019t be around to shoulder the blame when it becomes even more untenable.\n\nThe friction came to a head in early 2017 when senior officials offered Trump charts and graphics laying out the numbers and showing a \u201chockey stick\u201d spike in the national debt in the not-too-distant future. In response, Trump noted that the data suggested the debt would reach a critical mass only after his possible second term in office.\n\n\u201cYeah, but I won\u2019t be here,\u201d the president bluntly said, according to a source who was in the room when Trump made this comment during discussions on the debt.\n\nThe episode illustrates the extent of the president\u2019s ambivalence toward tackling an issue that has previously animated the Republican Party from the days of Ronald Reagan to the presidency of Barack Obama.\n\nBut for those who have worked with Trump, it was par for the course. Several people close to the president, both within and outside his administration, confirmed that the national debt has never bothered him in a truly meaningful way, despite his public lip service. \u201cI never once heard him talk about the debt,\u201d one former senior White House official attested.\n\nMarc Short, who until recently worked for Trump as his legislative affairs director, said he believed the president recognized \u201cthe threat that debt poses\u201d and he pointed to Trump\u2019s concern \u201cabout rising interest rates\u201d as evidence of his concern for the matter.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no doubt this administration and this Congress need to address spending because we have out-of-control entitlement programs,\u201d Short said, adding, \u201cit\u2019s fair to say that... the president would be skeptical of anyone who claims that they would know exactly when a [debt] crisis really comes home to roost.\u201d\n\nRecent reports have suggested that Trump is determined, at least rhetorically, to address the issue. Hogan Gidley, a spokesman for the president, noted that the president and his team have proposed policies to achieve some deficit reduction, \u201cincluding in his first budget that actually would\u2019ve balanced in 10 years, a historic, common-sense rescissions proposal.\u201d\n\nBut Gidley also passed the buck to the legislative branch. \u201cWhile the president has and will continue to do everything in his power to rein in Washington\u2019s out-of-control spending,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse and it\u2019s time for them to work with this president to reduce the debt.\u201d\n\nThose close to Trump say that one reason the issue of debt reduction has never been an animating one for him is because he is convinced that it can be solved through means other than tax hikes or sharp spending reductions.\n\nStephen Moore, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation and an economic adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, recalled making visual presentations to Trump in mid-2016 that showed him the severity of the debt problem. But Moore told The Daily Beast that he personally assured candidate Trump that it could be dealt with by focusing on economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat was why, when he was confronted with these nightmare scenarios on the debt, I think he rejected them, because if you grow the economy\u2026 you don\u2019t have a debt problem,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cI know a few times when people would bring up the enormous debt, he would say, \u2018We\u2019re gonna grow our way out of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMoore has since championed this approach to tackling the debt as a key part of \u201cTrumponomics,\u201d and has co-authored a book supporting it.\n\nAs Moore recalled, a belief that robust economic growth would solve all problems was the way Trump\u2014starting in 2016\u2014justified the cost of his ambitious proposals to slash taxes, pursue big infrastructure projects, and simply avoid massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Since then, the president has continued to show indifference over the national debt, to the consternation of more traditionally conservative associates.\n\nOne current senior Trump administration official vented that Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t really care\u201d about actually attacking the debt \u201ccrisis,\u201d and prefers simply \u201cjobs and growth, whatever that means.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, the Republican Party has gone along. Over the first two years of the Trump administration, congressional Republicans have slashed taxes dramatically while increasing defense and discretionary spending, all without giving much indication that they\u2019re going to take a stab at dramatically gutting certain popular entitlements.\n\nThe results have not been what Trump and Moore have promised; at least not yet. Economic growth increased over the past year\u2014including a robust 4.1 percent in the second quarter of 2018\u2014but the federal deficit has ballooned as well, in part because the government has taken in less revenue because of the tax cuts. Current forecasts are not too rosy about the future economy.\n\nRecently, both Trump and some Republican lawmakers have hinted at regret over their approach. Earlier this year, Trump conveyed his disappointment with signing a large spending bill, particularly after he saw typically friendly allies on Fox News tear into him for supporting legislation that they viewed as funding Democratic priorities, exacerbating the national debt, and ditching his pledge to build a gigantic border wall, according to a report at the time in Axios.\n\nSources close to the president tell The Daily Beast that Trump was genuinely taken aback by the severity of this mini-revolt from MAGA loyalists.\n\nHowever, right-leaning reformers shouldn\u2019t be holding their breath.\n\nThe Washington Post recently reported that Trump had instructed his Cabinet to devise plans to trim their budgets in an effort to reduce the federal deficit. But Trump also set strict limits on what sorts of programs could be cut\u2014and quickly proceeded to propose increased spending in other areas of the federal government.\n\n\u201cHe understands the messaging of it,\u201d the former senior White House official told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t a doctrinaire conservative who deeply cares about the national debt, especially not on his watch\u2026 It\u2019s not actually a top priority for him\u2026 He understands the political nature of the debt but it\u2019s clearly not, frankly, something he sees as crucial to his legacy.\u201d\n\nThe former Trump official adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to haunt him.\u201d"

  "text": "\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg listens to opening statements during a Senate committee hearing on April 10. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nA trove of emails and internal documents released by a British lawmaker on Wednesday illustrate how Facebook rose to dominance years ago by using people\u2019s data as a bargaining chip, undermining the social media giant\u2019s claim that changes to its business practices were motivated by a desire to protect people\u2019s privacy.\n\nThe more than 250 pages of documents, which a British parliamentary committee recently obtained as part of a wide-ranging investigation into Facebook, revolve around a decision Facebook made in 2014 and 2015 to cut off developers\u2019 access to posts, photos and other profile information from Facebook users. The internal communications, some of them from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, appear to show Facebook trading access to user data in exchange for advertising buys and other concessions, which would contradict Facebook\u2019s long-standing claim that it doesn\u2019t sell people\u2019s information.\n\n\u201cWe've never sold anyone's data,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a post Wednesday. He added that the emails released by Damian Collins, the chairman of the British parliamentary committee, \u201cwere only part of our discussions.\u201d\n\nThe records released by Collins are part of an ongoing federal court case in California brought by an app developer called Six4Three. Facebook said that the Six4Three documents were misleadingly crafted and do not represent the company\u2019s practices or policies.\n\nThe cutthroat tactics deployed by Facebook in its early years as a public company, and detailed in the newly-released documents, caught up with the social media giant this year. They are likely to fuel persistent claims that the company was cavalier with people\u2019s personal information and set off even more concern among the public and lawmakers around the world that Facebook\u2019s footprint is a risk to consumers and competitors alike.\n\nA series of emails from October 2012 reveal Zuckerberg\u2019s keen interest in figuring out how to extract revenue from Facebook\u2019s trove of user data -- and the app developers who relied on it. \u201cThere\u2019s a big question on where we get revenue from,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote to one of his executives.\n\n\u201cWithout limiting distribution or access to friends who use this app, I don\u2019t think we have any way to get developers to pay us at all besides offering payments and ad networks,\u201d he continued. Zuckerberg\u2019s private statements appear to contradict a stance he had long maintained publicly, that app developers' access was open and free.\n\nFacebook said the 2015 decision to cut off developers\u2019 access to people\u2019s information was motivated by privacy concerns. But it also caused dozens of businesses, including Six4Three, to shut down, and was a turning point in Facebook\u2019s relationship with the startup community in Silicon Valley.\n\nCollins\u2019 interest in the sealed and heavily-redacted documents springs from the British government\u2019s inquiry into Facebook\u2019s dealings with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which also benefited from the same access to user data. Facebook revealed earlier this year that Cambridge Analytica was able to obtain data on 87 million Facebook users.\n\nSince the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted in March, lawmakers have repeatedly questioned Facebook about its relationships with data partners, and the incident has spawned several investigations. In the U.S., the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the FTC have been investigating Facebook\u2019s handling of this data and its public representations about it.\n\nThe trove released by Collins \"highlights areas in which the company was knowingly deceptive,\" said Ashkan Soltani, a former top technologist at the FTC. \"It speaks to how both disingenuous the company is, and how anti-competitive some of their practices are.\u201d\n\nThe newly-released correspondence between Zuckerberg and his top brass between 2012 and 2015 -- though partial and collected by plaintiffs in a legal battle -- offer insights into how Facebook struggled to balance its need to make money off smartphones with the ambitions of developers who had come to rely on its rich trove of data about people\u2019s relationships and preferences.\n\nIn his post Wednesday, Zuckerberg said the internal conversations reflected the need to become \u201ceconomically sustainable\u201d as the company transitioned from desktop to a mobile app, and that the actions that the company took against against developers were a response to apps that were abusing people\u2019s privacy.\n\nBut privacy did not appear to figure heavily into the executives\u2019 discussions or into Zuckerberg\u2019s own emails. The emails were largely focused on competition and on how to leverage Facebook\u2019s extensive relationships with app developers, including Lyft, Airbnb, Nissan, Tinder, and Netflix. Executives also used a free app that Facebook had acquired, called Onavo Protect, to monitor how frequently consumers were logging into potentially competitive services, such as the live video-streaming app Vine.\n\nAs Vine was getting off the ground, a Facebook manager suggested that the company immediately cut off the potential competitors\u2019 access to data, according to the documents. \u201cYup, go for it,\u201d Zuckerberg replied.\n\nThe discussions also centered around a controversial practice known as whitelisting, in which Facebook gave select companies preferential access to data after the 2015 restrictions went into effect. Zuckerberg did not tell Congress about the company\u2019s whitelisting when he testified in April, but subsequent reports have exposed privileged relationships brokered by Facebook. The company has since conceded that over 100 apps received special privileges, in part to maintain their functionality as the transition to less data went into effect.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear that there was any user consent for this,\u201d Collins said of the whitelisting, in a statement. \u201cNor how Facebook decided which companies should be whitelisted or not.\u201d\n\nHe said major changes to Facebook's underlying policies and technology were driven by a desire to obtain \"increasing revenues from major app developers.\u201d\n\nJustin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumers Union, said the whitelisting amounts to a \u201cprima facie violation\u201d of a 2011 consent decree that Facebook brokered with the U.S. government over a previous privacy mishap. That agreement stipulated that Facebook could not give away people\u2019s data to developers without their permission, and it could carry fines for violations.\n\nThere\u2019s \"pretty clear documentation that they had a new setting to say, 'don't share my new data with whatever crap app my friends installed,' and then they went into agreement with a bunch of apps to get them that data,\u201d said Brookman, who previously served as a top tech aide at the agency.\n\nThe documents emerged out of a legal battle that has been quietly brewing in San Mateo County federal court in California between Six4Three and Facebook. They came into the possession of British authorities late last month when Six4Three developer Ted Kramer traveled to London with digital copies of thousands of the records. British authorities took custody of them, sidestepping the sealing order of the California court.\n\nKramer\u2019s company was the developer of Pikinis, an app that enabled people to find photos of Facebook users wearing bikinis. The app was built on the back of Facebook\u2019s data, which Six4Three and thousands of other developers accessed through a feed known as an application programming interface, or API.\n\nFor years, Facebook actively courted developers to build apps that encouraged people to spend more time on its desktop platform. After the rise of smartphones, Facebook eventually became large enough that it didn\u2019t need to rely on developers for engagement and ideas.\n\nIn 2014, Facebook announced it was restricting developers' access to the API, citing privacy concerns from users who complained that their data was being shared with outsiders without their knowledge. Many businesses, including Six4Three, shut down as a result.\n\nSix4Three alleges that privacy was not the reason Facebook shut down the API. The developer claims Facebook realized that it could use its data feed as leverage, to pressure businesses to buy advertising that would fuel the company\u2019s then-nascent mobile-ad business.\n\nThe emails also suggest the extent to which Facebook users and developers may have been kept in the dark about the company's data-collection practices. Company product managers discussed testing new features to collect call logs on Android smartphones in a way that might have made it harder for users to understand what they were giving away. They debated collecting call log data from users in ways that would bypass the privacy permissions people normally check off when signing up for an app.\n\nThey acknowledged the potential blowback from their decisions. \u201cThis is a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,\u201d the email read. They discussed how the idea, along with other changes, threatened to become \u201ca meme\u201d that journalists could turn into a story about how \u201cFacebook uses new Android update to pry into your private life in ever more terrifying ways.\u201d"

  "authors": [
    "William Mauldin"
  ],
  "text": "President Trump will pay his respects today to the late President George H.W. Bush, after last week also saying farewell to one of the legacies of his Republican predecessor\u2014the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nNafta was signed in Mr. Bush\u2019s last year in office and ratified under President Bill Clinton the following year. Mr. Trump is set to begin the process of withdrawing from Mr. Bush\u2019s original agreement, seeking to replace it with the Trump administration\u2019s reworked pact called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.\n\nIn doing so, the Trump administration is giving Congress a choice between ratifying Mr. Trump\u2019s new trade pact or returning to the pre-Nafta state of the early 1990s, including tariffs, and the end of the favorable trading status the U.S. has with its neighbors.\n\nFormer presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush in February 2005. Nafta was signed in Mr. Bush\u2019s last year in office and ratified under Mr. Clinton the following year. Photo: vinai dithajohn/epa-efe/rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe Nafta rewrite shows how far trade politics have shifted\u2014especially within the Republican Party\u2014in the 26 years since Mr. Bush joined Mexican and Canadian counterparts in signing the original treaty.\n\n\u201cFree trade is the way of the future,\u201d Mr. Bush announced in San Antonio at an initializing ceremony for Nafta in 1992.\n\n\u201cI am a Tariff Man,\u201d Mr. Trump said this week on Twitter. \u201cWhen people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power.\u201d\n\nMickey Kantor, the Democratic U.S. trade representative under former President Clinton, said the shift of views on Nafta is a \u201cstark and not-welcome contrast.\u201d Mr. Kantor spearheaded the congressional approval of Bush\u2019s Nafta after adding annexes on labor rights and environmental protections.\n\nThe U.S. and Canada reached a last-minute deal late on Sept. 30 to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. We look at what it is and what's changed. Photo: Getty Images.\n\n\u201cGeorge H.W. Bush believed that he should lead, believed in a world that would be global whether we liked it or not,\u201d Mr. Kantor said. \u201cIt seems like the Trump administration is retreating.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Lawrence Kudlow, sees it differently, saying on Monday that \u201cPresident Trump regards himself as a trade reformer,\u201d and that \u201che wants a world of zero tariffs and zero nontariff barriers and zero subsidies,\u201d so long as trading partners play fair.\n\nThe rhetoric aside, the reworking of the agreement shows a sharpening focus on labor and a growing reluctance to allow corporations to move jobs easily to foreign countries. Messrs. Kantor and Clinton, when seeking congressional approval for Mr. Bush\u2019s Nafta deal, added a section raising labor standards, a move designed to prevent American firms from cutting corners on worker rights when shifting any production to Mexico.\n\nAnd yet the concern that workers haven\u2019t gotten a fair shake from trade agreements has intensified in recent years, as seen in the popularity of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 skeptical attitude toward trade when he was seeking the Democratic nomination in 2016. Mr. Trump would win the presidency as a Republican on a similar trade platform.\n\nWhile the Trump administration further tightened labor standards when negotiating the agreement, Democrats in Congress say they want to include even more provisions to make sure the higher standards are enforceable\u2014and that Mexico follows through on promises to give more power to unions.\n\nIf the Trump administration and Democratic leaders strike a deal, it will ease the path to what is essentially a more stringent version of Mr. Bush\u2019s Nafta, with greater protections for workers, as well as some rules designed to deter companies from adding manufacturing capacity in Mexico.\n\nIf they don\u2019t come to an agreement, then Mr. Trump is set to proceed with his plan of withdrawing from Mr. Bush\u2019s Nafta, a path that will lead to legal challenges and efforts to rescue the 1992 deal.\n\nEither way, the legacy of both presidents hangs in the balance.\n\nWrite to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com"

  "text": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 A powerful earthquake that struck in the southern Pacific Ocean on Wednesday sent jitters around the region after authorities warned of possible tsunamis, but there were no initial reports of destructive waves or major damage.\n\nThe magnitude 7.5 quake hit in the afternoon near the French territory of New Caledonia at a shallow depth, where earthquakes are generally more damaging. It was felt as far away as Vanuatu, about 630 kilometers (390 miles) away\n\nTsunami sirens blared across New Caledonia minutes after the quake. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said tsunami waves of between 1 and 3 meters (3 and 10 feet) were possible along some coasts of New Caledonia and Vanuatu, before later lifting the warning.\n\nLocal authorities in New Caledonia ordered residents to evacuate coastal zones on the eastern edge of the archipelago, including the Loyalty Islands and the island of Ile des Pins. The evacuation order from the regional police said western islands didn\u2019t need to evacuate but should remain vigilant.\n\nWhile residents of the region are familiar with tsunami warnings and evacuations, the quake startled tourists, including communications consultant Eugenie Kerleau, 30, vacationing on the island of Lifou from her home in mainland France.\n\n\u201cIt was really surprising, I had a feeling of vertigo, the curtains were moving. We were immediately evacuated from the hotel to a calmer point at higher altitude,\u201d she told The Associated Press.\n\nNo damage was immediately reported, according to Vincent Lepley, crisis coordinator for the Red Cross in New Caledonia.\n\nJudith Rostain, a freelance journalist based in New Caledonia\u2019s capital, Noumea, said there was no damage to the city. She said the situation remained unclear on the east coast and scattered outer islands.\n\nIn Vanuatu, Dan McGarry said he heard only of three small wave surges hitting the southern island of Aneityum. McGarry, the media director at the Vanuatu Daily Post, said the waves traveled only a couple of meters (7 feet) beyond the normal tidal waves, and that everybody was fine on the island.\n\nMcGarry said he felt the quake where he is based in Vanuatu\u2019s capital, Port Vila, as a mild shaking.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of earthquakes every year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tsunami warning was what was different this time, though.\u201d\n\nThe warning center said there was no tsunami threat to Hawaii.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake struck about 168 kilometers (104 miles) east of Tadine in New Caledonia at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). At least six aftershocks also hit, ranging in magnitude from 5.6 to 6.6.\n\nThe populations of Vanuatu and New Caledonia are similar, with just over 280,000 people living in each archipelago.\n\nLast month, voters in New Caledonia elected to remain a territory of France rather than becoming independent. Both New Caledonia and Vanuatu sit on the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d the arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world\u2019s earthquakes and volcanic activity occur.\n\n___\n\nCharlotte Antoine in Paris and Moussa Moussa in Sydney contributed to this report."

It only fed the complaint by Democrats that Republican lawmakers have resisted bridging partisan divisions in the two years since Russia began its brazen attack on the American political system.\n\n\u201cNegotiations are about trust. Once that trust is breached, there is simply no way to reach an agreement,\u201d said Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the Republican committee. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a pledge to do what we planned to do already. And we\u2019re certainly not going to be a pawn in someone\u2019s publicity stunt.\u201d"

  "authors": [],
  "text": "DN! looks at the link between climate change and meat consumption on the heels of a series of damning reports that say if humans don\u2019t act now to halt climate change, the results will be catastrophic. A new study by the World Meteorological Organization shows the past four years have been the hottest on record. On Tuesday, the United Nations reported that carbon emissions reached record highs in 2017 and are on the rise for the first time in four years. Radical reductions are necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, the level that would prevent the worst effects of catastrophic climate change. Livestock for meat and dairy products worldwide is responsible for almost 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it the second largest source of emissions after the fossil fuels industry. DN! speaks with British author and journalist George Monbiot, who argues that the fate of the planet depends on the way we choose to eat."

  "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen appeared in court on Thursday morning and made a surprising guilty plea to a charge by the Special Counsel's team. According to Associated Press he, \"is pleading guilty to lying to Congress about work he did on a Trump real estate deal in Russia,\" and, \"admitted to making false statements in 2017 to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence about a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.\" Earlier this year Mr. Cohen had pled guilty to charges that involved bank fraud and election interference.\n\n\n\nThe news comes a day after the New York Times reported that former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort's lawyers had briefed the President's attorneys during the period that Manafort was being questioned. The breach of secrecy is likely the reason why Robert Mueller's team made a court filing on Monday saying Manafort had broken the terms of his plea agreement. There is speculation that Manafort's lawyers spoke to Trump's lawyers in hopes of a Presidential pardon.\n\n\n\nTrump has been increasingly jittery about the Special Counsel investigation, posting a barrage of incoherent and desperate-sounding tweets filled with lies and misinformation, indicating his fear over what may be revealed.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Kevin Gosztola, managing editor of Shadowproof.com.

  "text": "Fires burn more frequently and uncontrollably, ravaging the West\u2019s pines, firs and spruces, destroying lives and buildings.\n\nMultiplying insects feast: Colorado\u2019s forester last week said the state over two decades has lost a fifth of its forests to bugs, and a recent survey estimated one in 14 standing trees is dead.\n\nShrinking Rocky Mountain snowpack is forcing farmers out of business, jeopardizing skiing, and compelling utilities to consider super-costly new sources of water, including recycled waste.\n\nAnd rising heat waves hurt people \u2014 especially children, the elderly, low-income outdoor workers and anybody who can\u2019t afford air conditioning.\n\nThese impacts of global warming, intensifying across Colorado and the West with costs in the billions, have happened precisely as scientists have been predicting. The latest National Climate Assessment \u2014 released by the Trump administration on the day after Thanksgiving \u2014 now drives home this scientific consensus that Colorado and its western neighbors will face worsening, potentially ruinous environmental upheaval as average temperatures that increased 2 degrees over the past 30 years keep rising.\n\nWorld leaders at a United Nations-backed forum in Poland this week will rally nations to try to minimize ecological harm after 2050, and while American scientists will be there, the U.S. government isn\u2019t participating.\n\nNative Americans also predicted upheaval \u2014 including droughts, fires and floods. Ute Mountain Ute leaders watched as European settlers took Colorado mountain terrain and they prophesied that \u201cthe white man\u201d would cause environmental calamity, tribal elder Terry Knight said last week from his home in the Four Corners region.\n\n\u201cWhat you are putting in the air, what you are putting in the water, what you are putting in the ground \u2014 all this chemical contamination \u2014 it is causing an imbalance of nature, causing this drought and climate change,\u201d Knight said.\n\nHeading into 2019, tribal leaders, like local governments around the West, are scrambling to deal with the worsening impacts. For Utes, the most painful has been losing mountain springs used for sacred ceremonies due to decreasing snow and rain.\n\n\u201cPeople may have to consider changing their ways \u2014 how much water they use. They might have to think about how they\u2019re going to sacrifice some things for the long run,\u201d Knight said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the people. If they don\u2019t want to do this, they had better be ready to accept the hard times.\u201d\n\nYet Colorado continues to expedite the extraction of fossil fuels, which when burned worsen global warming, as the state clings to the economic benefits of jobs and tax revenue from the politically powerful oil and gas industry.\n\nThe 300 scientists who produced the National Climate Assessment, including several based along Colorado\u2019s Front Range, point to recent ruinous climate events as evidence that global warming is affecting the United States as never before and threatening to disrupt lives coast to coast. Those impacts are pretty much locked in until 2050 due to past emissions that raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to 410 parts per million. What happens after 2050 depends on how fast humans reduce air pollution from burning fossil fuels, clearing forests and other human activities that further load the atmosphere with heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\n\n\u201cThe message just gets louder and clearer as the years go by. We have got to deal with this problem,\u201d said Colorado State University climate scientist Brad Udall, who co-authored portions of the climate assessment, which is produced every four years as mandated by Congress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had event after event after event over the last 10 years with climate change written all over them. We have another 80 years ahead of us. And with the current projected air emissions, the future is bleak,\u201d Udall said. \u201c\u2026We need a sane and safe way to wean ourselves off fossil fuels over the next few decades, doing the least harm we can do to our economy but doing right by the environment. \u2026 We have to cease all greenhouse gas emissions as soon as practical.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cblinking red light\u201d of climate change\n\nColorado Gov.-elect Jared Polis on Thursday weighed in on the climate assessment, vowing aggressive state-level action to deal with global warming impacts and also to tackle causes.\n\n\u201cStates must lead the way, because the federal government has dropped the ball,\u201d Polis wrote in an emailed response to questions from The Denver Post. \u201cMy administration will be looking carefully at various options to not only deal with the potential short- and long-term impacts from climate change, but how to do our part to combat the root causes of global climate change through bold, proactive policies to transition to renewable energy.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a blinking red light, and we have to act now or our children will end up suffering the consequences of inaction.\u201d\n\nA five-term congressman, Polis last week was clearing out his office in Washington, D.C., and mulling possibilities for a state leadership team adept at cross-departmental dialogue in dealing with rising temperatures.\n\n\u201cClimate change can touch every facet of people\u2019s lives, and so there really isn\u2019t a part of government that isn\u2019t affected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s preparing for floods and fires, but it\u2019s also looking at how climate is affecting people\u2019s health, how it\u2019s affecting our economy now and is likely to affect it in the future. We will certainly be looking at how best to make sure we are taking a comprehensive approach to the issue and how our agencies can work together.\n\n\u201cOur ecology and many of our communities in the West are in already on a razor\u2019s edge. Water is extremely scarce, and an expected population influx, coupled with longer, hotter summers and shorter, drier winters would threaten the region\u2019s continued prosperity and quality of life.\u201d\n\nRaging wildfires and voracious beetles\n\nFor the West, bigger wildfires and a lengthening \u201cfire season\u201d have combined with population growth and building in burn zones to destroy more people and property, as seen in California\u2019s recent devastating wildfires and fierce burns in Colorado this summer. The record-low mountain snow in southern Colorado and higher temperatures accelerated a climate shift toward aridity that favors frequent ignition.\n\nThe cumulative forest area burned is increasing rapidly. And federal wildfire analysts calculated that the 24 million acres burned across the West between 1984 and 2015 was twice what would have burned had global warming caused by humans not happened.\n\nFires favored by climate change worsen the problem of more people building homes in forests and flammable former agricultural fields. Colorado state forester Mike Lester said in an interview that house-building and other urbanization in burn zones has left more than half of Colorado\u2019s population \u2014 2.9 million people \u2014 threatened by wildfire. That\u2019s up nearly 50 percent from 2 million in 2012. State task force recommendations to limit construction in what insurers designate as the \u201cwildland urban interface\u201d mostly have been ignored by state lawmakers and property developers.\n\nThe more people move into burn zones, the harder it becomes to restore forest health because safety pressures to suppress fire set up bigger fires in the future. Forests need fires to regenerate.\n\n\u201cWe need to let our forests evolve naturally,\u201d Lester said. But population growth leading to urbanization of forests means \u201cwe\u2019re always going to be suppressing fire.\u201d\n\nForests naturally function as \u201ca great carbon sink,\u201d Lester said. \u201cBut now they\u2019re a big carbon source. \u2026 We\u2019re going to have to suppress some fires. We\u2019re going to have to do some active management. We\u2019re going to have to do something with fire as a prescribed burn tool.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, recent surveys show spruce beetles infested another 202,000 acres of Colorado forest, pushing their total damage above 1.7 million acres. This follows the ravaging of 3.7 million acres of forest by mountain pine beetles. Rising temperatures help inspects proliferate in out-of-balance forests, especially as winters pass without extended sub-zero temperatures, Lester said.\n\n\u201cWe need to recognize the value of our Colorado forests, what they do for us. They provide water for 18 other states. They provide cleaner air, recreation, wildlife habitat. These are things a healthy forest does,\u201d he said. \u201cIf our forests are not healthy, they do less of those things. This is a huge part of our way of life and well-being.\u201d\n\nThreatened water flows and rising temperatures\n\nGlobal warming is disrupting water flows, too, complicating the water supply necessary to allow more population growth in Colorado and other parts of the arid West. Rocky Mountain snowpack dipped to record low levels this year. Climate scientists have documented lower flows in rivers, including the Colorado River that farmers and urban developers tap as the main source serving 40 million people across seven states. Looming shortages compelled state officials to prepare emergency plans for curbing use of water from the government-built reservoirs and irrigation systems that enabled settlement of the West.\n\nBeyond water conservation, some cities are pushing for construction of new and expanded reservoirs to try to store more water when rain falls.\n\nThe heat waves, with more days above 90 degrees throughout Colorado and the West \u2014 Denver alone now sees 50 to 70 days a year with 90-plus temperatures \u2014 drive more people to emergency rooms.\n\nHigher temperatures force lifestyle changes, keeping people and pet animals indoors. Climate scientists say the rising heat hits the elderly hardest, along with children and low-income people who cannot afford to run air-conditioning systems. Low-wage workers, including some on construction and public works crews, often are given no choice but to toil outside when temperatures top 100 degrees.\n\nDemand for artificially cooled air increasingly strains electricity grids, leading to power outages. And climate scientists say the conditions favorable for mosquitoes and ticks are spreading more sickness, including the Lyme disease that wreaks havoc on immune systems. The Zika virus is spreading northward.\n\nA need for adaptation and action\n\nDealing with impacts falls mostly \u2014 and unavoidably \u2014 to local governments. Some cities, including Denver, Fort Collins and mountain resorts, are joining together to lobby for help in adaptation and coordinated international climate action to reduce emissions.\n\n\u201cThe droughts, fires, threats to water supplies and heat waves \u2014 those things are all amplified and exacerbated by these increases in temperature,\u201d said Gregg Garfin, a University of Arizona climatologist who co-authored parts of the national assessment focused on Colorado and southwestern states.\n\n\u201cFossil fuel extraction is probably really good for the economy in the short term,\u201d Garfin said. \u201cIf you look at the long term, then we have to take into account the effects of heat-trapping gases warming up the lower atmosphere. It is important to see the connections.\u201d\n\nNative Americans around the West are leading efforts to adapt, managing forests to increase resilience and restoring water flows where possible, said CSU climate researcher Shannon McNeeley, a national assessment co-author who has worked with tribes.\n\nNatives cultures grasped how the natural environment, beyond economic potential, enabled survival of life in the West, McNeeley said.\n\n\u201cThere are lessons we can learn from tribes. There\u2019s more of an emphasis on viewing the natural world not as a commodity but as important relationships and interconnectedness \u2014 having value beyond just economic,\u201d she said. \u201cThe environment has value for our health and for our well-being, beyond just financial. What has gotten us into trouble is prioritizing economic values. We prioritize that to our detriment.\u201d"

  "title": "Amazon\u2019s move will gentrify neighborhoods. At what social cost?",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "When large companies move into an area, politicians often proclaim how the new business will create jobs, increase tax revenues, and thus lead to economic growth. This is one reason local governments offer tax incentives to businesses willing to move in.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmazon\u2019s decision to locate offices in Long Island City across the East River from Manhattan, and in Crystal City on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., follows this pattern. The New York location borders the largest low-income housing area in the United States, with mostly African-American and Hispanic residents whose median household income is well below the federal poverty level. These people, local politicians claim, will benefit from Amazon\u2019s move to the neighborhood. However, when large companies with an upscale and specialized workforce move into an area, the result is more often gentrification. As economic development takes place and prices of real estate go up, the poorer residents of the neighborhood are forced out and replaced by wealthier ones. Is such a market-driven approach that accepts displacement ethically justifiable? And how do we even measure its costs? Can gentrification ever be ethical? Although politicians don\u2019t typically frame gentrification as a question of ethics, in accepting the displacement of poor residents in favor of better-off residents they are, in effect, making an argument based on ideas of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism, developed as a modern theory of ethics by the 19th-century philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, seeks the greatest balance of happiness over suffering in society as a whole. Utilitarianism seeks the greatest net benefit in any situation. In economics, it is often expressed in monetary terms. A classic example is of a new dam that will generate electricity, irrigate crops and provide a new lake for recreation. But it might also displace people and flood land that is used for other purposes.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEconomists might calculate the dollar cost of the dam itself, the monetary value of the land lost, and the cost to relocate displaced people. They would weigh these monetary costs against the value of the electricity gained, the increased food production, and added income from recreation. What economists miss in these calculations are the social costs. For example, they do not count the lives disrupted through displacement, nor do they determine if the benefits of the dam are equally available to all. Gentrification, as an economic and social phenomenon, is not limited to cities in the United States. Gentrification has become a global issue. In cities as geographically dispersed as Amsterdam, Sydney, Berlin and Vancouver, gentrification has been linked to free-market economic policies. Put another way, when governments decide to let housing and property markets exist with little or no regulation, gentrification typically flourishes. When neighborhoods gentrify, politicians and policymakers often point to physical and economic improvements and the better quality of life for residents in an area after gentrification. For example in 1985, during a period of intense urban renewal in New York City, the Real Estate Board of New York took out advertisements in The New York Times to claim that \u201cneighborhoods and lives blossom\u201d under gentrification. Through the lens of utilitarianism, one could say that the population living in neighborhoods after gentrification experience greater happiness than before. The fallacy of this argument is, of course, that these \u201chappier\u201d populations are overwhelmingly not the same people as were there before gentrification. As a scholar who works on questions of ethics in the built environment, I have studied how we, as the concerned public, can better equip ourselves to see through such arguments.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEconomic development in an area leads to less poverty in that area, not because the personal economic situation of poor people who live there has improved, but because the poor people have quite simply been erased out of the picture. Erasing the working class Urban geographer Tom Slater points to a similar disappearing act within gentrification research. Researchers once focused on the experiences of those negatively affected by gentrification. For example, one study of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn found that gentrification commonly removed manufacturing from inner city areas, leading to blue-collar workers losing urban job opportunities. Another study found that gentrification was associated with increased social hardships for residents. Not only did their housing expenses rise, social networks disintegrated as neighbors were forced to move elsewhere. In an examination of seven New York neighborhoods, for example, the researchers found that half of the poor households who had remained in gentrifying areas were paying more than two-thirds of their income for rent. Where gentrification research once focused on evictions of low-income and working class residents, housing affordability problems, and torn social fabrics caused through changing neighborhoods, the talk has since turned to the experiences of the middle classes who are doing the gentrifying. Terms like \u201ccompetitive progress\u201d and \u201cregeneration, revitalization and renaissance\u201d of urban neighborhoods are commonly used to describe a process whereby physically distressed areas of a city have their buildings renovated and updated.\n\nadvertisement\n\nUrban planner and best-selling author Richard Florida also focuses on the gentrifiers. In his much discussed 2002 book, Florida maintains that cities with a large gay and \u201cbohemian\u201d population of artists and intellectuals tend to thrive economically. He calls this group of hip and affluent urbanites the \u201ccreative class,\u201d and states that they are responsible for a city\u2019s economic success. When Florida\u2019s book came out, city leaders throughout the United States quickly seized on his ideas to promote their own urban renewal projects. When researchers and urban leaders focus on the gentrifiers, the displaced poor and working class are doubly erased\u2013from the gentrifying areas they once called home, and with few exceptions, from the concerns of urban policymakers. The need to restore happiness Amazon\u2019s move to Washington and New York along with an influx of well-paid employees brings us back to the question of how we might apply the ethical concept of utilitarianism to understand the greatest balance of happiness over suffering for the greatest number of people. In my view, this number must include the poor and working class. In an area threatened by gentrification, the economic and social costs for displaced residents is typically high. To make ethical decisions, we must consider the people who suffer the consequences of rapidly rising costs in the area they call home as part of the ethical equation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlexandra Staub is associate professor of architecture, affiliate faculty, at the Rock Ethics Institute at Pennsylvania State University.

  "text": "Paris \u2014 Paris police said Sunday that 133 people had been injured and 412 had been arrested as protesters trashed the streets of the capital during France's worst urban riot in years.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was holding an emergency meeting on security later Sunday with his prime minister and interior minister. He has vowed that those responsible for the violence and the damages will pay for their actions.\n\nA protest against rising taxes and the high cost of living turned into a riot Saturday in the most popular tourist areas of the French capital. Activists wearing yellow jackets torched cars, smashed windows, looted stores, threw rocks at police and tagged the Arc de Triomphe with multi-colored graffiti. Police responded with tear gas and water cannon, closing down dozens of streets and Metro stations as they tried to contain the riot.\n\nPolice said 23 police officers were among the injured and 378 of the arrested have been put in police custody.\n\nBy Sunday morning, Paris city employees were cleaning up the graffiti on the Arc de Triomphe. One read: \"Yellow jackets will triumph\" \u2014 a reference to the fluorescent yellow vests that protesters are wearing to demand relief for France's beleaguered workers.\n\nSome of Paris' major avenues near the Arc de Triomphe and streets around the famed Champs-Elysees Avenue and the Tuileries garden were littered with piles of debris and burned cars. Graffiti was also sprayed on many storefronts and buildings.\n\nGovernment spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said Saturday's violence was due to those who hijacked the protest, people who came \"to loot, break and hit police forces.\"\n\nHe was questioned why thousands of French police couldn't prevent the damage, especially to the nation's Arc de Triomphe monument.\n\n\"Yesterday we made a choice ... to protect people before material goods,\" Griveaux told French broadcaster BFM TV.\n\nIt was the third straight weekend of clashes in Paris involving activists dressed in the yellow vests of a new protest movement and the worst urban violence since at least 2005. The scene in Paris contrasted sharply with protests elsewhere in France on Saturday that were mostly peaceful.\n\n\"It's difficult to reach the end of the month. People work and pay a lot of taxes and we are fed up,\" said Rabah Mendez, a protester who came to march peacefully in Paris.\n\nThe demonstrators say Macron's government does not care about the problems of ordinary people. The grassroots protests began Nov. 17 with motorists upset over a fuel tax hike, but now involve a broad range of demands related to France's high cost of living.\n\n\"(Violence) has nothing to do with the peaceful expression of a legitimate anger\" and \"no cause justifies\" attacks on police or pillaging stores and burning buildings, Macron said in Buenos Aires."

  "authors": [
    "Journalist",
    "Digital Consultant"
  ],
  "text": "Silicon Valley companies continue to pump out disruptive technology that's fueling regional and national economic growth. But according to a new report, they're also producing income inequality.\n\nA team of researchers at the Everett Program at UC Santa Cruz studied federal and regional income statistics and found that in Silicon Valley, wages are sliding backwards rather than following the rise in the cost of living.\n\nThe just-released report showed that wages for 90 percent of Silicon Valley workers (all levels of workers except for the top 10 percent)are lower now than they were 20 years ago, after adjusting for inflation. That's in stark contrast to the 74 percent increase in overall per capita economic output in the Valley from 2001 to 2017.\n\nMiddle-income workers -- those in the 50th and 60th percentiles -- were hit hardest. Their wages were up to 14 percent lower in 2017 than 1997. Workers performing duties that take higher levels of skill didn't see as much of a drop in most cases. The top 10 percent of earners actually saw wages climb.\n\nThe rich keep getting richer.\n\nBasically, it looks like business owners are keeping more of the profits from growth, at workers' expense. The report concludes the Valley economy is shifting away from middle and upper wage positions to less skilled, lower wage jobs. As a result, people feel chronically economically insecure in the Valley, and the jobs that are becoming more available do less to alleviate that insecurity.\n\nWhy is this happening? Researchers say it's rooted in today's business models:\n\nIncentives and relationships that have been created over time to form the business models underlying the information economy. Several fundamental characteristics of markets in which information and knowledge are key sources of business competitiveness themselves create inequality, volatility and insecurity.\n\nSo in other words, the system is rigged to make the rich richer. According to the report, companies that rely on networks to reach large numbers of customers (like Airbnb or Facebook) don't have to pay much to reach the people on their network, so they end up keeping more of the profit. However, the people on the network are what create the value. Not to mention many markets are prone to creating monopolies (Like Google in search or Uber in ridesharing).\n\nAdditionally global tech giants bring in enormous revenues, but resources are not available to local service industries which support the tech giants. The local businesses face highly competitive markets and can't raise prices for fear of losing customers.\n\nSilicon Valley is a canary in a coal mine.\n\nYou may think this is just San Francisco or Silicon Valley's problem. You'd be wrong. Research shows this is happening everywhere innovation is taking place - all over the country in fact. Silicon Valley is just a canary in a coal mine. As a longtime resident, I can see that the Bay Area is just facing these issues more intensely because there's a greater concentration of technology firms here.\n\nBrookings' Metro Analysis of 100 urban areas proves the point. It examined income inequality and found it's in every major city where entrepreneurship thrives. New York City, Los Angeles, Austin, Seattle and Raleigh are just some of the cities facing the issue. In some cases, those in the top five percent of the income spectrum were making more than 18 times what people in the bottom 20 percent made.\n\nFor example, Seattle, home of Amazon and Microsoft, has seen its share of income disparity, large rent increases, and increased homelessness. It's not too difficult to see that what happens in one technology hub, happens in the others.\n\nSo what can we do about this? In short, we need to spend less energy helping only a small percentage of the considerable talent that created this success, and work to help groups of people left behind.\n\nResearchers from the Everett Program study made several recommendations. They include raising the minimum wage by even more, stimulating middle-income job development through new policies and investment, and more sustainable hiring practices. The authors also say that big, monopolistic tech firms need to do more to help the ecosystem of companies on which they rely - such as suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers."

And in July, Trump\u2019s Department of Justice even announced the formation of a religious liberty task force.\n\nWell, if Trump and the GOP truly believe that religious liberty is not just for Christians, then here\u2019s a no-brainer for them. The Republicans in the House should unanimously support a recently proposed rule to ensure religious liberty for a soon-to-be-sworn-in Muslim member of Congress and push back against the anti-Muslim voices in their party when they attack this change\u2014which, if history is any guide, they will!\n\nCome January 3, 2019, Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar (D-MN) will be the first Muslim member of Congress ever to wear a hijab (head scarf). The problem is that a House rule enacted in 1837 bans any type of headwear, which would include Omar\u2019s headscarf.\n\nIn response, Democratic House leader and expected next speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has formally proposed to ditch this 181-year-old ban on headwear in order to \u201censure religious expression.\u201d As Pelosi explained to NBC News, \u201cAfter voters elected the most diverse Congress in history, clarifying the antiquated rule banning headwear will further show the remarkable progress we have made as a nation.\u201d\n\nThis rule, while on the books, doesn\u2019t seem to have been enforced. As AshLee Strong, the spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, explained in an email, \u201cUnder both Republican and Democratic Speakers, the House has never prohibited any kind of religious headwear.\u201d That\u2019s great to hear. But forgive me if I\u2019m not quite reassured.\n\n\u201c In Minnesota, Republican activists this year pushed a resolution to prevent Muslims from even being a part of the GOP. \u201d\n\nSo now, Pelosi and the Democrats want to take it one step further and go beyond ignoring a rule and instead affirmatively make it clear that they support religious freedom for all Americans. And Omar herself took to Twitter to celebrate the proposed change, writing, \u201cNo one puts a scarf on my head but me. It\u2019s my choice\u2014one protected by the first amendment.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cAnd this is not the last ban I\u2019m going to work to lift.\u201d Omar, a Somali refugee who would literally not be permitted to enter the United States today because of Trump\u2019s current Muslim ban, clearly has her sights set on changing that Trump policy.\n\nSo why would GOP House members not support embracing religious liberty for Muslims? I suppose they still might in this case\u2014we\u2019ll see how they react when the next Congress starts. But the fact is that Republicans have a recent track record of being outraged over Muslims receiving equal treatment in this country. To many of them, we don\u2019t deserve the same religious accommodations that Christians are afforded, and some don\u2019t believe we belong in American politics\u2014or even in America for that matter.\n\nFor example, several years ago the University of Michigan installed a number of foot-washing stations so that Muslims there could wash themselves before praying. (This washing ritual is called wudu and is intended to purify a person before prayer.)\n\nThe response by former GOP presidential candidate and Fox News staple Mike Huckabee summed up what we heard from others on the right as he vocally objected, saying, \u201cthe accommodation we\u2019re making to one religion at the expense of others is very un-American.\u201d\n\nIn Tennessee, GOP state legislators freaked out when they saw in their state capitol what they thought was a new sink installed to allow visiting Muslims to wash before prayers. These Bible Belt Republicans, though, were relived to find out the large sink was installed for washing mops, not Muslims.\n\nAnd this year we saw two examples of Republican elected officials trying to prevent religious freedom for non-Christians. In South Dakota, a GOP state senator publicly objected to interfaith dialogue among Muslims, Jews, and Christians who had come to the state capitol to meet with their elected official because in his view, \u201cInterfaith dialogue is a part of a war\u2026 of taking away the Christian fabric of our nation.\u201d\n\nAnd in Oklahoma, each session of the state legislature opens with a prayer by the \u201cchaplain of the day.\u201d Well a conservative Christian GOP state representative recently took over administering that program and changed the rules to so that only a Christian cleric would be eligible to deliver that opening invocation.\n\nSo much for religious liberty for non-Christians. And sadly, often when we hear the phrase religious liberty uttered by a conservative Republican, it\u2019s not just to deny it to other faiths, but worse, it\u2019s used to demonize or discriminate against the LGBT community.\n\nSo here\u2019s a chance for the GOP to champion religious liberty in the best of ways. Not only should every Republican in the House vote for this proposed change; they should speak out publicly in favor it and push back against the extreme voices in their party who no doubt will declare sharia law has taken over the Congress. Expect these extremists to say things like, \u201cNext, Muslims won\u2019t want bacon served in the congressional lunchroom!\u201d (Putting aside religion, turkey bacon is much better for you!)\n\nSadly, I doubt the GOP will do the right thing. Look what we are seeing now in Texas as Republicans are trying to remove a Muslim American from a leadership position in their own party because some there allege, without a shred of proof, that he wants to impose Islamic law.\n\nIn Minnesota, Omar\u2019s home state, Republican activists this year pushed a resolution to prevent Muslims from even being a part of the GOP, with two Republican elected officials claiming that Muslims are trying to \u201cinfiltrate\u201d their party. But none of this is surprising given that the leader of the GOP is Trump, the most anti-Muslim president our nation has ever seen.\n\nBut with that said, here\u2019s an opportunity for the GOP to evolve. Will they finally embrace an America for all faiths and push back against voices of intolerance within their own ranks? We will know soon enough."

  "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen appeared in court on Thursday morning and made a surprising guilty plea to a charge by the Special Counsel's team. According to Associated Press he, \"is pleading guilty to lying to Congress about work he did on a Trump real estate deal in Russia,\" and, \"admitted to making false statements in 2017 to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence about a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.\" Earlier this year Mr. Cohen had pled guilty to charges that involved bank fraud and election interference.\n\n\n\nThe news comes a day after the New York Times reported that former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort's lawyers had briefed the President's attorneys during the period that Manafort was being questioned. The breach of secrecy is likely the reason why Robert Mueller's team made a court filing on Monday saying Manafort had broken the terms of his plea agreement. There is speculation that Manafort's lawyers spoke to Trump's lawyers in hopes of a Presidential pardon.\n\n\n\nTrump has been increasingly jittery about the Special Counsel investigation, posting a barrage of incoherent and desperate-sounding tweets filled with lies and misinformation, indicating his fear over what may be revealed.\n\n\n\nGUEST: Kevin Gosztola, managing editor of Shadowproof.com.

A new study by the World Meteorological Organization shows the past four years have been the hottest on record. On Tuesday, the United Nations reported that carbon emissions reached record highs in 2017 and are on the rise for the first time in four years. Radical reductions are necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, the level that would prevent the worst effects of catastrophic climate change. Livestock for meat and dairy products worldwide is responsible for almost 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it the second largest source of emissions after the fossil fuels industry. DN! speaks with British author and journalist George Monbiot, who argues that the fate of the planet depends on the way we choose to eat."

  "text": "Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford, Jr., was a good guy, if you believe his mama.\n\n\u201cEmantic was that person who people went to when they needed someone to talk to,\u201d April Pipkins tells Rolling Stone on Monday, four days after her son, known as \u201cEJ,\u201d was shot to death by a police officer in Hoover, a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama. He was only 21-years-old. \u201cIt was just heartbreaking, because I\u2019ve lost my best friend also. I know that, if anything, he was trying to help people. That was his character. That\u2019s how I raised him.\u201d\n\nThat is why Pipkins believes the witnesses on the scene at the Riverchase Galleria who, according to family attorney Benjamin Crump, claim that Emantic was trying to help the situation on Thanksgiving night. \u201cSeveral people have said that he was responsible for saving their lives,\u201d he said to me. Shots had rung out at the mall, and an 18-year-old man was hit. So, too, was a 12-year-old girl whom the Hoover police department called an \u201cinnocent bystander.\u201d But Bradford, a recently discharged Army veteran who had a permit to carry a firearm in his open-carry state, was the only person who died that night.\n\nThe Hoover police department has had difficulty explaining why Bradford is dead. First, it was because he was supposedly the mall shooter (he wasn\u2019t). \u201cThank God we had our officers very close,\u201d Nick Derzis, the Hoover police chief, told AL.com. \u201cThey heard the gunfire, they engaged the subject, and they took out the threat.\u201d Then a day later, the department told us that he \u201clikely did not fire the rounds\u201d that struck the two victims. But wait! Bradford \u201cmay have been involved in some aspect\u201d of the crime, the police claimed in a since-deleted tweet. That seems likely why both the city of Hoover and the department said in a joint statement on Monday that \u201cthe initial shooter\u201d was still at large and that Bradford \u201cbrandished a gun during the seconds following the gunshots, which instantly heightened the sense of threat to approaching police officers responding to the chaotic scene.\u201d (Crump claims that the Hoover officer pulled the trigger without issuing any verbal warnings or commands; the department has yet to respond to Rolling Stone\u2019s request for further comment.)\n\nYet another Hoover statement on Monday clarified the \u201cbrandishing\u201d remark, specifying only that \u201cMr. Bradford held a gun in his hand.\u201d The Galleria prohibits guns, but Alabama is one of 45 states with some form of open-carry laws on the books. In 2013, Alabama\u2019s state legislature clarified that \u201cthe mere carrying of a visible pistol, holstered or secured, in a public place, in and of itself,\u201d did not constitute the crime of disorderly conduct.\n\nBut Bradford would have had his gun in his hand if he were trying to help, right? Using his legally licensed firearm to stop a shooter? Isn\u2019t that what the NRA and President Trump have told us to do?\n\nAfter the terrorist shooting at a Pittsburgh-area synagogue killed 11 people on October 27th \u2014 yes, that was just a month ago \u2014 Trump said, \u201cIf they had protection inside, the results would have been far better.\u201d It is a variation of the same argument that he made after the Valentine\u2019s Day massacre at a Parkland, Florida, high school, and before that, after the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church shooting that left 26 dead last year. It\u2019s the same theory that NRA boss Wayne LaPierre offered after the Sandy Hook school slaughter in 2012: \u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\u201d\n\nThis is their prescription for public safety: American streets and venues as a Second Amendment theme park, a Westworld come to life but with real blood and real consequences. It is not so much macho fantasy as it is an idea sold by a gun lobby seeking to enhance its income (which appears to be dwindling). Now, a president who only understands masculinity and power as violence and aggression is happy to endorse the notion that a shooting can only be ended by more shooting. That theory has many fatal flaws, but its central one is that the color of our skin appears to disqualify us for the role of a Good Guy With a Gun.\n\nBradford\u2019s death is hardly the only evidence of this. Two days after Bradford was killed, Jemel Roberson\u2019s family buried him.\n\nOutside of being black, Roberson fit the Good Guy with a Gun image to a T. The father of a nine-month-old with another baby on the way, the 26-year-old aspired to be one of the supposed Good Guys: a police officer. It was nothing-good-happens-after-o\u2019clock in the morning on November 11th, and Roberson was working as an armed security guard at Manny\u2019s Blue Room lounge in Robbins, just south of Chicago. He actually stopped a shooting himself \u2014 not by killing the perpetrator, but by detaining him. As Roberson kept his knee in the shooter\u2019s back, he was the hero of the night. Until a police officer from suburban Midlothian showed up and, according to bystanders, ended Roberson\u2019s life with virtually no warning.\n\nSimilar to what Hoover did with Bradford, Midlothian Chief Daniel Delany misidentified Roberson as \u201ca subject with a gun\u201d before recanting and calling him \u201ca brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny\u2019s Blue Room.\u201d Is that how it works? Do we only get to be the Good Guy With a Gun after we\u2019re dead?\n\nThe lack of ability to imagine black people as heroes may be one explanation for these shootings. That was one of the countless things that James Baldwin was right about. American fiction is a significant contributor to our ideas of heroism both on the page and onscreen, and as the author both wrote and said in 1965, \u201cIt comes as a great shock to see Gary Cooper killing off the Indians, and although you are rooting for Gary Cooper, that the Indians are you.\u201d Regardless of color, we all are trained from an early age not merely to synchronize whiteness and heroism, but are fed narratives that discourage us from forming any other conclusion. Barack Obama wasn\u2019t enough to change that, to say nothing of Lando Calrissian, Roger Murtaugh or Axel Foley. Not even T\u2019Challa from Black Panther or Chris from Get Out. A childhood of seeing men of color as cannon fodder for Clint Eastwood, John Wayne and other assorted Good White Guys With Guns has an effect on folks.\n\nThis is why we don\u2019t expect the NRA or the president to say a word about Bradford and Roberson, all but vindicated in their deaths. Nearly two years later, we are still waiting for them to adequately respond to the death of Philando Castile, the Minnesota school worker who even told the officer during the traffic stop that he was a Good Guy With a Gun and wasn\u2019t believed. We are most useful to them either as victims or as the victimizers. Never as the hero.\n\nA frontier-justice solution to crime will exacerbate this problem, producing disproportionately more black deaths. The late director George Romero was smart enough to encapsulate this in 1968, concluding his zombie classic Night of the Living Dead with the surviving black protagonist, Ben, gunned down by a white man dispatched to restore order. Ben was holding a rifle, to boot. (If you haven\u2019t seen it, consider if the ending of Get Out went sideways.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t about whether or not you like guns, whether you\u2019d like to stockpile them or melt them all down. This is about everyone being able to enjoy the full freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, and thus equal protection under the law. I don\u2019t point to Bradford and Roberson as cautionary tales in order to discourage black folks from arming themselves; violent white extremism on the Right has become the central terror threat to the United States, after all. The Black Panthers of the Sixties taught us this lesson, most notably in 1967 when their armed presence in California\u2019s capitol led to the passage of sweeping firearms control legislation that the NRA actually supported. Naturally, because while the gun lobby sells to everyone, it speaks primarily for white, conservative men. They skate by, never taking account for the urban gun violence that men like Donald Trump are all too eager to exploit.\n\nWhen I asked Pipkins why her late son EJ carried a gun, she said, \u201cProtection, pretty much. There is just so much going on. He had it for the reason why any other decent American would have one.\u201d Alas, were we actually Americans, entitled to all of the Constitution\u2019s freedoms, Bradford might still be alive. We can\u2019t be the Good Guys With Guns until we are no longer the Usual Suspects."

  "text": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Tuesday unsealed charges against eight individuals in an alleged widespread digital advertising fraud that reportedly used botnets to give the appearance of billions of humans looking at online ads.\n\nAleksandr Zhukov, Boris Timokhin, Mikhail Andreev, Denis Avdeev, Dmitry Novikov, Sergey Ovsyannikov, Aleksandr Isaev and Yevgeniy Timchenko were charged with crimes including wire fraud, money laundering, computer intrusion and aggravated identity theft, according to a department release.\n\nThe department also announced that a federal court unsealed seizure warrants allowing the FBI to take over 31 domains as well as seize data from 89 servers involved in the botnets, or networks of infected internet-connected devices that can be utilized by hackers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs alleged in court filings, the defendants in this case used sophisticated computer programming and infrastructure around the world to exploit the digital advertising industry through fraud,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard Donoghue said in a statement. \u201cThis case sends a powerful message that this Office, together with our law enforcement partners, will use all our available resources to target and dismantle these costly schemes and bring their perpetrators to justice, wherever they are.\u201d\n\nOvsyannikov, Zhukov and Timchenko have all been arrested in various countries and are awaiting extradition, while the remaining defendants are at large, according to the DOJ release.\n\nThe indictment claims that five of the defendants ran what they claimed was an ad network and committed the fraud with the assistance of another defendant in the case.\n\nThe allegedly fake ad network rented more than 1,900 computer servers and used them to create ads on fake websites, giving the appearance that humans were viewing ads on those spoofed domains and causing businesses to pay more than $7 million for the commercials.\n\nIn another scheme, three of the defendants allegedly began another fake advertising network that utilized a botnet to reach more than 1.7 million infected computers, download fake domains and then run ads on the spoofed webpages.\n\nThe scheme led to businesses paying the false ad network more than $29 million for the ad views, which were never actually seen by humans, according to the indictment.\n\nU.S. law enforcement and private companies collaborated to take down the botnets after the arrest of one of the defendants, according to the DOJ release.\n\nCybersecurity firm Symantec was one of the groups involved in dismantling the botnets. It said in a blog post Tuesday that a majority of the fake traffic to the false sites was executed through botnets run by two kinds of malware known as Miuref and Kovter."

  "text": "In this Nov. 15, 2018 photo provided by Ivan Pierre Aguirre, migrant teens are led in a line inside the Tornillo detention camp holding more than 2,300 migrant teens in Tornillo, Texas. The Trump administration announced in June 2018 that it would open the temporary shelter for up to 360 migrant children in this isolated corner of the Texas desert. Less than six months later, the facility has expanded into a detention camp holding thousands of teenagers - and it shows every sign of becoming more permanent. (Ivan Pierre Aguirre via AP)\n\nTORNILLO, Texas (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration has put the safety of thousands of teens at a migrant detention camp at risk by waiving FBI fingerprint checks for their caregivers and short-staffing mental health workers, according to an Associated Press investigation and a new federal watchdog report.\n\nNone of the 2,100 staffers at a tent city holding more than 2,300 teens in the remote Texas desert are going through rigorous FBI fingerprint background checks, according to a Health and Human Services inspector general memo published Tuesday.\n\n\u201cInstead, Tornillo is using checks conducted by a private contractor that has access to less comprehensive data, thereby heightening the risk that an individual with a criminal history could have direct access to children,\u201d the memo says.\n\nIn addition, the federal government is allowing the nonprofit running the facility \u2014 BCFS Health and Human Services \u2014 to sidestep mental health care requirements. Under federal policy, migrant youth shelters generally must have one mental health clinician for every 12 kids, but the federal agency\u2019s contract with BCFS allows it to staff Tornillo with just one clinician for every 100 children. That\u2019s not enough to provide adequate mental health care, the inspector general office said in the memo.\n\nTap to unmute\n\nBCFS acknowledged to the AP that it currently has one mental health clinician for every 50 children at Tornillo.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said Tuesday that overriding background checks is \u201cabsolutely appalling\u201d and called for the immediate shutdown of the shelter.\n\nThe Trump administration announced in June it would open a temporary shelter for up to 360 migrant children in this isolated corner of Texas. Less than six months later, the facility has expanded into a detention camp holding thousands of teenagers \u2014 and it shows every sign of becoming more permanent.\n\nBy Tuesday, 2,324 mostly Central American boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 17 were sleeping inside the highly guarded facility in rows of bunk beds in canvas tents, some of which once housed first responders to Hurricane Harvey. More than 1,300 teens have arrived since the end of October alone.\n\nRising from the cotton fields and dusty roads not far from the dark fence marking the U.S.-Mexico border, the camp has rows of beige tents and golf carts that ferry staffers carrying walkie-talkies. Teens with identical haircuts and government-issued shirts and pants can be seen walking single file, flanked by staff at the front and back.\n\nMore people are detained in Tornillo\u2019s tent city than in all but one of the nation\u2019s 204 federal prisons, yet construction continues.\n\nThe camp\u2019s population may grow even more if migrants in the caravans castigated by President Donald Trump enter the U.S. Federal officials have said they may send teens from the caravans to Tornillo, according to a nonprofit social service provider who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter.\n\nAn AP investigation has found that the camp\u2019s rapid growth has created serious problems, including costs that appear to be soaring more than 50 percent higher than the government has disclosed. What began as an emergency, 30-day shelter has transformed into a vast tent city that could cost taxpayers more than $430 million.\n\nFederal plans to close Tornillo by New Years\u2019 Eve will be nearly impossible to meet. There aren\u2019t 2,300 extra beds in other facilities and a contract obtained by AP shows the project could continue into 2020. Planned closures have already been extended three times since this summer.\n\nThe teens at Tornillo weren\u2019t separated from their families at the border this summer, but they\u2019re held by the government because federal immigration policies have resulted in the detention of a record 14,000 migrant children, filling shelter beds around the country to capacity. Almost all the teens at Tornillo came on their own hoping to join family members in the United States.\n\nSome children have been detained at Tornillo since the tent camp opened in June. As the population inside the tall wire fences swells, the young detainees\u2019 anguish has deepened.\n\n\u201cThe few times they let me call my mom I would tell her that one day I would be free, but really I felt like I would be there for the rest of my life,\u201d a 17-year-old from Honduras who was held at Tornillo earlier this year told AP. \u201cI feel so bad for the kids who are still there. What if they have to spend Christmas there? They need a hug, and nobody is allowed to hug there.\u201d\n\nAfter his family passed extensive background checks, the teen was recently released to them, but said he still has nightmares he\u2019s back inside. He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from immigration authorities.\n\nConfining and caring for so many children is a challenge. By day, minders walk the teens to their meals, showers and recreation. At night the area around the camp, that\u2019s grown from a few dozen to more than 150 tents, is secured and lit up by flood lights.\n\nThe nonprofit social service agency contracted to run Tornillo says it is proud of its work. It says it is operating the facility with the same precision and care used for shelters put up after natural disasters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to hide. This is an exceptionally run operation,\u201d said Krista Piferrer, a spokeswoman for BCFS Health and Human Services. \u201cThis isn\u2019t our first rodeo.\u201d\n\nShe said they have no guidance from the Trump administration regarding what will happen after Dec. 31.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Mark Weber, said no decisions have been made about whether Tornillo will close by year\u2019s end as scheduled.\n\n\u201cWhatever it is we decide to do, in the very near future, we\u2019ll do a public notice about that,\u201d he said.\n\nNO FINGERPRINTS\n\nIn June, as detention centers for migrant children overflowed, Scott Lloyd, director of HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement, signed a memo granting BCFS a waiver to staff up Tornillo without the required child abuse and neglect checks, which raise a red flag about any job candidate with a record of hurting a child. There were two reasons for the waiver, according to the inspector general: first, the agency was under pressure to open the detention camp quickly, and second, Lloyd\u2019s agency assumed Tornillo staff had already undergone FBI fingerprint checks. They had not.\n\nHelp-wanted postings quickly popped up, seeking case managers for $15 an hour, youth care workers for $11.27 per hour. And many signed up, eager to work the 12-hour shifts in the hot sun to bring the extra money home.\n\nTwo days after Lloyd waived the safety checks, BCFS opened the tent city. Lloyd, under fire for his handling of the migrant crisis, was transferred out of the refugee resettlement branch and to a different division of HHS last week. Weber did not immediately respond to questions as to why the department waived background checks, and referred inquiries to the inspector general.\n\nThree service providers who were brought on to work in the camp in recent months told AP they were not fingerprinted, including one who started work there just two weeks ago.\n\nFailing to properly check staffers\u2019 backgrounds \u201ccan lead to potential abuse and neglect of these kids,\u201d according to Dr. Colleen Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nSince the facility opened, BCFS has been checking job candidates\u2019 national and local criminal histories and doing multi-state sex offender registry checks, Piferrer said.\n\n\u201cThose are pretty comprehensive,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s no easy feat, but we know what right looks like.\u201d\n\nBCFS has filed more than 30 reports on \u201csignificant incidents\u201d at Tornillo since June, including some involving interactions between the children and staff, but none of a sexual nature, Piferrer said. Weber did not immediately respond to questions about the incidents Tuesday.\n\nFBI fingerprint background checks can be completed in a few minutes and reveal much more information about job candidates than checks that simply run a person\u2019s name against criminal history databases, said Jeffrey Harp, a retired FBI assistant special agent in charge.\n\n\u201cHow do you know the person is who they say they are unless you do a fingerprint check? They can\u2019t lie about their fingerprints, but they can lie about their name or take on someone else\u2019s identity who has a crystal clean record,\u201d Harp told AP. \u201cMore and more employers are finding out they have an employee who is problematic only after the fact, and that\u2019s because their employment screening isn\u2019t really comprehensive.\u201d\n\n\u2018NOBODY KNOWS\u2019\n\nMore than 50 years of research show institutionalizing young people is traumatizing, with harmful impacts on their psyche and life trajectories, prompting policymakers to seek alternatives to locking up children, said Naomi Smoot, executive director of the nonprofit Coalition for Juvenile Justice.\n\n\u201cHearing that more than 2,000 kids are in any kind of detention facility is alarming to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not where kids should be around the holidays, particular when they haven\u2019t broken the law.\u201d\n\nMost of the children locked inside Tornillo are never charged with a crime; crossing illegally into the U.S. is a civil offense. By law, migrant children traveling alone into the U.S. must be sent to a government shelter where they stay until they can be united with relatives or other sponsors while awaiting immigration court hearings. Migrant children\u2019s time in government custody has grown longer this year, in part due to the Trump administration\u2019s new requirements for deep background checks on sponsors who agree to take in young immigrants.\n\nTornillo currently has 3,800 beds for the teens, with 1,400 of those on reserve.\n\nAnnunciation House director Ruben Garcia, whose El Paso nonprofit works with recent immigrants, said Tornillo is far more secretive than other government shelters, where he and his staff are routinely allowed inside. At Tornillo workers must sign non-disclosure agreements and visitors are rarely allowed.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening inside? Nobody knows. They cannot speak about what they see,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this work for 20 years and we\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d\n\nBCFS says the shelter at Tornillo has actually had more media, elected officials, advocacy organizations, child welfare experts and attorneys tour the site than any other HHS facility. The nonprofit said confidentiality agreements are standard, to protect the privacy and rights of clients and those served.\n\n\u2018COUNTING THE DAYS\u2019\n\nIn June, as migrant child detention centers overflowed, HHS announced it was opening a rapidly built tent city at Tornillo, with the idea that most kids would only stay a few days. But within the week there was talk of making a detention camp 10 times as big.\n\nBecause the detention camp is on federal property \u2014 part of a large U.S. Customs and Border facility \u2014 it is not subject to state licensing requirements.\n\nBCFS, a San Antonio nonprofit, runs Tornillo as it operates evacuation centers for hurricanes: There\u2019s food, first aid, activities and bunk beds, but no normal-life activities for stressed-out teens, like formal school, therapy or unsupervised stretches.\n\nFederal officials have said repeatedly that only children without special needs were being sent to Tornillo. But facility administrators recently acknowledged that the Tornillo detainees included children with serious mental health issues who needed to be transferred out to facilities in El Paso, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion. The person spoke on a condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the discussions.\n\nThe inspector general said staffing ratios were \u201cdangerously low\u201d for a population that has experienced significant trauma.\n\n\u201cThe disproportionately high number of children to clinicians is especially worrisome in light of the continued increase in the number of children and length of stay at Tornillo,\u201d the memo said.\n\nBCFS said the current ratio of clinicians to children is 1 to 50, and that each child sees a mental health specialist every day.\n\n\u201cWhen a child is found to have a mental health need that cannot be best provided for at Tornillo, a request is made to HHS to transfer the child to a more appropriate facility,\u201d said Piferrer.\n\nDr. Ryan Matlow, a Stanford clinical psychologist whose work addresses the impact of early life stress, questions the facility\u2019s capacity to identify kids with special mental health needs given the large number of children and their tendency to suppress emotional distress in order to cope.\n\n\u201cThe kids are able to get by in there, but the more time they spend in these sorts of facilities, the greater the consequences, especially when it comes to their emotional and psychological well-being,\u201d said Matlow, who recently interviewed teens at Tornillo. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous and harmful system for kids to be caught in.\u201d\n\nNonprofit Hope Border Institute advocacy director Camilo Perez-Bustillo and Kristen Torres, who heads the child welfare and immigration division of the nonprofit group First Focus, said they were concerned when Tornillo officials told them they could staff one mental health clinician per 100 kids.\n\nPerez-Bustillo, who served as a Spanish-language interpreter at the camp earlier this month, said most of the two dozen children he met showed signs of depression and anxiety over when, or whether, they would be released. About two thirds are boys, and half of the teens are Guatemalan. There are no on-site interpreters for teens of indigenous origin who speak Spanish as a second language.\n\n\u201cThey are all counting the days they are inside the way prisoners do,\u201d Perez-Bustillo said. \u201cMany of the kids have the sense of being suspended, and anxiousness about how much longer they will be held there.\u201d\n\nDr. Elizabeth Carll, a teen and trauma specialist who heads the American Psychological Association\u2019s Refugee Mental Health resource network, said institutionalizing so many teens in a geographically remote place makes it harder to recruit qualified clinicians.\n\n\u201cYou have to find people who are licensed, who are experts in trauma, who speak Spanish and have worked with teens,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere would you find all these qualified professionals?\u201d\n\nMaking things worse, Carll said migrant youth are likely to have higher emotional needs after going through hardship, enduring the journey north and being held in detention. They would do better if placed with trained, bilingual foster families, she said.\n\nOne shy 16-year-old from Honduras held at Tornillo told an AP reporter as she awaited her immigration court hearing that she was worried that it was taking so long to reunite her with family in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of waiting because I\u2019ve been there three months,\u201d said the girl, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by staffers who were monitoring her and other Tornillo detainees. \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep the faith that I will be liberated soon.\u201d\n\n$1,200 PER NIGHT\n\nFor each night each child spends at Tornillo, taxpayers spend up to $1,200 to pay the direct care workers, cooks, cleaners, teachers and emergency services workers, according to information staff at two congressional offices said they were provided on a recent visit. That\u2019s well above the $775 officials have publicly disclosed, and close to five times more than a typical youth migrant shelter costs. The most expensive hotel room in El Paso is about $200 a night.\n\nBCFS did not dispute the cost, but said on average, actual costs are closer to $750 a day, which would bring current operations to more than $12 million a week.\n\nThe costs at Tornillo are so high because everything \u2014 water, sewage, food, staff and detainees \u2014 must be trucked in and out of the remote site. Every few hours, two teams fill up 2,000-gallon tanks of water from a hydrant outside the facility, then drive them back through the fences. Each day, 35,000 gallons of diesel are trucked in as well, to run massive generators that power air conditioners in the summer and heaters on winter nights.\n\nThe teens can play soccer during closely watched recreation periods. They are given yarn to pass the time making brightly colored bracelets and scarves. There aren\u2019t regular classes, but teens have textbooks and workbooks.\n\nPiferrer said BCFS was not charging the government for the tents, fire trucks and ambulance on site.\n\n\u201cEverything that is being provided has been directed by the federal government to be provided,\u201d she said.\n\nScant details about how those funds are spent motivated New York-based software developer Josh Rubin to set up residence in an RV just outside the gates, where he keeps a vigil on the vehicles going in and out. In recent weeks, he said, he has spotted new trends: construction trucks moving equipment in to build another tent, a vehicle carrying heaters, more buses with tinted windows taking children to immigration court.\n\nStaffers are transported to the camp from motels near the El Paso airport, where the tour buses take pains to park on side roads, far from view. On a recent evening outside the Hawthorn Suites hotel, Tornillo workers filed off to bed in the darkness, many talking of feeling sick or exhausted.\n\nTwice a day, the desolate stretch of highway outside Tornillo comes alive as more than a dozen tour buses pull up. Bells sound, lights flash. Workers walk in two by two, wearing khaki pants, neon jackets and backpacks, some wrapped in scarves to guard against the cool desert air.\n\nMany days, Rubin is there alone, holding up a sign saying \u201cFree Them\u201d at the tent city\u2019s entrance. Sometimes the train rumbles by, or cotton drifts in the wind. Black birds fly in geometric patterns in the sky above.\n\nProtests began at Tornillo almost as soon as it opened. State and federal elected officials joined local activists and Hollywood stars deriding the administration\u2019s immigration policies. But public attention turned elsewhere, and now demonstrations are rare.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, a group of about 60 activists including rabbis from Ann Arbor, Michigan, and students from a local Catholic girls\u2019 school assembled to pray for the teens\u2019 release and sang a throaty version of \u201cLet My People Go.\u201d\n\nAfter a Department of Homeland Security official blocked them, the group ventured through a fence onto a private dirt road behind the facility. A group of teen boys could be seen across marshland, and a hole in the wire fence had been visibly patched.\n\n\u201cYou are not alone!\u201d the activists cried out in Spanish to the youth being led between tents. Some of the teens waved back. One protester wiped away a tear as another banged on a plastic drum, calling out \u201cWe love you! We miss you!\u201d\n\nDalila Reynoso-Gonzalez, a program director for the Methodist immigration advocacy group Justice for our Neighbors of East Texas, said she was moved to demonstrate at Tornillo after helping an immigrant father reunite with his son held there. The boy told her stories of a stark and lonely place and spoke of isolation, fear, disorientation.\n\nHe still has a foil blanket issued to him when he first was taken into custody, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really heavy on my heart,\u201d said Reynoso-Gonzalez. \u201cHow did we get to this place, why do we have so many children out there?\u201d"

  "authors": [
    "David Dennis"
  ],
  "text": "Emantic \u201cEJ\u201d Fitzgerald Bradford, Jr. is a hero. Jemel Roberson is a hero.\n\nBradford Jr., an active duty serviceman, was gunned down by police while trying to save lives endangered by a gunman at an Alabama mall on Thanksgiving night. Roberson was gunned down by police while apprehending a man who fired shots into a Chicago nightclub. He was wearing a uniform with the words \u201cSECURITY\u201d emblazoned on the front.\n\nIn any scenario, two legally armed men being killed by cops while trying to save civilian lives would be a rallying cry for the NRA. But it isn\u2019t. And you know why: Bradford Jr. and Roberson are Black. And the rhetoric that galvanizes groups like the NRA doesn\u2019t apply to Black people.\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed the rhetorical gymnastics of the NRA then you know that its way to avoid responsibility for the disgusting amount of gun deaths in America is to suggest that the only way to stop a bad person with a gun is a good person with a gun; that fewer guns don\u2019t stop crime, more guns do. And guns in the hands of more civilians would accomplish what Bradford and Roberson achieved: stopping gun crimes as they are happening.\n\nIn theory, using that logic, the NRA should be outraged by the deaths of two legally armed men fulfilling their civic responsibilities as gun owners in accordance with NRA beliefs. But the NRA isn\u2019t really about gun rights for the sake of gun rights. The NRA is about gun rights as medicine for the disease of non-whiteness. The NRA doesn\u2019t want all people to have guns; the NRA wants white people to have guns to use against non-white people.\n\nThe only time the NRA invokes Blackness is to threaten Black activists or use \u201cgrieving black mothers\u201d as a means to misdirect legitimate criticisms of its policies.\n\nIn order to believe that Bradford Jr. and Roberson were good guys with guns, one has to believe that they are first good guys. But that goes against what the NRA stands for to believe that Black men and women can be good, Killer Mike video series aside. And the NRA hasn\u2019t shown a capacity to see Black people as anything but targets at the end of the guns they want to supply most of the country with. Otherwise, the NRA would have spoken up for Philando Castille a couple of years ago.\n\nJemel Roberson was the quintessential 'good guy with a gun' \u2014 but police officers shot and killed him for doing his job pic.twitter.com/x3sCSjzmBb \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) November 15, 2018\n\nThis all speaks to the larger issue: White supremacists are masterful in their racist rhetoric, and the language they use needs to be dismantled with prejudice. \u201cGood guy with a gun\u201d is as big a fallacy as statements like \u201cBlack on Black crime,\u201d \u201c#AllLivesMatter,\u201d \u201c#BlueLivesMatter\u201d and \u201cReverse Racism.\u201d On face value, they all sound like they make sense: Black people should stop killing one another, all lives do matter and a black person who says he hates white people has to be racist, right?\n\nBut just because a rhetorical argument is easily digestible doesn\u2019t make it right. Crime is about proximity. #AllLivesMatter is only used to counteract #BlackLivesMatter, and you can\u2019t be racist without the power to oppress. Still, if these tools of white supremacy keep getting repeated enough then they become widely accepted, even by the misguided respectability politicians amongst us.\n\nThe fact is, \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d is a myth. It\u2019s a myth perpetuated by groups like the NRA to appease a base that doesn\u2019t care about Black people. This has been the case since the NRA\u2019s inception and has persisted throughout its history. The people who shout about good guys with guns don\u2019t care about good black people with guns because they don\u2019t care about black people. The people who scream that NFL players should respect the troops don\u2019t care that Bradford Jr. was a serviceman. The people who scream #BlueLivesMatter don\u2019t care that Roberson was serving and protecting when he was murdered. These groups don\u2019t care about the disrespect their bodies were met with after they were killed. These groups don\u2019t care about the way their murders have been handled and covered up.\n\nEmantic \u201cEJ\u201d Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. and Jemel Roberson are heroes. But they won\u2019t be treated as such. They\u2019re just going to keep being treated like Black men in America. Even after their deaths.\n\nDavid Dennis, Jr. is a writer and adjunct professor of Journalism at Morehouse College.

Wisconsin is the country's second largest producer of milk.\n\nDepressed prices on farm goods such as corn, dairy and soybeans are also likely leading to a spike in Chapter 12 filings, according to the report. China has also largely closed its market to U.S. soybeans amid the fight over trade.\n\nChapter 12 allows repayment of debts over as many as five years.

  "text": "Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know? Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nPresident Trump has spent the past few weeks grandstanding over a crisis that seems to exist only in the heads of him and his allies. He repeatedly cast the arrival of Central American asylum seekers at the American border as an almost apocalyptic invasion of terrorists, criminals and other malefactors. (Reporters traveling among the \u201ccaravan\u201d of migrants found mostly families fleeing gang violence and poverty.) In an ostentatious election stunt, he dispatched active-duty troops to a dusty corner of Texas to unfurl miles of concertina wire for the cameras. (The Pentagon wound down the operation within days of the polls closing.)\n\nOn Monday, Trump warned that he would even permanently close a crucial California border crossing if he doesn\u2019t get federal funding for his still-nonexistent border wall, which most security experts believe would make little difference. But as the president fulminated over immigration and border security \u2014 red-meat subjects for his base \u2014 it\u2019s worth considering what he wasn\u2019t talking about.\n\nOn Friday, a U.S. government report acknowledged that climate change is real \u2014 and is doing damage to both the country and the world. The White House apparently hoped to bury the report by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving rather than next month. When that didn\u2019t work, Trump used a cold spell over the weekend to claim yet again that global warming is a hoax and later explicitly said he didn\u2019t believe his own administration\u2019s findings.\n\nOn Sunday, a dangerous military escalation flared between Russia and Ukraine, prompting alarmist headlines about World War III. Trump tweeted nothing about it, choosing instead to once more attack his nation\u2019s traditional allies in Europe, grousing over their supposed unwillingness to \u201cpay their fair share for Military Protection.\u201d In reality, a growing chorus of European leaders is calling for the continent to beef up its defense in the face of Moscow\u2019s menace \u2014 and Washington\u2019s unpredictability.\n\nEurope has to pay their fair share for Military Protection. The European Union, for many years, has taken advantage of us on Trade, and then they don\u2019t live up to their Military commitment through NATO. Things must change fast! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 25, 2018\n\nOn Monday, the heads of five major international aid groups urged the United States to halt its military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Thanks to years of conflict and an intractable Saudi blockade, 14 million Yemenis are on the brink of famine. \u201cWe have no means left to avert a catastrophe in Yemen,\u201d the leaders warned in a joint statement. \u201cEvery humanitarian effort can no longer prevent mass starvation if the war is not brought to an end immediately and urgent efforts undertaken to ensure food, fuel, and other vital supplies reach those in greatest need.\u201d\n\nAll three are urgent international issues, all ones in which the United States can play an important role. But Trump, as ever, is uninterested in statecraft. Confronted with record low approval ratings and a vast thicket of controversies, he has chosen to circle the wagons and continue ginning up the same grievance and nationalist rancor that brought him to power. But for a president convinced that he\u2019s putting America first, his blind spots may ultimately cause the country more harm than anything else.\n\nOn climate change, Trump has not merely surrendered the field to other governments but ignored the existence of the battle. Experts fear that his administration\u2019s actual climate policies \u2014 promoting coal, rolling back regulations and weakening rules such as emissions standards \u2014 are only going to make things worse.\n\nTrump\u2019s reluctance to rebuke Russian President Vladimir Putin or condemn his annexation of Crimea, critics argue, has encouraged an adventurous Kremlin to test the waters of expansion \u2014 all too literally in the case of this weekend\u2019s clash with Ukrainian warships in the Sea of Azov. His deference to Putin at a summit in Helsinki this year baffled many analysts, who contrast Trump\u2019s acquiescence with the tougher stances of senior foreign policy officials in the administration.\n\nOn Yemen, Trump has said precious little about the world\u2019s most dire humanitarian crisis. Instead, he has sought to defend one of the war\u2019s leading belligerents, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, from international censure. In a widely condemned statement issued last week by Trump \u2014 entitled \u201cStanding with Saudi Arabia\u201d \u2014 Yemen was only acknowledged as a proxy zone for Saudi and Iranian conflict. There was no mention of the human catastrophe unfolding there. Trump also highlighted Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil output and American arms purchases as reasons to not to punish the reckless prince for his alleged role in the assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nNone of this can justify the horrors of the war, nor the White House\u2019s inaction as mass starvation looms. For Trump, it\u2019s also bad politics: A growing faction in Congress wants to rein in the conflict; a new poll commissioned by the International Rescue Committee found that a majority of both U.S. liberals and conservatives opposed continuing arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.\n\nThe war in Yemen is driving the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, supported by arms from the U.S. Meanwhile, our poll shows that, of those expressing an opinion, Democrats & Republicans are united in their desire to end U.S. support to the war: https://t.co/wdNktQfxMh \u2014 IRC Intl Rescue Comm (@theIRC) November 26, 2018\n\nMeanwhile, the migrant caravan that scares and angers Trump\u2019s is the product of a real crisis, but not one that he will acknowledge. In a column for The Washington Post, former U.S. secretary of state George Shultz and former Mexican treasury secretary Pedro Aspe outlined measures Washington could pursue to help stabilize the Central American countries that are so dangerous for their own citizens.\n\n\u201cInstead of blaming the migrants who are fleeing violence and corruption in Central America, we should recognize why they are leaving and do something about it,\u201d Shultz and Aspe wrote. \u201cIf we succeed in improving economic conditions and reducing drug-related violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, then we can expect that the citizens of those countries will choose to stay home.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

Thompson\u2019s new investigation, \u201cDocumenting Hate: New American Nazis,\u201d which premieres Tuesday evening on PBS. The documentary reveals the deep ties between the military and white supremacy, as Thompson examines the Pittsburgh shooting and the rise of violent hate groups such as Atomwaffen. Thompson interviews historian Kathleen Belew, who says there has always been a correlation in the U.S. between the aftermath of war and the rise of white supremacist violence. \u201cIf you look for instance at the surges in Ku Klux Klan membership, they align more consistently with the return of veterans from combat and the aftermath of war than they do with anti-immigration, populism, economic hardship or any of the other factors that historians have typically used to explain them,\u201d she notes.

Bush declared a \u201cwar on terror\u201d in the wake of 9/11, according to a major new report from Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project.

Costs of War reports that more than 480,000 people have died from violence in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan\u2014including soldiers, militants, police, contractors, journalists, humanitarian workers and civilians. Several times as many people have died indirectly because of water loss, sewage and other infrastructural problems, and war-related disease. The wars have uprooted 21 million Afghan, Iraqi, Pakistani and Syrian people who are now refugees of war or internally displaced. The cost of the global so-called war on terror will soon surpass $6 trillion. We speak with Neta Crawford, director of the Costs of War Project.

  "text": "Prosecutors in Germany reportedly charged a 95-year-old alleged former guard at a Nazi death camp with more than 36,000 counts of accessory to murder.\n\nCBS News reports that Hans Werner H., whose last name was not publicly released by police, was charged Friday and accused of serving as a guard at the Mauthausen concentration camp in northern Austria from 1944-1945.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore than 95,000 people, including 14,000 Jews, are believed to have been executed at the Mauthausen camp alone, some of the millions who died during the years of the Holocaust in German-occupied Europe. The 95-year-old suspect was not charged with any specific killings related to the camp's operation.\n\n\"With his service as a guard he aided or at least made easier the killing of many thousands of inmates,\" Berlin prosecutor Martin Steltner told CBS News.\n\nHans Werner was accused in the court filings of having \"been aware that a large number of people were killed ... and that the victims could have only been killed with such regularity if they were being guarded by people such as himself.\"\n\nRoughly the equivalent of a corporal during the war according to CBS, the suspect is alleged to have served as a guard both inside and outside the camp, as well as having run prisoner details at a nearby quarry.\n\nHis indictment in Germany comes several months after the U.S. deported Jakiw Palij, a 95-year-old man who was believed to be the last suspect of Nazi war crimes living in the U.S.\n\n\"To protect the promise of freedom for Holocaust survivors and their families, President Trump prioritized the removal of Palij,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at the time."

Polish national prosecutors said Sunday, Nov. 25, 2018 that they are canceling a criminal investigation into a reporter for a U.S.-owned broadcaster on suspicions of propagating fascism for having gone undercover to film neo-Nazis. TVN, owned by Discovery, broadcast undercover footage in January that showed members of a Polish neo-Nazi group celebrating Adolf Hitler\u2019s birthday in a forest in 2017. (AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski, file)\n\nWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Polish national prosecutors said Sunday that they are dropping a criminal investigation into a reporter for a U.S.-owned broadcaster on suspicions of propagating fascism for having gone undercover to film neo-Nazis.\n\nTVN, owned by Discovery, broadcast undercover footage in January that showed members of a Polish neo-Nazi group celebrating Adolf Hitler\u2019s birthday in a forest in 2017.\n\nThe private broadcaster reported that agents with Poland\u2019s Internal Security Agency on Friday evening visited the home of the cameraman who had gone undercover, Piotr Wacowski, and gave him the summons to appear in the investigation.\n\nTVN said on Saturday that it considered the state action \u201can attempt to intimidate journalists,\u201d and other commentators also criticized the move as an attack on media freedom.\n\nOn Sunday, national prosecutors issued a statement saying that it was \u201cpremature to prosecute the TVN operator\u201d and that it was moving the investigation from the local prosecutor\u2019s office in Gliwice to another city, Katowice.\n\nThe move against Wacowski comes amid rising concerns about the state of media freedom in Poland, where the populist ruling party has turned tax-funded public media into a propaganda tool and is looking for a way to limit foreign ownership of media companies. TVN has been critical of the government and is seen as particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe ruling party, Law and Justice, has faced international condemnation for a string of moves seen as un-democratic \u2014 from a Holocaust speech law passed this year, which was seen as an attack on freedom of speech and academic inquiry, to attempts to take control of the courts.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Georgette Mosbacher warned Polish authorities last week that any attempt to restrict media freedom would harm the U.S.-Polish relationship.\n\nTVN was bought for $2 billion by the U.S. company Scripps Networks Interactive, making it the largest U.S. investment ever in Poland. Scripps has since been bought by Discovery, Inc., which is based in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nLast year, Poland\u2019s media regulator slapped TVN with a fine of nearly 1.5 million zlotys ($395,000 at today\u2019s exchange rate) for what it alleged to be biased coverage of anti-government protests, a move some saw as an attack on media freedom. The regulator called it a \u201cwarning\u201d to commercial TV stations, though in the end the fine was rescinded.\n\nThe party has also been making conciliatory moves toward extremist right-wing groups. On the Nov. 11 Independence Day holiday, top officials marched in Warsaw with far-right groups. Government officials have also publicly attacked independent monitors of xenophobia who have noted a rise of hate speech over the past year."

By his death he assured to the children of his beloved land the supremacy of that ideal.\"\n\nPetit acknowledged that the writing on the monument makes clear that the obelisk supports white supremacy, but said he does not think it can be taken down due to possible protections under South Carolina's Heritage Act. The law prevents certain historical monuments on public land from being taken down.\n\n\"I've had nobody dispute it to me,\" he said. \"And we just need to take positive action to remedy that situation, in my opinion.\"\n\nThe city is waiting for state attorney general to clarify that rule, Pettit told CNN, but he said he hopes to move ahead with the recommendations from his report.\n\nPettit devised the report beginning with a committee of six people \u2014 half black and half white \u2014 to investigate the monument's history. Pettit then determined that the best way to amend the monument is to recognize the seven black men killed in the riot.\n\nThe report also recommended erecting sculptures or plaques to provide context about the massacre and Jim Crow era."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "By TIM SULLIVAN, Associated Press\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Indian authorities were struggling Thursday to figure out how to recover the body of an American who was killed after wading ashore on an island cut off from the modern world.\n\nJohn Allen Chau was killed last week by North Sentinel islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach, police say.\n\nBut even officials don\u2019t travel to North Sentinel, where people live as their ancestors did thousands of years ago, and where outsiders are seen with suspicion and attacked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult proposition,\u201d said Dependera Pathak, director-general of police on India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where North Sentinel is located. \u201cWe have to see what is possible, taking utmost care of the sensitivity of the group and the legal requirements.\u201d\n\nPolice are consulting anthropologists, tribal welfare experts and scholars to figure out a way to recover the body, he said.\n\nWhile visits to the island are heavily restricted, Chau paid fishermen last week to take him near North Sentinel, using a kayak to paddle to shore and bringing gifts including a football and fish.\n\nIt was \u201ca foolish adventure,\u201d said P.C. Joshi, an anthropology professor at Delhi University who has studied the islands. \u201cHe invited that aggression.\u201d\n\nJoshi noted that the visit not only risked Chau\u2019s life, but also the lives of islanders who have little resistance to many diseases.\n\n\u201cThey are not immune to anything. A simple thing like flu can kill them,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his first day Chau interacted with some tribesmen - who survive by hunting, fishing and collecting wild plants - until they became angry and shot an arrow at him. The 26-year-old self-styled adventurer and Christian missionary then swam back to the fishermen\u2019s boat waiting at a safe distance.\n\nThat night, he wrote about his visit and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to North Sentinel the next day, Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn\u2019t known, but on the morning of the following day, the fishermen watched from the boat as tribesmen dragged Chau\u2019s body along the beach and buried his remains.\n\nPathak said seven people have been arrested for helping Chau, including five fishermen, a friend of Chau\u2019s and a local tourist guide.\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can\u2019t be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak said.\n\nHe also said the police were examining whether Chau had tried earlier to visit the isolated island.\n\nPathak said Chau and his accomplices planned well for last week\u2019s visit by \u201ccamouflaging the visit as fishing.\u201d\n\nAlso, Chau appeared to be full of confidence as he wrote in his notes, \u201cGod sheltered him from coastguard and Navy,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an Instagram post, his family said it was mourning him as a \u201cbeloved son, brother, uncle and best friend to us.\u201d The family also said it forgave his killers and called for the release of those who assisted him in his quest to reach the island.\n\n\u201cHe ventured out on his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,\u201d the family said.\n\nAuthorities say Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed on another island while he prepared to travel to North Sentinel. It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman islands in 2015 and 2016.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the island chain, where they broke the news to Chau\u2019s friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nPolice surveyed the island by air Tuesday, and a team of police and forest department officials used a coast guard boat to travel there Wednesday. Another trip was planned Thursday.\n\nIndia has a hands-off approach to the island\u2019s people. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore, but Indian media reports say officials did not investigate or prosecute anyone in the deaths.\n\nIndia recently changed some of its rules on visiting isolated regions in the Andamans. While special permits are required, scholars say visits are now theoretically allowed in some parts of the Andamans where they used to be entirely forbidden, including North Sentinel. Chau had no permit, police said.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Christianity with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on tours of Israel to affirm their Christian faith. Chau went through that program in 2015.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t go there for just adventure. I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them,\u201d Staver said.\n\nStaver said Chau\u2019s last notes to his family on Nov. 16 told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School. Phone messages left with relatives were not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\n___"

  "text": "SHAKER HEIGHTS, Ohio \u2014 Former Cuyahoga Common Pleas Judge Lance Mason, who spent nine months in prison for beating his then-wife in front of their children, is accused of fatally stabbing the woman Saturday morning at his Shaker Heights home, according to three sources.\n\nMason was arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the death of his estranged wife, Aisha Fraser Mason, at his home on Chagrin Boulevard near Normandy Road, the sources said.\n\nThe house where the stabbing happened is near where police reported that a Shaker Heights police officer was hit by a car fleeing a domestic violence incident. The officer, who was in his cruiser at the time of the crash, was taken to the hospital and his condition was unknown.\n\nAgents with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation are at the scene assisting Shaker Heights police.\n\nShaker Heights police did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment until more than seven hours after the slaying, when the department issued a release stating only that Fraser Mason had been killed and that her estranged husband had been arrested.\n\nThe refusal by the department to release details of the case in a timely manner continues the pattern of four years ago, when the suburb failed for more than 36 hours to provide its resident with an account of Mason\u2019s attack on his wife. More than 24 hours after the attack, then Mayor Earl Leiken refused even to to confirm that Mason was sitting in the Shaker Heights Jail.\n\nAfter Mason\u2019s release from prison, he was hired by Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson\u2019s administration as a minority business development director. The city said in a statement later in the day Saturday that Jackson fired Mason from his $45,000-per-year job because of his arrest.\n\n\"I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Ms. Aisha Fraser, especially to her children,\u201d Jackson said in a statement.\n\nLizette Jordan, who identified herself as a longtime friend of the Masons, spoke well of both Mason and Fraser Mason. She said she wasn\u2019t aware of any issues between the two after the 2014 domestic violence incident.\n\n\u201cThe only issues they ever had is when they argued about the girls,\u201d Jordan said, referring to their two children. \u201cHe really loved those girls though.\u201d\n\nMason in August 2014 punched his then-wife 20 times and slammed her head against the dashboard of his car five times, breaking her orbital bone.\n\nThe couple\u2019s children were in the back of the car when the attack occurred. Mason, who previously served in the state legislature, was a sitting Cuyahoga County judge when the attack happened.\n\nMason drove home after the attack. A family member reported to Cleveland police that he might attempt suicide, but Mason surrendered. Officers searching his home at the time found smoke grenades, semi-automatic rifles, a sword, a bulletproof vest and more than 2,500 rounds of ammunition from the home.\n\nMason pleaded guilty to felonious assault and domestic violence and was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nHe was granted judicial release nine months later. Part of his petition for early release included a letter to Fraser Mason in which he apologized to her, asked for her forgiveness and said he deeply regretted what happened.\n\nMason wrote that he \u201cfailed as a husband, father, and a man,\u201d and promised that once he realized he was \u201cbroken\u201d he became a better father and man, the letter said.\n\n\u201cMy responsibility was to love and protect you,\u201d Mason\u2019s letter said. \u201cInstead of loving, protecting and providing for you and our daughters, I have provided a terrible example, and exposed you to rage and violence.\u201d\n\nFraser Mason, who needed reconstructive surgery on her face, filed for divorce two days after the incident. The divorce case is still pending.\n\nFraser Mason also won a $150,000 judgement in a civil case after suing her ex-husband for damages after the attack.\n\nMason was barred by law from ever being a judge again. His law license was suspended indefinitely in December 2017.\n\ncleveland.com reporter Robin Goist contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: The post is updated to reflect the stabbing happened at Mason\u2019s Shaker Heights home, not Fraser Mason\u2019s. Court records show that the address of the stabbing was Mason\u2019s home. Shaker Heights police as of 12:30 p.m. Monday have not answered questions seeking clarification."

The group that gives him the highest markes are Republicans, with 76 percent. White men are the next highest, with half approving of Trump\u2019s handling of race relations.\n\nDemocrats as a whole disapprove the most \u2014 93 percent \u2014 with how the president is handling race relations. Black Americans are a close second, with 91 percent disapproving.\n\nThe survey is one of the first major collections of data following the 2018 midterms. The university surveyed more than 1,000 voters across the country from Nov. 14 to 19.\n\nRace became a major theme of the midterms \u2014 and continues to be, as several races remain uncalled. Trump had appeared to lean on hip-hop artist Kanye West, and he questioned why he and the GOP failed to win the black vote. Reports stated that hate crimes were on the rise. And racial identity was a common conversation topic for those wondering what decisions voters would make on Election Day.\n\nBut voters\u2019 confidence that Trump could be a leader to guide these important conversations remained low. The number of Americans disapproving of Trump\u2019s handling of race relations in the most recent poll was about the same as the last two recent polls: 58 percent in July and 61 percent in June. And that could be because of how the president handled race during the midterms.\n\nFormer congressman Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) defeated Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in the Florida gubernatorial race. Gillum had been on the receiving end of attacks from a white-supremacist group and from his opponent, and he noted the racially tense political climate that Trump helped create. In his quest to become Florida\u2019s first black governor, Gillum sometimes found himself as the object of jabs from Trump.\n\n\u201cI have not called the president a racist, but there are racists in his sympathizers who believe he may be, which is why they go to his aid, which is why he has provided them cover. I believe his cover has led to much of the degradation in our political discourse,\u201d he said earlier this month on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\"\n\nAnd Trump called Stacey Abrams unqualified in her race against Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp despite her education and political experience. Some critics thought the president\u2019s attacks on Abrams, who hoped to become America\u2019s first black female governor, were discriminatory based on her race and gender. The criticism fit a larger narrative about Trump\u2019s treatment of black women \u2014 from politicians to journalists to his former staffers.\n\nAmericans' views of Trump\u2019s role in race relations will continue to be shaped by midterm races. His defense of Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), who has been called unfit to lead Mississippi after she stepped into racial controversies in her runoff, reinforced the idea held by some black Americans that the president is insensitive to issues affecting black Americans. After the lawmaker came under fire for comments related to lynching, Trump said it was sad to see her criticized for remarks said in jest.\n\nAs Trump moves forward with a new Congress \u2014 and one that is more diverse than ever \u2014 opportunities will surface and allow him to work on issues of great importance to the country\u2019s minority groups. As of now, his approval numbers among people of color are even lower than his overall numbers, after he asked black and Latino voters what they had to lose by voting for him in 2016. So far, based on how Americans view the president\u2019s ability to address the most pressing racial issues of our time, the answer seems to be \u201ca lot.\u201d\n\nCorrection: The headline of an earlier version of this post said Trump\u2019s approval rating on race relations had hit 60 percent. It is 59 percent in the Quinnipiac poll."

Assange has been living since 2012 in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London where he has sought refuge and political asylum. It\u2019s unclear what charges may be brought against Assange; the Justice Department has previously considered prosecuting him over his role in the release of hacked DNC emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, as well as over the release of the so-called Iraq and Afghanistan War Logs, shared by U.S. military whistleblower Chelsea Manning. The Assange case has been closely followed by advocates for press freedom.

That is the same route the three larger caravans took after entering Mexico starting Oct. 19.\n\nThe caravans find strength in numbers, and Mexican officials have been loath to confront the first caravans, which numbered between 1,500 and 6,000. But agents have detained smaller groups that split off from the larger caravans.\n\nMexico has offered residency and other types of visas to migrants in the caravans, but most have refused, saying they want to reach the United States.\n\nAlso Wednesday, prosecutors in the northern state of Baja California \u2014 where the first caravan is now camped out \u2014 confirmed that a migrant was run over and killed by an unidentified vehicle on a highway between the border cities of Mexicali and Tijuana.\n\nThe state prosecutor\u2019s office said 17-year-old Oscar Baudiel Cruz Alcerro, of Honduras was found dead on the roadside with fractures and a dented skull, with parts from a white car scattered nearby.\n\nMigrants stranded in Mexicali have been walking and hitching rides to join up with the main part of the caravan in Tijuana, about 110 miles (180 kilometers) to the west.\n\nAt least one other migrant was killed early in the caravan when he fell off a truck on a highway in the southern state of Chiapas."

  "text": "VA\u2019s inspector general issued a report Tuesday saying that dozens of veterans suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were deprived of financial support because staff mishandled their benefits claims. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Veterans Affairs Department\u2019s internal watchdog has uncovered widespread errors in how the agency awards benefits to some of its most vulnerable patients: those diagnosed with the devastating neurological disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.\n\nVA Inspector General Michael Missal, in a review released Tuesday, found that dozens of veterans suffering from ALS were deprived of financial support because staff mishandled their benefits claims.\n\nOfficials with the inspector general\u2019s office are concerned that the Veterans Benefits Administration, under pressure from Congress and veterans service organizations to reduce an enormous backlog of compensation claims and appeals, may be cutting corners.\n\nOf 960 claims that were examined by Missal\u2019s office, 430 contained errors. Of those, 230 claimants were awarded the wrong benefits, the inspector general\u2019s report says. Most received no money or were underpaid. In other cases, officials could not determine whether the benefits VA paid were too low or too high.\n\nOfficials estimated that if the errors continue at the same rate over the next five years, VA will fail to pay $7.5 million in benefits to ALS patients and award an additional $6.5 million in erroneous payments.\n\n\u201cALS is a devastating, aggressive disease,\u201d Missal told The Washington Post. \u201cAccordingly, VA needs to ensure that claims reviewers are proficient and trained to properly and accurately assure that veterans are getting the full range of benefits to which they are entitled.\u201d\n\n[Veterans aren\u2019t getting their GI Bill payments \u2014 because VA\u2019s 50-year-old computer system broke]\n\nALS, a rapidly progressive neurological disease that most often leads to death within three to five years from the onset of symptoms, afflicts at least 2,000 veterans a year. Studies show that military service puts veterans at up to twice the risk of contracting the disease, although scientists have not determined why that link exists.\n\nVeterans diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, have been entitled since 2008 to automatic, service-connected benefits. Compensation ranges from $36,000 to $100,000 annually, depending on marital and family status, and related needs as the disease progresses .\n\nThe inspector general faulted poor training for the staff, comprising mostly low-level employees, tasked with reviewing the claims.\n\nEmployees who improperly denied claims failed to accurately evaluate the disease\u2019s many medical complications, and in dozens of cases they did not inform veterans or their caregivers that they were eligible for additional compensation to assist with related needs such as transportation , dressing and feeding, and specialized housing, investigators found.\n\nPaul Lawrence, VA\u2019s undersecretary for benefits, agreed with the report\u2019s recommendation that his office create specialized training for reviewers handling ALS claims and inform the staff that they must tell veterans they are entitled to additional benefits for related needs.\n\nA spokesman for VA, Curt Cashour, said that evaluating the disease\u2019s severity is \u201ccomplex work that requires a detailed assessment of a veteran\u2019s medical history.\u201d The agency is committed, he added, \u201cto improving its ALS claims-processing efforts so veterans receive the maximum benefits to which they are entitled.\u201d\n\nALS claims are among the most complex in VA\u2019s benefits system, in part because the disease progresses quickly with varied symptoms. The onset of symptoms \u2014 which can include twitching, cramping, muscle stiffness or weakness and slurred speech \u2014 may be so subtle that changes are overlooked.\n\nVA employees are supposed to tell veterans about their right to extra compensation. But they did not, based on a narrow interpretation of a legal case, the inspector general\u2019s report says.\n\n\u201cWithout information about [additional compensation], veterans with ALS may not know about and understand the benefits available to them and may mistakenly believe there are no additional benefits available,\u201d the report said."

  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump told the White House counsel in the spring that he wanted to order the Justice Department to prosecute two of his political adversaries: his 2016 challenger, Hillary Clinton, and the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, according to two people familiar with the conversation.\n\nThe lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, rebuffed the president, saying that he had no authority to order a prosecution. Mr. McGahn said that while he could request an investigation, that too could prompt accusations of abuse of power. To underscore his point, Mr. McGahn had White House lawyers write a memo for Mr. Trump warning that if he asked law enforcement to investigate his rivals, he could face a range of consequences, including possible impeachment.\n\nThe encounter was one of the most blatant examples yet of how Mr. Trump views the typically independent Justice Department as a tool to be wielded against his political enemies. It took on additional significance in recent weeks when Mr. McGahn left the White House and Mr. Trump appointed a relatively inexperienced political loyalist, Matthew G. Whitaker, as the acting attorney general.\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Trump read Mr. McGahn\u2019s memo or whether he pursued the prosecutions further. But the president has continued to privately discuss the matter, including the possible appointment of a second special counsel to investigate both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Comey, according to two people who have spoken to Mr. Trump about the issue. He has also repeatedly expressed disappointment in the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, for failing to more aggressively investigate Mrs. Clinton, calling him weak, one of the people said."

  "text": "CNN on Monday sought an emergency court hearing after White House officials said they would again revoke reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s recently returned press credentials.\n\nThe cable network filed a request in U.S. District Court seeking a hearing on a preliminary injunction to block the new White House threat to remove Acosta, a frequent foil for President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-press rhetoric. CNN\u2019s filing aims to protect Acosta\u2019s access until the network\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump administration for yanking Acosta\u2019s credentials is decided.\n\nThe renewed White House threat, delivered in a letter to Acosta on Friday \u2015 hours after a judge issued a temporary order that Acosta\u2019s credentials be returned for 14 days \u2015 was an attempt by the Trump administration \u201cto provide retroactive due process,\u201d CNN\u2019s lawyers said in Monday\u2019s court filing, obtained by BuzzFeed.\n\nThe White House is \u201cyet again \u2026 violating the constitutional rights of CNN and Acosta,\u201d the attorneys wrote.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine\u2019s letter to Acosta said they made a \u201cpreliminary decision to suspend [his] hard pass due to [his] conduct\u201d during a testy Nov. 7 Trump news conference. The letter, CNN said, was sent just hours after U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly issued the temporary order requiring the Trump administration to reinstate the reporter\u2019s credentials.\n\nThe letter said Acosta would be allowed to keep his press pass while the order was in effect. It added that Acosta would need to reply to by 5 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 18, if he wished to contest the preliminary decision to re-suspend his credentials after the order lifts.\n\n\u201cShould you not submit a response by that time, this preliminary decision will be final,\u201d the letter states.\n\nSanders and Shine alleged that Acosta failed to abide by \u201cbasic, widely understood practices\u201d during the presidential press conference, though they acknowledged the White House does not currently \u201chave a written code of conduct for journalists.\u201d\n\nCNN sued the Trump administration following Acosta\u2019s ouster, accusing the White House of violating the network and Acosta\u2019s First and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nKelly, who was appointed by Trump last year, agreed with CNN that Acosta\u2019s right to due process had likely been violated in the abrupt and opaque way he was stripped of his credentials.\n\nCNN\u2019s Brian Stelter, who shared news of the White House\u2019s latest correspondence with Acosta in his \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter, suggested the Trump administration may now be attempting to establish a \u201cpaper trail\u201d that could pass for due process.\n\n\u201cFrom the looks of the letter, the [White House] is trying to establish a paper trail that will empower the administration to boot Acosta again at the end of the month,\u201d Stelter wrote.\n\nCNN files for an emergency hearing after the White House warns that reporter Jim Acosta's press pass could be revoked again at the end of the month https://t.co/6PJHRHCNBK pic.twitter.com/WsYV8SjGOW \u2014 CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) November 19, 2018\n\nFriday's court ruling means that a temporary restraining order is in effect for 14 days.

  "text": "\n\nMother taking care of a girl with chickenpox disease. (iStock) (Mixmike/iStock)\n\nChickenpox has taken hold of a school in North Carolina where many families claim religious exemption from vaccines.\n\nCases of chickenpox have been multiplying at the Asheville Waldorf School, which serves children from nursery school to sixth grade in Asheville, N.C. About a dozen infections grew to 28 at the beginning of the month. By Friday, there were 36, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported.\n\nThe outbreak ranks as the state\u2019s worst since the chickenpox vaccine became available more than 20 years ago. Since then, the two-dose course has succeeded in limiting the highly contagious disease that once affected 90 percent of Americans \u2014 a public health breakthrough.\n\nThe school is a symbol of the small but strong movement against the most effective means of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. The percentage of children under 2 years old who haven\u2019t received any vaccinations has quadrupled since 2001, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLike the Disneyland measles outbreak in 2015, the flare-up demonstrates the real-life consequences of a shadowy debate fueled by junk science and fomented by the same sort of Twitter bots and trolls that spread misinformation during the 2016 presidential election. And it shows how a seemingly fringe view can gain currency in a place like Asheville, a funky, year-round resort town nestled between the Blue Ridge and Smoky Mountains.\n\n\u201cThe school follows immunization requirements put in place by the state board of education, but also recognizes that a parent\u2019s decision to immunize their children happens before they enter school,\u201d the school explained in a statement to Blue Ridge Public Radio.\n\nJennifer Mullendore, the medical director of Buncombe County, N.C., was unambiguous: \u201cWe want to be clear: Vaccination is the best protection from chickenpox.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we see high numbers of unimmunized children and adults, we know that an illness like chickenpox can spread easily throughout the community \u2014 into our playgrounds, grocery stores, and sports teams,\u201d she said in a news release.\n\nBut not all parents seemed to grasp the gravity of the outbreak. Nor does everyone see the rationale behind vaccines, which some believe \u2014 contrary to scientific evidence \u2014 cause more severe health issues than they\u2019re meant to cure. The claim of an autism risk, though it has been debunked, has remained a rallying cry of the anti-vaccine movement.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal with chickenpox?\u201d one city resident, Amy Gordon, told the Citizen-Times.\n\nChickenpox is serious, warns the CDC, \u201ceven life-threatening, especially in babies, adolescents, adults, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.\u201d\n\nA person can spread the disease one to two days before the rash appears, increasing the risk of broad transmission of the virus before it is detected.\n\nThat was before a two-dose vaccination program was introduced in the United States in 1995.\n\nThe virus used to crop up in about 4 million cases annually in the United States, causing more than 10,000 hospitalizations and between 100 and 150 deaths. Children were especially susceptible, as schools seemed to incubate the blisterlike rash, which appears first on the stomach, back and face and can extend over the entire surface of the body, creating as many as 500 itchy blisters.\n\nThe vaccine, which the CDC says is about 90 percent effective, hasn\u2019t eliminated the varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. But since the regimen became commercially available, it has reduced the number of cases, as well as their severity. A 14-year prospective study published in Pediatrics in 2013 found that the incidence of infection was nine- to 10-times lower than in the pre-vaccine era.\n\nStill, the vaccine\u2019s clearly documented merits remain unconvincing to some. Asheville Waldorf has one of the highest religious vaccination exemption rates in the state, according to data maintained by the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe private school has a higher rate of exemption on religious grounds than all but two other North Carolina schools, the Citizen-Times reported. During the 2017-18 school year, 19 of 28 kindergartners were exempt from at least one vaccine required by the state. Of the school\u2019s 152 students, 110 had not received the chickenpox vaccine, the newspaper reported.\n\nNorth Carolina requires all students in the state to receive certain immunizations. Among the vaccines required for kindergarten-aged children are two doses for chickenpox, two for measles and two for mumps. Seventh graders must again submit to immunization.\n\nBut the state also permits exemptions based on the advice of a physician \u2014 as well as on religious grounds.\n\n\u201cIf the bona fide religious beliefs of an adult or the parent, guardian or person in loco parentis of a child are contrary to the immunization requirements contained in this Part, the adult or the child shall be exempt from the requirements,\u201d state statute allows.\n\nRecent efforts to tighten the rules have foundered. In 2015, state legislators withdrew a bill that would have all but eliminated the religious exemption after their efforts were met with strident protest. Protesters picketed the state\u2019s General Assembly in Raleigh, warning of \u201cMedical Terrorism.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the county\u2019s medical director has been exhorting residents to immunize their children. \u201cWhat happens when we lack community immunity? Measles is what happens,\u201d Mullendore this fall told commissioners of the county, which had the highest rate of religious exemptions last year.\n\nThe friction between medical experts and the residents in their care is not unique to Buncombe County, where the parents of 5.7 percent of kindergartners claimed a religious exemption, or even to North Carolina, where the rate was 1.2 percent.\n\nForty-seven states allow religious exemptions to vaccine requirements, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. CDC data shows that the median percentage of kindergartners with an exemption from one or more required vaccine was highest in Oregon.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nWhite House tells Acosta his press pass will be suspended again when order expires, CNN says\n\nA look at Trump\u2019s \u2018A-plus\u2019 weekend: Finnish leaf-raking, 'Pleasure\u2019 Calif., and Adam \u2018Schitt\u2019\n\nNCAA relents: Lesbian college athlete, disowned by parents, can get outside help"

  "text": "Left Image: Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. (Photo by Chesnot/WireImage) Right Image: Megan and Matthew Saxton (photo courtesy the Saxton family)\n\nAround 2 AM last Friday, a neighbor knocked on Megan and Matthew Saxton\u2019s door. It was time to go.\n\n\n\nThe previous day, the Woolsey fire had begun charting a path of destruction along the Pacific coast of southern California. In Malibu and nearby affluent enclaves, the fire has so far devoured more than 98,000 acres and over 600 structures, killing at least three. Some residents, most infamously Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, were able to call in a private army of firefighters to save their properties. Many others were lucky to escape the state's latest bout of flames with their lives\u2014the Camp fire, simultaneously raging in northern California\u2019s Butte County, is the deadliest in state history with over 60 fatalities to date and well over 10,000 structures eviscerated.\n\nThe Saxtons, both 31, lived with their three sons at the Seminole Springs mobile home park in an unincorporated piece of LA county land off Mulholland Highway. They recalled buying their mobile home and a lot in the park for a combined $420,000 in 2016\u2014not the cheapest spot in town, but a far cry from the neighboring Malibu mansions that go for millions.\n\nThere were no official evacuation orders when they were woken in the middle of the night, but the air was getting smoky and they decided better safe than sorry. After grabbing some photo albums and the kids, the Saxtons drove north to stay with Megan\u2019s brother in Thousand Oaks, figuring they\u2019d be home soon to inspect the damage.\n\nThey soon found out through the NextDoor app that more than half of the mobile home park had burned. A few days later, Matthew went to the park to see the damage for himself and their worst fears were confirmed: Their home was gone.\n\nThe Saxtons were lucky enough to have an insurance policy\u2014it was required as part of their mortgage, they explained. But the policy won\u2019t cover the full cost of rebuilding, they noted, and the soonest they expected to rebuild was a year from now. \"We were a middle-class neighborhood in the middle of the canyon, an affordable gem in the middle of all these really expensive homes,\" Matthew said.\n\nNatural disasters typically have the most devastating effects on those with the fewest resources. A 2016 UN report on the nexus of wealth inequality and climate change found that the two were locked in a vicious and increasingly terrifying cycle: \"...the disadvantaged groups suffer disproportionate loss of income and assets (physical, financial, human and social) when these hazards actually hit them. Consequently, inequality worsens, and the cycle perpetuates with greater force.\"\n\n\u201cNo matter what the kind of natural disaster, whether it\u2019s flooding or wind damage or fire, the biggest burden of the longest duration falls on the already-poor,\u201d David Lodge, director of Cornell University\u2019s Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, told me.\n\nIn addition to the immediate threats to life and limb that come with any severe natural disaster, there may be a temporary period of homelessness or unemployment that can send someone on the brink of poverty over the edge. Without adequate insurance, savings to rebuild, or a reliable social safety net in place, what Lodge has called \u201cthe human face of policy-induced suffering\u201d is revealed.\n\nAnd with the current trajectory of increasing weather disasters, that suffering is likely to grow. In addition to the spectacular events of the last few years\u2014the current spate of fires in California, January\u2019s wildfire-related mudslides in Montecito, the 2017 hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria\u2014at least 99.7 percent of all US counties have incurred significant property damage from natural hazards since 2000. Between the 1960s and the 2000s, the yearly average of financial loss attributable to disasters (per capita) in the US soared from about $25 to about $80, adjusting for inflation.\n\nJunia Howell and James R. Elliott, sociologists who study social inequality, try to look away from the spectacle and find out what happens after the reporters leave Malibu, or Houston, or New Orleans. Their longitudinal study of how natural hazards impact wealth inequality in the US was motivated by the reality that \u201cthese events keep happening,\u201d as Elliott explained to me. \u201cThis is not a California problem, this is not a Texas problem, this is not a Florida problem. It's an American problem.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obviously also a global problem. Still, understanding the specifics even within American states can help show the bigger picture. So how might this worsening of economic inequality play out in the Los Angeles and Ventura county regions where the Woolsey fire continued to rage Friday?\n\nLodge suggested thinking of the archetypal Malibu mansion as a small business that employed a staff of service workers.\n\n\u201cWhile their homes are perhaps not harmed by the fire, their place of employment is destroyed,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThe consequences for them may be almost as severe as if their own homes were destroyed if they\u2019re living on the edge, as many service workers are already, even without a disaster.\u201d\n\nElliott offered a broader view, pointing to the ways disaster damage to property can affect inequality over time. \u201cIf you're a low-income resident in Los Angeles, even if your property wasn't directly affected, there can be these indirect knock-on effects for lower-income and middle-income people either because of supply potential going down in housing, or disruptions in work just giving you general precarity,\" he said. For California residents, one of these indirect effects might prove to be astronomical utility bills, as Pacific Gas and Electric Company has struggled to stay afloat in the wake of unprecedented wildfire damage.\n\nOf course, like the Saxtons, not everyone directly affected or displaced by the Woolsey fire is a Malibu millionaire. For those in the humbler neighborhoods affected, or for those who bought decades ago before the local real estate market became too hot for most to handle, rebuilding may not be an option. One measure of the fallout will be gauged by following how many of these residents end up having to put more geographical and social distance between themselves and their elite former neighbors.\n\nElliott predicted that number would be high. \u201cThe more costly the event, the more inequality in wealth is going to emerge over time,\u201d he told me. \u201cGiven the amount of property damage there, that would be our expectation for Southern California.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, good policies can mitigate effects of the disaster-inequality crises. Local government can carefully consider where people are allowed to build or rebuild, for example, keeping in mind whether it\u2019s fair for taxpayers to subsidize homes and businesses in areas that are frequently flooded or burned, as Lodge suggested. Or they could earmark funds for affordable housing or rental assistance for those whose homes weren\u2019t directly impacted by a disaster, but who have suffered economically from the fallout, as Elliott offered.\n\nOr we could yield to the increasingly popular oligarch model of billionaire-owned newsrooms and individuals with more wealth than the bottom half of the US, and directly ask some of the better-off Malibu residents to spread some wealth to less-visible casualties of the Woolsey fire.\n\nFor the Saxtons, the future seemed shaky. Their property now \u201clooks like the landscape of the moon,\u201d Matthew said, and they expected its value to plummet. They figured they\u2019d need to rebuild and stay there for four or five years just to break even on their original investment, and that they'd have to find a way to cover the difference between the cost of their new mobile home and what their insurance would pay them. Matthew worked at an office in Malibu, and when we spoke earlier this week, he was waiting to find out once the evacuation orders were lifted whether the building* remained.\n\nAgainst a broader backdrop of accelerating political chaos and routine mass shootings\u2014including one that left 13 dead in Thousand Oaks, where the Saxtons took refuge, just hours before the Woolsey fire forced residents to evacuate\u2014an increasingly dystopian reality loomed. Though the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department said there has been no looting in Malibu, singer Pink's husband Carey Hart posted a photo to Instagram on Tuesday of a group of gun-toting, masked men bearing a sign that read \u201cLOOTERS WILL BE SHOT ON SITE!\u201d Another Instagram feed with the handle @prayformalibu posted a photo of a similar sign: \u201cWelcome 2 Point Dume Looters get bullets Fireman get hugs.\u201d\n\nAt a moment when asking what really stands between Americans and civil war is not entirely unreasonable, addressing \u201cwealth inequality is an issue not only of fairness,\u201d as Lodge noted, but also critical to maintaining social stability.\n\n*Correction 11/16/2018: A previous version of this story suggested Matthew Saxton was concerned about his job, when in fact he was worried solely about the office building in which he worked.

  "authors": [],
  "text": "The CIA has concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the country's consulate in Istanbul last month, The Washington Post reported Friday.\n\nThe agency has high confidence in its assessment, the newspaper reported. The CIA reportedly examined multiple sources of intelligence in reaching its conclusion, including a call between the crown prince's brother Khalid bin Salman and Khashoggi.\n\nKhalid, who is the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., reportedly told Khashoggi, who was a columnist for the Post, that he should go to the country's consulate in Istanbul to get documents for his marriage to a Turkish woman, offering assurances that he would be safe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT People familiar with the call, reportedly intercepted by U.S. intelligence, told the Post that it wasn't clear if Khalid knew Khashoggi would be killed when he returned to the consulate, but said that he made the call at the direction of his brother.\n\nTurkish officials have said that he was killed by a Saudi hit squad shortly after entering the consulate, and was then dismembered and his body removed from the premises. The Saudi government issued several conflicting explanations for his disappearance before eventually acknowledging that he was killed inside the consulate, while denying that the crown prince was involved. Saudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor said this week that it would seek the death penalty for five suspects allegedly involved in the killing. Khashoggi's death sparked an international firestorm, with bipartisan members of Congress calling on the Saudi royal court to be punished."

  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2015 By last summer, Kamau Bilal had heard enough. When the Clarks became one of the first white families to move onto his nearly all-black block in the Bloomingdale neighborhood more than a decade ago, he\u2019d tried to make them feel welcome. He became friendly with the Clark brothers, who once helped him build a treehouse for his son.\n\nBut Bilal distanced himself from Jeffrey Clark and his younger brother, Edward, as they became increasingly radical, especially after one blowout fight over then-candidate Donald Trump. Then, on the night of Trump\u2019s election, Bilal\u2019s mother called to tell him about a group gathered on Clark\u2019s porch chanting about Hitler.\n\nLast summer, after someone snatched a gay pride flag off a front porch near the Clarks\u2019 home, a group of about six people ripped another pride flag off the front of the Showtime bar and a bunch of white supremacist flyers were scattered around the neighborhood, neighbors contacted Bilal, who had since moved to Maryland, and told him they suspected the Clark brothers were involved.\n\nSo Bilal went to talk to another Bloomingdale neighbor: a District of Columbia police officer. He told the cop who lived just down the street from the Clarks that neighbors were worried the brothers were involved with the racist propaganda spreading throughout the neighborhood. The police officer said he would look into it.\n\nThat was the last he heard of it.\n\nA year later, one of the brothers is dead and the other is imprisoned on gun charges after family members told the FBI that the elder Clark brother is a dangerous white supremacist. Edward Clark, 23, killed himself on Roosevelt Island in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 27, hours after the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre. In the following days, 30-year-old Jeffrey wrote on Gab, a social media site popular among racists, that Robert Bowers, that the accused Pittsburgh shooter, was a \u201chero\u201d and that the synagogue victims \u201cdeserved\u201d to be killed. Jeffrey was arrested on Nov. 9 after his relatives turned him into the FBI.\n\nOn Friday, a federal magistrate judge ordered Jeffrey held until trial following a hearing in which a federal prosecutor described the defendant as \u201ca bomb\u201d waiting to explode.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office A noose found inside the Clark home.\n\nThe death by suicide, the arrest and the public revelations about the Clark brothers\u2019 ideology have left their neighbors struggling to understand how the two men were able to spend years going to white supremacist meet-ups, making violent threats online and stockpiling guns in their home without attracting attention from law enforcement in the heart of a progressive city like Washington. Even Jeffrey Clark\u2019s public praise of the violent actions of Bowers and Cesar Sayoc, the Florida Trump supporter accused of sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats, likely would have gone unnoticed by authorities if his own family hadn\u2019t reported his behavior.\n\nIt also raises questions about law enforcement\u2019s ability to keep tabs on radicalized right-wingers who could pose a threat while they navigate First Amendment protections. Despite the Clark brothers\u2019 extensive online support for hate groups and their reputation in their Bloomingdale neighborhood, a law enforcement official confirmed that they were not on the FBI\u2019s radar until the family members raised concerns.\n\nThe Clark family moved to Washington from Utah, where both parents had attended Brigham Young University. They sent their kids to private Catholic schools. After briefly living in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, the Clarks bought their house in Bloomingdale. When the parents later split up, the father stayed in the Bloomingdale house with his three children: Jeffrey, Edward and a daughter.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office Body armor and helmets found inside the Clark home.\n\nBilal, whose mother has lived in the neighborhood for decades, noticed a shift in the Clark brothers after Edward was mugged on his way to the store several years ago. The brothers shaved their heads and Jeffrey started carrying a gun.\n\n\u201cI think it really affected their manhood,\u201d Bilal said.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Bilal and Jeffrey got into arguments about Trump. Jeffrey ranted about his hatred for Mexicans, and Edward seemed to go along with it, Bilal said.\n\n\u201cI think [Jeffrey] kind of respected me in a sense where he didn\u2019t want to let me know his true nature,\u201d said Bilal, who is black. \u201cBut deep down inside, I think he hated my guts.\u201d\n\nJeffrey claimed in a podcast last year that he \u201cwas not somebody that would have been described as a racist a few years ago.\u201d He claims he went looking for answers and found it in the so-called alt-right. According to Jeffrey, the rise of the alt-right is due to people\u2019s dissatisfaction with the \u201cZionist-occupied government.\u201d\n\nOver the past year and a half, Jeffrey and Edward became regulars at white nationalist gatherings. They appeared at an April 2017 protest outside the White House organized by alt-right leader Richard Spencer to protest military airstrikes in Syria.\n\nAnd you can't spell \"aspiring mass shooter\" without \"Richard Spencer\" somewhere in there. Web doesn't get much smaller than this, folks. pic.twitter.com/gpa8GXtewK \u2014 Stop the Next 'Unite the Right' (@stopthenextutr) November 14, 2018\n\nSpencer told HuffPost he never knew the Clarks by name or had any interaction with them outside of them asking for the photograph.\n\nThe Clark brothers teamed up with far-right propagandist Jack Posobiec in May 2017 to shoot footage for a Posobiec project on Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staffer whose murder in Bloomingdale is the topic of several conspiracy theories. Posobiec denied working with the Clarks, despite appearing in several photographs where he is being filmed by the Clark brothers in Bloomingdale. Jeffrey attended a \u201cFreedom of Speech\u201d rally in D.C. in June 2017 with other alt-right members, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Around the same time, Jeffrey and Edward showed up at a D.C. bookstore to disrupt an event with Alexander Reid Ross, an author who was discussing his book Against the Fascist Creep. The Clarks were there with Jamie Troutman, a white nationalist who goes by AltRightVA online. That month, Jeffrey Traveled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to participate in a March Against Sharia rally organized by the Islamophobic group ACT for America, according to the Anti-Defamation League and screenshots of tweets reviewed by HuffPost.\n\nUnite the Right organizer Jason Kessler tweeted at the time, \u201cThese are some of my favorite people! #MAGA,\u201d referring to pictures of the Clark brothers. Kessler wrote in an email that he does not condone politically motivated violence \u2014 but he claims it is the natural result of failing to address the grievances of white people. Suppressing that conversation, he wrote, pushes people \u201cinto an echo chamber of extremism and frustration where thoughts of violence seem like the only way out.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese are some of my favorite people! #MAGA https://t.co/8qdzIq8VkF \u2014 Jason Kessler (@TheMadDimension) June 10, 2017\n\nThe Clark brothers also appeared at Kessler\u2019s initiation into the Proud Boys, a violent neo-fascist gang whose leader claims the group is not racist despite attracting white nationalist members.\n\nIt was around this time that the white supremacist flyers appeared in Bloomingdale and Bilal asked the local police officer to look into the Clark brothers. The D.C. police officer who lived within eyesight of the Clark home did not immediately respond to a voicemail message left with his wife. Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Brianna Jordan told HuffPost in an email that she has no knowledge of the tip. She declined to say whether the police department investigated the flyers or the theft and attempted theft of the pride flags.\n\nThe Clark brothers traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, to attend the deadly white nationalist rally there in August 2017. They appeared in a photo near James Alex Fields Jr., who drove a car into protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring several others.\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Spencer's \"anti-war\" rally\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Spencer's first torch rally on 5/13/17\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Kessler's Proud Boy night on 6/17\n\n\u2611\ufe0f UTR planning Discord chats\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Stood near Fields on UTR\n\n\n\nThis is probably the tip of the iceberg but what more do y'all need before realizing this isn't a fucking game? pic.twitter.com/oIOEbb79wq \u2014 Stop the Next 'Unite the Right' (@stopthenextutr) November 14, 2018\n\nThis August, a neighbor snapped photos of a man he says was Patrick Little, a neo-Nazi who ran for Senate in California. Little was known to be in D.C. at the time, where he held a sign saying \u201cExpel the Jews\u201d outside of the White House, and the elder Clark brother had promoted Little on Gab. Little did not respond to questions about his ties to Clark. Instead, he told HuffPost he would grant an interview in exchange for a summary of a film about \u201cJewish Supremacism.\u201d\n\nBy this time, multiple neighbors suspected the Clark brothers, who were quiet and kept to themselves, of being right-wing extremists. One person who lived in the neighborhood had Googled the Clark family and found screenshots of what appeared to be Jeffrey\u2019s suspended Twitter and Facebook profiles, which included images of Jeffrey posing with a swastika, as well as descriptions of the brothers as associates of Richard Spencer. The neighbor was horrified but didn\u2019t know what to do. Despite watching for suspicious activity, the neighbor didn\u2019t find anything online or see anything in person that was illegal.\n\nHad the Clark brothers been vocal advocates of the Islamic State instead of the Third Reich, they likely would have attracted law enforcement\u2019s attention long ago. If Jeffrey was supporting a group like ISIS or al Qaeda, he could now be facing a material support charge based on his public advocacy for a group the U.S. government has labeled as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nBut there\u2019s no federal law against domestic terrorism, a fact that surprises many Americans. Consequently, federal law enforcement takes a much different approach to investigating armed neo-Nazis advocating violence than it would sympathizers of radical Islamist terrorist groups.\n\nJeffrey Clark was charged with the federal crime of illegally possessing a firearm while using or addicted to a controlled substance \u2014 a rarely used criminal statute \u2014 and the D.C. crime of possessing a high-capacity ammunition magazine. The maximum prison sentence for the federal statute is 10 years and the maximum time for the D.C. offense is one year.\n\nThat means federal authorities are leaning heavily on the notion that Clark owned a gun while addicted to marijuana as the basis of his imprisonment. Marijuana is legal in Washington, although it is still an illegal substance under federal law.\n\nClark appeared in federal court in D.C. on Friday afternoon, where prosecutors argued for his continued detention because they say he poses a threat to the public and is a flight risk.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office A Nazi flag found inside the Clark home.\n\nBoth David Bos, a federal public defender representing Clark, and Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey indicated during Clark\u2019s detention hearing Friday that they\u2019d never seen prosecutors use the unusual federal charge.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney John Cummings said in court Friday that it was \u201cclear to anyone in that house what was going on\u201d and that Clark\u2019s \u201cglorification of violence and hatred for minority groups\u201d \u2015 together with his possession of weapons and use of marijuana \u2015 made him a \u201cvery dangerous combination.\u201d Cummings noted that Clark told law enforcement he could respond violently if the government took his weapons \u2014 and that Clark would be banned from owning weapons if convicted of the felony count. Asked by the judge if Clark\u2019s father was one of the relatives who turned him in, Cummings said he was not.\n\nBos, representing Clark, argued that Clark\u2019s \u201cdistasteful comments\u201d were \u201cconstitutionally protected\u201d and suggested the government was grasping at straws to find a charge to stick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a case in which the government went forward on this portion of the statute,\u201d said Bos, who has been practicing for 30 years.\n\nWhile concurring that Clark was facing an \u201cunusual charge\u201d that the judge hadn\u2019t seen before, Harvey ordered Clark detained until trial, saying he couldn\u2019t ignore Clark\u2019s \u201cthreatening\u201d and \u201cmenacing\u201d posts and his family members\u2019 concern that his anger \u201chas intensified\u201d in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cIt seemed that the defendant was preparing for something,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nBefore the hearing, federal prosecutors indicated in a filing that Clark told law enforcement he wanted to move West Virginia to nonviolently \u201ctake over\u201d a town with \u201clike-minded white nationalists.\u201d They also laid out additional evidence against the elder Clark brother, saying that authorities searching the home found a flyer from the Atomwaffen Division, a violent neo-Nazi group responsible for several murders; a rope tied into a noose above his bed; a Nazi flag and body armor; and a drawing of a gunman aiming at a caricature of a Jewish man wearing a yarmulke.\n\nNext to the anti-Semitic drawing was a bullet-pointed list of an agenda for \u201cpeaceful resolution,\u201d which included legalizing discrimination, cutting off all welfare, ending all immigration, deporting all illegal immigrants, banishing criminals to Mexico, and affirming the First and Second amendments. The final point in the plan: \u201cEnd birthright citizenship.\u201d"

  "text": "(CNN) Democrat Stacey Abrams on Friday acknowledged that Republican Brian Kemp will become the next governor of Georgia, ending her bid to become the first African American woman elected to lead a state.\n\nThe announcement followed more than a week of post-election legal maneuvering from her campaign and allies as they sought to find enough votes to reduce Kemp's lead and force a December 4 runoff.\n\nAbrams was considering further legal challenges as recently as Friday morning, but ultimately made the decision to end her campaign in a fiery speech to supporters at her headquarters in Atlanta. She did, however, announce plans for a \"major federal lawsuit against the state of Georgia for the gross mismanagement of this election and to protect future elections from unconstitutional actions.\"\n\nEven in acknowledging defeat, Abrams insisted her speech was not giving a concession and instead delivered a series of sharp criticisms of Kemp.\n\n\"So let's be clear -- this is not a speech of concession, because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper,\" she said. \"As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that. But, my assessment is the law currently allows no further viable remedy. Now, I can certainly bring a new case to keep this one contest alive, but I don't want to hold public office if I need to scheme my way into the post.

  "text": "\u201cDelay, Deny and Deflect.\u201d That\u2019s the name of a new bombshell investigation by The New York Times revealing that Facebook executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, were aware of a Russian misinformation campaign on the social media network and took a series of extraordinary private actions to preserve the company\u2019s reputation, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat critics and spread misinformation. The New York Times investigation reveals that Facebook hired the Republican opposition-research firm Definers Public Affairs to discredit critics of Facebook, linking them to the billionaire liberal donor George Soros. Facebook also allegedly lobbied the Anti-Defamation League to condemn criticism of the company as anti-Semitic. Since the publication of the investigation, Facebook has announced it will cut ties with Definers. DN! speaks with Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, one of the organizations targeted by Definers Public Affairs.

  "text": "After the 2016 election, Mark Zuckerberg went on a \u201clistening tour\u201d while Sheryl Sandberg reportedly orchestrated an oppo campaign against Facebook\u2019s critics. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images and Scott Eisen/Getty Images.\n\nThe leaders of Facebook can no longer pretend they are special people running a special company. Facebook is now just another normal sleazy American company run by normal sleazy executives, engaged in normal sleazy lobbying and corporate propaganda.\n\nThanks to some deep reporting by a team of New York Times reporters, we now know that CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent the year after the 2016 presidential election largely checked out and clueless about the monster he had created. And we know that COO Sheryl Sandberg, in the face of growing scrutiny of the company, was so desperate to repair the leak in the price of Facebook stock that she went into cahoots with a number of suspect figures across American politics\u2014including a right-wing opposition research shop dabbling in the PR dark arts as well as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who ran interference for the company within his party.\n\nOver the past three years, Facebook has been outed for abusing the trust of its users, sharing personal data with third parties like Cambridge Analytica, unwittingly hosting Russian-backed propaganda intended to undermine American democracy, amplifying calls for religious and ethnic violence in places like Sri Lanka and Myanmar, and promoting violent authoritarian and nationalist leaders like Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines and Narendra Modi in India. As these stories piled up and public trust eroded, the Times reports, Zuckerberg consistently exempted himself from crucial discussions with the Facebook security team and acted generally baffled that anyone would question his baby. After all, didn\u2019t he just want, in his words, to \u201cbring the world closer together?\u201d\n\nThe Times report makes clear that Zuckerberg and Sandberg played no-cop-bad-cop while troubles rolled across their screens and into their board meetings.\n\nSandberg, a veteran of the Clinton administration and a thoroughly connected member of America\u2019s corporate and cultural elite, called in all the favors she could and appealed to some of the baser instincts of potential allies. Crucially, Sandberg brought on Republican lobbyists like Joel Kaplan, last seen lending public support to his old friend, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, during his fraught confirmation hearings.\n\nKaplan reportedly led the charge internally to water down Facebook reports about the breadth of Russian attacks on American democracy for fear of angering President Donald Trump and conservative power brokers. Sandberg consistently backed Kaplan, denying the American public a full account of a hostile foreign power\u2019s attempts to influence an election and, just as important, the fundamental vulnerability of Facebook to being hijacked by almost any small but determined force.\n\nSandberg also reportedly unleashed a propaganda campaign that leveraged the right-wing meme machine\u2014the same machine that so deeply pollutes Facebook with misinformation and disinformation about life in America. Perhaps the most disturbing allegation in the Times report is that Facebook\u2019s right-wing agents tried to link some high-profile Facebook critics to financier George Soros. Given that Soros is the go-to boogeyman in many recent anti-Semitic campaigns, we should be shocked that Facebook stooped so low. All the while boasting of transparency and concern for the health of our communities, Facebook clandestinely played with the very villains who regularly warp and pollute our culture and politics.\n\nAfter months of stalling and dodging and under intense pressure from Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking minority member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Facebook finally revealed in late October 2017 that Russian propaganda had reached at least 126 million American Facebook users. Because of Facebook\u2019s propensity to algorithmically amplify content that generates strong emotions, University of Pennsylvania professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson concludes in her new book Cyberwar that Russian activity in the 2016 election \u201cnot only infected the news agenda but also tilted the balance of discourse in battleground states against the Democratic Party nominee.\u201d\n\nWarner, one of the few in this drama who comes off as more concerned about the fate of the republic than the prospect of Facebook campaign contributions, has been such a strong and consistent interrogator of Facebook that his party leader, Schumer, felt compelled to defend his old friend Sandberg. (As the Times also points out, Schumer\u2019s daughter is a marketing director at Facebook.) The Times reports that he told Warner to back off from his scrutiny of Facebook and that \u201cMr. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Mr. Schumer advised, not harm it.\u201d\n\nSchumer has always been a transactional politician. But Facebook has not always been just a regular, sleazy company. It\u2019s become one lately, largely as a result of the rush of trouble that has rendered Zuckerberg verbally stunned and Sandberg morally stunted.\n\nFor most of its history, Facebook made too much money to care about money and had too strong a reputation to care about its reputation. It was golden. Just as Zuckerberg and Sandberg graced the covers of magazines, Facebook scaled the peaks of the stock market and the public imagination.\n\nWhat explains the cravenness of Facebook\u2019s leadership now? They must realize, as social media scholars have been warning for many years, that Facebook is vulnerable by design. All of the scandals and crises the company has facilitated in recent years are examples of Facebook working as it was supposed to.\n\nThe three features that make Facebook Facebook also make it the ideal platform for working on behalf of dangerous and violent forces. The first is scale. Facebook gathers posts from more than 2.2 billion people in more than 100 languages. The second is algorithmic amplification. Facebook promotes extreme content like hate speech and conspiracy theories over thoughtful, balanced, deliberate work. And the third is the best advertising system ever created. Facebook can put an ad in front of exactly the type of person who might respond to a sales pitch or a call to political action and ignore those who might not.\n\nZuckerberg and Sandberg can\u2019t fix Facebook because to fix Facebook is to scrap one or more of these essential attributes. The problem with Facebook is Facebook.\n\nWe are stuck in the world Facebook made. It was a terrible idea in the first place, but as long as advertisers, authoritarians, and Chuck Schumer protect it, Facebook will face little significant pressure in most of the world. All Zuckerberg and Sandberg need to do is ride out this moment, boast about making a good effort to clean the thing up, and keep those campaign contributions flowing. Facebook will be just fine. Democracy will not."

Also pictured is Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, left, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, second from right.

Trump made the announcement in passing at a White House ceremony for Presidential Medal of Freedom honorees. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Andrew Wheeler, a former congressional aide and lobbyist who has led the Environmental Protection Agency since his scandal-plagued predecessor resigned earlier this year, got President Donald Trump\u2019s nod Friday for the permanent job.\n\nWheeler\u2019s promotion from acting to permanent EPA chief would keep him as a methodical and effective agent in Trump\u2019s mission of rolling back environmental regulations that the administration regards as burdensome to business. Environmental groups quickly voiced their opposition.\n\nTrump announced his plans for Wheeler almost in passing Friday at a White House ceremony for Presidential Medal of Freedom honorees.\n\nSingling out Cabinet members in the audience at the ceremony, Trump got to Wheeler and said, \u201cacting administrator, who I will tell you is going to be made permanent.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a fantastic job and I want to congratulate him, EPA, Andrew Wheeler. Where\u2019s Andrew?\u201d Trump continued. \u201cCongratulations, Andrew, great job, great job, thank you very much.\u201d\n\nThe White House said Trump was signaling his intent to nominate Wheeler. The nomination would require Senate confirmation. Senators approved Wheeler as the agency\u2019s deputy administrator in a 53-45 vote last April.\n\nA veteran on Capitol Hill, Wheeler worked from 1995 to 2009 as a staffer for Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, a fervent denier of man-made climate change, and then for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\n\u201cThe perfect choice to lead the EPA,\u201d Inhofe tweeted Friday. \u201cGreat pick.\u201d\n\nWheeler later worked as a lobbyist, including for coal giant Murray Energy Corp., which pushed hard at the outset of the Trump administration for coal-friendly policies from the EPA and other agencies.\n\nThe grandson of a coal miner, Wheeler told staffers in his first days as the agency\u2019s acting head this summer that he was proud of his roots in coal country. In the acting role, Wheeler has a reputation as a more open and cordial boss for employees than Pruitt was, and for producing regulatory rewrites more likely to stand up to court challenges.\n\nSince becoming acting EPA head, Wheeler has advanced proposals that would ease emissions limits for power plants, for cars and for oil and gas facilities, rejecting earlier EPA findings that some of the moves would lead to increased deaths from pollutants.\n\nHowever, Wheeler also has slowed another Pruitt-era rollback that would have allowed trucks rigged with outdated, dirtier-burning engines to stay on the road.\n\n\u201cCompared to Administrator Pruitt, Mr. Wheeler is better,\u201d Sen. Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat and one of the most consistent critics of Trump\u2019s EPA, said Friday in a statement after Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cCompared to Administrators Ruckelshaus or Whitman, he\u2019s not doing nearly as well,\u201d Carper added. He was referring to William Ruckelshaus, who was appointed by Richard Nixon to head the EPA in 1970 and Christine Todd Whitman, who was appointed to the post in 2001 by George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cIf the president intends to nominate Andrew Wheeler to be the administrator of EPA, then Mr. Wheeler must come before our committee so that members can look at his record as acting administrator objectively to see if any improvements have been made at the agency since he took the helm.\u201d\n\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. Environmental groups condemned the announcement.\n\n\u201cIn normal times, a zealous fossil fuel apologist and the top official in charge of protecting children\u2019s health from pollution would be two separate people with conflicting agendas,\u201d Ken Cook, president of the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said in a statement. \u201cBut this is the Trump administration, where a former top coal lobbyist could become administrator of the EPA.\u201d"

  "text": "Three likely incoming Democratic chairs of House committees overseeing environmental issues vowed to scrutinize the Trump administration\u2019s actions on climate change and bring before them top administration officials who they think have escaped adequate oversight under their Republican colleagues.\n\nAfter eight years out of power in the House, Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson (Tex.), Ra\u00fal Grijalva (Ariz.) and Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.) are expected to lead the committees on Science, Space, and Technology; Natural Resources; and Energy and Commerce, respectively, after serving as the panels' ranking Democrats.\n\nIn a slate of interviews, they outlined an expansive agenda to put a hot spotlight on the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of President Obama\u2019s climate agenda and to delve deep into alleged misconduct of officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, Interior Department and the Housing and Urban Development Department.\n\nAt the top of that list is Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.\n\nGrijalva wants Zinke to testify before his committee about discussions surrounding a deal in Whitefish, Mont., between the Zinkes\u2019 family foundation and Halliburton chairman David Lesar along with other developers. Democrats asked Interior\u2019s acting inspector general to launch a probe of the matter in late June after Politico first reported on the deal. The watchdog office last month referred the matter to the Justice Department.\n\nTrump said last week he was \u201clooking at\u201d the allegations against Zinke but that overall he was \u201cvery happy with most of my Cabinet.\u201d Zinke has denied the allegations as \u201cvicious attacks.\u201d\n\nThe planned oversight is in line with the overall aim by the incoming House majority to scrutinize President Trump and his underlings on subjects such as the president\u2019s tax returns and alleged payments by Trump\u2019s former lawyer to women who said they had affairs with him.\n\nSome agencies are already gearing up for an onslaught of congressional demands. The EPA recently hired two lawyers who are prepared to handle document requests, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.\n\nAn EPA spokesman, who declined to comment directly on the two hires, said there had not been a spike in hiring at the agency due to the prospect of greater oversight.\n\nWhile agencies prepare, there is already a turf battle within the new Democratic majority over how to wield its power to address what scientists say is an ecological crisis the world has little time to solve.\n\nAt the moment, even the forum for a climate debate is up for debate.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), looking to corral support and again serve as speaker of the House, said she \u201cstrongly\u201d supports reestablishing a special committee on climate change.\n\n[Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says she has the votes to become the next House speaker]\n\nBy doing so, she is meeting one of the demands from a group of protesters \u2014 one of whom was Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N. Y) \u2014 who occupied her office Tuesday. First impaneled by Pelosi in 2007, the select climate committee was scrapped four years later when Republicans took the House.\n\nBut Pallone and Johnson have voiced apprehension about duplicating the efforts of their own panels.\n\n\u201cWe have climate change champions leading all these committees,\u201d Pallone said.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, wondered what a select committee, which was purely a fact-finding panel the last time around, could achieve with Trump regularly dismissing the scientific consensus that human activity is warming the globe.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what a special select committee would do to change the executive branch,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nA day after Pelosi tweeted her support for creating a special climate committee, the three ranking Democrats announced they plan to hold two days\u2019 worth of hearings on climate change early next year. Pallone said Democrats want to review some of Trump\u2019s splashier climate-related moves, such as the plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord and to repeal greenhouse-gas limits on coal-fired plants.\n\nThey also want to bear down some smaller-bore but still neglected issues.\n\nPallone wants to determine whether the Trump administration is following legally mandated requirements to review potentially dangerous chemicals and issue energy-efficiency standards.\n\nJohnson said she aims to review a proposal to ban the use of certain studies in rulemaking that rely on confidential health information.\n\nGrijalva said he was interested in conducting hearings on a proposed reorganization plan of Interior, which he worries may break up some \u201cpretty well-functioning\u201d offices.\n\n\u201cIt's a long list that has been dormant,\u201d Grijalva said.\n\nThat alone probably will not be enough for the progressives. A handful of freshmen, including Ocasio-Cortez, are pressuring Democratic leaders to craft an ambitious plan to take the entire nation to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years.\n\nIn addition to answers about the Montana land deal, Grijalva said he wants to know more about an incident last month in which Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson announced one of his top appointees would become Interior\u2019s acting inspector general. Days later, Interior officials called Carson\u2019s statement \u201c100 percent false\u201d and said they would not hire HUD official Suzanne Israel Tufts.\n\n\u201cThe coincidence of the timing, I would question,\u201d Grijalva said, noting that Carson\u2019s statement came shortly after Interior acting inspector general Mary Kendall referred allegations concerning Zinke to Justice.\n\nPallone said he wanted to know more about the work of Nancy Beck, formerly an executive at the lobbying outfit American Chemistry Council, at the EPA.\n\nEven the tenure of Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s first EPA administrator who resigned in July amid ethics investigations, may again be scrutinized.\n\n\u201cMy concern with the EPA is: How was Mr. Pruitt able to get away with all he got away with and remain there?\u201d said Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is set to take over the gavel of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nAsked about future congressional investigations, Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift declined to directly address the issue in an email.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of bipartisan priorities that we work with Congress on and we will continue to work with them,\u201d she said.\n\nHouse Democrats will also have the opportunity to grill corporate executives. Already, environmental groups have called for Democrats to investigate ExxonMobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a company, and there\u2019s been outreach before by the minority on these committees, then that gives you a pretty good indication that they\u2019re going to want to talk to you,\u201d said Aaron Cutler, a former lawyer for Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee who now works at the law firm Hogan Lovells.\n\nBut Democrats will have to balance their impulse to investigate Trump\u2019s environmental deputies with their desire to try to work with the president on a long-promised infrastructure bill.\n\nPallone expressed interest in working with the White House to improve drinking-water systems, while Grijalva said he wants to finish a plan kicked off by congressional Republicans to use federal oil and gas revenue to fix leaky pipes and craggy roads in national parks.\n\n\u201cThis is an area where we can work with the president,\u201d Pallone said.\n\nBut at a news conference this week, Trump threatened to take a \u201cwarlike posture\u201d if Democrats investigated him and his team.\n\nAnd while lawmakers have the power to demand documents when they\u2019re in the majority, Alston & Bird partner Kevin Minoli said it is important to keep things in perspective. Minoli, who led the EPA\u2019s response to congressional oversight during the Obama administration, noted that members of Congress often set tight deadlines of two weeks or less.\n\nBut, he cautioned, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that when they write that letter that the agency is going to provide them the next day, or even ever.\"\n\nBen Guarino and Paul Schwartzman contributed to this report."

  "text": "Dunkin Donuts Franchise owner Christina Cabral and police officer (Photo: Screen capture)\n\nAmericans can add \u201cusing free wifi while black\u201d to the list of things African Americans must navigate.\n\nAccording to a video posted on Facebook and flagged by The Root, Tirza Wilbon White walked into her local Fairfax, Virginia Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, where she is a frequent customer. She set up her laptop and that\u2019s when she was approached by franchise owner Christina Cabral, who White said she\u2019d never met in her two years of going to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.\n\nCabral said that White couldn\u2019t use the wifi without making a purchase, something no one has told White about before. So, White asked if it was a new policy. Cabral said it wasn\u2019t new but now that she was there, it would be enforced.\n\nWhite felt something was off and pressed a little asking if the policy was posted anywhere. White began recording the exchange as their conversation continued. White, a policy scholar, felt the issue was about discrimination and an arbitrary enforcement of the rule.\n\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d Cabral said. \u201cDon\u2019t get into the racial profiling. It\u2019s my family. I find that offensive.\u201d\n\nCabral then revealed that she was the owner of the local Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and confessed she would order signs explaining the \u201cpolicy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey hang out here for eight hours and they get into fights,\u201d she told White. \u201cYou can look it up; it was on Prince William County a year ago.\u201d\n\nThe Root noted they couldn\u2019t find any news of a fight breaking out in a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, certainly not one with a 46-year-old black woman working on her laptop.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make our customers feel safe,\u201d Cabral claimed.\n\nAfter a conversation, Cabral inevitably threatened to call the police.\n\n\u201cNow you wanna call the police because you don\u2019t like what I\u2019m saying?\u201d White asked, still preternaturally calm.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re offending me,\u201d Cabral said, as the reason for calling the authorities.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who brought up racial profiling,\u201d Cabral claimed. \u201cYou can take your recording, and you can do what you want with it, because at the end of the day, you\u2019re trying to blackmail me.\u201d\n\nAll over free wifi.\n\n\u201cI just pulled across the street and cried,\u201d she told The Root over the phone in an interview. \u201cEven now I\u2019m so angry because of all of it and how it could have ended. \u2026 I wanted to document, if for nobody else for my children, who I wanted to teach: There are no identity politics that can protect you from this. Your mom is a former college professor, but on this day, I was a black chick with no makeup on and a twistout. \u2026 Based on what I looked like, this is what happened to me.\u201d\n\nDunkin\u2019 Donuts has tried to reach out to White and apologize for what happened. They released a statement claiming that the franchise owner was \u201cattempting\u201d to reach out to White to apologize for the negative experience.\n\nWatch her video below:\n\n\n\n"

  "text": "A man shouting \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Trump\u201d during a performance of \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d in Baltimore smelled of alcohol and told police he was motivated by his hatred of President Donald Trump.\n\nAnthony M. Derlunas, 58, told an officer he \u201chad been drinking heavily throughout the night\u201d before the outburst at the Hippodrome Theatre on Wednesday night, according to a police report.\n\nBut before details of the police report became public in the early evening, the incident rattled many already anxious about a recent spike in anti-Semitism and hate crimes in Maryland and nationwide.\n\nAudience member Rich Scherr said the outburst, which happened during intermission, sparked fears of a shooting like the one in a Pittsburgh synagogue last month that killed 11 people.\n\nUpdate: Man apologizes for yelling 'Heil Hitler, heil Trump' at 'Fiddler on the Roof' performance in Baltimore \u00bb\n\nThe man, later identified as Derlunas, had been seated in the balcony and began shouting \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople started running,\u201d Scherr said. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I was waiting to hear a gunshot. I thought, \u2018Here we go.\u2019\u201d\n\nSamit Verma was seated in the balcony when he heard shouting and saw a man holding his hand straight up in a Nazi salute, he said in an email Thursday. Ushers rushed over to the man while audience members quickly made their way out of the theater and into the hall, Verma said.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun investigated 2 years of hate incident reports in Maryland. Here's what we found. \u00bb\n\n\u201cThe people around me appeared to be quite shaken by the incident,\u201d Verma said in the email. \u201cThere were some people in tears.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, Derlunas said that the final scene of the play before intermission had reminded him of his hatred for the president, which is why he shouted. He was confused when people around him became angry. The officer deduced \u201cthat his intention was to express his dislike for President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBaltimore Police were called and security escorted Derlunas out a few minutes later, a police spokeswoman said, and the show continued.\n\nAccording to the police report, Derlunas was \u201ccalm and compliant\u201d during the interaction and returned to a hotel where he was staying with his girlfriend in the area. Witnesses told The Baltimore Sun that the audience applauded as the man was removed.\n\nPolice issued a stop ticket to the man, but he was not arrested, police said. A stop ticket is the least severe measure police can take when responding to a complaint, followed by citations and arrests. Stop tickets do not carry any fines or other penalties and do not require follow-up from the recipient.\n\n\u201cAs reprehensible as those words are, they are considered protected free speech because nobody was directly threatened,\u201d police spokesman Matt Jablow said in an email.\n\nDerlunas, who could not be reached for comment, was permanently banned from the Hippodrome. He has no record of criminal violence.\n\n\u201cMore should have been done,\u201d said Dana Vickers Shelley, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland.\n\nWhile such speech is protected under the First Amendment, the man could easily have been charged with disorderly conduct for the act of disrupting the play, Shelley said. Instead, he was given, she said, \u201cwhat sounds like a ticket for jaywalking \u2014 or less.\u201d\n\n\u201cFiddler\u201d tells the story of a Jewish family as it faces persecution in tsarist Russia. It\u2019s based on \u201cTevye the Dairyman,\u201d a series of fictional stories by author Sholem Aleichem, originally written in Yiddish. The play opened Tuesday and runs through Sunday in Baltimore.\n\nThe outburst occurred during intermission, immediately following a scene that depicts a wedding interrupted by a pogrom \u2014 an attack on Jewish people which can range from destruction of homes or property to outright massacre.\n\nFor some, it was an eerie moment of life imitating art. Audience member Theodore Casser said the incident made the following act all the more poignant for him as a person of Jewish faith.\n\n\u201cIt is a story inherently about Jews being made not to feel welcome, and here is this bozo who decided to express that he felt we should not be welcome here either,\u201d Casser said.\n\nThe Pittsburgh shooting remains fresh on the minds of many. Witnesses there said the gunman shouted \u201cAll Jews must die,\u201d before opening fire.\n\nScherr, 49, said it was hard to focus on the play after the outburst.\n\n\u201cMy heart was just racing,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even really pay attention to the second act.\u201d\n\nShouting that seems to be the equivalent of shouting \u2018fire\u2019 in a theater. \u2014 Howard Libit, executive director of the Baltimore Jewish Council\n\nIn a statement, Hippodrome officials apologized to patrons and said they would not tolerate such behavior. They emphasized that a full team of security is always on-site during live performances to check bags and screen patrons, as well as monitor cameras throughout the venue.\n\n\u201cOur venue has a proud tradition of providing shared experiences to people from all walks of life, right in the heart of this wonderfully diverse city, and we intend to continue that tradition in the spirit of bringing people together, not dividing them,\u201d the Hippodrome\u2019s statement said.\n\nUniformed police will be stationed at the Hippodrome for the remaining \u201cFiddler\u201d shows through Sunday, Jablow said. Their presence was not requested by the theater, he said.\n\nJablow also said police did a background check on the man who shouted the salute, and found that he wasn\u2019t a threat to public safety. Police are not monitoring him further, he said.\n\nHippodrome President Ron Legler declined to comment.\n\nA spokesman for the \u201cFiddler\u201d company said the incident was an \u201can unfortunate and isolated event\u201d in an email Friday.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our company and audience members is always a top priority and every local venue we work with has measures in place to ensure the safety of all theatergoers, staff members and performers,\u201d spokesman Mahaley Jacobs said in the email. \u201cThe performances will go on as scheduled and we look forward to bringing this remarkable production to audiences across the country.\u201d\n\nHoward Libit, executive director of the Baltimore Jewish Council, said the incident was concerning to the Jewish community, and he understood why theatergoers worried the outburst could have signaled the start of a more violent episode.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very sensitive and concerned in the wake of the recent shootings,\u201d Libit said. \u201cShouting that seems to be the equivalent of shouting \u2018fire\u2019 in a theater, or shouting \u2018bomb.\u2019\u201d"

  "text": "Once again, the Trump administration is ready to sacrifice human health at the altar of anti-science extremism.\n\nThe Trump administration is considering cutting $100 million worth of crucial medical research into developing new vaccines and treating diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.\n\n\"It will slow some projects down that are vital for sick Americans,\" Larry Goldstein, the director of UC San Diego\u2019s stem cell program, told Politico, blasting the proposal by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to discontinue National Institutes of Health (NIH) research that uses fetal tissue.\n\nResearch on stem cells derived from fetal tissue is absolutely essential to medical progress. It brought us the vaccines for polio and measles, and it's currently being used to develop potential vaccines for HIV/AIDS and influenza, as well as treatments for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, and more.\n\nThere are strict ethical guidelines on how to obtain the fetal tissue, which comes from miscarriages and legal abortions, and which has unique properties that give researchers insights they often can't find elsewhere.\n\nThis fetal tissue would just get thrown away if it weren't being donated to research \u2014 and that research could save future babies by finding treatments for the Zika virus and other prenatal problems.\n\nBut Trump is willing to throw all of that progress out the window just to pander to the same religious extremists who want to ban birth control and fertility treatments.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson told Politico that the department is \"holding multiple listening sessions with various stakeholders [like] scientists, pro-life groups, ethicists\" on whether to ban this medical research.\n\nAmong those \"pro-life groups\" is the Susan B. Anthony List, an extremist lobbying group that's basically like the NRA of the movement against reproductive health and rights.\n\nBut groups like SBA List do even worse things to science and medicine than the NRA, which has blocked government research on gun violence.\n\nThe anti-choice extremist movement in America operates a lot like the climate change denial movement: Making up garbage lies and peddling garbage \"experts\" in order to confuse people about the validity of well-established science.\n\nThanks to the lobbying of these extremists, doctors are often forced to lie to women about basic health issues or use outdated medical practices. They risk losing their license or even jail time if they can't figure out how to follow badly written laws that make no medical sense. And women are even arrested for miscarriage when prosecutors abuse laws that were intended to protect pregnant women.\n\nSo when the Trump administration says it's consulting scientists, ethicists, and \"pro-life groups\" about medical research, it's a lot like saying NASA is consulting engineers, astrophysicists, and used car salesmen before launching the next space probe.\n\nThe real scientists aren't happy about this at all \u2014 and some worry that they're being \"listened\" to just so that the Trump administration can cover its ass and do what it's been planning to all along.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much time anyone has to give a compelling case,\u201d one anonymous representative of a scientific organization on the listening tour told Politico. \u201cIs this just a fait accompli and window dressing to say that you listened to people?\u201d\n\nTrump, probably taking the advice of the virulently anti-choice Vice President Mike Pence, has already stuffed HHS full of anti-science hacks who push abstinence-only sex \"education\" for teenagers and who want to defund basic family planning and health programs.\n\nWhen Pence was governor of Indiana, he signed a law that would have forced women who had miscarriages to seek funerary services for their fetuses.\n\nAnd of course, the Trump administration and the GOP have tried to ruin health care across the board by systematically sabotaging Obamacare.\n\nOnce again, Trump and his lackeys are working hard to sacrifice human health at the altar of right-wing extremism.\n\nPublished with permission of The American Independent."

  "text": "After a months-long PR campaign, Amazon has officially announced it will split its so-called second headquarters between New York and Arlington, Virginia, outside Washington, D.C., after being offered more than $3 billion in tax breaks and other incentives. The news prompted protests at the site of Amazon\u2019s future office complex in Long Island City, New York, to condemn the city and state governments for showering Amazon with massive tax breaks and other giveaways to entice the company to expand into the city. As part of the deal, New York taxpayers will even build a helipad for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who is the richest man in the world. Many local politicians have openly criticized authorities in New York and Virginia for backing the deals, which will create a total of 50,000 jobs. DN! speaks with New York Assemblymember Ron Kim, who is introducing legislation to block the deal and redirect taxpayer money away from Amazon subsidies and toward student debt relief.

Nearly 6,000 active-duty troops are currently stationed in Texas, California and Arizona, following Trump\u2019s escalating attacks against the Central American caravan heading toward the border. Trump has warned that that number could swell to 15,000\u2014more than the U.S. forces in Afghanistan and almost triple the number of troops in Iraq. According to some reports, the border deployments could cost $220 million, despite the fact the Pentagon does not see the caravan as a risk.

  "title": "The NRA doesn't care about black heroes: Jemel Roberson was \"the good guy with a gun\"",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "On Sunday night, around 4 a.m., a Chicagoland police officer shot and killed Jemel Roberson, a black man, after reports of a shooting came from a bar in a Cook County suburb. Roberson, 26, was not the assailant \u2014 he was the armed security guard who had secured the alleged shooter and saved lives. He was shot for saving a person's life while being black. I wonder why President Trump and the NRA have been silent on this one?\n\nThat night, Roberson, who was employed by Manny\u2019s Blue Room, had escorted a group of drunk men out of the bar. According to WGN9 Chicago, witnesses say one came back with a gun\u00ad\u00ad and opened fire. Roberson apprehended a person involved in the shooting in an effort to protect the other patrons as they exited the club. Midlothian police officers arrived on the scene with little to no details, and it appears that they saw a black man with a gun, ignored his uniform and hat labeled SECURITY, and shot him. He died in the hospital.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAdam Harris, who was at the lounge that night, gave this account: \"[Roberson] had somebody on the ground with his knee in back, with his gun in his back like, 'Don\u2019t move,\u2019\u201d Harris said. \"Everybody was screaming out, 'Security!' He was a security guard!\"\n\n\u201cAnd they still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office stated that Jemel Robinson had a valid gun license (a FOID card) but not a concealed carry license. As if the cops ever take the time to ask, \u201cHey! Do you have a valid concealed carry permit?\u201d before they open fire?\n\nHis mother Beatrice Roberson has filed a federal lawsuit against the officer, whose identity has not been released, as well as the village of Midlothian, alleging the shooting was unprovoked, unjustified, excessive and unreasonable, according to the New York Times.\n\nRoberson's son is nine months old. And now with the holidays approaching, racism, flawed gun culture, and poor policy is prohibiting yet another innocent black man's family from celebrating with him.\n\n\"This was going to be my baby's first Christmas with his dad and now he's going to miss out on everything,\" Avontea Boose, the child's mother, told The Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nRobinson wasn\u2019t a thug. He didn\u2019t have a troubled past. He was a man of God who played drums at several churches in Chicago and surrounding counties. And according to reports, he even wanted to become a police officer.\n\n\"Every artist he\u2019s ever played for, every musician he\u2019s ever sat besides, we\u2019re all just broken because we have no answers,\" the Rev. Patricia Hill of Purposed Church said. \"He was getting ready to train and do all that stuff, so the very people he wanted to be family with, took his life.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m waiting for the National Rifle Association to honor Roberson as a hero on their website's front page. Isn\u2019t he the perfect example of why they advocate for more armed citizens and guns in public places? A guy opens fire at a bar, putting many in danger, and another armed man swoops in and saves the day?\n\nShouldn\u2019t their new president, disgraced Lt. Colonel Oliver North, champion this cause as a way for the NRA to look less racist?Well, they don't want to look less racist, so they won\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nLike Philando Castile before him, a licensed gun owner who was killed by a racist cop in Minnesota, Roberson was black. And to the NRA, it's clear that black gun owners don\u2019t matter. These horrible situations expose the stupidity of the idea that more guns in schools, or more guns in general, make us safer. Especially if you're a person of color, it leads to more tragedies.\n\nLast month after a gunman murdered 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, President Trump irresponsibly said, \"If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him.\u201d What the president doesn\u2019t understand is that even trained shooters miss their targets, especially when their target is firing back, even more people can get hurt. And if that armed guy in the synagogue just happened to be black like Roberson, cops could have arrived and shot him too. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if he had saved 1,000 Jewish lives first, because in the eyes of law enforcement, black skin equals guilty.\n\nRoberson \u2014 a father, a church musician, and a uniformed working and licensed gun carrier \u2014 did nothing wrong. He was the hero in the room that night, leaving the cops who shot him, along the the department they represent, with nothing to say but the usual empty promise, \"We are conducting a investigation.\" Meanwhile, as expected, President Trump and the NRA remain silent."

The difference in votes between Ron DeSantis and Andrew Gillum for Governor and between Rick Scott and Bill Nelson for Senator, are so close that they triggered automatic recounts. But because the initial vote counts were in favor of the Republican candidates, President Donald Trump is rattled over the possibility of Democrats winning the seats via the recount.\n\n\n\nTrump and his Republican colleagues have been tweeting and giving interviews claiming without evidence that Democrats are trying to \"steal the election,\" even though it is their efforts that amount to potential election theft. Trump supporters have been protesting in front of the Broward County election supervisor Brenda Snipes' office chanting \"Lock Her Up.\"\n\n\n\nGovernor Rick Scott, who has a serious conflict of interest in counting votes for his Senate race, has launched 5 lawsuits against County election officials. Voting rights groups are now suing him. And the state Democratic Party has called on his recusal.

  "text": "On Thursday, a federal judge in Montana temporarily halted the construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada\u2019s tar sands region in Alberta to refineries as far away as the Gulf of Mexico. The court\u2019s decision will require the Trump administration to review more thoroughly the potential negative impacts of the pipeline on the surrounding environment and climate change. President Obama halted the construction of the pipeline, which is being built by TransCanada, in 2015 following mass public protests, but Trump reversed the order shortly after he came into office. Environmental and indigenous groups hailed the decision Thursday. Sierra Club attorney Doug Hayes said in a statement, \u201cThe Trump administration tried to force this dirty pipeline project on the American people, but they can\u2019t ignore the threats it would pose to our clean water, our climate, and our communities.\u201d DN! speaks with May Boeve, executive director of 350 Action, the political arm of the climate organization 350.org."

According to WGN, the State Police Public Integrity Task Force is running an investigation of the officer\u2019s decision to open fire on Roberson.\n\nPastor Patricia Hill of Chicago\u2019s Purposed Church tells WGN TV that she\u2019s horrified to see another young black man fatally shot by police despite the fact that he had risked his own life to prevent a potential mass shooting.\n\n\u201cOnce again it\u2019s the continued narrative that we see of shoot first, ask questions later,\u201d she said.\n\nWatch WGN TV\u2019s report on the shooting below.\n\n\n\n"

Brian Kemp earned a clear victory on Tuesday night and holds a sizable lead as remaining provisional and military ballots are counted.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Kemp holds a 62,709-vote lead, with 100 percent of precincts reporting. But the race has not yet been called by AP or major news outlets.\n\nAbrams has not conceded, insisting her campaign will not end until all the votes are counted.\n\nAbrams's team argues that there are enough uncounted ballots to shrink Kemp's total to below 50 percent, which would trigger a Dec. 4 runoff election.\n\nAbrams responded to Kemp's statement on Instagram Saturday, saying that counting ballots is democratic.\n\n\"I am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it,\" she said. \"I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake: Our democracy should work for all of us, regardless of political leanings, race, income, or region.

  "text": "\n\nPresident Trump points at American Urban Radio Networks White House correspondent April Ryan during a news conference following Tuesday's midterm elections. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nApril Ryan is White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks. She is the author, most recently, of \" Under Fire: Reporting from the Front Lines of the Trump White House .\"\n\nWednesday, when PBS\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor asked President Trump if his campaign rhetoric was \u201cemboldening white nationalists,\u201d the president (who has, in recent weeks, railed against \u201cpower-hungry globalists,\u201d a distant immigrant \u201ccaravan,\u201d and called African American Tallahassee mayor and Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum a \u201cstone-cold thief\u201d) tried to turn the tables by saying: \u201cThat\u2019s such a racist question.\u201d\n\nFriday, when CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip asked Trump if he wanted newly designated acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker to \u201crein in\u201d special counsel Robert Mueller, Trump tried to dismiss her by saying: \u201cWhat a stupid question that is. What a stupid question. But I watch you a lot, you ask a lot of stupid questions.\u201d Wednesday at the White House, he told me to \u201csit down.\u201d In Friday\u2019s press gaggle, he called me \u201cnasty\u201d and a \u201closer,\u201d never mind my 21 years spent covering four presidents as a reporter for American Urban Radio Networks.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to find the common denominator: Though there\u2019s hardly anyone \u2014 from his predecessors to senators in his own party \u2014 he won\u2019t try to shout down with ad hominem insults, Trump relishes, and injects venom into, verbal attacks against women of color.\n\nHe leaves little doubt about what he really thinks of us.\n\nIn rally after rally, when Trump says Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has a \u201clow I.Q.\u201d he\u2019s showing contempt for the idea that a black woman, who has sworn an oath to uphold the same Constitution as he has, should be able to speak her mind if she in any way challenges his authority. When he feuded with Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) over his response to the death of her constituent, La David Johnson, an African American Army sergeant killed in action, he failed to live up to his role as commander in chief. When he says Stacey Abrams, a Yale Law School graduate and former Democratic leader of the Georgia House of Representatives, is \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be her state\u2019s governor, he\u2019s applying a double standard. When he feuded, via Twitter, with Jemele Hill, the National Association of Black Journalists\u2019 2018 journalist of the year (an award I was honored with in 2017) Trump telegraphed that there\u2019s something about being questioned by a black woman that he can\u2019t abide. One or two of these instances might only leave you scratching your head. But we\u2019ve reached the point where it\u2019s an unmistakable pattern.\n\n[I represented La David Johnson. Here's what I still want to know about his death.]\n\nThe journalists covering Trump\u2019s presidency are professionals, and I\u2019m confident that all of us, including the African American women covering this White House, will continue to do our jobs no matter how we\u2019re treated by President Trump. But we shouldn\u2019t have to put up with the kind of treatment we received this week: Not only has the president given cover to people who want to harass us, but he\u2019s left the American people with a twisted understanding of how press freedoms work. He seems not to appreciate that journalists\u2019 roles are to hold power to account, and, at times, seems unwilling to face tough questions. At the end of my exchange with him at the most recent White House news conference \u2014 the type of exchange that I\u2019ve had, completely respectfully, with other presidents \u2014 he implied that my White House hard pass, the credential that allows me White House access daily, might be pulled. That\u2019s not how things are supposed to work in a democracy.\n\nAnd the taunting, schoolyard-bully atmosphere winds up putting a stain on the highest office in the land. The White House is where decisions about war and peace, taxes and spending, and fundamental human rights are made \u2014 a place where life or death can be determined by the stroke of a pen. The presidency is the one office that\u2019s supposed to represent everyone, no matter their faith, race, gender or orientation.\n\nCorrespondents don\u2019t go to the White House every day to make friends. We do our jobs courteously, but also thoroughly and assertively, to get answers for our viewers, listeners and readers about the statements and actions that affect all Americans\u2019 lives. Sometimes that means having a quiet sidebar with a member of the White House communications staff. Sometimes that means meeting with first son-in-law and presidential adviser Jared Kushner to discuss the administration\u2019s approach to criminal justice reform. Sometimes that means shouting a question at the president as he crosses the White House lawn on the way to boarding Marine One. You can tell, though, by the way Trump has responded in recent days to more than one black female journalist that he sees our presence there as illegitimate. If he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d either answer our questions or simply ignore them, not berate us.\n\nBut when Trump denigrates black women, he\u2019s sending the message that he doesn\u2019t see us equally.\n\nEvery morning that I walk through the White House gates, I thank God for the privilege of doing the job that I do, and for the trust and faith that my listeners put in me to ask for, and bring home, the truth. Every day, I try to remember that, to the best of my knowledge of my family\u2019s history, I am only five generations removed from the last known member of my family to be enslaved, Joseph Dollar Brown, who was sold on the auction block in North Carolina. And I carry that knowledge with me, because I owe it to him to cover the presidency the best way I know how, no matter how much pushback I get.\n\nThe White House has had issues with me ever since January, when I asked, \u201cMr. President, are you a racist?\u201d After his response to Charlottesville, after \u201cs---hole countries,\u201d after \u201cget that son of a b---- off the field\u201d and \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d it\u2019s more than a fair question, it\u2019s necessary. As a black female journalist, I\u2019m going to keep asking it and continue seeking answers. That\u2019s my job, and I am up for it."

  "title": "This NFL player has become the league\u2019s worst nightmare",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "Last Sunday, Carolina Panthers\u2019 safety Eric Reid intercepted a pass from Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick early in the game between divisional rivals. He tacked on a 39-yard return into the red zone, which set the tone for what would turn out to be a Panthers offensive explosion.\n\nIn the locker room after the dominating victory, head coach Ron Rivera presented Reid with the game ball, and his teammates erupted in cheers. It was, undoubtedly, a big moment for Reid. He spent the first four weeks of the NFL season unemployed, as teams were seemingly hesitant to sign him because of his ongoing protest of police brutality and racial injustice during the national anthem.\n\nBut it was also a bittersweet moment for the 26-year-old. Because while he has found a new home with the Panthers, his good friend Colin Kaepernick is still being blackballed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be able to help the Panthers win, but until (Kaepernick) gets back in the league, I can\u2019t be wholly happy,\u201d Reid told ESPN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Reid used what was a big moment for him personally to make sure the spotlight found Kaepernick and the movement he ignited, as well. He has done that every step of the way since arriving in Charlotte.\n\nIn his first press conference with the Panthers, Reid wore a t-shirt emblazoned with a big \u201c#IMWITHKAP\u201d on the front, signaling his continued solidarity with Kaepernick, and promised that his collusion lawsuit against the NFL would continue. (He and Kaepernick are both suing team owners for colluding to keep them out of the league due to their protest.)\n\nThen, when asked about the meaning behind his protest, Reid gave reporters \u2014 in the south, mind you \u2014 an education on historical systemic oppression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNext year will be 2019. It will mark 400 years since the first slaves touched the soil of this country. That\u2019s 400 years of systemic oppression,\u201d Reid said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s slavery, Jim Crow, new Jim Crow, mass incarceration, you name it. The Great Depression \u2014 they come out with the New Deal, and black people didn\u2019t have access to those government stimulus packages. The New Deal set up what is known as the modern-day middle class. We didn\u2019t have access to those programs, the GI Bill, social security, home loans, none of that. So this has been happening since my people have gotten here. And so, I just felt the need to say something about it.\u201d\n\nReid has also been a vocal opponent of the Players\u2019 Coalition, a group run by Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins. The Players Coalition accepted $90 million from the NFL last year while the NFL attempted to get players to stop protesting racism during the national anthem. In exchange for this money, most players \u2014 including Jenkins \u2014 stopped protesting.\n\nAfter an altercation with Jenkins during a Panthers vs. Eagles game last month, Reid told reporters that he felt that the Coalition betrayed Kaepernick, who started this movement by taking a knee back in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe believe a lot of players should have stepped up for Colin,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI believe Malcolm capitalized on the situation, he co-opted the movement that was started by Colin [Kaepernick] to get his organization funded. It\u2019s cowardly. He sold us out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater that same week, Reid actually expanded on this to reporters in the Panthers locker room. Among other things, he said NFL owners were using Jenkins as a \u201cblack figurehead.\u201d It\u2019s an extremely uncomfortable statement to make about a player that so many inside and outside the league respect, and who does great work addressing systemic racial oppression, particularly in the criminal justice system. But that\u2019s the point. Reid isn\u2019t here to make anyone comfortable; he\u2019s here to tell his truth.\n\n\u201cMalcolm called and asked me if I would stop protesting \u2014 \u2018be comfortable ending my demonstrations\u2019 were his words \u2014 if the NFL made a donation to the Players Coalition,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI tried not to blow a gasket and tell him no. Then he asked me, \u2018Well how much? How much will it take for you to stop?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I ended that conversation with him. I told the other players who were involved with the coalition the content of our conversation. We then removed \u2014 a couple players, myself and I think three or four others removed ourselves from the Players Coalition via tweet.\u201d\n\nThe NFL paid the Players Coalition all of that money in the hopes that these protests \u2014 and the issues being protested \u2014 would just fade into the background, and that they could just point to the donations and praise the players\u2019 \u201cwork in the community\u201d whenever they were criticized.\n\nBut now Reid is back in the NFL. He\u2019s starting for the Panthers, a 6-3 team that has a good shot to make it to the playoffs. He has the full support of his team, which is using its own website to publish articles on why his military family supports his protests.\n\nHe\u2019s still taking a knee during the national anthem every game, and pretty much every time there\u2019s a microphone in his face, he\u2019s using his platform to draw attention to police brutality, racism, and those who have tried to silence him. He\u2019s unapologetic about his commitment to the cause.\n\nThis is the NFL\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\nAfter the Panthers suffered a humiliating loss on Thursday Night Football, Reid \u2014 who was ejected during the game for a hit on Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger \u2014 was subjected to a drug test.\n\nWith reporters surrounding him, Reid said that it was his fifth drug test in six weeks back in the league. The Big League did the math, and found there\u2019s about a 0.5 percent chance any player would be randomly tested that much.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to catch me on anything,\u201d Reid said. As much as the league may want to."

  "text": "A polling place in downtown Atlanta started the day with just three machines, despite a registered voter roll of over 3,000. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp\u2019s campaign declared victory in the race for Georgia governor on Wednesday, even as election officials continued counting thousands of absentee and provisional ballots, narrowing his lead and prompting Democrat Stacey Abrams to insist she could have the votes to force a runoff election.\n\nAs the vote-counting continued, voting rights advocates accused Kemp \u2014 who as secretary of state is Georgia\u2019s top election officer \u2014 and local officials of disenfranchising thousands of voters on Election Day. Hundreds of complaints flooded in about hours-long lines brought on by broken equipment, a shortage of voting machines and insufficient quantities of printed provisional ballots.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Kemp was ahead with 50.3 percent of the vote to Abrams\u2019s 48.7 percent. Abrams and the Libertarian candidate would need to gain at least 25,000 votes more than Kemp to bring his share of the vote below 50 percent and trigger a runoff.\n\n\u201cWe believe our chance for a stronger Georgia is just within reach,\u201d Abrams, who if elected would be the nation\u2019s first black female governor, told supporters early Wednesday. \u201cWe cannot seize it, however, until all voices are heard. And we are going to make sure that every vote is counted \u2014 because in a civilized nation, the machinery of democracy should work everywhere for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office reported late Wednesday that fewer than 3,000 regular ballots remained to be counted statewide, and that a total of 22,000 provisional ballots had been cast \u2014 numbers that would likely close off any path to victory for Abrams. The office did not certify a winner and said votes could be counted into next week.\n\nYet Cody Hall, a spokesman for Kemp\u2019s campaign, said: \u201cAbrams does not have a mathematical formula to victory, based on our calculations. We have a clear path to victory. We\u2019re declaring victory and we are moving forward with the transition process starting tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, the Abrams campaign claimed that nearly 100,000 ballots, and possibly more, remained uncounted.\n\nAmong the calls logged at a voter hotline run by a consortium of voting rights groups including the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union and Common Cause were complaints from hundreds of voters who said their requests for absentee ballots went unanswered. Voters \u2014 and advocates \u2014 said they were chagrined at how many of those reports came from communities with large minority populations.\n\n\u201cFrom our vantage point, this was an intentional system failure in targeting communities where African Americans made up a high percentage of active voters,\u201d said NAACP President Derrick Johnson.\n\nPeggy Xu, 23, was one of those voters. Xu provided emails to The Washington Post showing that she requested an absentee ballot from Fulton County on Oct. 6 and said she later saw on the secretary of state\u2019s website that one had been sent to her. But she never received it, she said. She tried again, didn\u2019t receive the second ballot either and was not able to vote, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m furious,\u201d she said. \u201cI was genuinely excited to vote for her. But now, seeing this razor-thin margin, and seeing how many voter suppression issues are going on, it\u2019s driving me a little crazy, especially knowing that this has affected so many voters.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoting machines sit unused in Georgia thanks to a lawsuit. On Election Day, a lack of voting machines led to long lines and complaints. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nAsked about the range of voter concerns, Candice Broce, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state\u2019s office, noted that the turnout shattered midterm records.\n\n\u201cI stand confident that we had a successful Election Day,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition, election monitors from civil rights groups said hundreds of voters whose registrations had been suspended under a strict new law, one championed by Kemp, were improperly turned away. The law requires that personal information on registration applications, even down to the hyphen, exactly match other government records. In late October, a federal judge ordered the state to alert such voters before removing them from the rolls and to allow them to vote with proper identification.\n\nAnother problem was the limited number of voting machines in some locations. More than 1,800 machines sat idle in storage in three of the state\u2019s largest and most heavily Democratic counties. In Fulton County, according to figures provided by elections director Rick Barron, the ratio of machines to registered voters was lower than it had been in 2014, despite predictions that turnout was likely to break records for a midterm election.\n\nWhile some voters waited in hours-long lines in Fulton County, 700 of those machines sat in stacks in a warehouse in downtown Atlanta, Barron said. The machines were sidelined because they are evidence in a lawsuit alleging the equipment had been exposed to the threat of hacking in 2016.\n\nThe federal judge in the case had ordered state and local election officials \u2014 including Kemp \u2014 and the plaintiffs to weigh the demands of upcoming elections in deciding how many machines to set aside.\n\nIn an interview, Barron said more machines \u201cwould have made a huge impact on operations yesterday\u201d and acknowledged that \u201cit would have been a good idea\u201d to push for the use of more machines before Election Day.\n\n\u201cThe lines were long in the morning and we just didn\u2019t have any machines to throw out there,\u201d he said.\n\nBroce, too, said additional machines \u201cwould have really helped with the long lines.\u201d\n\nShe blamed the litigation for tying up those machines. One attorney for the plaintiffs, Bruce Brown, called that \u201crubbish\u201d and said officials could have sequestered fewer machines, or later decided to put some back into service.\n\nDaniel White, an attorney representing Cobb and DeKalb counties, said both counties kept more machines out of circulation Tuesday than required by the judge \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d that they were complying with the spirit of the court agreement.\n\nWhite said he suspected the sequestered machines contributed to long lines at his polling place Tuesday. At a school in Marietta, where White said he usually sees eight to 12 machines, he saw just five or six.\n\nTuesday\u2019s ballot was long, with five constitutional amendments across the state and additional measures in select locations.\n\nOne precinct near Pittman Park in downtown Atlanta started the day with just three machines, despite a registered voter roll of more than 3,000. Similar equipment problems were reported elsewhere in Fulton County and in three other large counties of the Atlanta metro area \u2014 Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett.\n\nAbrams\u2019s campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said the problems were Kemp\u2019s responsibility. \u201cMachines were breaking down and counties did not get guidance from the secretary of state and didn\u2019t have adequate paper ballots \u2014 let\u2019s be clear about where the blame lies,\u201d she said.\n\nBroce said local officials make those decisions, not the secretary of state.\n\n\u201cCounties are the custodians of the equipment and are responsible for deploying it,\u201d she said.\n\nVanessa Williams in Atlanta and Sonam Vashi in Athens, Ga., contributed to this report. Gardner, Reinhard and Davis reported from Washington."

  "text": "A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the memo.\n\nA consent decree is a type of injunction that allows federal courts to enforce an agreement negotiated between two parties \u2014 say, the Justice Department and a local police department \u2014 to address a violation of the law. The department started enforcing them during the Clinton administration, after a statute was enacted in 1994 allowing the attorney general to use court agreements to remedy systemic, unconstitutional behavior.\n\nThe agreements gained a higher profile as the Obama administration entered into 14 of them as part of its efforts to improve relationships between the police and their communities. They became even more prominent after the killings of black men at the hands of the police captured headlines and set off the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nIn March 2017, a month after he took office, Mr. Sessions ordered a review of the use of consent decrees to ensure that they \u201cadvance the safety and protection of the public.\u201d He said that the pacts should also ensure that the police are safe and respected and that they should not interfere with recruiting efforts by the local police.\n\nMr. Sessions, who has long championed local sheriffs and police officers, maintained that the agreements \u201creduce morale\u201d among police officers and lead to more violent crime. Academics and researchers have contested his assertions about the links between consent decrees and crime rates.\n\nUnder Mr. Sessions, the department also dropped Obama-era investigations into the police in Chicago and Louisiana.\n\nLast month, Mr. Sessions opposed a consent decree between the Chicago Police Department and the Illinois attorney general enacted after a Justice Department report unveiled in the final days of the Obama administration found rampant use of excessive force aimed at black and Latino people. Under Mr. Sessions, the Justice Department said the deal placed too many restrictions on Chicago\u2019s police superintendent.\n\n\u201cWhen Jeff Sessions intervened in the locally negotiated consent decree in Chicago, it belied the love of federalism that he professes and uses to justify this effort to effectively end the use of consent decrees,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the former head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division."

  "text": "Left: Kris Kobach by Mark Reinstein/Corbis Via Getty Right: Scott Walker by Andy Manis/Getty\n\nThe results of Tuesday's midterm election suggested no clear narratives about blue waves or red tides\u2014Democrats took the House, while Republicans bolstered their Senate majority. America's most repulsive senator, Ted Cruz, held onto his seat in deep-red Texas by the skin of his teeth, edging out the charming Democratic up-and-comer Beto O'Rourke. (\"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you,\" fellow Republican Lindsey Graham once joked of his colleague's popularity.)\n\nNevertheless, plenty of other assholes lost last night, proving that there is justice in the world, inconsistent though it may be. Let's take a look at all the people who deserved to lose, and actually did:\n\nKris Kobach\n\nKris Kobach via Wikimedia Commons\n\nRepublican Kris Kobach lost the race for Kansas governor to Democrat Laura Kelly, thank the fucking lord. Kobach made a name for himself as the head of Trump's very crooked and now-defunct \u201cVoter Fraud Commission,\u201d created to affirm the president's bogus claims that millions of undocumented immigrants voted in the 2016 election.\n\nAs VICE News noted, \"Kobach, who is affiliated with the legal arm of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a hard-line anti-immigrant group, has been the architect of some of the most anti-immigrant laws in the county.\"\n\nKelly won 48.7 percent of the vote, while Kobach got 43 percent, meaning it wasn't even close\u2014Kansas voters rejected this fucker with their entire hearts. Good for them!\n\nScott Walker\n\nScott Walker via Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia Commons\n\nAlthough he hasn't conceded yet, Scott Walker, the two-term Republican governor of Wisconsin and former presidential hopeful, lost to Democrat Tony Evers by a slim 1-point margin. Walker is a notoriously anti-union conservative, who signed a bill that ended public workers' collective bargaining rights, and later gave a $4.1 billion subsidy to the company Foxconn to entice it to open a factory in his state\u2014based on the number of jobs created by the factory, this works out to about $230,000 in subsidies per job. In response to his loss, Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, released a terse statement: \u201cScott Walker was a national disgrace.\" Note the past tense.\n\nKim Davis\n\nKim Davis at a 2015 rally. Photo by Ty Wright/Getty\n\nThe Kentucky county clerk who became famous for hating the idea of gay people getting married so much she went to jail rather than issue a marriage license to two men won't get the chance to deny anyone anything again after losing to Democrat Elwood Caudill Jr.\n\nJason Lewis\n\nJason Lewis via Wikimedia Commons\n\nLewis, the Republican representative for Minnesota's second district, once complained that he can't call women \"sluts\" anymore. \"It used to be that women were held to a little bit of a higher standard. We required modesty from women. Now, are we beyond those days where a woman can behave as a slut, but you can't call her a slut?\" he said on his radio show in 2012.\n\nPer CNN's KFILE, that is one of many disgustingly sexist things Lewis said on his radio show:\n\nIn another instance, while arguing that \"young single women\" vote based on coverage of birth control pills, Lewis said those women were not human beings and were without brains.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrat Angie Craig, who will be the first openly gay mother in Congress, beat Lewis by over 5 points.\n\n\n\nDana Rohrabacher\n\nDana Rohrabacher via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe former Reagan speechwriter, best known as \"Putin\u2019s favorite congressman\" thanks to his baffling fondness for Russia, has represented California's Orange County in Congress since 1989, but on Tuesday, he lost his seat to Democrat Harley Rouda. Rohrabacher, a staunch Trump supporter, has made news for his bombastic personality\u2014in 2013, he left a condo he rented \"a shockingly horrific pigsty, a dump worse than a college fraternity house of unhygienic slobs unfamiliar with the most basic tools of cleaning,\" according to the OC Weekly, and in the 1990s, \"he famously arm-wrestled [Vladimir] Putin, then a lowly deputy mayor, in a Washington dive bar,\" as Politico recounted.\n\nAside from his weird Russia stuff, Rohrabacher has a slew of abhorrent ideas. Earlier this year, he said he thought homeowners should be allowed to refuse to sell their houses to gay and lesbian buyers. He also apparently told an undocumented activist, \"I hate illegals!\" and suggested he could have her deported. (His press secretary disputed that).\n\nIn any case, he is an asshole and he lost.\n\nDave Brat\n\nDave Brat via Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia Commons\n\nFar-right congressman Dave Brat lost his Virginia House seat to Democrat Abigail Spanberger in a close race. Brat has been called as \"the poster child for the Tea Party,\" and came to political prominence when he won the Republican primary against House Majority leader Eric Cantor in 2014, one of the signs back then the GOP was turning hard to the right.\n\nIn 2017, Brat complained, \u201cSince Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go. They come up\u2014\u2018When is your next town hall?\u2019 And believe me, it\u2019s not to give positive input.\u201d\n\nIn Spanberger's victory speech, she said, \u201cWe won an unwinnable district by doing exactly what every campaign should do. We focused on the needs of the people, the voters.\"\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Eve Peyser on Twitter and Instagram."

  "text": "While a record number of women are projected to win House seats in Tuesday's midterm elections, a local judicial race in Houston, Texas brings even more great news: All 19 black women who ran for various judicial seats in Harris County won their races last night, marking the single biggest victory for black women in the county's history.\n\nAll 19 of the #Houston African American Female Judges up for election WON tonight!\n\n\n\nCongratulations #Houston19 \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83c\udf7e pic.twitter.com/JJMcEI76JF \u2014 Isaac Hayes III (@IsaacHayes3) November 7, 2018\n\nMany are highlighting this win as a bright spot amid Democrat Beto O'Rourke's loss to Republican incumbent Ted Cruz in the Texas Senate race. The victory of the #Houston19, as the group of women are called, has obvious local impact: Harris County, which encompasses most of Houston, is the third-largest county in the country, and one of the most diverse. Adding 19 women of color to judicial seats builds a bench that's more reflective of the population it serves, which, as with all elected offices, is a good thing.\n\nBeyond Houston, the election is reflective of an overall increase in women of color who are not just running, but winning local, state, and national races during the Trump administration. A similar thing happened during the 2016 election in Alabama\u2014like Texas, a historically red state\u2014when nine black women were elected as judges in Jefferson County.\n\nWins like these are an important step in adding much-needed diversity to judicial seats across the country. According to data collected by the American Constitution Society, a national progressive organization focused on the legal system, women of color make up less than 20 percent of state judges. While county judges don't have quite as much jurisdiction, in most states (including Texas), they have important local responsibilities, including a slew of election procedures, signing off on bail amounts, and jury selection.\n\nAs so many have said, your life is more likely to be impacted by your local officials than any of the people holding office in Washington D.C. But more importantly, seeing more women of color deservedly step into elected seats sends a clear message that you don't have to be a white man to hold office in this country.\n\nFollow Hannah on Twitter."

  "authors": [
    "Joshua A. Geltzer"
  ],
  "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a reception in Moscow on Sunday as a part of celebrations marking Russian National Unity Day. Alexander Nemenov/Getty Images\n\nThis piece was originally published on Just Security, an online forum for analysis of U.S. national security law and policy.\n\nWith Election Day 2018 behind us, many are breathing a sigh of relief. Those following closely the prospect of widespread election interference are indicating that, despite fears of everything from the changing of votes to the spread of disinformation, the 2018 midterms saw relatively little by way of such interference, or at least less than occurred in 2016. It\u2019s true that there have been no credible reports of actual vote-changing of the type that could call into question the Election Day results, and that\u2019s reassuring. But, all told, it\u2019s unfortunately misguided to suggest that this campaign season and ultimately this election were free from election interference. That\u2019s for at least three reasons.\n\nFirst, consider the changes in Russian tactics for reaching American audiences. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have stepped up their efforts to address election interference and in so doing disrupted, at least to some extent, Moscow\u2019s attempts to repeat its 2016 tactics like the building of false personas with large followings. But make no mistake: The Kremlin has adapted. With a broader array of sources for disinformation\u2014from newly created websites to greater numbers of social media accounts, each with smaller followings\u2014overall Russia appears to have engaged in more disruptions to democratic dialogue in 2018 than in 2016, not fewer. This is an unfortunate and troubling state of affairs that leading experts Jonathon Morgan and Ryan Fox have documented through extensive research and analysis.\n\nSecond, consider the maturation in Russia\u2019s approach compared to what it did in 2016. Coverage of 2018 election interference has tended to focus on whether particular candidates were favored by online influence operations, whether particular votes were changed, or whether disinformation about whether, when, and how to vote on Election Day was circulating. But, even if there was less of that than some expected, the democratic dialogue leading up to Election Day 2018 was still unquestionably infected by Russian influence. Think of the major themes that dominated political discourse during this period, including #ReleaseTheMemo, the Kavanaugh hearings, and immigration. Those topics generated significant political fights in the long build-up to the election. As has been well-documented for each of these topics, the online discussions about all of them have been polarized, aggravated, and in some instances even driven by Kremlin-backed online influence campaigns. In other words, just zoom out, and the 2018 election interference comes into clearer focus. And there\u2019s also the potential interference we seem narrowly to have avoided this election cycle, as evidenced by Russia\u2019s reported laying of the groundwork for spreading disinformation about widespread voter fraud in battleground states where Democrats had the possibility of achieving greater gains than ultimately materialized.\n\nThird, consider Russia\u2019s domestic counterparts in the dark arts of disinformation. America\u2019s experience in 2016 trained us to focus on foreign election interference, in particular. But it\u2019s not only foreigners who can spread disinformation online in a deliberate effort to distort our democracy. Americans, too, can mislead and distort their fellow citizens\u2014and they are increasingly doing so, taking a page from hostile foreign actors. In so doing, they\u2019re pitting Americans against each other on cooked-up issues like the so-called migrant caravan and the purported influence of billionaire George Soros, as powerfully documented this week in the Washington Post. What\u2019s more, online there\u2019s no clear separation between foreign and domestic influence campaigns; instead, in our digital age these voices cross national boundaries and echo, amplify, and feed off each other.\n\nSo, breathe a brief sigh of relief that Tuesday\u2019s election results appear, in a direct sense, ones we can and should honor. As I\u2019ve emphasized elsewhere, be sure to maintain a healthy skepticism of any claims to the contrary unless grounded in clear and concrete evidence, especially if such claims appear politically driven. But don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve cleansed our political system and discourse of the taint of election interference. It\u2019s still happening, and it may well be escalating. If anything, we\u2019re missing it because it\u2019s become insidiously ingrained in our national debates on an ongoing basis, rather than just materializing to favor particular candidates in the immediate prelude to Election Day. And that status quo, in which we as Americans don\u2019t even notice that our biggest political arguments are being fueled by disinformation peddled at home and abroad, should be decidedly disconcerting and should in turn demand an improved response from the government, the tech sector, and civil society in the months to come\u2014especially with Election Day 2020 suddenly looming large.\n\nMore From Just Security:\n\nUpdate: The Military, the Mexican Border and Posse Comitatus\n\n\u201cProtecting Children\u201d: A Welcome Addition to Efforts to Redress Wartime Harms"

  "text": "Story highlights Matthew Whitaker: The finances of Trump or his family are beyond Mueller's purview\n\nIf Rod Rosenstein doesn't rein in probe it will look like a political fishing expedition\n\nMatthew Whitaker is a CNN legal commentator and former US attorney who directs the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), a conservative ethics watchdog group. He ran in the Republican primary for Iowa Senate in 2014. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) (This article was originally published on August 6, 2017. On November 7, 2018, President Donald Trump announced that he was naming Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general.)\n\nLast month, when President Donald Trump was asked by The New York Times if special counsel Robert Mueller would be crossing a line if he started investigating the finances of Trump and his family, the President said, \"I think that's a violation. Look, this is about Russia.\"\n\nThe President is absolutely correct. Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\n\nAccording to a CNN article, Mueller's investigators could be looking into financial records relating to the Trump Organization that are unrelated to the 2016 election. According to these reports, \"sources described an investigation that has widened to focus on possible financial crimes, some unconnected to the 2016 election.\" The piece goes on to cite law enforcement sources who say non-Russia-related leads that \"involve Trump associates\" are being referred to the special counsel \"to encourage subjects of the investigation to cooperate.\"\n\nThis information is deeply concerning to me. It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.\n\nRead More"

Sessions, who was the first GOP senator to endorse Trump in his 2016 campaign, faced repeated and public attacks from the president during his tenure, including having Trump questioning whether he had an attorney general.\n\nWhitaker has already come under scrutiny by top Democrats, who warn that his previous remarks about Mueller's probe suggest he is unfit to oversee the investigation.\n\n\"Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis Schumer'Dog-with-a-bone' mentality won't help Democrats in 2020 Senate Dems press White House for update on Puerto Rico recovery response 4 in 5 Americans say they support net neutrality: poll MORE (D-N.Y.) said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro PelosiDems worry Mueller findings could expand executive power The Memo: GOP frets as Trump squanders advantages Trump campaign starts selling 'Pencil-neck Adam Schiff' t-shirts MORE (D-Calif.) echoed this call.\n\nWhitaker previously authored an op-ed for CNN that accused Mueller of going \"too far.\"\n\n\"The President is absolutely correct. Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\" Whitaker wrote, calling for Rosenstein to \"limit the scope\" of Mueller's investigation.\n\nTrump's move to oust Sessions comes one day after the midterm elections, with Democrats regaining a majority in the House.\n\nDemocrats have already indicated that they plan to conduct oversight on a series of matters relating to the Trump administration \u2014 including his move to oust Sessions on Wednesday.\n\n\"Americans must have answers immediately as to the reasoning behind @realDonaldTrump removing Jeff Sessions from @TheJusticeDept. Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation? We will be holding people accountable,\" tweeted Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is the Democrat presumed to become chair of the House Judiciary Committee in the next Congress."
